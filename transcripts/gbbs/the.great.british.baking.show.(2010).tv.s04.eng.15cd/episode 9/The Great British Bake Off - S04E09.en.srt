00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Welcome back to Somerset, the tension is mounting in the tent 

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,680
- and also in my waistband. It's the semi-final of the Great British Bake Off.
- Inside that tent, 

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,520
- four bakers are fighting for their lives...is that too dramatic? 
- It's never too dramatic, 

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,480
- it's cakes, biscuits and desserts we're talking about. 
- Plus I let a tiger loose in there. 

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,320
Welcome to the Great British Bake Off! 

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,680
Last time, our quarter-finalists braved wheat-free loaves... 

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,920
Oh, hello, cheeky! 

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,600
..messy meringues... 

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,760
It feels like the most complex technical so far. 

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,560
..and novelty cakes. 

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,720
It's quite outside my comfort zone. 

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,120
Ruby was Star Baker for the third time... 

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,520
It's probably the best-looking thing I've ever made. 

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,640
..whilst Christine... 

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,720
Can't believe this. 

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,800
..left the tent. 

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Now, our all-female semi-finalists have just three French challenges... 

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,800
We're baffled by the bavarois. 

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,640
..between them at a place in the final. 

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,120
This is going to be a mess! 

21
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,080
Who will survive to tell the tale? 

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,120
The person who will not be joining us for the final is... 

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,200
THEY SPEAK IN FRENCH 

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,800
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour, ca va? 

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,880
- Tres, tres bien, Suzanne!
- Oui?
- Oui! 

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,800
Oh-h! So close to the final! 

27
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,080
I've been containing my competitive spirit. 

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,840
At the minute, it's not quite at full pelt, but it's nearly there. 

29
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,400
I am sort of taking it all like a marathon, so I'm just trying 

30
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,920
to do each mile as it comes, but we're getting nearer to that end 

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,880
so even if I hit that wall this week, 

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,960
I'm just going to push on through it. 

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,000
I think there's a lot of pressure this week. 

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,600
To go out at this stage when you're so close would be really difficult. 

35
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,720
I wouldn't call it at this stage, there's so much talent in that tent. 

36
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,480
There's going to be a fight to the finish, I think. 

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,800
Hello, semi-finalists, and welcome back to the tent. 

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,520
Now, you are just three bakes away 

39
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,720
from the Great British Bake Off finals. 

40
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,160
So for your Signature Challenge, 

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,800
we all know what makes a great drinks party. 

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,920
Keys in a bowl. 

43
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,280
Sadly, for legal reasons, we can't do that today, 

44
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,400
so we're going to ask you instead to make savoury canapes. 

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,840
So we'd like three types, one choux, one pastry-based, 

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,640
the other one is entirely up to you. 

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,200
We'd like 12 of each, please. 

48
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,880
Now, these little canapes should be tantalising to the taste buds, 

49
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,880
and visually very, very enticing. 

50
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,600
You've got two and a half hours, so on your marks... 

51
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,720
Get set. 

52
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,960
BOTH: Bake! 

53
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,280
There's lots to go on today, there's lots of elements that need to 

54
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,440
be made and done to a high standard. 

55
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,400
You know, they need to taste good and look amazing. 

56
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,280
Just trying to get all the different elements 

57
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,480
done in the time, it's going to be tight. 

58
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,840
There's so much that can go wrong with canapes, 

59
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,480
they've got to pace themselves, because they've got to make 

60
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,680
choux pastry, shortcrust pastry and something else. 

61
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,320
The finish has got to be absolutely perfect. 

62
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,120
It's about precision, they've got to be all the same size. 

63
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,120
It's about consistency throughout the batch, the flavours, 

64
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,480
how you're going to incorporate those flavours, 

65
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,760
because you want to pack a big punch in a small amount of space. 

66
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,880
At the moment, I'm just making the pastry for the tartlets 

67
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,200
and I'm going to put that in the fridge to relax for a while, 

68
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,640
while I do some other stuff. 

69
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,960
So I'm just starting my carrot pastry at the moment. 

70
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,840
Outside of cooking cakes and sweet and buttery stuff, 

71
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,480
I do actually love vegetables. 

72
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,240
So I'm doing French legume canapes, it's already looking a bit 

73
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,720
carroty in colour, because I've added the smoked paprika. 

74
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,200
As well as spicy carrots, 

75
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,680
Frances' vegetable garden 

76
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,520
will feature choux pastry tomatoes 

77
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,280
filled with smoked trout pate 

78
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,600
and tiny cauliflowers made from scones 

79
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,920
topped with cheese and cauliflower puree. 

80
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
So what sort of pastry are you using? 

81
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,840
It's almost like a shortcrust, really, I'm shaping it 

82
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,040
around these little horns so it looks like a little carrot. 

83
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,600
And then I'm filling it with hummus 

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
cos you normally have carrot sticks and hummus together. 

85
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,360
Now, I hope we're not having rabbits all round the outside 

86
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,880
- or flowers or something. 
- No rabbits. No, no, no. 

87
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,040
- We're concentrating on the three canapes.
- Yeah. 

88
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,520
Style over substance. 

89
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,160
I want to put the style on the substance, Paul, this time. 

90
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,840
I'm making little rye and poppy seed biscuits with some beetroot stuff. 

91
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,200
Ruby's 'beetroot stuff' is actually 

92
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,480
a jelly to top her poppy seed biscuits. 

93
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,080
She's also making shortcrust 

94
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,640
tartlets packed full of spinach 

95
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,960
and quail's egg, 

96
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,040
and choux buns filled with goat's cheese 

97
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,160
and caramelised red onion. 

98
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,960
This is the beetroot jelly. 

99
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,480
So it's the juice that we're using? 

100
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,360
That looks like good fun, Ruby. 

101
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
- This is good fun. 
- It looks slightly violent. 

102
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,520
I look a bit scary at the moment, don't I? 

103
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,680
Your little tart shells, what are you using for that? 

104
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,360
I'm making little tartlets with spinach and Gruyere in them 

105
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,120
and I'm cracking a quail's egg on top 

106
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,320
and then they go in the oven for a short time. 

107
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,880
So it'll be a cooked egg on the top? 

108
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,640
Yeah, hopefully with a soft yolk still. 

109
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,080
- Good luck.
- Good luck. 
- See you later, Ruby. 

110
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,360
To complete three different types of canape in just two 

111
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,960
and a half hours, every minute must be used effectively. 

112
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,720
A good pastry canape needs to be thin, crispy, no soggy bottom. 

113
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,960
When I was making them in the week, they weren't thin enough. 

114
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,400
To get everything made in time, 

115
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,080
Kimberley's already preparing her fillings. 

116
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,960
I'm doing the cooking sauce for the chicken 

117
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,640
that's going inside my steamed Chinese buns. 

118
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,200
It's a classic kind of Chinese dim sum. 

119
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,080
She's making pea and Parma ham 

120
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,440
shortcrust tarts, 

121
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,680
elongated choux buns 

122
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,920
filled with crab and wasabi mayonnaise, 

123
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,480
and steamed buns filled with Chinese chicken. 

124
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,000
Now, these look like dough balls. 

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,200
It's a yeasted dough, pop the chicken in, close it up, 

126
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,840
then turn it and then steam them. 

127
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,680
- Do you get some growth with that in the steamer?
- A little bit, yeah, 

128
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,480
I've worked it out so they should be roughly the same size. 

129
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,520
- And are they going to have a decoration on them?
- The pickled lotus root, 

130
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,600
I'm going to colour it a bit and tie that in a knot and put it on top. 

131
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,560
You've got some serious multitasking on your hands, Kimberley. 

132
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,640
- I've got a lot of work to do.
- Good luck.
- There's no holding back now. 

133
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:57,120
I've been practising my behind off all week. 

134
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,960
This savoury macaroon is a new thing. 

135
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,400
I thought I needed to up my game a bit so I devised this. 

136
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,920
To go with her Stilton and walnut macaroons, 

137
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Beca's making beetroot choux buns 

138
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,120
filled with smoked salmon 

139
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,040
and horseradish creme fraiche, 

140
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,720
and surprise, surprise, 

141
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,400
Welsh rarebit tartlets. 

142
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,280
Can you tell us about the macaroons? 

143
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,680
Stilton and walnut, Stilton that goes inside, how's that going to be put inside? 

144
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,640
Is it mixed with anything or literally just a blob of Stilton inside? 

145
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,760
I'll cut them into rounds 

146
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,960
so they'll fit neatly within the macaroon shell. 

147
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,000
- So you're not doing anything to the Stilton, just cutting it? 
- I don't think it needs anything, 

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,680
cos it's so strong and such a lovely flavour, and I don't want to add anything else to it. 

149
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,560
To choose Stilton is going to kill any sweetness, 

150
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,200
which is just what we want. 

151
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,120
You like your macaroons, Beca, don't you? You like the old macaroon. 

152
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,280
I think they're brilliant and versatile and fun. 

153
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,560
You are Becaroon. That's your new name. 

154
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,240
This is just water and butter for my choux pastry, 

155
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,040
and I'm just going to add some plain flour and green tea powder. 

156
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,760
Green tea powder, it's just for colouring, 

157
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,120
it's not meant to add too much flavour. 

158
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,000
That is beetroot powder, I've got beetroot juice for my choux pastry, 

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,800
but this is just to give it a little bit more colour as well 

160
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,320
cos it does lose a little bit 

161
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,840
during the baking process. 

162
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,960
Once the choux has thickened in the pan, it can be piped. 

163
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,120
Mary and Paul will be looking for canapes that are identical in size. 

164
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,880
And Frances is taking no chances. 

165
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,320
I'm just giving them a bit of an egg wash, so it just gives them 

166
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,000
a bit of colour and also it stops them ballooning too much 

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,720
cos although I want them to puff, 

168
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,000
I still want them to look like tomatoes. 

169
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,640
It's important for these to be really small. 

170
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,080
Actually, I do need to be careful because I want them 

171
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,640
to be reasonably similar in size to the other things I'm doing. 

172
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,600
Oh, brilliant. 

173
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,680
That's my dough for the buns. 

174
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,640
This is actually a cake pops tray, 

175
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,760
I was trying to find a way 

176
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,720
to get the buns uniform 

177
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,560
to make sure they're all the same size 

178
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,280
and all small cos, actually, 

179
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,760
they do expand and rise, 

180
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,600
and so I was experimenting with a few different methods. 

181
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,280
Actually, this is the best way. 

182
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,840
- Hello, Kimberley.
- Hello. 
- This is a bad week to go, isn't it? 

183
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,800
It would be really bad, no, there's no denying that. It'd feel... 

184
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,880
Cos to say, "I'm a finalist," it's then... 

185
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,480
You know, cos you'd love to say you'd won, but a finalist! 

186
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,520
At this stage, you want to see it through, I think, 

187
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,240
you want to have the opportunity to say, "You know what...?" 

188
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,600
"See it through..." That actually means, "I really want to win," 

189
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,680
but, you see, you're very clever and have the way of couching it, 

190
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,200
"I'd like to see this through." 

191
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,120
SHE LAUGHS 

192
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,960
SHEEP BLEAT 

193
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,480
All-female baker semi-finalists of the baking sorority, 

194
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,360
you have got one hour left on the clock. 

195
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,640
One hour... 

196
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,240
This is the cheese and chive scone for the cauliflower cheese scone. 

197
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,400
They've kept their colour, which is good. 

198
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,480
They're a lot more even than they usually are, 

199
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,800
they've come up all right. 

200
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,680
Compared to the size of the other things, 

201
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,040
it's pretty much spot on, which is positive. 

202
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,160
I might discard that giant one. 

203
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,200
Oh, wow, look at those! 

204
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,600
- They're like sort of strange talons, aren't they?
- I know. 

205
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,520
Frances just takes everything to another completely different level, 

206
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,600
it goes to planet Frances, where nobody can hitch a ride to. 

207
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
I think that's a compliment. 

208
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,240
I reckon it's better to be a mentalist than boring. 

209
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,760
OK, bakers, you have 30 minutes on your posh canapes. 

210
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,440
Posh pastry in 30 minutes, thank you. 

211
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,360
So choux's under there, scones there, carrot talons... 

212
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
It's now filling galore. 

213
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,280
Piping, filling, boom. 

214
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,960
Right, eggs. 

215
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,760
It'd be really nice to have them 

216
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,840
filled to the brim with stuff, but if that egg white 

217
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,320
trickles down the side while it's in the oven, I will have soggy bottoms. 

218
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,080
I'll have 12 soggy bottoms. 

219
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,760
I'm just preparing the Parmesan crisps. 

220
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,680
Have you just gone freestyle there? You're not going to weigh it? 

221
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,120
I haven't got time, really. 

222
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,200
- You daredevil, playing with fire. 
- I'm off the scale! 

223
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,480
You are bakery rock'n'roll, Frances. 

224
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,240
These are...what are these poppy seed little things? 

225
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,840
Yeah, little biscuits. 

226
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
I'm making now the filling 

227
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,520
for my Welsh rarebit. 

228
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,320
So I've got some amazing Welsh cheddar. 

229
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,960
My ale is from Felinfoel, 

230
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,960
which is near Llanelli, in West Wales. 

231
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,200
I don't know what rarebit means, 

232
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,280
I think it's an olde-worlde term 

233
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,600
for something thy spread on thy toasts, with cheese. 

234
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,320
OK, bakers, that's ten minutes left. 

235
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,040
This is the only time where chouxs are acceptable on the benches. 

236
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,800
Oh, come on. 

237
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,000
This is the beetroot jelly. 

238
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,480
OK, bakers, one minute left. 

239
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,560
OK, bakers, time is up. 

240
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Time for you to canape your dues to the judges. 

241
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,640
Cool. 

242
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,520
Well, for originality, ten out of ten. 

243
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,000
They look most tempting. 

244
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
Mmm. 

245
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,360
The pastry is crisp, 

246
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,000
the pea puree is delicious, 

247
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,920
that's a beautiful canape. 

248
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,600
They look great, by the way. 

249
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,320
I think these are scrummy, 

250
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,080
the choux pastry is crisp 

251
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,720
and well dried out, 

252
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,200
the crab is lovely. 

253
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,960
You've kept the texture of the crab, 

254
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,760
in fact, I'm going to eat the other half. 

255
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,800
Let's go to the big ones, you could have done half the size of that. 

256
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,800
Literally, half the size. 

257
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,280
This might take two bites, even for me. 

258
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,960
I think the size is wrong, for sure, 

259
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,960
but I think the consistency from the bread to the filling is perfect. 

260
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,920
I think all three of them are ingenious, 

261
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,840
you've thought them through well, the flavours are great. 

262
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,200
The best thing about these ones 

263
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,080
is you can do a very good Marlon Brando impression. 

264
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,440
So, Ruby, the collection looks 

265
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,760
so attractive. 

266
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,760
I think they look really good, quite different. 

267
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,840
I'm going to start off with your spinach tart 

268
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,960
- and that's your pastry example. 
- Yeah. 

269
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,680
If you're going to put a shell like that, you have to fill it up. 

270
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,160
You can't leave half empty shells like that. 

271
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,800
One of the things which you could have done which is poach 

272
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,840
the eggs individually into little moulds and taken them out and cooled 

273
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,480
them and dropped them in, that would have given you uniformity. 

274
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,920
The pastry is beautifully cooked, 

275
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,000
beautifully cooked, lovely and thin. 

276
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,320
Needs just a little more seasoning for me. 

277
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,120
So shall we go onto your beetroot ones? 

278
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,560
I'm enjoying that enormously, 

279
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,920
clever girl to get that base crisp. 

280
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,560
They're clever, they look very neat. 

281
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,080
I do like the flavour, it dissipates quite quick. 

282
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,240
And then we're onto your choux pastry. 

283
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
I think they're quite flat as a choux, 

284
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,200
they're not as domed as you expect them to be, not as lively, 

285
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,440
but let's try it. 

286
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,360
That's the one, if I was going to go for one, that's the one I'd go for. 

287
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,920
The onion is delicious, cream cheese great, really crispy choux. 

288
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,640
- Thank you, Ruby.
- Thank you. 
- Delicious, thank you. 

289
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,920
I think the uniform, it hasn't got the wow factor, I'm not sure. 

290
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,320
They look quite boring, 

291
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,600
if I'm honest. 

292
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,600
I'm a little bit worried about the beetroot ones, 

293
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,280
they look to me a little over-baked. 

294
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,000
- I'm not finding that memorable.
- OK. 

295
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,760
Here we are, semi-final - 

296
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,800
each one has got to have character, 

297
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,080
that one for me doesn't have character. 

298
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,080
Then we move onto the macaroon, 

299
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,960
I think it's a very, very clever idea. 

300
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,280
I was worried about the volume of cheese, basically, 

301
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,680
you've got a macaroon with just a bit of Stilton inside, 

302
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,440
I think the Stilton is too thick, if you're going to put a disc in, 

303
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,360
a thin disc in and maybe melt it, just blast it with a blowtorch, 

304
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,000
- so you've got a package, that's the point of a macaroon.
- Yeah. 

305
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,040
- Now you're in your comfort zone, Welsh rarebit.
- Yes. 

306
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,960
Well, the pastry's crisp. 

307
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,360
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT 

308
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,640
Wow, there's some alcohol in that! 

309
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,440
Everything's dominated by the ale, 

310
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,680
I can't taste anything else. 

311
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,000
Thank you very much. 

312
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,520
It's all right, thank you. 

313
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,520
I do think it looks stunning, 

314
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,120
I think your presentation 

315
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,840
is what we were looking for. 

316
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,680
- Oh, thank you!
- They look fantastic. 

317
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,240
The flavour is delicious, 

318
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,160
the basil is coming through. 

319
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,280
Lovely shine on the icing, you've cracked it. 

320
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,840
- Going onto your pastry one, the carrot.
- Yes. 

321
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,440
I love the texture of it, it's great. 

322
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,760
I love the look of it, there is too much heat, 

323
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,400
there's too much paprika in there. 

324
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,520
If it's for your drinks party, you'll have to supply a lot of drink 

325
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,800
- because you're going to be very, very thirsty.
- That's true. 

326
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,520
The cauliflower scones, they look fantastic, 

327
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,040
they really do look great. 

328
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,320
You've got a very good bake underneath. 

329
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,600
Lovely, lovely, lovely. 

330
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,400
You've got the creaminess coming from the cauliflower on top, 

331
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,720
you've got the crispiness coming from the lettuce, 

332
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,760
and that beautiful scone texture coming from underneath. 

333
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,760
It's magical, very, very clever. 

334
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,160
Absolutely scrummy. 

335
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,520
- Well done.
- Thank you. 

336
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,320
I was really sort of dreading whether the style 

337
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,040
and the look of it may put them off, but I think they were pleased 

338
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,520
and I got a Hollywood handshake. 

339
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,600
It wasn't all bad, but it was a very mixed bag 

340
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,480
and it can't be that now, at this stage in the competition. 

341
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,360
It just has to be uniformly good feedback, 

342
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,240
you can't just be mediocre, you've got to be doing really well. 

343
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,120
That was pretty good, I'm really pleased. 

344
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,120
I'm so pleased, the only criticism was about the size 

345
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,760
of the steamed buns and I can deal with that, that's fine. 

346
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,160
They said that they weren't memorable, which is frustrating 

347
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,640
because at this stage, you need to be smacking them 

348
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,440
with flavours between their eyes, pretty much. 

349
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,000
I think the main thing why I'm frustrated is 

350
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,840
because they just didn't love it as much as I hoped they would. 

351
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,280
Pretty much. 

352
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,080
SHEEP BLEAT 

353
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,640
Bakers, boulangeres. 

354
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,240
It's time for the Technical Challenge. 

355
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,960
FRENCH ACCENT: Le challenge technique. 

356
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,920
The recipe you're about to do is one of Madame Berry 

357
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,920
- so, juges, il faut quitter la tente, s'il vous plait.
- Oui, allez. 

358
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,400
- Directement allez.
- Allez! 
- Pour longtemps. 

359
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Wow! Derriere, comme une peche! 

360
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,360
Rrrr! 

361
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,200
Right, let sanity prevail. 

362
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,480
Technical Challenge, feared by many. 

363
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,360
Now, it is upon you - today, we would like to you make... 

364
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,520
a Charlotte Royal. 

365
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,080
- Yes!
- Yeah. 

366
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,480
I'd never heard of it either. 

367
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,560
Anyway, what it is, it's basically slices of Swiss roll 

368
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,400
that form a dome around a set fruit custard, called a bavarois, OK? 

369
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,160
You have two and a half hours to complete this challenge, 

370
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,280
we're going to do two hours this afternoon 

371
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,200
and then you've got half an hour tomorrow. 

372
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,960
Because it needs to set overnight. 

373
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,960
All I'm going to say is, I've seen one, it looks like a brain. 

374
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,800
Hope that helps. On your marks. 

375
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,040
Get set. 

376
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,080
BOTH: Bake! 

377
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,560
I've never made one of these before, 

378
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,680
I'm trying to create a picture in my head 

379
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,360
of what it's meant to look like. 

380
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,320
I know what it looks like but it's the sort of thing you see in a book 

381
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,280
and think, "I'm never going to mess around with something like that." 

382
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,080
And now look what I'm doing. 

383
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,840
I think the challenge sounds like fun, actually. 

384
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,440
Charlotte Royal is the perfect Technical Challenge 

385
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,920
for a semi-final. 

386
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,480
There are so many techniques, 

387
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,680
you've got to make a perfect Swiss roll, tightly, very tightly packed 

388
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,920
into the bowl so you don't see any of the bavarois peeping through. 

389
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,680
There it is. 

390
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,240
It does look good, 

391
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,800
the sponge is nice and soft, 

392
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,360
it's really packed together, 

393
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,760
that mousse has got a little 

394
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,600
bit of bounce to it from that gelatine too. 

395
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,160
It's gorgeous, it's really nice. 

396
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,360
And you've had it now, Mary, because next time 

397
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,960
- I go round to your house, I'd better get this when I arrive.
- We shall see. 

398
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,080
The first instruction is make the jam. 

399
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,760
I'm just sort of going on how I make jam. 

400
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,720
It's fruit and sugar ultimately, at the end of the day, isn't it? 

401
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,600
I'll just get that going. 

402
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,040
If you don't boil it for long enough, it won't set 

403
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,720
and you'll just have a very sweet fruit compote or it will end up with 

404
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,640
a toffee-like texture, which isn't very nice if you boil it too long. 

405
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,440
While the jam's cooling, the bakers make the Swiss roll sponge. 

406
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,960
So eggs, 150g of caster sugar. 

407
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,360
The eggs and sugar should be whisked together before adding the flour. 

408
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,200
Without adding extra fat, you're able to get the elasticity in it, 

409
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,640
if you put the fat in, it makes it shorter and would crumble 

410
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,640
and you wouldn't be able to roll it. 

411
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,240
The basic instructions don't stipulate exactly how long 

412
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,520
to leave the sponges in the oven. 

413
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,960
Because the mixture is spread so thinly, 

414
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,240
moments out could result in an under- or over-baked cake. 

415
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,520
I really should check the time when I put stuff in the oven. 

416
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,720
But whether or not the sponge is baked is just the first hurdle. 

417
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,440
It's springing back. 

418
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,720
Right, what do you do? What now? 

419
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,760
I'm just making a little cut 

420
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,520
that helps to start the roll. 

421
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,080
I can't let them cool first, 

422
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,240
because it will just crack. 

423
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,160
So you kind of do this, so it knows...almost like muscle memory, 

424
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,320
so it knows the shape that it's supposed to hold. 

425
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,880
This is going to be a big design element of your Charlotte Royal, 

426
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,640
the swirls, so you need to make sure it's a good one. 

427
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,120
It needs to be rolled tighter, but I just don't want to squeeze 

428
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,600
all the jam out of it, this is the problem. 

429
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,280
Looks all right. 

430
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,600
Yeah, I'm happy with those swirls. 

431
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,160
This roll has really not been done justice. 

432
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,760
Bakers, you've got one hour left 

433
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,560
until you need to chill and set, 

434
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,880
and put your puddings in the fridge. 

435
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,800
While those Swiss rolls firm up, 

436
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,800
the bakers face the most puzzling part of the challenge. 

437
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,960
I know nothing about bavarois, frankly. 

438
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,240
Bavarois, babarois, bavarois. 

439
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,080
We're baffled by the bavarois. 

440
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,120
A bavarois is a delicate cream made with custard 

441
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,000
that's thickened with gelatine. 

442
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,600
The eggs will start to set at about 84 degrees 

443
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,160
and I don't want to take it too far over that, because it'll split. 

444
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,400
The custard should be cooked to the correct consistency 

445
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,320
so that when the gelatine is added, the bavarois will set. 

446
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,600
If not, the dessert could collapse. 

447
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,680
I don't think it wants to be as thick as a creme pate, 

448
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,040
but at the same time, it wants to be fairly thick, 

449
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,600
cos it's then going to have the 

450
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,280
raspberries going through it. 

451
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,840
Great colour. 

452
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,840
The final step is to gently fold in the whipped cream, 

453
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,760
which should give the bavarois its mousse-like texture. 

454
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,920
I don't know what consistency it's supposed to be, 

455
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,600
but I haven't really got time to worry. 

456
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,680
OK, bakers, just half an hour remaining on this chunk 

457
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,240
of the Charlotte Royal challenge. 

458
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,880
'Once the Swiss rolls have cooled, 

459
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,200
'they must line the bowl.' 

460
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,520
I'm quite happy with that, 

461
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,000
I think that looks really good. 

462
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,680
I'm trying to keep them consistent, 

463
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,480
to make sure they are neat. 

464
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,240
It is all wrong, I'm getting progressively thinner slices 

465
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,880
realising I'm never going to line the bowl. 

466
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,640
Hang on, hang on, right, Frances is bang on the money. 

467
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,160
She's using the clingfilm. 

468
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,440
SHE WHISPERS: They need to line the bowl... 

469
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,160
- THEY WHISPER:
- Why are you doing that?
- I don't want Beca to see. 

470
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,560
It looks sinister. 

471
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,680
If you don't line the bowl with clingfilm, 

472
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,440
then it's very difficult to turn out, apparently. 

473
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,520
Kimberley is very difficult to read, 

474
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,360
she keeps her cards close to the chest, 

475
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,240
although when we did the intro, 

476
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,520
when we said the words "Charlotte Royal", she went... 

477
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,520
"I was at school with her." 

478
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,960
THEY CHUCKLE 

479
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,080
"Excuse me, I must leave immediately." 

480
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,000
I just want to make sure 

481
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,920
that all the cracks are filled in, 

482
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,400
so that the custard doesn't just spill out. 

483
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,920
That's quite pretty, because aesthetically you need 

484
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,400
to think about when it's turned out as well. 

485
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,240
I've found a little hole... 

486
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,880
..two little holes. 

487
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,800
If I can see the light through it, 

488
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,400
then it means the custard will get through it. 

489
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,200
I should have lined it, I should have lined the bowl. 

490
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,440
It's going to be a mess, 

491
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,280
it really will look like a brain. 

492
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,320
That there, that's all good. 

493
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,240
- So...
- There's no panic, 

494
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,480
there's a couple that you've got a bit annoyed with, 

495
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,840
a couple of frontal lobes have suffered quite badly. 

496
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,880
You'll be fine, you can just use those bits. 

497
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,680
So don't worry, don't panic. 

498
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,080
Tell me if you want me to slap you in the face, Ruby. 

499
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,760
- What do you mean? You've never asked me before, you just went for it.
- I know, I know. 

500
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,200
Ladies of the semi-final, 

501
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,000
you've got five minutes left 

502
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,560
on your right Royal Charlottes, five minutes. 

503
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,240
Mmm, slop. 

504
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,880
The cakes are not going to sit on top of that. 

505
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,360
It's going to sink. 

506
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,840
This is weird. 

507
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,400
This is where we find out 

508
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,280
whether we've got any holes. 

509
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,760
It's looking OK. 

510
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,720
It's a mess anyway, 

511
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,160
if I can just maybe distribute the fruit a bit more evenly, 

512
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,200
I don't know. 

513
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,800
OK, bakers, you've got one minute to put the mush in the brain, 

514
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,120
put the lid on the brain, put the brain in the fridge. 

515
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,600
I'm not an expert. 

516
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,840
Knocking it out... 

517
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,280
How do I get this undone? 

518
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
You can rely on foil. 

519
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,280
Oh, sugar! 

520
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,000
I've forgotten the fruit. 

521
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,040
OK, that was very close, 

522
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
I don't like that. 

523
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,560
Little bit too relaxed there. 

524
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,600
Bakers, that's it, the Technical Challenge is now closed, 

525
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,720
Charlotte must go into the fridge. 

526
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,160
Charlotte will come out of the fridge tomorrow morning, 

527
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,400
she'll be furious. Night-night! 

528
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,280
A new day dawns in the Bake Off tent, 

529
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,360
and only 30 minutes remain to finish the Charlotte Royals. 

530
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,440
Cool, let's do it. 

531
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,880
Oh, dear. 

532
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,960
She's not a looker. 

533
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,440
I'm going to have to turn it out, aren't I? 

534
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,560
Yeah, I think the film is just being very clingy. 

535
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,920
Oh, there we go. 

536
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,560
OK. 

537
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,600
It's breaking... That's it. 

538
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,880
It came out. 

539
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,240
I'm just going to have to cover up all the mistakes. 

540
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,520
There's only so much you can do. 

541
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,280
And now for the finishing touches. 

542
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,400
Dissolve arrowroot and sugar syrup 

543
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,840
to glaze the Charlotte. 

544
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,240
It's quite gloopy, jelly-like. 

545
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,880
Mmm, appetising. 

546
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,040
Here we go, Charlotte. 

547
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,800
It's like glue! 

548
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,000
Look at the gloop. 

549
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,440
It's like Ghostbusters. 

550
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,720
OK, bakers, one minute left, one minute, please. 

551
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,840
OK, bakers, time to stop fiddling with Charlotte now, the bake's over. 

552
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,440
All right, if you'd like to bring your gooey brains 

553
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,440
over to the judging table and stand away, 

554
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,520
let's just all stand away from them. 

555
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,160
We'll have a look at this one first, I mean, this one is not too bad. 

556
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,160
There are massive areas where the bavarois is coming through. 

557
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,440
This person didn't get the tight roll of the Swiss roll. 

558
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,360
It's a good distribution of fruit. 

559
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,160
But it's a little bit too much 

560
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,760
Swiss roll on the bottom. 

561
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,840
Tastes very good, don't you think so? 

562
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,600
It has got a good taste, that one. 

563
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,240
This one's quite nice - not much, if any, bavarois coming through at all, 

564
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,800
jam looks pretty good as well. 

565
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,000
Nice tight roll. 

566
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,560
Everything looks right on this one, 

567
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,680
whoever's made it should be very proud. 

568
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,320
This one, the jam looks OK in this one again, 

569
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,800
lots of bavarois coming through. 

570
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,480
Let's see how it is inside. 

571
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,400
The fruit's not very evenly 

572
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,600
distributed in this one. 

573
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,280
It's not a bad effort, it just needs to have more sponge on the top 

574
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,720
and more fruit inside. 

575
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,160
And finally, the last one, this has got issues, hasn't it? 

576
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,080
The jam is one of the biggest issues on that, 

577
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,600
the height is the other one. 

578
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,680
Yes, I think the Swiss roll 

579
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,440
hasn't got the same volume, 

580
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,240
it's a much smaller Swiss roll. 

581
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,600
I don't quite know where all the mousse has gone. 

582
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,320
The mousse is very solid. 

583
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,280
It has problems. 

584
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,160
Mary and Paul will now rank the bakes in reverse order. 

585
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:36,520
The person in fourth place is obviously this one. 

586
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,960
Oh, dear. 

587
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,000
Right, and in third place, here. 

588
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,360
Number two is this one. 

589
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,960
Frances, not bad, but you haven't covered all of it. 

590
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,880
And in first place... 

591
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,200
- Well done, Kimberley. 
- Well done, Kimberley. 

592
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,760
We couldn't find fault. 

593
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,560
Perfection, well done. 

594
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Um, yay! 

595
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,800
It was nice. 

596
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,680
I think that was everything I expected, wasn't it? 

597
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,400
At least I was prepared for that, 

598
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,240
I knew I was going to come last. 

599
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,400
I got on the podium, the technical podium. 

600
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,000
And I got a silver, 

601
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,720
so, yes, that feels really good actually going into the Showstopper. 

602
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,840
Kimberley and Frances have done well in both challenges, 

603
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,200
Ruby and I have both had issues, 

604
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,640
so it's pretty much down to the Showstopper. 

605
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,440
It is win or home, pretty much. 

606
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,200
Bonjour, bakers, and welcome to your French Showstopper Challenge. 

607
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Today, we would like you to make the most delicate 

608
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,200
and complex of cakes - the opera cake. 

609
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,280
Now, this traditionally consists of seven even layers of joconde sponge 

610
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,520
with buttercream, ganache, syrup and glaze 

611
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,720
representing the four acts of the opera, 

612
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,360
- or a sort of Cosi Fan Fruity, if you will.
- Oh, she's good. 

613
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,600
Now, the flavours in your opera cake are entirely up to you, 

614
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,040
but Mary and Paul want the layers to be clearly defined, 

615
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,440
they want the sides to be even and, most important of all, 

616
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,640
when somebody looks at your opera cake... 

617
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,640
# ..they should break into song! # 

618
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,040
You've got two and a half hours to bake 

619
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,600
and present these opera marvels. 

620
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,840
So, ladies, on your marks... 

621
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,280
Get your funk on, Brunhildes! 

622
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,880
- # Bake!
- Aaah!
- # 

623
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,440
This is a bit of a crucial bake for me, 

624
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,400
but I'm not going to let that 

625
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,120
bother my train of thought, I'm just going to crack on. 

626
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,680
Opera cake is an elaborate French dessert, traditionally made up 

627
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,520
of thin sponge layered with coffee and chocolate filling. 

628
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,760
As always with these bakes, it's time. Time, time, time. 

629
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,840
Could there be anything that is more grand than an opera cake? 

630
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,880
First thing you see is that wonderful shiny top. 

631
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,800
The main thing is it's very fine layers all the way up, 

632
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,760
it's got to be sheer perfection. 

633
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,640
The bakers can go wrong on any level on an opera cake. 

634
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,000
Ooh, hello... 

635
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,880
'It's actually all about timing,' 

636
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,760
you've got to cool each layer down as you put it on. 

637
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,800
If you try and put cream on a warm sponge, it will melt, 

638
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,880
it's one of the hardest cakes to do properly. 

639
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,920
This is the chance to shine. 

640
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,880
Last-chance saloon. 

641
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,280
An opera cake's sponge layers are individually baked joconde sponge, 

642
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,320
made from stiffly beaten egg whites and ground almonds. 

643
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,080
So I'm just sieving my almonds, 

644
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,080
it's going to go in my joconde, 

645
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,800
and I measured out more than I need because I want to use 

646
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,360
the finest parts of them 

647
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,320
so the sponge is kept as light as possible. 

648
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,720
- Hello, Ruby.
- Hi. 

649
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,080
Your opera cake, how is it different? 

650
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,680
The buttercream is made with an almond praline, 

651
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,040
and there's some saffron in it as well. 

652
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,680
Ruby's not only adding saffron 

653
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,120
to her almond praline 

654
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,200
French buttercream, 

655
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,880
she's also using it to flavour 

656
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,960
her syrup and her chocolate ganache. 

657
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,200
Why have you used saffron in this? 

658
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,800
I just like saffron. 

659
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,560
Saffron is going to be fighting with the chocolate, 

660
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,440
with the pralines, it's going to be fighting with everything, 

661
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,160
- are you actually going to taste it? 
- You'll get a bit of it. 

662
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,760
- Good luck.
- Thank you. 

663
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,640
I'm folding the egg whites into the batter 

664
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,720
so that you're incorporating it as evenly as you can without losing 

665
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,280
too much of the volume that you've worked hard 

666
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,320
to get into the egg whites. 

667
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,480
The key to a successful opera cake is thin, 

668
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,520
perfectly even layers of sponge. 

669
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,400
I'm just weighing the mixture, 

670
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,680
so there's roughly the same amount in each tin, 

671
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,600
because I do have a tendency to dollop mixture into cake tins 

672
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,720
and hope for the best. 

673
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,640
These are probably going to go in now. 

674
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
BEEPING 

675
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,880
So, ganache. 

676
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,680
The ganache layer of the opera cake 

677
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,440
is usually made from dark chocolate, 

678
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,280
but Frances rarely sticks to the rule book. 

679
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,960
White chocolate sometimes is a little bit tricky to play with, 

680
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,440
cos it's got more sugar in, so I don't want it to burn 

681
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,640
so I'm just encouraging it to melt 

682
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,800
by putting it over a bain-marie rather than straight back in the pan 

683
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,880
so this way, I can control it a little bit more. 

684
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,840
Frances' white chocolate opera cake 

685
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,560
made with layers of lemon sponge 

686
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,120
and lavender buttercream is based 

687
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,000
on a different kind of opera. 

688
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,120
I'm creating a soap opera cake, 

689
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,120
so I'm using fresh flavours, 

690
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,520
lemon and then French lavender and a white chocolate ganache. 

691
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,880
So no carbolics? 

692
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,520
No carbolics, no Fairy liquid, no. 

693
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,560
- Lavender, such a pungent kick...
- Yes. 
- ..that in something as delicate 

694
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,920
as an opera cake, I'm worried that that's going to overwhelm everything. 

695
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,440
The syrup itself is very strong. 

696
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,920
- Very body wash.
- Yeah. 

697
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,280
But once it actually goes into the sponge 

698
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,520
and you've got the powerful sharp lemon buttercream, 

699
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,600
and the white chocolate and vanilla ganache, it tones it all down. 

700
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,600
- Lovely.
- Sounds good.
- Good luck, Frances.
- Thank you very much indeed. 

701
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,120
Worst comes to the worst, 

702
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,400
we'll just add a rope, hang it in the shower, no bother. 

703
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,600
- Hello, Beca.
- Hello. 

704
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,800
Can you tell us about your opera cake, please? 

705
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,320
My opera cake, I'm basing it on the flavours of banoffee. 

706
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
I've got two different types of buttercream, 

707
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,800
one will have caramel through it 

708
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,880
and one will have fresh bananas through it 

709
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,680
and then I'm going to do two layers of dark chocolate ganache. 

710
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,200
This sounds awful. 

711
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,760
Beca's banana and caramel 

712
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,080
buttercreams will be sandwiched 

713
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,720
with banana flavour sponge cakes 

714
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,400
and topped with even more banana. 

715
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,960
Is there any element of texture, something that's going to crack, 

716
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,000
something that's going to give more of a texture to the whole thing 

717
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,800
rather than just soft sponge all the way through and buttercream? 

718
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,920
There are banana chips, dried banana chips in the sponges. 

719
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,560
Are these banana chips which you've crushed or pureed? 

720
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,520
Yes, they're really hard and I've ground them down. 

721
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,680
- So you might get a bit of crunch off that.
- Yeah. 

722
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,280
You don't really get much flavour from that, though. 

723
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Well, that's why I'm adding banana essence in to help 

724
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,960
and that's why I'm using fresh bananas in the buttercream, 

725
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,360
so you are getting a fresh element in there. 

726
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,680
- Well, good luck, Beca.
- Thank you very much.
- See you in a little bit. 

727
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,760
While Beca, Ruby and Frances 

728
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,720
are sticking to the traditional elements of cake, 

729
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,520
ganache and buttercream... 

730
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,240
I'm just whipping up the egg whites now, I've put some lemon zest 

731
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,800
in there as well to really help with the lemon flavour. 

732
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,120
And then I've got a lemon syrup going on. 

733
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,680
I'm just gradually adding icing sugar, 

734
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,360
it needs to be thick but spreadable. 

735
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,160
Kimberley is experimenting with more unusual layers. 

736
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,720
And this is for the lime jelly, 

737
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,240
I'm just going to warm a little bit of the lime 

738
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,320
to dissolve the gelatine in, but keep most of it cold 

739
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,160
so it doesn't all have to cool down, 

740
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,600
it'll save me some time. 

741
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,040
Going to colour that lime green, so it shows up in the layers. 

742
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,800
Kimberley's jelly will sit in the middle of her chocolate opera cake, 

743
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,640
which also features a thick layer 

744
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,120
of dark tempered chocolate, 

745
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,520
passion fruit mousseline 

746
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,080
and a crisp polka dot topping. 

747
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,440
Tell us how you're going to decorate this opera cake. 

748
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:20,080
The plan is, time-permitting, to make some chocolate caramel twirls 

749
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,560
which I'll roll into a hoop 

750
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,040
and fill with truffles, if I can, 

751
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,400
but maybe just the twirls, it depends. 

752
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,880
How big are they going to be? 

753
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,120
I'm going to wrap them round a little...this. 

754
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,680
The truffles are going to go inside? 

755
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,640
Yeah, so it's going to be like a little hoop 

756
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,760
with a little ball of truffle inside. 

757
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,560
It's all very enterprising, isn't it? 

758
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,280
You're going to be a very busy girl, aren't you? 

759
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,440
Sing me your ingredients, Beca. 

760
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,880
- # Banana, banana!
- Banana! 

761
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,280
- # But isn't it sponge...
- Sponge! 
- ..and then banana? 

762
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,600
# Sponge, chocolate buttons 

763
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,560
- # Chocolate buttons! 
- Chocolate buttons!
- Caramel 

764
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,560
# Ground up something or other I don't know what that is 

765
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,360
- # It's ground banana chips! 
- Ground banana chips!
- # 

766
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,920
I'm not sure if I'm on track. 

767
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,720
We've only got an hour and a half left, there's so much to do. 

768
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,040
Before the challenge was given, I'd never made an opera cake, 

769
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,960
but it's something that I've come to quite like, even though 

770
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,320
it's quite a fiddly thing, which is not usually what I go for. 

771
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,960
Number three is about to come out. 

772
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,160
I am taking over cake corner. 

773
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,400
Mine. All mine. 

774
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,240
Some fascinating flavours going on, what we saw with Kimberley, 

775
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,200
she's going for the passion fruit and lime, 

776
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,640
if I was going to do it, I'd probably go down that route too. 

777
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,480
I think she knows exactly what she's doing. 

778
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,400
If everything goes to plan, she'll be all right. 

779
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,240
Frances, she's gone for the lavender. 

780
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,640
Now, I have a bit of an issue with this, 

781
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,120
that lavender could kill or make that dish. 

782
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:15,440
She's trying to make it very French. It could do well. 

783
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,440
Beca's banoffee pie. 

784
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,760
What I'm worried about is that banana flavour, 

785
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,840
she's using banana essence, which I've never used before. 

786
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,600
She's made wonderful caramel, 

787
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,080
her sponges are good, 

788
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,720
but are those layers going to have style and class? 

789
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,760
Now, Ruby. She's making praline but she's also using chocolate, 

790
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,920
using saffron as well, I'm not quite sure against those other 

791
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,800
flavours what that'll bring to the table at all, you know. 

792
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,000
She's usually so good on her flavours, it could work. 

793
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,520
This is for the syrup that you brush the sponges with. 

794
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,800
Put a bit of saffron in there for good measure. 

795
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,760
Just to spite Paul, who thinks it's not going to work. 

796
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,120
The opera cake story began in Paris, 

797
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,480
with the opening of the beautiful Palais Garnier, 

798
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,720
the famous opera house. 

799
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,520
It was the most expensive building to be constructed 

800
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,720
in the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte III, in 1875. 

801
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,320
The opulent auditorium, 

802
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,400
holding almost 2,000 seats in four gold tiers, 

803
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,520
was a place for the French aristocracy to see and be seen. 

804
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,080
'The decadence and design influenced French patisserie too, 

805
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,320
'giving birth to this iconic dessert.' 

806
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,760
Chef, who invented the opera cake? 

807
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,360
The opera cake was invented 

808
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,560
by Monsieur Dalloyau. 

809
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,200
Dalloyau. 

810
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,680
In 1955, for le Grand Opera Garnier, in Paris. 

811
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,120
So that's why the name for the cake. 

812
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,320
There's a lot of coffee, chocolate, inside. 

813
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,480
Yeah, they decide to combine the chocolate and the coffee 

814
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,560
to have a contrast between the bittersweetness 

815
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,840
and also the acidity of the coffee, 

816
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,520
so that's why and also to keep awake. 

817
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,600
Oh, I see, so the caffeine in the coffee keeps people awake 

818
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,520
if it's a very long opera. 

819
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,160
And also, if you're looking at the layers, so the layers 

820
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,120
are really thin and remind of the inside of the opera, all the seats. 

821
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,960
- Layers by layers.
- Oh! 

822
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,560
Now, I notice this one, a little bit different. We're missing something. 

823
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,000
Yeah, because I wanted to show you, 

824
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,800
the name of the opera cake how to write on it. 

825
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,160
And you want me to do that? 

826
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,480
I would like, yes. 

827
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,480
- Right, OK, now...
- Yeah. 

828
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,800
It's a bit like a fruit, 

829
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,040
a rather stout fruit. 

830
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,240
Oh, don't shout at me please, chef. 

831
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,760
Oh, no, it's a Z! 

832
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,320
What's happening? Hang on, there we go. 

833
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,880
That's weak. 

834
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,880
- Yeah, it's not really easy, you know.
- No! 

835
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,640
No, it's fine, the most important question is can you read it, 

836
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,040
- yes or no?
- Yes. 

837
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,640
- So the job is there.
- Job's done. 

838
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,240
Good. 

839
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,920
Bakers, that's halfway, you're halfway through the opera. 

840
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:10,600
I'm going to start my construction because I will feel better 

841
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:15,520
in my soul knowing that I've got something together. 

842
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,440
Precision is key. 

843
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,560
I'm going to assemble the cake in the frame because it helps keep the 

844
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,160
shape and it helps when I'm piping 

845
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,400
and the buttercream gives me a neater finish, 

846
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,880
so I may not need to trim much off on some of the sides. 

847
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,720
Each layer should be equally thin and even. 

848
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,000
I just want to get the buttercream really levelled, 

849
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,240
because when I made one at home, somehow the buttercream 

850
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,840
was at a very steep incline towards one side of the cake. 

851
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,720
This is a banana buttercream. 

852
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,640
This is the middle layer of ganache, 

853
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,640
there's still one more layer of sponge, buttercream and chocolate 

854
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,840
to go on, I'm just going to put it in the freezer for five minutes. 

855
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,480
By firming up the individual elements, 

856
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,960
the bakers can build the distinct layers of their opera cake. 

857
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,920
This is the top layer, the decorative layer. 

858
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,600
I'm going to pour my tempered chocolate over the top 

859
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:24,760
so that you turn it over, you should get a kind of polka dot effect. 

860
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,320
You are the only person in the room going for the soap opera cake. 

861
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,960
I'm very proud of you and your wordplay skills, always. 

862
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,360
I love a soap opera. 

863
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,480
Are you going to be moulding Dot Cotton? 

864
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,960
All right, Pat? 

865
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,400
Frank. Janine! 

866
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,080
- Janine!
- Janine! 

867
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,360
SHE HUMS EASTENDERS' THEME 

868
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:52,360
Lady bakers, you have got half an hour to get your fans 

869
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,920
and binoculars ready, you're going to the opera in 30 minutes. 

870
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,680
Really? 

871
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,120
Get the buttercream layers very even. 

872
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,240
Oh, I know, but they're not going to be, I can feel it. 

873
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,200
- What's going on?
- Everything. 

874
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,000
Oh, my days, it's beyond multitasking, isn't it? 

875
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,480
It's a new level. 

876
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,960
- It's uber-tasking. 
- It's a whole new level. 

877
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,480
Tempering white chocolate and I'm doing a ganache 

878
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,880
and I'm assembling my cake. Oh, God. 

879
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,320
So this is my ganache, 

880
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,480
I'm adding a dash of lavender. 

881
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,280
I'm going to put some crushed banana chips 

882
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,360
for a little bit of added texture. 

883
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,680
It's looking OK, not perfect, but you know... 

884
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,240
What opera is your cake? 

885
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,520
What's a tragedy? 

886
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,120
One minute, bakers, let there be a wailing and ganaching, one minute. 

887
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,720
You're brave to do it by eye, Kimberley. 

888
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,320
THEY HARMONISE 

889
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,680
These slightly chubby ladies have sung, bakers, 

890
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,960
which means opera's finished. 

891
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,680
Time to move your cakes to the end of your benches, please. It's over. 

892
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,440
For one of these bakers, 

893
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,240
this will be the last time they face Mary and Paul. 

894
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,560
There's no more I can do, 

895
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,280
hopefully, the flavours are going 

896
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,640
to go down well with them. 

897
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,880
So, yeah, everything crossed. 

898
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,240
We knew you were arty anyway, but I mean, that looks very, very good. 

899
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,480
The shine you've got on that ganache as well is good. 

900
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,160
We can actually see the layers separately 

901
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,200
and these lovely sharp edges, it does look very professional. 

902
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,240
I think the flavour's OK, 

903
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,160
I'm not getting the lavender, 

904
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,360
so I then question why was the lavender there in the first place. 

905
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,480
- It could do with more lemon. 
- More lemon? 

906
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,200
Yeah, needs more of a zing to it. 

907
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,000
It just needs a sharpness. 

908
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,840
It's quite sickly sweet when you go through the layers. 

909
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,680
Considering the way it looks, I didn't expect it to taste like that. 

910
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,160
Again, concentrate on your flavours. 

911
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,320
Yeah. 

912
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,560
I'm happy with what I did. 

913
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,160
In terms of elements, 

914
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,680
I got them all in and I hadn't even 

915
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,440
been able to do that in practice. 

916
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,880
So I did what I set out to do, for the most part. 

917
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,000
The decoration's unusual, it's sort of modern. 

918
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,320
It's very effective and very different. 

919
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,240
It's a shame about the lustre on the top, the sheen's gone. 

920
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,800
It's quite matt. The layers are defined. 

921
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,320
It's always a bit of a problem 

922
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,480
when you put tempered chocolate on the top, because of that reason, 

923
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,200
as soon as you put any pressure on it, 

924
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,240
anything that's soft underneath will just fall out. 

925
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,200
All you get actually in flavour is dark chocolate. 

926
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,080
You know there's something in there that's citrus, the problem is 

927
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,000
you couldn't identify it in a million years, and that's because 

928
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,040
the dark chocolate is so strong, it's the overwhelming flavour. 

929
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:53,800
But you've certainly got some lovely textures there amongst the flavours. 

930
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,840
OK. 

931
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,240
Why can I not work at the same pace 

932
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,680
as normal people? 

933
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,400
I feel like I'm going full speed 

934
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,160
and then, somehow, I'm just behind everyone. 

935
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,520
I just feel disappointed, just so disappointed. 

936
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,720
Yeah, I mean, there are issues with it, you know that, 

937
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,400
you've got a nice shine on it, which is good. 

938
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,880
I can clearly see the various layers, 

939
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,000
not quite perfect on the side 

940
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,400
and I like to see that sharp edge. 

941
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,440
I like the praline in there. 

942
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,920
Gives us just a little bit of crunch 

943
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,800
because just the almond sponge and the creams can be awfully boring. 

944
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,760
As a whole thing together, the textures are great, 

945
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,560
the saffron does come through. 

946
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,400
Well, it certainly does to me, 

947
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,120
tastes very, very good, 

948
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,400
but it hasn't quite got the finish that I would like to see. 

949
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,480
I've always given it my all, 

950
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,760
I just want them 

951
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,120
to like the taste of it, 

952
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,000
that's the one thing I want them to do. 

953
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,160
Cos I know I can and they know that I can deliver on taste. 

954
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,520
You can see the layers, although the layers do look a bit awkward, 

955
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,280
I mean, they do look very thick, especially the sponge, 

956
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,440
- they should be quite thin and delicate.
- Thinner... OK. 

957
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,080
To me, it is very, very sweet. 

958
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,840
It's not banana, 

959
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,000
it's...artificial banana. 

960
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,840
That's what it tastes like and it's a gravelly banana. 

961
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,080
It's quite grainy in the caramel as well. 

962
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,800
I wondered how you'd get that banana coming through 

963
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,200
and it just isn't coming through. 

964
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,920
- It's a shame, thank you very much, Beca.
- Thank you. 

965
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,880
When we went into this particular challenge, 

966
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,720
we thought that Frances and also Kimberley were doing very well. 

967
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,880
Let's start with Frances, 

968
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,440
cos she did achieve that good shine on the top, didn't she? 

969
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,880
- Oh, she did.
- And the great layers. 
- And the great layers. 

970
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,520
I mean, that was the one that your eye went to, 

971
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,640
we wanted a different opera cake and that was different. 

972
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,520
It looks great, but does it taste as good as it looks? 

973
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,080
- No.
- Too sweet for my taste. 

974
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,880
And on the opposite side of the opera cake coin, 

975
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,560
this you said tasted too bitter, Kimberley's. 

976
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,720
She chose two flavours, passion fruit and lime. 

977
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,160
Two powerhouses when it comes to flavouring, 

978
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,440
both those two will bring a lot to the table, 

979
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,440
but it was going to lose every step of the way 

980
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,960
with a very rich bitter chocolate. 

981
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,360
The bottom end of the spectrum, obviously Beca and Ruby. 

982
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,960
Let's look at Ruby, it's not been a great challenge, 

983
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,640
- has she done enough?
- If I had the choice of any one of these four, 

984
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,360
I'd probably go for the flavour of that. 

985
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,360
The textures were good too, you had that praline running through it. 

986
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,400
- It's just unfortunate it looks the way it does.
- What about Beca's? 

987
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,960
I actually quite like the way it looks, if I'm honest, 

988
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,640
but the whole texture thing and flavour, no. 

989
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,360
You wouldn't really know that there's banana in there 

990
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:22,400
and it is just sweet and the actual sponge itself is very dry. 

991
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,600
I do feel for whoever goes - it's very, very tough, 

992
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,520
leaving at the semi-final stage. 

993
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,120
As you know, bakers, every week Mel and I get 

994
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,400
to alternate the role of good cop, bad cop. 

995
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,120
I get the nice part today, I get to award Star Baker, 

996
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,400
and this week's Star Baker goes to someone 

997
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,840
who's really plumbed the depths of the human brain, 

998
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,360
and they don't half do a bad sponge version as well. 

999
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,880
Kimberley, congratulations, you're Star Baker. 

1000
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,080
ALL: Well done. 

1001
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,920
APPLAUSE 

1002
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,880
And congratulations to all four of you for reaching the semi-final. 

1003
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:15,640
As you know, this is a very tough one, and I'm afraid the person 

1004
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:20,560
who will not be joining us for the final next week is... 

1005
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,520
..Beca. 

1006
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,000
We're very sorry, Beca. 

1007
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,040
Come on, give us a big old hug, Beca. 

1008
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,000
- You'll be very sorely missed, darling.
- Thank you. 

1009
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,160
THEY SOB 

1010
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,320
- Well done, darling, you should be very proud.
- Well done, love. 

1011
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,600
I don't think I need to say how upset I am, but... 

1012
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,360
..I know that, in time, I'll be really proud of myself 

1013
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,720
to get to this point, I think it's just 

1014
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:07,200
so, so close to the final and, you know, we've done so much 

1015
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,280
and I've learnt so much, 

1016
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,840
but it's just been the most amazing experience as well. 

1017
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,680
Well done. 

1018
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,320
'It's always sad when you've got to say farewell,' 

1019
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,720
she'd got so far, she'd had some very good bakes, 

1020
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,920
but today, sadly, her opera cake 

1021
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,040
just didn't have the flavour we were looking for. 

1022
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,000
You, missus. 

1023
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,680
It must have been so close between us, I just can't imagine. 

1024
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,280
I think deep down I'm really excited 

1025
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,920
about getting through to the final, 

1026
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,560
but it might take a while for me to come to terms with it, 

1027
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,600
I just hope I come to terms with it before next weekend. 

1028
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,520
Oh, my God, I'm in the final! 

1029
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:58,600
I'm in the final from biscuit towers toppling over, I know... 

1030
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,040
Oh, Lord, I actually can't quite believe it. 

1031
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:05,320
I was hoping for it so much and now it's actually happened. 

1032
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,440
I'm through to the finals! 

1033
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,800
'Yeah! Congratulations! 

1034
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,240
'Wow! That's my girl!' 

1035
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,600
Next time... 

1036
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,040
Oh, the pressure gauge has hit three tiers high. 

1037
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,840
..it's the final... 

1038
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,000
Right, this is the crucial test. 

1039
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,360
..and the three remaining bakers... 

1040
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,960
No! 

1041
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,920
..face three final challenges... 

1042
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,440
- It's the battle of the baskets, isn't it?
- It is. 

1043
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,680
Spoon, spoon, spoon. 

1044
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,200
- Oh, God.
- What? 

1045
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,760
No, it's fine. 

1046
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,600
'..but who will be crowned champion?' 

1047
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,520
The winner is... 

1048
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,680
