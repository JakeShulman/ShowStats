00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Welcome to sunny Somerset. We're putting the final touches

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,800
to our summer party with the classic ingredients -

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,440
balloons, bunting, bandstands, bickering relatives,

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,840
and three of the finest amateur bakers in the land.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,320
That's right, our lady finalists are about to battle it out to be

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,640
crowned winner of Great British Bake Off 2013.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,160
BALLOON SQUEAKS

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,840
Ooh, gluten.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,120
Welcome to the Great British Bake Off. Mild intolerance.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,960
'Last time, it was French week.'

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,040
BOTH: Mwah and mwah and mwah!

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,280
'And the semi-finalists tackled three Gallic classics. Canape...'

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,400
You are bakery rock'n'roll, Frances.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,120
'..Charlotte Royale...'

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,280
Mmm...slop.

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,800
'..and opera cake.'

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,760
It's beyond multi-tasking, isn't it?

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,080
- KIMBERLEY:
- Yeah. No, it's a new level.

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,440
Oh, God.

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,320
'It was Beca who fell at the final hurdle.'

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,240
I don't think I need to say how upset I am.

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,320
'Now, it's the final.'

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,000
Spoon, spoon, spoon.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,520
- Oh, God
- What? What, what?

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,840
'But who will be crowned champion?'

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,200
The winner of the 2013 Great British Bake Off is...

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,040
- SUE:
- 13,000 home bakers dreamt of making it to the Bake Off final.

28
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,040
Just three remain.

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,800
MEL: 'Ruby, the youngest baker this year,

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,640
'has sometimes struggled with the pressures in the tent.'

31
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,400
- Get a grip. Just get a grip, OK? 
- Thank you.

32
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,440
'Despite not always planning her recipes...'

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,680
- Are you winging this one? 
- Yeah, I am. I can't lie.

34
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,960
'..she's demonstrated an instinctive baking flair...'

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,400
That's a bit of all right.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,160
'..that has seen her crowned Star Baker three times.'

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,760
APPLAUSE

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,000
'Ruby is the wild card of the Bake Off tent.'

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,240
'I've been feeling sick with nerves all week.

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,000
'I think my strategy for this weekend is just'

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,560
don't have an episode.

42
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,120
'Kimberley has made the steadiest progress through the Bake Off.

43
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,920
'Her stunning flavours...'

44
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,560
- PAUL:
- That is one of the nicest pies I've had for some years.

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,240
'..have won praise week after week.'

46
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,200
I have to say that that is absolutely beautiful.

47
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,720
'And her extensive technical knowledge has meant

48
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,720
'she's been unflustered by Mary and Paul's recipes.'

49
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,920
I'm quite happy with that. I think that looks really good.

50
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,920
'My family and friends are obviously massively biased.'

51
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,360
They're really pleased, really proud of me and their advice has mostly

52
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,600
been "crush the opposition", which I think is a little bit strong!

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,000
'Frances has proved to be the most creative baker ever to have

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,080
'set foot in the tent.'

55
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,960
- MARY:
- They're always very excited

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,200
when you do something totally original.

57
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,880
'Her incredible designs set the bar high.

58
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,200
'But her flavours have not always reached the same standards.'

59
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,320
- PAUL:
- I love your style, but please remember the substance.

60
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,120
'Now she must deliver on both.'

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,880
- FRANCES:
- 'I need to bake my flipping socks off.

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,040
'The judges want it all.'

63
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,040
They want substance, they want style,

64
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,760
they want perfection.

65
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,600
Good morning, bakers, and welcome to the final.

66
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,040
- Congratulations.
- Yey!

67
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,640
So your first challenge, the Signature Challenge,

68
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,680
we'd like you to make a savoury picnic pie.

69
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,960
Shortcrust pastry, elaborate looking when you cut into it,

70
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,840
we'd like some kind of design inside.

71
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,400
Remember, it is for a picnic, so it should be presented out of the tin.

72
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,000
You've got three hours for this,

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,800
your final Signature Challenge ever.

74
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,200
- On your marks...
- Get set... 
- BOTH: Bake!

75
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,840
- PAUL:
- The reason why we chose the savoury picnic pie in the final

76
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,480
is because we want to see the use of pastry again.

77
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,280
It's not easy.

78
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,760
- MARY:
- Some had it under-baked, some had soggy bottoms...

79
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,080
- PAUL:
- So this has given them the second bite of the cherry, to see

80
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
if they've learnt from before.

81
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,760
The filling should be in definite layers so, as you cut through it,

82
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,040
you get all the layers and they don't spill into each other.

83
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,200
- PAUL:
- You're looking for a nice, crispy shell that stands

84
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,920
all on its own, you're looking for a beautiful golden-brown colour.

85
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,120
- MARY:
- Good flavour, good texture, good appearance.

86
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,640
They've got to be perfect.

87
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,960
- FRANCES:
- So, my picnic pie, I was thinking,

88
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,800
British weather, what do we get?

89
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,120
We either get sunshine or showers.

90
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,520
And with sunshine and showers, what do you get?

91
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,280
Rainbows. Rainbows!

92
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,960
The rainbow inside Frances's pie will be made up of rice,

93
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,880
two types of trout and five different summer vegetables,

94
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,920
all encased in a decorative pastry picnic hamper.

95
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,240
So what flavours are you using throughout?

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,400
So, there's turmeric in the rice, with also some shallots and garlic

97
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,920
and some toasted pine nuts, and then we've got

98
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,200
the roasted red peppers, and then you've got the rainbow trout

99
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,440
and there's also a layer of smoked trout to pack a bit more flavour in.

100
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,280
And then we've got green beans and asparagus

101
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,960
that I'm doing in some lemon juice, mint, dill, parsley and lemon.

102
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,200
There's going to be so much going on in there.

103
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,960
So, listen, show me your hands.

104
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,360
There's a slight wobble. How are you feeling?

105
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,000
I am nervous, I am nervous.

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,960
It means the world to be here right now.

107
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,520
Frances grew up in Leicestershire,

108
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,080
and is the youngest of five children.

109
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,480
She always loved drawing and she did art right the way through school.

110
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,200
She started making little cakes, for friends and everything.

111
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,920
She'd always have a sort of quirky play with words,

112
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,800
so it wouldn't just be a plain cake, it would be something extra.

113
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,160
Is that enough?

114
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,840
Taking part in a Bake Off has been a true family affair.

115
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,960
She's a great one for asking people's advice.

116
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,160
"Do you really taste the lavender in that?

117
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,400
"Are you sure? Because...

118
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,040
"Tell me, Dad, honestly, are you sure?"

119
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,120
- DEIRDRE:
- I'm not very helpful, cos I haven't got a sense of taste.

120
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,840
- Mum can't taste.
- It comes and goes.

121
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,520
I was kicked on the nose when I was 15.

122
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,920
"Oh, it's lovely, Fran." "What are you tasting?"

123
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
"Nothing." "Oh, that's great."

124
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,480
That's why there's no substance.

125
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,520
I remember getting these nerves before hundred-metre sprints.

126
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,280
I did once win the hundred-metre sprint and the hurdles,

127
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,960
so hopefully the same can happen today.

128
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,800
I've certainly hit some hurdles throughout this whole process.

129
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,880
'And it seems Frances isn't the only one.'

130
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,920
You're doing your lattice basketry.

131
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,760
- I am.
- Is Frances doing something similar?

132
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,720
- Unfortunately, yeah.
- Oh, man!

133
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,120
I know, I know. I'm up against Design Queen and here I am.

134
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,560
I just... I can't compete with Frances.

135
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,120
Ruby's picnic basket is a vegetarian pie filled with halloumi,

136
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,600
mozzarella, couscous,

137
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,120
sun-dried tomatoes, oregano and basil.

138
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,320
Is it a bit like appearing at a do

139
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,520
and you're both wearing the same dress?

140
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,680
Yeah, it's like wearing the same dress but the other person wearing

141
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,720
the dress is a 6'3" Brazilian supermodel, or something like that.

142
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,400
Just have to hope it goes all right.

143
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,040
- It's the battle of the baskets, isn't it?
- It is.

144
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,680
'Having done most of her baking practice at university,

145
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,160
'this week, Ruby has been preparing for the final back at her mum

146
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,000
'and dad's house in Southend-on-Sea.'

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,800
It's quite nice to be able to use a proper kitchen after

148
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,160
just being at uni and working... Basically, cooking in my bedroom.

149
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,240
It's been really lovely having Ruby at home, because we do miss her

150
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,280
when she's not here.

151
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,800
I am looking forward to being able

152
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,360
to get back in the kitchen.

153
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,640
She does tend to monopolise the kitchen.

154
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,280
She has improved, because although she works in chaos,

155
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,120
she does tidy up after herself. Before, she'd work in chaos

156
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,640
and then blissfully wander off, leaving the chaos behind her.

157
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,880
I've never done that in my life.

158
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,960
I've lived with Ruby for 20 years, and so I know she's never completely

159
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,480
happy with anything. She keeps at something until she perfects it.

160
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,360
If she was to get 98%, she'd want to know how she could get the extra 2%.

161
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,560
I think she finds the idea of winning quite daunting,

162
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,680
because she never feels that she's done as well as she can.

163
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,920
She doesn't believe in any way, shape or form

164
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,280
that that's possible.

165
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,760
I'm thinking that it doesn't look very good.

166
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,560
'The picnic pie pastry needs to be

167
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,080
'just short enough to crumble when eaten.'

168
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,520
It doesn't look the same as at home.

169
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,000
It's drier, but I put the same amount of everything in.

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,240
'But strong enough to support the weight of the filling,

171
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,440
'without being overworked and tough.'

172
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,080
This is a bit weird, cos obviously you have to be quite fragile

173
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,720
with pastry but at the same time,

174
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,960
I really need to get it fully in the corners of the tin.

175
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,800
I'm going to have to make some more. I've not got time for this.

176
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,880
'Kimberley has already prepared her pastry - all three varieties.'

177
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,040
So, you're doing a white pastry, a green pastry and...

178
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,440
- A pink one.
- A pink pastry?

179
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,320
MARY: Now, wait a minute. What are you doing with the pink pastry?

180
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,640
I'll be cutting out little pigs.

181
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,200
Pigs? Does it stay pink?

182
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,560
Yes, it's beetroot powder so it'll stay a little bit pink.

183
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,120
MEL: Kimberley's chicken and pig pie will be filled with chicken mousse,

184
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,520
pistachios, pancetta and pork tenderloin pate,

185
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,480
packed round a black pudding at the centre.

186
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,840
Practising for the pie's been fairly traumatic.

187
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,480
I had two and a half catastrophes.

188
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,720
So, if it works, it'll probably be the first one that does!

189
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,200
Kimberley grew up in East London with her mum and little sister.

190
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,440
We used to pretend we was doing a cooking show

191
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,600
when we were younger and we'd slice up the food really nicely

192
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,520
and pretend that we were being filmed.

193
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,240
Then take a little moment to be like,

194
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,280
"And now we're adding 100 grams of flour."

195
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,240
So it was a great laugh at home and I don't think

196
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,040
my mum found it really funny, cos then the kitchen would be a mess.

197
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,400
Now a psychologist, Kimberley's been juggling work

198
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,360
and practising recipes for Bake Off...

199
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,920
A lot of cake needs taste.

200
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,840
..which have all been tried by her boyfriend Giuseppe.

201
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,920
When she has good weeks in her baking,

202
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,600
there's nothing that can stop her.

203
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,400
She'll survive on two hours' sleep.

204
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,480
She definitely wants to win the Bake Off.

205
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,200
'She's worked so hard for it.'

206
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,640
- It's almost there. 
- Almost there, just one more push.

207
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,960
SHE LAUGHS

208
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,160
- We're going to be latticing? 
- We're striping, so that there'll be

209
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,440
stripes going up the outside of the pie.

210
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,680
Wowsers.

211
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,000
It did strike me, Kimberley -

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,760
our first ever winner on Bake Off was called Edd Kimber.

213
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,880
Kimber? Ley?

214
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,720
And also, my friend pointed out, the two winners after that,

215
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,120
both of their surnames start with a W.

216
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,240
Wheatley and Whaite.

217
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,920
- WHISPERS:
- Wilson.

218
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,920
'Tins lined with pastry,

219
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,960
'the finalists must prepare their fillings.'

220
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,120
'The biggest enemy will be moisture.'

221
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,960
Well, I don't want a soggy bottom.

222
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,040
'To avoid that, Ruby and Frances are cooking their fillings beforehand.'

223
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,480
That's all good.

224
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,360
Roasting the veg just brings out the flavour a bit, as well.

225
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,160
They are drying out in there, which I need, cos otherwise

226
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,800
they'd release a lot of water into my pie, which I don't want.

227
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,640
'All of Kimberley's ingredients are going in raw.'

228
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,560
So, it's chicken, a little bit of double cream, some masala.

229
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,200
There's soaked mushrooms. It's flavours that work together.

230
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,200
So...hopefully I shouldn't be too far off.

231
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,960
That's one hour, bakers! One hour left on your pies before

232
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,520
we complete the picnic theme and send in the squadron of wasps.

233
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,080
'How the ingredients are layered is crucial.

234
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,360
'Once cut, the picnic pies should reveal an attractive design.'

235
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,320
So, what have you done with that? I can see it's grated.

236
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,080
That's going to... I put it in to cool, actually.

237
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,720
I might just quickly blast it in the microwave for a few seconds.

238
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,200
- Why not?
- Quickly, she's gone to the microwave.

239
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,720
- Doesn't need it, does she? 
- I hope not.

240
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,000
That rocks. I've had about five pieces.

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,560
We're doing quite well. Do you like the mint?

242
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,600
Oh, I'm sure she won't miss it.

243
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,800
Lads, actually, we better be careful.

244
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,120
- RUBY:
- The atmosphere with the others is pretty laid back.

245
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,000
But I feel, like, on the verge

246
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,280
of a baking abyss.

247
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,800
FRANCES SIGHS

248
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,320
It's looking OK. Bit juicy.

249
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,040
Oh, Ruby, you clever sausage.

250
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,560
I think it's going to need wafting. Wafty-waft.

251
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,000
You waft the pie and I'll waft you.

252
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,680
OK, bakers, five minutes remaining on the picnic challenge!

253
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,000
I hope that doesn't HAMPER your progress.

254
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,160
I'll just be out the back.

255
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,880
I feel like it's all coming out.

256
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,160
So, you know it comes out, that's good.

257
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,760
In theory, you just tip it up.

258
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,560
Please be careful.

259
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,040
Oh, I will.

260
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,960
Uh-uh.

261
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,880
The words "cack" and "handed" come to mind.

262
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,080
Aw! Oh!

263
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,320
- Oh, God.
- What? What, what?

264
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,920
No, it's fine.

265
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,440
- It's completely brilliant. 
- I don't think that's soggy.

266
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,280
It's flaked, it's flaked. It's gorgeous

267
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,760
It's a bit juicy.

268
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,760
What I might do, just pop it on a baking tray.

269
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,920
- You OK?
- Yeah.

270
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,400
Sh-sh-sh.

271
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,920
Stop looking at the other one.

272
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,400
Bakers, that's one more minute left.

273
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,280
No!

274
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,320
Bakers, your final Signature Challenge is over.

275
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,720
Step away from the piggies, Kimberley.

276
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,760
Oh, no. What a shame.

277
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,480
It's judgment time for the Signature picnic pies.

278
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,080
- PAUL:
- I think it looks impressive.

279
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,800
I like the lattice work on the top.

280
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,760
It's a very good bake underneath

281
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,560
and you've got crisp, sharp corners.

282
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,000
It's very heavy.

283
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,640
I'm curious to see what's going to happen when I cut this.

284
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,240
- FRANCES:
- So am I.
- Is it going to ooze? Is it not going to ooze?

285
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,120
We should have the layers of all the different vegetables to give

286
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,480
a slight rainbow effect.

287
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,440
MEL: Fingers crossed, sounds good.

288
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,720
Oh, my Lord! That's amazing!

289
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Very, very neat layers.

290
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,080
It probably could have done

291
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,560
with a bit longer in the oven.

292
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,680
It's got a nice colour and I think if it was in there

293
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,880
for another five, maybe even ten minutes,

294
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,040
- it would have stabilised the walls of the pie, as well.
- Yeah.

295
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,200
The individual flavours taste very good.

296
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,720
You've cleverly seasoned it.

297
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
The pastry tastes great, but...

298
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,760
..the filling itself is fantastic.

299
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,720
- Oh!
- What's annoying is you were ten minutes from perfection.

300
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
- KIMBERLEY:
- You can lift it, I'm concerned.

301
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,920
Oh, it's gone.

302
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,960
- PAUL:
- The whole thing is...

303
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,600
The problem is, because the moisture's got inside the side,

304
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,720
it's weakened the structure of the pie.

305
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,880
That's a shame.

306
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,800
That's purely moisture coming from the meat

307
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,960
and coming from the pudding and everything else.

308
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,840
I think it looks good inside.

309
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,120
It's almost like a glue binding my mouth together.

310
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,200
SHE LAUGHS

311
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,920
- MARY:
- It's seasoned very well and the mousse with the pistachios is

312
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,120
very nice, but it's spoilt by the pastry.

313
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,440
Overall, the flavour's OK, but I think the texture's wrong

314
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,320
and, obviously, the outside was a big issue, as well.

315
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,200
- MARY:
- From here it looks just very, very special.

316
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,800
- I love the patchwork on the side, as well.
- RUBY:
- Yeah.

317
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,440
The uniformity of the lattice work is fantastic.

318
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,320
What are we expecting to see inside?

319
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,880
Hopefully some layers.

320
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,080
MEL LAUGHS

321
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,280
Can you sell it any more than that, Rubes?

322
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,040
That bake is beautiful and you've still got the crisscross all along.

323
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, there's layers in it!

324
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,080
Just look at that.

325
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,080
It never cut like that at home!

326
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,560
Don't tell me things like that, Ruby!

327
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,960
MEL LAUGHS

328
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,760
I think this is an excellent example of a vegetarian pie.

329
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,280
What a difficult thing to get right.

330
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,680
Sublime. I mean, well done, Ruby.

331
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,520
You've finally come up with something that actually looks...

332
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,960
- WHISPERS:
- ..like Frances made it. Well done.

333
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,120
Thank you.

334
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,520
It's nice to start the weekend on a good bake.

335
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,080
I have spent the whole competition dreading being compared to Frances,

336
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,360
but, actually, it was favourable.

337
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,280
I think I'd probably be in silver right now.

338
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,080
- SUE:
- 'One challenge down and just two remain in this year's Bake Off.'

339
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,120
Bakers, it's time for your last ever Technical Challenge.

340
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,560
Hooray! Unfurl the bunting, happy days.

341
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,880
Sadly, it is one of Paul's recipes.

342
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,640
- Oh.
- I'm so sorry, there was nothing we could do about that.

343
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,320
At all. Paul and Mary, with great respect, you might want to go...

344
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,720
- Goodbye!
- ..frolic in the buttercups. 
- Goodbye!

345
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,320
What we'd like you to make is something

346
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,560
never before seen on Bake Off.

347
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,360
Pretzels. Six savoury, six sweet.

348
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,240
What we're looking for is a deep, glossy coat.

349
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,360
Think Labrador at Crufts. And a dense, chewy interior.

350
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,600
We'd like them tied into a classic pretzel knot.

351
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,960
Yeah, for sure, we all know what that is.

352
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,640
And you've got two and half hours in which to bake them.

353
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,200
- On your marks...
- Get set...

354
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,480
Bake!

355
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,000
I love pretzels, but I've never, ever made them before.

356
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,800
I've only eaten one, like, once and, obviously, I've never made it.

357
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,000
Who makes a pretzel?

358
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,760
I've made bread similar to a pretzel before. I know what the process is.

359
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,440
- PAUL:
- Pretzels, Mary. The final Technical Challenge.

360
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,480
They look absolutely amazing. And I love the deep shine.

361
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,880
When you break it...

362
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,640
..if you look inside the pretzel,

363
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,240
you see the crumb structure is very, very tight.

364
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,480
Don't be tempted to add too much liquid and slacken

365
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,200
the dough off, that's the first thing.

366
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,440
Secondly, they've got to shape them properly,

367
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,600
so it looks like a pretzel.

368
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,920
And then, finally, don't under-bake it.

369
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,280
I want a nice, rich, dark colour. That's what a pretzel is.

370
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,600
It's crispy.

371
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,360
I'm just going to concentrate on making the dough at the moment.

372
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,840
MEL: 'Paul's instructions are minimal.'

373
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,320
"Add the flour, salt, yeast

374
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,720
"and butter to a bowl, warm the milk."

375
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,680
It's an enriched dough, cos obviously we've got the milk.

376
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,960
I'm just going to add the malt extract to it.

377
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,240
I'm going to let it cool for a second.

378
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,960
I think it might be a tiny bit hot.

379
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,120
If it's too hot, it'll deactivate the yeast

380
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,720
and you won't get a rise at all.

381
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,280
- RUBY:
- It says mix and knead.

382
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,560
I'm just going to knead it till it looks how I would

383
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,920
usually expect something to look. That's the only thing I can go on.

384
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,200
Paul encourages you to use your hands

385
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,800
and this is the final,

386
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,320
so it does show more skill.

387
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,320
It's quite a dry dough,

388
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,440
drier than I would usually do.

389
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,720
But I think that's because

390
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,440
it wants to be close textured.

391
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,440
You want to get the dough working as much as possible, to get the gluten

392
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,200
to...kind of develop.

393
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,040
- FRANCES:
- People say I've got quite strong hands.

394
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,640
I often give friends massages and stuff,

395
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,400
so I'm hoping the same will help

396
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,000
this kneading of the bread.

397
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,960
That is a good, fast action you've got there, Kimberley.

398
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,240
Were you a bit frustrated with how it went this morning?

399
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,240
- Maybe.
- Yeah?

400
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,160
Taking out the frustration on the old...

401
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,720
KIMBERLEY LAUGHS

402
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,680
Minimal chat, just a lot of...

403
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,640
This has to be split in half.

404
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,840
'Paul has asked for six savoury and six sweet pretzels.'

405
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,720
Making sure I've got equal halves. Beautiful.

406
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,880
I need to add to one half the zest of two oranges and the poppy seeds.

407
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,680
I'm just going to pop

408
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,960
the dough in to prove.

409
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,000
Finalists, you've got one hour left for your pretzels.

410
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,360
"One hour left on your pretzels."

411
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,840
WHISPERS: It's New York.

412
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,360
'Once proved, the dough is shaped.'

413
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,240
I can't remember what a pretzel looks like.

414
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,880
Yeah, you and me both.

415
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,320
Take hold of the ends, lift it into a U shape.

416
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,920
Right, this is the crucial test.

417
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,000
In one movement, flip the centre,

418
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,160
so that it forms a double twist.

419
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,560
Double twist?

420
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,640
It's basically dough gymnastics, isn't it?

421
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Propel and twist.

422
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,480
That's normally a pretzel shape, isn't it?

423
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,840
Is it? Is that complicated enough to be a pretzel?

424
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,960
That's better.

425
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,480
I can't...

426
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's double.

427
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,920
- Is it?
- Is that double?

428
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,360
Could've been anything, that's a quadruple twist.

429
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,720
I don't know what that is. That's just a baguette now.

430
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,560
FRANCES SIGHS

431
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,680
Was that a subtle look over your shoulder?

432
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,280
I am. I'm trying to see what other people are doing.

433
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,520
There's only one way to find out if they'll hold.

434
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,920
'The knotted dough is next dropped in a mixture of boiling water

435
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,640
'and bicarbonate of soda.'

436
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,640
Please, please. Please work.

437
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,360
'This helps develop a pretzel's unique brown crust.'

438
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,600
This just seems insane, dropping these in here.

439
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,920
I'm just wondering how long to leave them in for.

440
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,040
- RUBY:
- 26, 27, 28...

441
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,040
'The pretzels only need seconds in the solution.'

442
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,200
Hey, they've been in a while.

443
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,000
They've had a minute in total, now.

444
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,880
They've sort of...expanded.

445
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,680
They've ballooned.

446
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,920
This is not looking good.

447
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,120
These are not looking like the pretzels I like to enjoy.

448
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,760
I can't remember which needs... two slashes or one.

449
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,920
But I've started with one, so...

450
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,720
'Paul's recipe does suggest slashing the dough to help control

451
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,200
'the pretzel's rise in the oven...

452
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,120
'but doesn't reveal how long they should be in the oven for.'

453
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,080
There's nothing more I can do about the actual pretzels now.

454
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,280
Except hope.

455
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,720
Pray to the baking gods.

456
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,920
Half an hour to go. Half an hour to go on ze pretzels.

457
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,640
They're looking OK.

458
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,000
I was worried that the little arms would fling open.

459
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,520
'Whilst they're in the oven...'

460
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,320
This size looks good, they're very even.

461
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,680
They're the better ones. You can't see the monsters.

462
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,000
'..the finalists need to prepare two toppings for their sweet pretzels.'

463
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,160
I'm making the orange glaze that basically goes on the poppy seed

464
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,000
and orange pretzels when they're baked.

465
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,280
I made candied peel in suet pudding week, so...

466
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,200
The short way is just to boil it very quickly in some sugar syrup

467
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,760
and then dust it with some more caster sugar.

468
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,440
They just don't look like pretzels.

469
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,400
They're like pretzelsaurus.

470
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,960
- RUBY:
- Those ones look almost like pretzels.

471
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,400
The ones in the oven are monstrous.

472
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,240
They're desperately, desperately overdone.

473
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,120
I put them in the water for way too long.

474
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,640
60 seconds of "pretzel fun, come on". 60 seconds left.

475
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,160
Lost the accent a bit.

476
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,240
They're not looking like pretzels. At all.

477
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,400
Kim's look really good.

478
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,000
I think the shaping's definitely better the further you go along,

479
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,240
but I'm happy that they've

480
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,360
all kept the double twist.

481
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,360
These aren't looking good.

482
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,760
I've got to be honest, I don't care how I display these,

483
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,360
it will make no difference.

484
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,840
OK, this knotty challenge is over!

485
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,400
It's finished! Step away from the pretzel.

486
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,840
'Paul and Mary will be looking for a perfect knot,

487
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,880
'crisped, deep brown skin and a dense, chewy texture.'

488
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,240
We'll start with this one over here.

489
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,160
Looking at the shape,

490
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,840
there's a sort of pretzel look about it on that one,

491
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,840
although it's been in the water too long. See how wet it's got?

492
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,240
It's lost its colour.

493
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,320
Quite a tight structure.

494
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,720
There's not much snap to it, though.

495
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,200
- MARY:
- No.
- It's quite soft in places.

496
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,520
Flavour's OK.

497
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,120
Let's have a look at the sweet one.

498
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,520
That's a lovely orange flavour.

499
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,200
It's got a nice, crisp outside and it's lovely

500
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,120
and spongy in the middle.

501
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,640
These look like they've been in the water again too long.

502
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,600
Not really a pretzel shape, if I'm honest.

503
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,240
It looks more like a roll.

504
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,800
The texture's nice and tight.

505
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,120
A little bit more salt on that would have been nice.

506
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,760
A little bit more colour, as well. They're quite pale.

507
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,880
Let's have a look at the sweet one.

508
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,400
Again, beautifully shaped roll, not a pretzel.

509
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,920
We'll move on to the last one.

510
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,000
There's a sort of shape of a pretzel here.

511
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,240
It's got a nicer colour

512
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,320
because you're looking for that rich, dark brown colour,

513
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,560
Let's just see what the crisp is like.

514
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,640
Good break.

515
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,920
It's got a beautiful bake, top and bottom. Mmm. Really crisp.

516
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,680
Let's try the sweet ones. They look good. They're nice and dark.

517
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,920
You can see the poppy seed, you can see the orange.

518
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,160
Both of them have a good bake, don't they? A good colour.

519
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,560
Good break on it, as well.

520
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,760
It's a lovely texture in there

521
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,040
- and a good flavour too. 
- Totally agree.

522
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,920
MEL: 'But who has triumphed in the final Technical Bake?'

523
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,000
In third place...

524
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,480
..is this one. Whose is this?

525
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,400
Frances, they are rolls not pretzels.

526
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,640
And in second place...

527
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,520
..is this one.

528
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,920
The colour is good, the shape's getting there

529
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,440
and the orange ones were particularly good.

530
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,760
So, first place. Well done, Kimberley.

531
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,920
Well done, Kimberley.

532
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,000
It's the closest thing to a pretzel, but don't clap.

533
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,600
'I think I've done a little bit to redeem myself.'

534
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,560
Had I come second or third, I think I would

535
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,760
'have been feeling pretty much out of the game.'

536
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,640
'That wasn't as bad as I thought.'

537
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,960
It has gone better today than I thought it would.

538
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,080
'Wasn't the best Technical Bake.'

539
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,040
I'm still in it. I'm still in it.

540
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,400
BIRDSONG

541
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,840
INDISTINCT CHATTER

542
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,800
- SUE:
- 'There's just one challenge remaining in this year's Bake Off.'

543
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,360
Ten weeks ago, we were going into our first one.

544
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,120
So, who would've thought when we begun this process

545
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,760
that, nine weeks later, it would be so close to call?

546
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,920
What's your view of the challenges so far?

547
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,800
For me, Ruby tipped the scales and probably just slightly took it,

548
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,560
for the picnic pie, for her display, the flavour I thought was great.

549
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:10,320
The actual finish and the skill with which she got that crisp pastry.

550
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,160
And then she came second in the Technical Challenge.

551
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,040
I think it puts her slightly ahead.

552
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,400
I expected much, much better from Kimberley.

553
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,200
It really didn't work out, that pie, and it was very disappointing

554
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,480
because we know that she could have done it.

555
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,760
However, she then won the Technical Challenge.

556
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,600
I think it lifted her up.

557
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,360
Frances really put paid to the idea that she can't flavour.

558
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,680
She did really well with her pie and she did beautiful presentation.

559
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,680
I did say she was ten minutes away from perfection.

560
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,520
She came last in the Technical Challenge.

561
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,120
Which is why Kimberley and Frances are sort of like that

562
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,680
and Ruby's just that LITTLE step in front.

563
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,640
Good morning, bakers. Welcome to this,

564
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,360
your final challenge of the Great British Bake Off 2013.

565
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,600
It's got to be a Showstopper to end all Showstoppers.

566
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,000
Bakers, today we're asking you

567
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,880
to bake the most celebrated of cakes.

568
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,320
It should be full of love, possibly a bit of stress

569
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,040
and some tears, but only three "tears", please -

570
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,800
it's a three-tiered wedding cake.

571
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Now, it can be any size or any shape, but do bear in mind

572
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,040
if it's too small it will disappoint the bride.

573
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,960
We are looking for immaculate designs,

574
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,760
we are looking for an incredible finish.

575
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,800
This is your very last bake,

576
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,360
make it count. Very best of luck.

577
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,680
- You've got six hours. On your marks...
- Get set... BOTH:
- Bake!

578
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,400
Six hours to do a three-tiered wedding cake is quite a push.

579
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,000
Sometimes people spend six days. But no, not here.

580
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,200
You do want something that has a bit of impact on the inside

581
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,520
as well as on the outside.

582
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,680
Because you want the cake to be as memorable as possible.

583
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,200
It's not really a very formal cake

584
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,160
but it's just the sort of things I'd want if I ever got married.

585
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,040
'When you're making a wedding cake,

586
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,600
'you've got to think of the flavour combination, the decoration,'

587
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,040
you've got to think of what you're going to cover that cake with.

588
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,320
'All three tiers have got to be in proportion,'

589
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,400
every single layer has got to be perfect

590
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,840
'and there'll be no covering up of overcooked cakes.'

591
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,720
'The reason why we've set it is because'

592
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,000
you expect it to be the best of the best.

593
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It's more ambitious of anything I've ever done before. Yeah, it's tight.

594
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,320
MEL: 'The bottom tier of Frances's Midsummer Night's Dream

595
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,080
'wedding cake is flavoured with rhubarb and ginger,

596
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,920
'the middle is a lemon Victoria sponge

597
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,680
'filled with raspberries and cream,

'and on top is a carrot, apricot and orange cake.

599

'All three will be decorated with an edible take on a wedding staple.'

600
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,440
So I'm doing falling confetti. So I'm sort of putting

601
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,880
the beetroot hearts, and also mango and sweet potato, and then I'm making

602
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,040
dried pineapple flowers, so it's all using natural fruits and flavours.

603
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,280
Are there going to be fairies? Fairies on the cake?

604
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,280
- No fairies. A few bumblebees. - Aw!

605
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,400
I'm doing the polka dots for my first cake.

606
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,680
They need to be cooked first before I add them to the batter

607
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,720
for the base tier.

608
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,200
This is a cake pop mould. It's for little novelty cakes as lollipops.

609
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,200
It also obviously makes perfect spheres.

610
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,760
'Kimberley's raspberry-flavoured cake pops

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,000

'It'll be decorated with the word "love" in 28 languages.'

616
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,560
Your decorations - are you going to be covering it in sugar paste?

617
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,480
I'm making some fondant for the top tier,

618
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,680
and sugar paste for some of the exterior decorations.

619
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,320
- Detail?
- Yeah.
- The detail.

620
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,200
As you make a cake like this, Kimberley,

621
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,280
do you have somebody in mind that you're baking it for?

622
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,000
Do you know what I mean? A wedding cake

623
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,800
is quite a sort of emotional thing.

624
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,080
I haven't got somebody in mind in particular.

625
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,760
The bottom tier is my boyfriend's favourite flavour,

626
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,280
- but the top two are mine.
- Good.

627
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,000
I'm just adding the eggs to the butter mixture

628
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,680
with a handful of the flour to stop it curdling.

629
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,840
A couple of squiffy ones, but mostly pops.

630
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:37,360
- SUE:
- 'Combined, the finalists' three-tiered Showstoppers require

631
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,200
'the perfect baking of 21 separate layers of cake.'

632
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,160
I've just put a layer of the raspberry cake pops

633
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,560
and some fresh raspberries with the chocolate cake mix.

634
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,640
I can't remember exactly how long this one takes to cook

635
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,640
and I didn't write my cooking times on my recipe for some reason.

636
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,280
I don't know why.

637
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,840
So that's all done.

638
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,680
'For the insides of their cakes,

639
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,960
'they're preparing ten different fillings from scratch.'

640
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,840
So this is the cream cheese frosting filling

641
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,880
that's going in between the ginger cake.

642
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,480
And some poppy seeds.

643
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,200
It's going to be quite a crunchy texture

644
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,200
which is going to be unusual, hopefully not too unusual.

645
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,560
I'm just making the passion fruit curd and the lemon curd.

646
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,920
It's an easy way to get flavour into something

647
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,280
without having to use loads of buttercream.

648
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,240
'Ruby's passion fruit curd will fill the delicate Victoria sponge

649
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,400
'that will top her wedding cake.

650
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,200
'The middle will be filled with fresh raspberry and mascarpone cream,

651
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,960
'and on the bottom, a lemon Victoria sponge filled with lemon curd -

652
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,480
'all decorated to represent sunset on a warm summer's evening.'

653
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,280
If you were getting married, what sort of cake would you like?

654
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,120
Quite often, weddings are just an exercise in narcissism.

655
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,720
I can't...I can't be bothered.

656
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,120
That's not to say I hate romance, I'm not that much of a cynic.

657
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,720
So, if you made a wedding cake it would just say things like

658
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,760
- "this'll never last"... 
- Yeah, probably.

659
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,040
..or "one in two marriages end in divorce", piped lovingly?

660
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,480
BEES BUZZING

661
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,240
OK, bakers, that's half-time. You should be one-and-a-half tiers

662
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,640
through your three-tier challenge. Halfway through.

663
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,680
Not...yet.

664
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,160
I'm coming out.

665
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,520
This is my middle tier - that's done.

666
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,560
The top tier will be done in two minutes.

667
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,600
Not yet.

668
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,520
It's light and fluffy but it's just a little bit fragile.

669
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,880
Hmm...

670
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,120
There's just one left in there, then they're all cakes baked.

671
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:13,720
So I'm just cutting out what will be the checkerboards.

672
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:19,000
Cut out the middle, and then you cut out the middle of those...

673
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,320
..and then, you do this.

674
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,240
- Boom.
- Are you pleased with the way the bakes are going?

675
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,520
Yes, I think I'm on track.

676
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,480
It's a bit of a difficult one to gauge because it is so long.

677
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,360
How will you feel if I announce your name as the winner?

678
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,440
I don't know.

00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,960
I'm going to go in the oven.

680
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,200
Are you trying to avoid my eye?

681
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,480
Yes.

682
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,320
It means a lot.

683
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,400
They look good. They've come up loads, which is fantastic,

684
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,080
but they're not cooked yet.

It's going to be extremely close, I would hate to be judging it myself.

695
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,280
For me, I think Kimberley, because she's been cool head,

696
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,760
steady, consistent.

697
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,760
And then you've got Frances, who I love to bits

698
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,160

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,280
worthy of the Great British Bake Off 2013 final?

703
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,800
Oops. Nothing that a bit of buttercream can't hide.

704
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,320
We've got three totally different wedding cakes

705
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,040
and original wedding cakes.

706
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,120
Frances is strong on her stylings. You know that cake,

707
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,680
regardless of what the interior is going to taste like,

708
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,240
the outside is going to be amazing - you just know that.

709
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,480
Having said that, when you talk about Ruby,

710
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,440
what she did with the allotment cake, and what she did with

711
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,880
- the picnic pie... 
- It was beautiful, wasn't it?

712
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,400
- ..was incredible. So she can do it as well.
- Yeah.

713
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,280
When it came to Kimberley's,

714
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,320
I think her flavours have generally been very good.

715
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,680
I hope this is the time that

716
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,400
she just raises the game and goes, "Bang, there you go."

717
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,800
I'm slightly concerned.

718
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,360
Ruby said that she's never used doweling before.

719
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,280
- Rod of doom?
- Yes.

720
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,200
She is 21. Very young.

721
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,040
And she's never made a wedding cake before.

722
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,600
But she's always winged it a bit.

723
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,640
Oh, I hate this bit.

724
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,920
Ooh, it's on there.

725
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,080
OK.

726
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,000

Do you reckon I can just seal a gap?

730
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,640
I'm just prepping my fruit ready to start making the confetti out of,

731
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:05,520
so we've got mango, beetroot, sweet potato and rhubarb, as well.

732
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,960
The skin for the rhubarb, when they're dry in the oven,

733
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,360
you get that lovely, shrivelled, pink effect

734
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,400
that gives the idea of a rose petal.

735
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,640
- WHISPERS:
- Sugar...

736
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,600

738
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,840

00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,360
I am having to improvise a bit.

Bakers, I'm getting married in 30 minutes.

747
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,640
Ding-dong, my guts are going to groan.

748
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,480

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,080
How are the hands?

751
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,280
Quite shaky.

752
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,400
God, it's tense as ever.

753
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,600
I'm not looking round, I'm just... This is race day.

754
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,840
I've still got to put this strip on, put the letters on top

755
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,000
and, ideally, try and get some quilting in.

756
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,920
But I think there'll be a little bit of compromising going on now.

757
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,440
Oh, look...

758
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,960
MEL: Baker finalists, you've got ten minutes.

759
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,320
God, there's loads of it still!

760
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,800
I think it will work. I think it will stay. I hope it does.

00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,400
One more minute left of Bake Off 2013.

764
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,680
I'm not...going...to finish.

765
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,560
Oh, the pressure gauge has hit three tiers high.

766
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,000
I feel so ill.

767
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,360
That's not going to work, is it?

768
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,560
OK, that's it!

769
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,840
We're done. Step away from your cakes.

770
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,320
The final challenge of Bake Off 2013 is over.

773
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,560
Ruby, do you want to bring your final Showstopper up?

774
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,240
RUBY: 'I thought it'd be kind of frustrating,

775
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,720
'it being out of my hands now,'

776
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,080
but, actually, it's a relief. I've spent ten weeks

777
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,560
'intensively baking and now it's up to Paul and Mary.'

778
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,160
I'm not sure that the whole colour of the cake works

779
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,040
because it's not uniform enough, it needs to unify around something.

780
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,360
You've come through with techniques and skills that you've built up

781
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,920
over the weeks, and I think we've only seen moulding.

782
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,760
If we saw one or two other things, the cake would look smarter.

783
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,200
Right, we'll start with the top one, which is the passion fruit.

784
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,120
Looks good, Mary, doesn't it?

785
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,920
It does taste absolutely scrumptious.

786
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,360
It's the sort of cake

787
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,280
that you could serve as the luxury pudding at a wedding,

788
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,280
perhaps with fresh strawberries.

789
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,600
- And this one is the raspberry.
- Yeah.

790
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,640
Looking at the colour there, it looks quite dark.

791
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,680
- Your cake's too dry.
- Mm-hm. 
- I think it's over-baked.

792
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,600
The filling is lovely,

793
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,520
but you can't go wrong with mascarpone and fresh raspberries.

794
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,080
And the bottom one?

795
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,160
That's just lemon.

796
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,680
There's a nice amount in there

797
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,840
but I would like it just a little bit more lemony.

798
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,480
I mean, you can taste the lemon, the flavour's not bad.

799
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,120
Cream in the middle lightens it up

800
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,680
but it's down to the sponge again, it's over-baked.

801
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,360
I know where your skills lie in baking.

802
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,000
But I think, on this particular one,

803
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,240
your flavours are good

804
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,000
but your cakes are over-baked and the icing is just wrong.

805
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,520
Oh... I've gone numb. I've gone absolutely numb.

806
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,040
'I just so wanted the last bake to go well.'

807
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,600
Come on, push those guns. You can do it, big boy.

808
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,720
That's a heavy cake.

809
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,800
'This whole process,'

810
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,960
I've learnt so much

811
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,840
and I think all those elements came together today.

812
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,160
Well, it's certainly very original.

813
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,720
That is so pretty, it's so effective,

814
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:55,360
every little bit is edible. But I'm round the back here

815
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,640
and there's absolutely nothing round here.

816
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,480
I think we should have had our confetti swirling around.

817
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,280
It's got a strong contemporary feel, I think it's attractive.

818
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,680
I'm dying to look into the top. So what is in the top one again?

819
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:13,360
So it's carrot and orange with pistachios and apricots inside.

820
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,720
You've got all the spices right. The icing -

821
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,680
I could have done with a little bit more sharpness. It's very sweet.

822
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,280
- What's in this? 
- So this is a Victoria lemon sponge.

823
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,680
It's moist, it's well baked,

824
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,280
very nice with the raspberries and cream.

825
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,280
The cut, it looks most attractive, and it tastes very good.

826
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,320
It does taste very good, the bake on it is very good.

827
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,280
And now we come to your rhubarb one?

828
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,920
Ginger and rhubarb, Mary, yes.

829
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,120
Ginger and rhubarb. This looks interesting.

830
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,840
It's moist, it's a nice ginger cake

831
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,640
but I don't think the rhubarb actually adds to it.

832
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,800
The flavour of the ginger cake is fantastic,

833
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,680
the bake's pretty good as well.

834
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,400
Mary's right, the rhubarb's useless.

835
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,040
What's it going to do with the ginger?

836
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,360
I think the bride would be very surprised and think that this was

837
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,240
a very different cake and it would be a lovely centrepiece.

838
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,760
Thank you very much, Frances.

'I think dreams probably can come true.'

841
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,040
If you know what you want and you set out to get it,

842
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,000
I think there's always a good chance you can achieve that.

843
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,520
Otherwise, what's the point?

844
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,280
This is the centrepiece of the wedding,

845
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,480
it's the piece de resistance for the bride,

846
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,760
and I think that I'd like to have seen more skill there.

847
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,680
A little bit of piping,

848
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,240
more decoration that you've made yourself.

849
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,080
You know, you stand back from it

850
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,920
and I know what's inside and I can't wait to taste it.

851
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,120
But the actual finish,

852
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:31,040
I think, is not as interesting as I would like it to be.

853
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,280
- OK.
- We'll start with the top layer.

854
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,880
Now that DOES look tempting,

855
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,600
that lovely-looking poppy seed filling.

856
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,600
- Let's have a go.
- It looks good.

857
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,640
It really works well.

858
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,720
The whole thing tastes good, it's not too sweet either.

859
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,680
The poppy seed filling is very good and the sponge is light.

860
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,360
So can you tell us what the second layer is?

861
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,760
That's an orange and pistachio checkerboard, with any luck.

862
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,240
- Wow.
- MEL: Oh...

863
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,760
That certainly works, doesn't it? And it took a lot of skill.

864
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,480
It's well baked, nice and moist.

865
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,520
I'm beginning to feel that the outside doesn't reflect the inside.

866
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,080
Remind us of the bottom layer, please.

867
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,800
That's a chocolate fudge cake with raspberry spheres inside.

868
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,760
The chocolate cake is on the dry side.

869
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,800
The raspberries in there come through

870
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,760
and the chocolate's not too strong.

871
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,000
Overall, I think your flavours are very good.

872
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,840
I'm just a bit disappointed with the decoration.

873
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,400
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

874
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,280
Unbelievable shot!

875
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,120
WHISTLING

876
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,480
APPLAUSE CONTINUES

877
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,680
'As the finalists join their friends and family

878
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,840
'at the garden party...

879
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,600
'..Paul and Mary have a decision to make.'

880
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,760
So the last ever Showstopper for 2013 is complete.

881
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,760
Judges, are you clear about who's going to win or...?

882
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,360
After the Technical Challenge,

883
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,320
we'd sort of had a structure in our mind

884
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,480
and it's been turned round slightly in the Showstopper.

885
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,120
When you look at Ruby, for instance - Ruby's been very strong

886
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,600
throughout the whole Bake Off, and has natural flair.

887
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,120
We'll always remember Ruby's wonderful picnic pie.

888
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,160
The skill and the precision she used on that basket,

889
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,400
she didn't use skill and precision on her cake.

890
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,400
Her downfall is pressure.

891
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,880
It's shown today that pressure did get to her.

892
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,640
And then Frances - she has, of the whole Bake Off,

893
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,680
been criticised by us for being all style over substance.

894
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,480
She actually concentrated on the interior, the substance.

895
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,560
The flavours of each level were very, very good.

896
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,880
The outside was nice, as well.

897
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,240
She was the nicest looking cake out of the three.

898
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,000
I think she's done extremely well.

899
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,400
She's listened and learnt and she's moved up and up.

900
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,320
When you look at Kimberley, she's all about taste and textures.

901
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,320
She's shown us she's a brilliant baker.

902
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:46,800
Checkerboard stood out and her poppy seed was absolutely delicious.

903
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,480
But unfortunately when you're looking at a wedding cake

904
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,600
it has to be a HUGE impact.

905
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,840
You eat with your eyes first, that's what they say.

906
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,400
Kimberley, who's been very consistent,

907
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,800
suddenly delivers a leaky pig pie.

908
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,320
She thought it out but it just didn't work.

909
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,760
Is it that time?

910
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,040
- I've got someone in mind already. 
- Have you, Mary?

911
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,360
I have someone in mind.

912
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,560
Is it me?

913
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,160
- No.
- Sadly not. 
- Every year! Every single year!

914
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,720
Maybe next year, mate.

915
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,400
- Might be Mel.
- Just don't! That makes it even worse!

916
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,760
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

917
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,520
- Oh, it's so nice!
- Ahh...

918
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,240
Hee-hee!

919
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:47,320
Thank you so much, everybody, for coming and making this Bake Off 2013

920
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:52,080
final so brilliant. And what a lovely day in Somerset that we've had.

921
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,600
So, the time has come.

922
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,280
Finalists, if you'd like to step forward, please.

923
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,400
All right. It's a posse.

924
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,160
We know that only one can be crowned champion.

925
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:17,120
And the winner of the 2013 Great British Bake Off is...

926
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,000
..Frances.

927
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

928
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:34,840
- Oh, well done.
- Well done, honey.

929
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,960
THEY CHUCKLE

930
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,720
You did it!

931
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,760
There you are. Great British Bake Off.

932
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,600
How are you feeling?

933
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,200
Oh, good God.

934
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,280
I hoped. You know, I dreamt it

935
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:57,240
but I don't think I ever truly, truly believed it.

936
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,800
Oh, darling. Congratulations!

937
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,840
Frances is a deserved winner. When it came to the Showstopper,

938
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,960
she just beat the other two guys hands down.

939
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,520
She not only gave us the style, she gave us the substance too.

940
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,440
And that cake, actually, each layer - superb.

941
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,400
Frances has many qualities.

942
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:20,360
She has attention to detail, she's got excellent flavours,

943
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:24,480
her baking improved as each week went by.

944
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,920
We're very proud of her.

945
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,080
KIMBERLEY: '2013 will be the year

946
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,960
'that I took part in this amazing programme'

947
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,960
and met some of the most amazing people.

948
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,440
Yeah, I just had a lot of fun in Somerset.

949
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,480
'This is something that I never would have done at one point

950
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,160
'and I just kind of took a leap and it's been amazing.'

951
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,600
Something to be proud of.

952
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,440
I'm so proud of you.

953
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,800
Oh, well done.

954
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,160
I'm just over the moon, absolutely. I don't think I'm going to

955
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,920
really realise exactly what's hit me for a few days.

956
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,000
But right now, I just feel on cloud nine.

957
