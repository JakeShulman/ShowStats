1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,400
Over ten weeks, 

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,600
13 of Britain's best amateur bakers 

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,240
took to the tent to whisk, mix, and knead 

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,520
in an attempt to win The Great British Bake Off. 

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,840
I'm bending down to have a look 

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,320
because I'm waiting for my pie to cook! 

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,480
Each week, they faced three challenges. 

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,040
The Signature, which showcased their creativity and individuality... 

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,120
I know what I'm doing, but I don't necessarily know why I'm doing it. 

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,680
..the tricky Technical, where their knowledge, 

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,480
skill and intuition were tested... 

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,400
To weigh or not to weigh? 

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,520
..and the Showstopper, that had to astound, amaze, and delight. 

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,680
Demanding only the highest standards were our resident judges, 

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,080
Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry. 

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,720
That crumble on the top with nuts is a lovely surprise. 

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,600
One of my pet hates is a soggy bottom. 

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,480
You've managed to get a soggy top. 

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,840
But now, Mary and Paul are back to take over the tent. 

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,960
The masterclasses are a chance for Mary and I to show you exactly how 

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,160
to do all the techniques and follow the recipes stage by stage. 

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,160
The challenges get more difficult, but Paul and I are here 

23
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,200
to show you every trick in the book. 

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,000
Coming up - Mary Berry treats us to her all-time favourite recipe. 

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,600
A tantalising tipsy trifle, packed with Swiss roll sponge and pears, 

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,560
topped off with delicious home-made custard, fresh cream, and cherries. 

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,280
A French classic, illes flottantes - 

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,240
moreish meringues floating on a sea of creme anglaise, 

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,200
topped with spun sugar. 

30
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,240
A family fruit pie bursting with apricots and almonds, 

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,120
covered in a sweet shortcrust pastry. 

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,280
Paul shows how to bake the best British egg custard tart, 

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,280
made with a sweet shortcrust pastry, 

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,560
and topped with fresh nutmeg. 

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,200
And he takes us through a spectacular, showstopping 

36
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,840
filo pie centrepiece - spanakopita, 

37
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,400
filled with rich feta cheese and spinach. 

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,520
And if you've ever wanted a child-friendly way 

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,760
of icing fairy cakes, 

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,040
or wondered how to blind bake pastry, 

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,400
Mary and Paul will show you how to get wonderful results 

42
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,640
every time with their quick tips. 

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,640
Mary and I will take you step by step through each recipe. 

44
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,200
It doesn't matter if it's hard, 

45
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
doesn't matter if it's got stages in. 

46
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,000
Follow us, we will show you the correct way of doing it 

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,080
so you can impress all your friends. 

48
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,520
As the weeks progressed, the challenges got harder and harder. 

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,080
Week three's Signature Bake was an opportunity for the bakers to 

50
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,640
showcase a family recipe, asking for their take on a classic dessert. 

51
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,440
Paul and Mary would really love you to make your favourite trifle. 

52
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,280
Now, this could be anything ranging from a Scottish tipsy laird, 

53
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,400
whatever that is, to an Italian zuppa inglese, 

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
to Mary's own personal favourite, 

55
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,880
which is, of course the rum, whiskey, vodka, sherry trifle. 

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,840
So, bakers... 

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,440
on your marks... 

58
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,640
- Get set! BOTH:
- Bake! 

59
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,640
I'm going to be making, like, a tropical trifle. 

60
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,280
And I'm making the custard out of coconut milk. 

61
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Now, yours has no alcohol in? 

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,480
No. I'm Muslim, so I don't use alcohol at all, 

63
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,280
but I was hoping that the lemon curd 

64
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,240
would sort of compensate for that sharpness. 

65
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
The trifle is raspberry and almond trifle. 

66
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,240
There's an almond boudoir biscuit, which will be 

67
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,360
soaked in the lovely Amaretto. 

68
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,320
Mary's Tipsy Trifle has layers of sherry-soaked sponge, 

69
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,520
Ratafia biscuits and pears, 

70
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,400
topped with custard and fresh cream. 

71
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,880
This is my family favourite trifle. 

72
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,440
I'm going to put pears in it, 

73
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,520
I'm going to soak it in sherry, and then I'm going to put... 

74
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,280
When you say "soak," it's going to be, like, half a bottle? 

75
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,360
No. It's just enough to give a nice flavour. 

76
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,240
You, you're winding me up! 

77
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,120
Then on top of that, a nice layer of vanilla custard, home-made. 

78
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,920
No jelly, Mary? 

79
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,920
No. I sometimes put jelly in if I'm doing it for the children. 

80
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,280
But, for me, a trifle's not a trifle without jelly. 

81
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,240
Well, I'm doing my family favourite one, 

82
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,000
and it happens to be with a bit of booze in. 

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,960
- It's your family against my family.
- Exactly. 

84
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,040
- You've got to impress me now. Go on.
- All right. 

85
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,840
The thing to start off with is to line the tin. 

86
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,280
Grease a Swiss roll tin with butter... 

87
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,800
Push that butter into the corners. 

88
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,240
..and line with baking parchment. 

89
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,600
So we have a nicely-lined tin. 

90
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,280
I've now got to make the Swiss roll. 

91
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,160
To make the sponge mixture, 

92
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,640
first combine four large eggs 

93
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,920
with 100g of sugar. 

94
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,520
So, full speed ahead. 

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Whisk until light and frothy. 

96
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,280
That looks about right to me. 

97
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,240
Now, it's not as stiff as meringue. 

98
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,920
Can you see there? 

99
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,880
It's just sort of a light ribbon 

100
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,200
and sinking back in. 

101
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,720
Sift 100g of self-raising flour, 

102
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,440
folding as you go. 

103
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,240
A fatless sponge is beautifully light and it holds its shape. 

104
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,920
Whereas if you use a sponge with fat in, it will crumb. 

105
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,000
Pour the mixture into the baking tray, 

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,760
making sure the surface is even. 

107
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,920
So that's taken its own level. 

108
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Place in the oven at 220 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes, 

109
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,640
until a pale, golden brown all over. 

110
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,080
That's it. There we are. 

111
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,200
And now, I'm going to turn that out onto some sugared paper. 

112
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,600
It gives a nice crust to it and it's traditional. 

113
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,720
- You expect it.
- It is. 

114
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,920
Gently peel the paper away from the sponge, leave to cool slightly, 

115
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,840
before spreading evenly with strawberry jam. 

116
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,520
If you do it with raspberry jam, 

117
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,680
when you soaked it up with fruit juice or sherry, 

118
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,440
it goes a nasty grey colour, 

119
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,960
whereas strawberry keeps its colour. 

120
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,080
And then, it does help, 

121
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,920
to get a tight roll, 

122
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,360
press that down at the end like that. 

123
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,880
Lifting the paper, begin to roll up the sponge. 

124
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,840
It isn't easy, the first part, 

125
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,160
so just push it in and encourage it, 

126
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,520
and look down and see that 

127
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,160
it IS tucking in. 

128
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,760
So, there it is. 

129
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,360
And then, once you get going, it's quite easy. 

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Right, so, we start the work now. 

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,480
Carefully slice the Swiss roll 

132
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,120
into 14 even pieces, 

133
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,960
and use to line the bowl. 

134
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,320
I find it best to do the outside first. 

135
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,920
- And you notice that I'm putting pressure to push it in.
- Yeah. 

136
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,600
The jam sticks the Swiss roll to the sides of the bowl, 

137
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,560
making assembly simple. 

138
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,120
When all the sponge is in, 

139
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,160
it's time for the biscuit layer. 

140
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,680
I'm going to put 20 Ratafias on top 

141
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,080
and I don't want to put them in a processor. 

142
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,480
If you just sort of break them up a bit, 

143
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,320
just more or less like that. 

144
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,720
- That size.
- Crumble it? 

145
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,640
Yes, in there. And that will give a lovely almond flavour. 

146
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,600
And now, for the fruit. 

147
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,640
So, I've chosen to put pears in there. 

148
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,280
You could use apricots, you could use white peaches. 

149
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,760
We want a clear juice to go in there. 

150
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,240
Don't choose a red fruit like strawberries or raspberries, 

151
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,680
because you will lose that lovely spiral. 

152
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,960
Combine 150ml of canned pear juice 

153
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,680
with 250ml of sherry, 

154
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,760
and pour over the sponge and crumbled biscuits. 

155
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,120
That will need a little bit of help to soak it up, 

156
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,880
so just press that down to level it. 

157
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,240
Still crisp at the moment, 

158
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,720
but the juice will all be absorbed into the sponges. 

159
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
Meanwhile, I can make some custard. 

160
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,840
So, in goes the milk. 

161
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,440
To make the custard, gently heat 600ml of whole milk 

162
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,120
and 300ml of single cream in a saucepan. 

163
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,960
I'm going to keep an eye on that. It's NOT going to boil over. 

164
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,480
In a bowl, combine three egg yolks with 50g of caster sugar, 

165
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,640
50g of cornflour, 

166
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,400
and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. 

167
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,640
You could make it totally with egg yolks, but it's tricky to make 

168
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,160
and I always like to add a stabiliser of cornflour. 

169
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
But under pressure to perform, 

170
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,400
some of the bakers were finding even a simple custard hard to get right. 

171
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,120
I've got scrambled eggs! 

172
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,720
This needs to be done again. 

173
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,240
This is an ex-custard. 

174
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
You've got to be on the ball with it, 

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,960
especially with stuff like custard, 

176
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,480
which can curdle so easily. 

177
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,320
So I'm having to be attentive. 

178
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,120
I've curdled it again! 

179
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,680
It's like school dinners gone wrong, 

180
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,640
only with vanilla and... 

181
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,400
Argh! 

182
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,920
Now, this coming up to the boil, steams over. 

183
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,560
I'm not going to let it boil over, 

184
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,240
so I'm going to pour that on, and stir. 

185
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,400
To prevent your custard from curdling, gradually add 

186
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,960
the hot milk and cream to the egg mix and continue to whisk. 

187
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,560
You've done a good job there. 

188
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,160
Now, that has already thickened, but let's just put it back in the pan. 

189
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,320
Continue to stir over a high heat 

190
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,320
until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. 

191
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,200
I'm just moving that off the heat now, 

192
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,360
and I'm going to chop up the pears. 

193
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,600
Tip all that in, like that. 

194
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,960
I'm going to put the custard on while it's hot. 

195
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,480
So there it is, going in. 

196
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,720
And you can see, it's a perfect consistency. 

197
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,280
I'm just going to push that over the top there, 

198
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,320
and it should be filling in the gaps 

199
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
all the way. 

200
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,760
Cover the bowl with clingfilm and put in the fridge 

201
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,760
for a minimum of two hours, before adding the finishing touches. 

202
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,600
So, to finish the trifle, I'm going to put some cream on top. 

203
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,920
Lightly whip 250ml of cream, 

204
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,160
then spread evenly over the top of the trifle, 

205
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,920
saving three tablespoons for the final decoration. 

206
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,240
If you don't get the custard the right consistency, 

207
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,080
as you serve the trifle, 

208
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,960
it all goes into one, 

209
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,680
and you do want to be able to see all the layers. 

210
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,320
Whisk the remaining cream until firm. 

211
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,800
That's perfect. 

212
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,120
So, if you take teaspoons of this whipped cream 

213
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,120
and then just put it round. 

214
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,400
If you piped it, it would be neater, wouldn't it? 

215
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,920
Do you know, I'm not awfully keen on piping at home, 

216
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,280
and I like informal blobs. 

217
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,280
When you serve it at home and you put jelly underneath, 

218
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,480
- you can put your...pipe it.
- Yeah. 

219
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,920
To finish, topped with toasted, flaked almonds and cherries. 

220
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,760
So, ultimately, you can do whatever you want with a trifle. 

221
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,160
- That's the point, isn't it? 
- But I like that trifle. 

222
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,720
I know what's gone into it, no jelly in sight. 

223
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,600
- Come on. Verdict! 
- Hang on!
- Don't take that long! 

224
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,880
All right! Hang on! 

225
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
- Love it.
- Oh! 

226
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,520
The jam almost replaces the jelly. 

227
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,160
Not quite, but the flavour's there. 

228
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,560
- The flavour's lovely.
- Good. 

229
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,760
Well, you took such a long time about it, I was wondering what was coming! 

230
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,000
- You're through to the next round, Mary.
- Thank you! 

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,320
You're Star Baker. 

232
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,200
That's what I'd like to be. 

233
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,200
And now, Paul's tip on how to avoid a soggy bottom. 

234
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,480
This is how to do it, 

235
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,560
and it's blind baking. 

236
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,760
You start with your tin. 

237
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,400
We've already rolled out our shortcrust or sweet pastry, 

238
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,440
and you line the tin gently 

239
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,240
by pushing the pastry inside 

240
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,800
and pushing it right down to the bottom of the base of the tin. 

241
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,160
You can either use your fingers or, one of Mary's big tips 

242
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,920
is to use a piece of pastry 

243
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,120
to push inside the flutes of the tin, 

244
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,960
all the way around, to make sure the pastry is nice and neat. 

245
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Personally, I like to use my fingers. 

246
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,840
Once you've done that, just fold over the ends 

247
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,520
and then break it off with your hands 

248
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,280
by pushing across the top. 

249
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,040
There you have your lined shell. 

250
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,920
Prepare your food wrap, 

251
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,440
making two cuts straight down. 

252
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,320
One, the other side, 

253
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,320
just to make sure it covers all the tin. 

254
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,240
You'd think that food wrap would melt. In fact, it doesn't. 

255
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,080
It bakes, rather than melts. 

256
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,000
Put your food wrap over the top 

257
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,200
and do exactly the same as you did with the pastry. 

258
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,360
Make sure it's pushed in all the way. 

259
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,600
So I'm going to use mung beans. 

260
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,840
Small, they'll get into the sides. 

261
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,680
In fact, you could use rice, if you like. 

262
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,200
Anything you've got that's dry. 

263
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,840
Put plenty of those in there 

264
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,040
and put a bit of pressure in there to force them to the outside. 

265
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,040
Now, I'd bake that at 220 degrees Celsius for about 20 minutes. 

266
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,920
That will ensure that the pastry 

267
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,480
is baked all the way around 

268
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,320
and at the bottom and avoid that soggy bottom. 

269
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,040
As dessert week continues, Mary had chosen a Technical Challenge 

270
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,400
to put the bakers' repertoires to the test. 

271
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,680
We would like you to make illes flottantes, or floating islands, 

272
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,240
which are, of course, little tiny poached meringues, 

273
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,320
light and fluffy in a sea of creme anglaise and topped with spun sugar. 

274
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,680
So, on your marks. 

275
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,480
- Get set.
- Bake! 

276
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,360
Why would you even float a meringue on custard? 

277
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,480
I haven't made it before, 

278
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,000
but I know what it should look like, 

279
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,480
which is always helpful. 

280
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,440
Mary's Floating Islands - a timeless French pudding. 

281
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,400
Delicately poached meringues 

282
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,040
resting in a pool of warm creme anglaise. 

283
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,120
So, to start off with, I'm going on heat the cream 

284
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,800
- and milk, ready for the custard.
- OK. 

285
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,360
So I've got 300ml of double cream 

286
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,240
and 300ml of milk. 

287
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,840
So, equal quantities, and I'm going to put those in the pan. 

288
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,360
Now, you poach the meringue in here, 

289
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,160
so you must have a wide pan. 

290
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,400
I'm going to do six of them, 

291
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,320
- and so I've got to be able to get all six in that pan.
- Yeah. 

292
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,880
So, in goes the milk and the cream. 

293
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,960
This is a creme anglaise we're making, and that is French. 

294
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,320
It has no thickening agent like cornflour, 

295
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,760
- what we would have if we were making custard.
- Yeah. 

296
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,040
So, I've got the cream and milk in there. 

297
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,360
I now need some vanilla bean paste 

298
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,960
and I'm going to put a teaspoon of that in. 

299
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,760
You could use vanilla extract. 

300
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,440
Or you could use the bean itself, couldn't you? 

301
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,560
Of course you can. 

302
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,600
I try to use all the things that are available, 

303
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,720
and then people can use what's in the cupboard. 

304
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,400
I'm putting the lid on and turning it up, 

305
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,360
and I want that to become very, very hot. 

306
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,600
To make the meringues, start by separating six eggs, 

307
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,360
setting aside the yolks for the creme anglaise. 

308
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,120
So I'll turn this on, fast speed. 

309
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,880
Whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks, 

310
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,040
then add 150g of caster sugar, 

311
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,680
a tablespoon at a time. 

312
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,800
MIXER WHIRS 

313
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,280
I'm glad that noise has finished! 

314
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,360
How about that?! 

315
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,720
All right, OK! 

316
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,960
Right, so, I'm going to have six rather big meringues 

317
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,440
and I'm going to put them on top of 

318
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,400
the hot, just below simmering, cream and milk. 

319
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,840
And to help me do that, 

320
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,720
I'm going to shape them with two wet spoons. 

321
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,240
Now, that's something that our bakers didn't do 

322
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,840
and they didn't get really smooth results. 

323
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,360
I don't want to be the first one. 

324
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,840
I'll wait till someone else does it, see how they do it, 

325
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,600
and then I'll do mine. 

326
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,000
So it's a waiting game for me now. 

327
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,600
Is that big enough? 

328
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,440
Because it says to make six. 

329
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,040
And that's the size of the spoon. 

330
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm seeing Beca do it. She has quite big ones. 

331
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,160
For the first time making quenelles, I don't think they're too bad. 

332
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,920
Mary will be big on uniformity, I think. 

333
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,400
She's going to want them to be all the same size. 

334
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,480
They're meant to look like three-sided spoon shapes, 

335
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,880
three of them together. 

336
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,440
That's what I'm trying to achieve. 

337
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,720
So I'm going to take two spoons. 

338
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,800
They've got to be slippery and wet. 

339
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,760
So, a nice big spoon like that. 

340
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,720
The aim is to get a lovely, smooth, oval shape. 

341
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,360
If you don't use a wet spoon, you get a lot of rough edges. 

342
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,160
And I'm going to dip that in again. 

343
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,400
Into the water, because that's what makes it nice and smooth. 

344
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,480
And then, just round it off. 

345
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,240
- Can you see, that's...
- Yeah. 

346
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,680
So they're full-sized, old-fashioned tablespoons. 

347
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,280
And you just gently put those on top, like that. 

348
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,720
And don't let them slip, 

349
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,280
because you do not want that custard all over the top. 

350
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,560
- We want them snowy white on top. 
- Yeah. 

351
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,520
Repeat with the remaining meringue, 

352
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,960
placing the six quenelles into the poaching liquid. 

353
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,640
That's it. This is very, very hot. 

354
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,440
Just below simmering, and you take the lid and put it on top. 

355
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,160
And the idea is to cook them in the steam. 

356
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,920
Yep, you're poaching them, actually. Poaching them in there. 

357
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,000
Actually poaching them, and it's the steam that cooks the top of them. 

358
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,960
You've got to leave them in the steam for nine to ten minutes. 

359
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,760
- Don't look at them before nine minutes, don't let them bubble.
- OK. 

360
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,760
If you lift the lid off, you've lost the steam 

361
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,400
and they wouldn't cook on top. 

362
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,960
So, ideally, a glass lid is the best way to do it, 

363
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,440
- so you can keep an eye on them as well.
- We'll leave them. 

364
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,400
So, Paul, it's had about nine minutes, 

365
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,320
and I can see through the lid that they have puffed up, 

366
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,560
and, let's have a look... 

367
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,600
I can see they're huge! 

368
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,560
And that is because they've been cooked from underneath 

369
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,400
from the very, very hot liquid and then the steam has sealed the top. 

370
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,920
So just lift that out. 

371
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,240
They're surprisingly firm 

372
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,760
and you can handle them and put them onto a wire rack. 

373
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,280
If you haven't got a wire rack, 

374
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,120
you can just put them onto parchment paper. 

375
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,240
To make the creme anglaise, whisk together the six egg yolks 

376
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,600
saved from making the meringue with 100g of caster sugar. 

377
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,760
When pale and creamy, add to the still-warm poaching milk, 

378
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,560
whisking continuously. 

379
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
I'm going to pour that into the pan. 

380
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,920
Now, it's absolutely runny at this stage, 

381
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,600
and it's got to be watched 

382
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,440
and removed immediately it has thickened as much as I want. 

383
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,080
You're using the yolks, aren't you, to thicken this mix up, 

384
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,280
thicken the anglaise up? 

385
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,400
Exactly. And that is the tricky part. 

386
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,760
But get it right, and it's wonderful. 

387
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,560
So, Paul, it's a lighter colour now, it's beautifully smooth 

388
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,400
and it just coats the back of a spoon. 

389
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,800
Unlike the custard that perhaps you'd use for something like a trifle, 

390
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,880
would be much thicker and it would have a stabiliser like cornflour. 

391
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,040
This has no cornflour, just the egg yolks and it's thinner, 

392
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
but just coating the back of the spoon. 

393
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,680
Floating Islands are commonly topped with a runny, caramel sauce, 

394
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,240
but Mary took the challenge one step further. 

395
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,200
"Make spun sugar." 

396
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,840
- HE LAUGHS 
- So, that's what we do! 

397
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,240
I'm heating the sugar 

398
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,800
so it sticks to back of the spoon. 

399
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
And then, with a bit of luck... 

400
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,000
No, that's not right. 

401
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,600
Ruby, your face can only be described as...quizzical. 

402
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,120
You need to do less of the Dr Evil and more of the spinning. 

403
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,160
I can't. I don't know what I do with it. 

404
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,200
I don't know what temperature it has to be at. 

405
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,680
I mean, this one's ruined. 

406
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,960
I've got to wait for that to go. 

407
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,400
So what's ruined about this one? Do you think it's too..? 

408
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,840
Oh, I haven't got a clue. I don't know anything about it. 

409
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,320
Do you know roughly what temperature it's supposed to be? 

410
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,800
Absolutely not. Absolutely not. 

411
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,280
To make the caramel, melt 100g of caster sugar 

412
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,280
in a small, stainless steel pan over a medium heat, 

413
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,640
until it turns to a dark, golden colour. 

414
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,280
Got a lovely clear caramel there. 

415
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,800
Wrap some parchment around a rolling pin. 

416
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,120
And in goes the fork. 

417
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,640
Then, using the fork, flick the caramel back 

418
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,920
and forth to create the spun sugar. 

419
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,440
- I like that. Don't you? 
- You like making a mess, don't you? 

420
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,680
- Yes. Now, come on, you have a go. You finish it off.
- Right. 

421
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,200
This is a reason for doing it in the garden. 

422
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,400
- Yeah, I know. 
- Or out on a patio. 

423
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,360
Gather them all up, try and keep them as light as possible. 

424
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,600
And it's them that we'll place on the top. 

425
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,560
So, spun sugar's done, made the creme anglaise, 

426
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,440
and we've got the meringue. 

427
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,440
Here's the serving dish. 

428
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,240
Put some custard underneath. 

429
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,160
Just the right consistency. 

430
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,000
And you just put those on like that. 

431
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,960
You have to give them a bit of a push to get all six on, 

432
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,680
- because they're so big.
- Yeah. 

433
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,240
You may like to serve them in a slightly deeper dish than 

434
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,920
this, to get all the custard in. 

435
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,320
- Is that about right?
- Mmm-hmm. 

436
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,480
There we are. 

437
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,760
Pull that one a bit more forward than that one. 

438
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,600
And then, spun sugar on the top. 

439
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,960
One for you. 

440
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,000
And one for me. 

441
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,640
Looks beautiful. 

442
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,800
Nice, strong caramel, 

443
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,400
beautifully-poached meringue 

444
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,520
and a gorgeous sauce anglaise. 

445
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,600
- How easy was that? 
- You can't wait to get going! 

446
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,520
I think it looks lovely. 

447
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,120
I've been very patient while you've been making this, 

448
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,800
because I've been wanting to try this for ages. 

449
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,160
Put it underneath, on the custard. 

450
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,560
Not a bit of custard on top, we managed that all right. 

451
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,040
And, as you can see, the meringue doesn't fall apart. 

452
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,800
It keeps a perfect shape as you eat it. 

453
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,280
A little bit of creme anglaise, a little bit of the meringue. 

454
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,840
That's delicious, that. 

455
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,000
That flavour of the creme anglaise 

456
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,520
and then that beautiful, 

457
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,680
almost marshmallow-like meringue 

458
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,120
with the crispy caramel on the top. 

459
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,920
It's a beautiful dish. 

460
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,600
Very summery and very special. 

461
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,440
And really quite simple to make, if you follow a few simple rules. 

462
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,520
As the Bake Off progressed, the Technical Challenges became 

463
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,560
harder, and week four's was going to give the bakers a bit of a wobble. 

464
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,040
OK. Now, the Technical Challenge. 

465
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,680
This week, we are looking... 

466
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,560
..for custard tarts. 

467
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,200
12 individual custard tarts. 

468
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,120
You've got two hours to bake these individual tarts. 

469
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,600
- On your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake! 

470
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,360
Love custard tarts! 

471
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,520
LOVE some custard tarts! 

472
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,120
Never thought to make one, though. 

473
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,200
Perhaps I should have. 

474
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
It feels like a puzzle. I quite like it. 

475
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,040
It's quite exciting. 

476
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,120
Paul's creamy egg custard tarts are made 

477
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,920
with sweet golden shortcrust pastry 

478
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,200
and topped with fresh nutmeg. 

479
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,600
For me, it was one of my first jobs, 

480
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,000
along with... I was jamming doughnuts, I was creaming scones, 

481
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,800
I was rolling out puff pastry, and making custard tarts. 

482
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,600
I must have been 14-years-old, on a Saturday, making them, 

483
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,600
and I used to have trays and trays of these things to do. 

484
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,080
But we're going to make this one from scratch. 

485
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,160
For the pastry, put 165g of plain flour, 

486
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,240
25g of ground almonds, 

487
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,240
and 55g of caster sugar into a bowl. 

488
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,880
Normally, we wouldn't put this in in the bakery when we did it. 

489
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,800
It's too expensive to put it in there. 

490
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,040
It makes the custard tart very, very expensive, 

491
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,760
but I think it adds an element to it, a nuttiness as well, 

492
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,760
and I think it's a little bit of extra crunch. 

493
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,000
OK, this is just softened butter, 120g of unsalted butter, 

494
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,520
and what I'm going to do is just crumb this down. 

495
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,240
Just basically rub the butter into the flour, almonds and sugar. 

496
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,600
When the mixture looks like crumbs, add one egg to bind it together. 

497
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,800
Can I have a little bit of flour? 

498
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,240
If you just dip you hand in that... 

499
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,000
Yes, I've never used a flour shaker. 

500
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,680
I've always used my hands, because we didn't have one at home. 

501
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,800
I'll get you one for Christmas! 

502
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,800
I'm very happy to use my hands on that occasion. I think it's good. 

503
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,320
I'm just going to pat it down. 

504
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,720
I'm going to work it a little bit. 

505
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,840
I think, because of the almond paste in there, 

506
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,800
it's going to make this very short indeed. 

507
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,560
If you're using whole flour, then the protein levels, 

508
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,400
however small, will bind together. 

509
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,880
But the fact that you've added the almond paste to it 

510
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,920
will break that protein down a little bit. 

511
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,360
It's only a small amount, but it'll make a difference. 

512
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,040
And you can see that's all it needed. 

513
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,720
Just a little bit of smoothing off. 

514
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,840
Job's done. 

515
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,440
Now, I'm just going to wrap that and pop it into the fridge. 

516
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Right, Mary, now I need to make the custard itself. 

517
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,040
So, can you give me 700ml of milk? 

518
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,560
It should be in there already. 

519
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,200
That's already measured. 

520
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,640
- What I'm going to do with this is just warm it up slightly.
- Right. 

521
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:19,320
In the pan, and then that will go on a heat just to warm through. 

522
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,800
For the custard filling, measure seven egg yolks 

523
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,160
and 90g of caster sugar. 

524
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,400
Start off with this dissolving process 

525
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,600
for the caster sugar and the egg yolks. 

526
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,840
Right, it's halfway there. 

527
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,120
It's still a little bit grainy, but not that much. 

528
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,880
Over here, I have the milk. It's warm now, it's not boiling. 

529
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,520
- Oh, lukewarm? 
- Yes. A little bit in to start with. 

530
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,680
Melt down that sugar. 

531
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,640
- I like making a mess. 
- You are making a mess! 

532
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,840
And then the rest of the milk goes in. 

533
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,880
The more egg yolks that you put in there, the quicker it will bake. 

534
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,000
You have to understand that you're not just putting it in a bowl 

535
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,480
and cooking it, or poaching it and making a creme brulee. 

536
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,320
What you're actually doing is cooking it through in a pastry, 

537
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,480
so you've got to think of the bake of the pastry, 

538
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
the penetration of the heat through the tin 

539
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,240
through the pastry into the custard, 

540
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,040
so that's why you add the extra yolks. 

541
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,520
To give you that richness and, of course, flavour as well. 

542
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,600
So that's melted beautifully now. 

543
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,000
So that's an egg custard. 

544
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,400
That's a basic egg custard. 

545
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,120
Something Paul thought the bakers should have known how to make. 

546
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,160
Just deciding whether I should cook the custard or not. 

547
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,480
"Make the custard filling." Helpful (!) 

548
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,040
It just says, "Make the custard filling." 

549
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,920
Is "make," prepare? 

550
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,480
Is "make," cook? 

551
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,200
Is "make" just your opinion? 

552
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,320
This is what happens. 

553
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,200
You know, you just start doubting everything and stuff. 

554
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,640
- Do you feel safe, doing the technical?
- No. 

555
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,760
Is it quite nice? No? HE LAUGHS 

556
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,280
By now, the pastry should be well-chilled. 

557
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,040
Perfect. I might just pop a bit of flour on there. 

558
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,360
Grab a rolling pin, and then what you want to do is roll it out. 

559
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,480
Quite thin, because the thicker that it is on the pastry, 

560
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,560
the worse it will be. 

561
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,080
Less liquid will be able to get inside. 

562
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,200
So, once you've rolled it out once... 

563
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,880
..lift your pastry up, 

564
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,800
plenty of flour underneath again. 

565
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,720
Roll it back down, and turn it. 

566
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,920
And that's it. 

567
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,080
Using an 11cm cutter, make 12 discs of pastry to line the muffin tin, 

568
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,440
overlapping the top of the cups by a few millimetres. 

569
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,160
What you can do as well, once you've done that, 

570
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,560
just pattern it round the outside, so it's nice and neat. 

571
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,880
Now, you could also just pinch it with your fingers 

572
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,600
all the way around to give it a ridge. 

573
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,800
I think it looks professional and just gives it a nice finish. 

574
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,120
It does give it a nice finish. 

575
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,880
So, gently push them all inside the tins. 

576
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,520
It's basically a bit like doing mince pies, you know? 

577
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,880
But custard tarts are always on the deep side, 

578
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,120
so you get lots of custard 

579
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,360
and not too much pastry. 

580
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,000
- That's the same as my mince pies, though, Mary.
- Is it? 

581
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,160
I always make mince pies with these moulds because they look just... 

582
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,200
You can get more mincemeat in there, you know? 

583
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,880
There's our tart shells, lined, ready. 

584
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,000
We just need to fill them with the custard mix now. 

585
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,320
Now, here's our custard mix, 

586
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,960
- but what we're going to use is a jug...
- You need a jug of some sort. 

587
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,920
..to fill these with. 

588
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,680
Now, what you've got to do is fill them up as high as you possibly can 

589
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,640
without them falling over the top. 

590
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,320
It's essential to pour it from a jug. 

591
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,120
You can't put it in with a ladle, and if you spill a few drops, 

592
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,680
you should mop it up straight away, 

593
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,440
because otherwise, it will get under the pastry and it will stick. 

594
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,760
Exactly. 

595
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,120
Now, the final magic thing. 

596
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,560
Nutmeg. Fresh nutmeg. 

597
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,360
Critical. 

598
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:12,000
Classic custard tart would be nothing without some nutmeg. 

599
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,160
It reminds me of custard tarts. Every time I smell a nutmeg, 

600
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,560
it just reminds me of a custard tart. 

601
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,080
The last job is to bake it. 

602
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,400
200 degrees for about 25 to half an hour. 

603
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,120
And this will then cook the custard and bake the tart. 

604
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,760
What you're looking for is a small dome 

605
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,920
to begin to grow and expand with the egg yolks. 

606
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,680
That's when it's ready to come out. 

607
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,240
Not only is the cooking time and oven temperature important, 

608
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,920
but allowing adequate cooling time is also essential. 

609
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,440
How many minutes did she just say? 

610
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,120
Five minutes. HE SIGHS 

611
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,400
I don't think they're so uncooked that they'll be inedible, 

612
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,760
but they do need to cool. 

613
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,080
The pastry's too soft. 

614
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,280
How on earth do you get these out? 

615
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,560
Have not got a clue. 

616
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,240
Don't look at the procedure. 

617
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,440
- SHE SIGHS 
- Oh, dear. 

618
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,040
That's broken now, anyway. 

619
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,400
Oh, sugar! 

620
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,800
Oh, jeez! 

621
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,520
Oh, no! 

622
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,000
Look at that! 

623
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,280
OK, I brought these out of the oven 20 minutes ago. 

624
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,360
They're nice and cool, 

625
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,920
and as you can see, 

626
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,640
they're releasing quite well 

627
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,600
from the shell. 

628
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,360
Look underneath. 

629
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,400
Lovely and brown, baked all the way round, filled with custard, 

630
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,800
a little bit of nutmeg that gives it the lift. 

631
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,440
I hope that we're going to have a taste. 

632
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,040
Do you know what? 

633
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,680
I will give you the honour of choosing one of those to eat. 

634
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,200
Which one are you going to try? 

635
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,920
- This one looks perfect.
- That one? 

636
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,440
This will take me back a few years. 

637
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,040
After three, Mary. Three, two, one. 

638
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,520
Mmm! 

639
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,240
Do you know, I like them this...just warm. 

640
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,960
They're not too set. 

641
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,040
The custard's like a jelly, it's creamy, the pastry's buttery, 

642
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,080
and you can taste that almond. 

643
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,120
You know what's so beautiful about these? 

644
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,920
There's not a bubble in the custard. 

645
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,800
Just like a creme caramel, there shouldn't be a bubble. 

646
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,200
If it bubbles, it's tough, isn't it? 

647
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,080
And this is just perfect. 

648
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,320
- Well baked. They're all right, them, Mary, aren't they?
- Mmm! 

649
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,160
Week four of the Bake Off continued to test the bakers' knowledge 

650
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,040
on pastry, this time with a Signature Challenge which 

651
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,640
required them to make one of Mary's favourites. 

652
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,480
Which is a double-crusted fruit pie. 

653
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Which means, oh, yes, pastry not just on the top 

654
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,280
but on the bottom as well, and not soggy. 

655
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,600
Right, so the pastry can be sweet or shortcrust. 

656
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,040
It's up to you, you can fill it with whatever fruit you like. 

657
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,880
- On your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake! 

658
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,200
The only thing I want from this pastry today is for it to be crisp. 

659
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,280
The terror of a soggy bottom has been keeping me up all night. 

660
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,040
I eat trifle, I love trifle. Breadsticks, I love breadsticks. 

661
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,640
You know, cakes, I love cakes, but I hate fruit pie. 

662
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
So, how do I judge it? 

663
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,280
No matter what I do, I taste it and it's disgusting. 

664
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,560
Well, Mary's Wobbly Pie is a family favourite, 

665
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,240
bursting with apricots and marzipan, 

666
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,960
covered in a sweet shortcrust pastry. 

667
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,880
Paul, I'm making a double-crusted pie with apricots in. 

668
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,320
I call it Wobbly because the pastry makes little mounds on top 

669
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,680
and I'm making it from a very sweet crust. 

670
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,480
And that's what makes the mounds on top of the pastry over the apricots. 

671
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,760
So I'm going to do the pastry in a processer. 

672
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,880
Could you weigh me the flour, first of all? 

673
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,120
You'll need 225g of plain flour 

674
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,440
and 100g of icing sugar. 

675
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,000
And I want it to be particularly sweet, 

676
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,080
because if you have a sweet shortcrust, 

677
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,960
it gets brown quicker than a plain shortcrust. 

678
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,080
So that can go straight into the processor. 

679
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,640
Remember to put the blade in first. 

680
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,200
How many time have I done it without a blade in?! 

681
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,360
So, in that goes. 

682
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,880
Add 100g of cubed butter and blend. 

683
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,760
That's really fine, sort of breadcrumb texture. 

684
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,120
Sometimes you add water to a sweet shortcrust. 

685
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,720
- I'm going to add a whole egg.
- OK. 

686
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,760
Process, until the mixture starts to come together. 

687
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,160
I don't let it go on until the ball actually forms. 

688
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,400
I stop it at this and work it together myself. 

689
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,240
- That's a good idea. 
- It gives a better result. 

690
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,400
Flour the work surface and bring the mixture together. 

691
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,080
Wrap in clingfilm and pop in the fridge to rest. 

692
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,400
Right, so, this is our sweet crust pastry, 

693
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,960
and I'm going to line the tin with it and put some on top. 

694
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,800
This is a 23cm tin... and nine inches. 

695
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,200
I write on the bottom in a marker pen, 

696
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,160
because when you're in a hurry, you can't find a ruler, 

697
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,520
- somebody's borrowed it, and then you know exactly where you are.
- OK. 

698
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,680
I like a deep rim around the outside, 

699
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,160
because you get a better shape, I think. 

700
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,880
Roll out the pastry. 

701
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,400
Two-thirds for the pie base and the remaining third for the lid. 

702
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,600
Nice and thin. That's good. 

703
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,400
Then, you put that in like that. 

704
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,760
Unfold the pastry base until it covers the sides of the tin, 

705
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,600
gently pushing the dough into the flutes. 

706
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,720
- See how it takes the shape all the way around?
- Yeah. 

707
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,200
And, again, I'm pushing it right into the bottom. 

708
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,400
- You don't want it to not get into the corners.
- Yeah. 

709
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,160
So, we've completed that all the way round. 

710
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,920
I'm going to just roll out the top, ready. 

711
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,840
It's quite an easy one to work with, actually. 

712
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,440
The whole thing is very easy. 

713
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,480
It's one of my most popular, double-pastry tarts that I make. 

714
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,960
Sometimes I put pears in it. Pears go very well. 

715
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,800
You can put canned peaches in it, 

716
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,520
you can put fresh apricots in. 

717
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,560
It takes slightly longer to cook with fresh apricots, 

718
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,160
but sadly, fresh apricots are very rarely available. 

719
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,040
- It's a very short season.
- Yeah. 

720
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,480
So, there it is, ready to go on the top. 

721
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,520
The bakers had free rein over what filling was to 

722
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,200
go into their pies, and not one combination was the same. 

723
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,440
I have apple and ginger in there. 

724
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,880
I think they go well together, 

725
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,080
and in my crust I have pecan and walnuts crushed up 

726
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,400
to give it sort of an earthy sort of flavour. 

727
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,640
I'm doing an apple pie which has got golden raisins in it. 

728
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,000
It's also got pecans and walnuts. 

729
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,920
Oh, my God, that smells SO good! 

730
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,800
Sweet, buttery appleness! Yum! 

731
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,320
Cherry apple! 

732
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,160
It's just something that my mum's mum came up with one day 

733
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,360
when my brother and I refused to eat rhubarb pie. 

734
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,760
She called it cherry apple tart. We lapped it up. 

735
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,000
Because cherry apple does sound more appealing to a child than rhubarb. 

736
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,200
So, like, a mix of peach and frangipane. 

737
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,640
I remove, obviously, the stone, 

738
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,280
and then I fill that with a bit of frangipane 

739
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,360
and then I place in a whole almond to sort of replicate the stone. 

740
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
This is a very good way, at Christmas time, 

741
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,760
or when you've been icing perhaps a cake, and you've got some 

742
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,400
marzipan left, it's a good way of using up that marzipan. 

743
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,520
Anything from 150g. 

744
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,200
- Depends how much almonds you sort of want in it.
- Yeah. 

745
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,240
So you grate that. 

746
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,120
And this is a white marzipan. 

747
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,720
You can use the yellow one if you prefer. 

748
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,920
What's the benefit of using all the small pieces? 

749
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,880
- Just so it melts better in the pie? 
- It melts much better. 

750
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,240
If you just cut it into pieces, you get uneven lumps. 

751
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,560
And it's better just to bother to grate quite a lot. 

752
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,360
It's a way of evenly distributing the marzipan, isn't it? 

753
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,080
Of course it is, yes. There we are. 

754
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,640
Spread out the marzipan evenly in the base of the pie. 

755
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,600
And you don't have to bind it with egg or anything. 

756
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,040
Just leave it as it is. 

757
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,960
Drain two 400g tins of halved apricots 

758
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,520
and arrange them on the top. 

759
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,960
I'm putting them with the rounded side up. 

760
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,640
And there's a reason for that, 

761
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,000
because when the pastry goes over the top, 

762
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,800
it moulds itself like little mountains. 

763
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,200
Moisten the edge of the pastry case and gently place the lid on top. 

764
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,520
Then you just go around with your hand, pressing that down. 

765
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,160
- It seals it. 
- It seals it all the way around. 

766
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,520
So, there it is. 

767
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,960
- No glaze, no fluting.
- Really? 

768
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,120
Nothing at all. 

769
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,640
I just leave that and put it into the oven. 

770
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,120
- As it is?
- As it is. 

771
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,560
So that goes in, 180 degrees centigrade, fan, 

772
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,760
for about 30-35 minutes. 

773
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,480
Keep an eye on it. 

774
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,320
When it came to keeping an eye on their fruit pies, 

775
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,320
it was crunch time for the bakers. 

776
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,920
Pastry does look a little bit crumbly, 

777
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,680
but hopefully that's not too bad a thing. 

778
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,160
It looks very nice on top 

779
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,920
and I'm just hoping that that's replicated underneath. 

780
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,640
So I'm hoping, by boosting up the temperature, it will cook 

781
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,880
the pastry quicker and that's what I need, for the pastry to be cooked. 

782
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,360
- Is that burning a bit? 
- I think it might be, you know. 

783
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,720
I think that brown stuff is burn. 

784
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,280
Ooh, it looks nice. 

785
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,760
- Ooh!
- Is that some leak? 

786
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,520
I think it's just fat. 

787
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,560
That bit might be soggy. 

788
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,200
Do you know what, it is what it is now. 

789
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,080
Looks grand, that, Mary. 

790
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,000
It does. It's got a nice crust around the outside. 

791
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,440
Each little mound is tinged with pale golden brown. 

792
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,920
If the edge begins to catch, 

793
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,600
you can always put a little bit of foil around the outside. 

794
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,120
Leave the pie to cool, then remove from the tin. 

795
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,560
It looks as though it needs a little finish to it. 

796
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,920
I could have glazed it, 

797
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,160
but what I like to do is just a sifting of icing sugar over the top 

798
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,960
and then I'm going to slip that on top... 

799
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,800
..and then it's ready to taste. 

800
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,600
There it is. 

801
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,480
And serve it with clotted cream. 

802
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,280
Creme fraiche, I think, goes very well with it. 

803
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,640
I'd have that with any type, honestly. 

804
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,920
That looks fantastic. I can't wait to try it. 

805
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Still a little bit warm, which is fantastic. 

806
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,720
And just look at that for a nice brown underneath. 

807
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,920
It's beautiful. 

808
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,280
The pastry crumbles. 

809
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,240
You can taste that marzipan, then you've got that slight... 

810
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,440
..tang coming from the apricots. 

811
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,880
And then, again, the lid, it's a crispy lid. 

812
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,760
And with the cream, actually. That's gorgeous, that. Really tasty. 

813
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,040
And now Mary's tip on child friendly, 

814
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,080
mess-free cupcake icing. 

815
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,480
Children love decorating cakes, but it can be a bit of a messy business. 

816
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,960
I usually use something like a piping bag and tube, 

817
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,960
but if you haven't got one of those, 

818
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,160
you can use something like a ketchup bottle or even mustard, 

819
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,920
really well scrubbed out. 

820
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,640
And what you do is take the whole lid off and wash it thoroughly 

821
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,520
and then fill it with icing. 

822
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,680
And the icing wants to be slightly more liquid than usual, 

823
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,080
because little hands find it quite difficult to squeeze. 

824
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:17,280
So, do a rose or whatever you like. 

825
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,160
And if it's a bit uneven, when it's given to auntie or their best friend, 

826
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,280
they'll know that they made it themselves. 

827
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,440
There we are, a sort of rose on one. 

828
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,880
Let's have a go with a chocolate one. 

829
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,240
I find it best to start from the middle and go round, like a snail. 

830
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,320
Also doing it with this means you don't get too much icing. 

831
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,000
So often when they're doing cupcakes, 

832
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,280
there's more icing than there is cake. 

833
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,440
So, there we are. 

834
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,120
And the other one you could do a face, 

835
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,440
they could make noughts and crosses. 

836
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,840
The children, grandchildren or your own children 

837
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,680
will have such fun doing this. 

838
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,120
And no mess. 

839
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,360
Just put that to one side 

840
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,080
and it's ready to have another go. 

841
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,680
Week four's Showstopper tested the bakers on one of the most 

842
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,640
notorious of pastries. 

843
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,800
It's got to be, please, a filo pastry pie. 

844
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,000
The most important thing is that the pastry is made from scratch. 

845
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,120
It could be freeform or it could be in a tin, shape it how you want. 

846
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,920
- On your marks.
- Get set. 

847
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,120
Bake! 

848
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,520
So, my filo pie is sort of a Moroccan vegetable spicy... 

849
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,480
thing. 

850
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,320
Almond, rose and raspberry filo pie. 

851
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,120
Fresh fig and feta filo flan, 

852
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,880
which is a bit of a mouthful. 

853
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,000
I'm making spanakopita. 

854
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,560
Classic Greek pie 

855
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,160
and very delicious it is, too, when it's made right. 

856
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,240
With Paul's simple recipe for a Greek spanakopita, 

857
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,400
you too can make your own filo pastry at home. 

858
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,560
Do you like spinach? 

859
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,840
I absolutely love fresh spinach. 

860
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,440
I loathe spinach. 

861
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,520
But I love making this. 

862
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,600
- Do you really?
- Yes. 

863
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,000
It goes so well with feta. 

864
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,680
Yeah, it does. I don't like feta either! 

865
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,720
Would you like me to take over? HE LAUGHS 

866
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,920
I'll do the filling and you could do the pastry. 

867
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,360
But it's a special thing to make. 

868
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,920
I don't mind it, actually, wrapped in filo pastry. 

869
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,560
It works for me, as a whole deal. 

870
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,200
I mean, to be honest, you could put many different things in there, 

871
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,280
but the classic thing is spinach and feta. 

872
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,720
Now, to start with, I need to make the filo pastry. 

873
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,120
Measure out 200g of strong flour. 

874
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,480
There's absolutely no rush at all(!) 

875
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,520
I'm shaking like mad! 

876
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,240
Thank you very much indeed. 

877
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,640
And to this I'm going to add a little pinch of salt. 

878
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,880
- That was a jolly good pinch! I would approve of that.
- OK! 

879
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,800
And then after that, I'm going to add some olive oil to this. 

880
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,440
Add a tablespoon of olive oil, 

881
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,160
and you'll need around 120ml of warm water. 

882
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,400
Have you ever made filo, Mary? You must have done. 

883
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:04,880
I have made it when I was at college, and it was an hilarious time. 

884
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,360
We threw it about, we got there in the end, 

885
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,560
but I've never been tempted to make it since. 

886
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,080
Yes. Pour the water in, I'm just going to hold some back. 

887
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,720
Add a little at a time, until the dough comes together. 

888
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,920
So what I'm going to do is just turn it round the bowl, 

889
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,720
get all these ingredients to start binding together. 

890
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,120
It's quite a smooth, glossy dough, this. 

891
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,440
It's got no rising agent in it, as such. 

892
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,560
A little bit more in there. But this thing's going to really stretch. 

893
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,000
You have to work at this dough to get it quite glutinous, 

894
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,560
quite stretchy. 

895
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,000
So, all I've done now is bring it together in a ball. 

896
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,040
I'm going to work that now for a bit. 

897
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:45,360
In about 1966, filo pastry came and we could buy it in the shops, 

898
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,600
and I can remember going out 

899
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,200
and seeing this pastry being made here for the first time in England. 

900
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,600
- Yeah.
- And there were huge great rollers, like a mangle, 

901
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:00,480
and the factory had all women in doing it, and it went through 

902
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,000
all these mangles, and there were still people turning those, 

903
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,200
and that was about 1966, '67, 

904
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,000
and it became available in all the shops. 

905
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,520
It is, obviously, easy to just go to the shop and buy some. 

906
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,480
It's already layered, it's wafered and it's ready and it IS good. 

907
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,680
The quality of the stuff that you can buy is good. 

908
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,240
But it's also good and interesting to try it yourself. 

909
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,000
You work it exactly the same way as you do a bread dough, 

910
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,520
but because it's so small, it's easy to control. 

911
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:31,920
All I'm doing is flattening it down and then rolling up. 

912
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,160
And what you need to do is rest it in a fridge. 

913
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,520
Realistically, you want to leave it in there for at least an hour. 

914
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,320
What's happened is all the gluten strands 

915
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,920
have bonded together quite tightly. 

916
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,720
As it sits in the fridge, it just releases, so you've got more... 

917
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,080
You know, you've got more chance to spread it out 

918
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,880
and stretch it for as long as you can. 

919
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,240
So at the moment, I'm happy with that. 

920
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,160
It's smooth, it's elastic, now that it's got some tension. 

921
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,720
So, what I'm going to do is just wrap it up and pop it in the fridge. 

922
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,640
And leave to rest for a minimum of one hour. 

923
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,360
The bakers had their own ways of working the dough, 

924
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,440
but the aim was to make it stretchy, smooth and malleable. 

925
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,760
It's not only therapeutic, 

926
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,760
you can take some of your frustrations out on it. 

927
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,520
Show us your technique, then, Ruby! 

928
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,600
I'm scared I'm going to end up hitting one of you! 

929
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,000
That's all right. Do it in front of Mary, it's fine. 

930
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,320
- MEL:
- Ooh, she's got a good slap, Mary, hasn't she? 

931
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,600
Go on, you have a go, Mary. 

932
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,680
You are rotten! 

933
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,880
- MEL:
- Come on, Bez! 

934
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,200
Ooh, it's cold! 

935
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,360
THEY LAUGH 

936
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,720
Go on, give it a good slapping, Mary! Go on! 

937
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,920
- There is steel in those arms! 
- Blue steel! 

938
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,080
OK, Mary, now I'm going to start to create the filling. 

939
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,680
Could you pass me that large bowl of spinach, please? 

940
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,840
This is obviously fresh. 

941
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,880
And that will wilt down to next to nothing. 

942
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,040
- Down to virtually nothing. 
- How much is in there? 

943
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,120
There's 900g, so a couple of big bags in there. 

944
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,240
So I've got a pan here that's getting hot. 

945
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,400
You literally just grab all your spinach. 

946
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,000
And, of course, that's freshly washed 

947
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,560
so the water that's around it, that's all you, need isn't it? 

948
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,960
That will create enough steam. 

949
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,600
And, again, the moisture's inside the leaves. 

950
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,600
Now, literally, you leave that. 

951
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,720
A couple of minutes, it'll start to steam, 

952
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,400
and then it will sweat down. 

953
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,880
Once it's sweated down, we can drain it and prepare it 

954
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,920
and mix it with the feta. 

955
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,320
OK, Mary. There we have it. There's our wilted spinach. 

956
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,160
What I'm going to do is just grab this lot. 

957
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,960
I'm going to pass it through here 

958
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:38,200
and try and get as much liquid out of here as possible. 

959
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,160
Using the back of a spoon, squeeze the liquid out of the spinach. 

960
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,840
Because what you don't want to do is 

961
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,840
when you actually come to roll this thing up in the filo pastry, 

962
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,760
to have all that liquid inside when you do it. 

963
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,040
Place onto kitchen roll to soak up any excess. 

964
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,640
Well, that's pretty dry now. 

965
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,760
It is there. I think it's nearly there. 

966
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,400
Put the spinach into a bowl, adding the zest of a lemon. 

967
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,960
Little bit of seasoning in there. 

968
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,280
The spinach is going to have an inherent flavour, 

969
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,600
but obviously, you need to highlight that flavour as well. 

970
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,800
The lemon's going to cut through this. 

971
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,000
And I'm going to add a little bit of nutmeg. 

972
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,160
Now, that lemon, don't let's waste it. 

973
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,400
We could just put a bit of clingfilm round it, 

974
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,840
put it in the fridge and perhaps use it for lemon drizzle cake or 

975
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,920
a slice of lemon in gin and tonic. 

976
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,560
Gin and tonic! I knew it would come round to that somewhere! 

977
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,440
Nearly everything in there. The last thing we're going to add... 

978
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,720
actually, can you pass me an egg over there, please? 

979
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,720
And the egg will be the binding agent in this. 

980
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,320
Thank you very much indeed. 

981
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,560
And that will make the whole mixture set. 

982
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,560
Yes, exactly. 

983
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:45,920
And then, finally, we're going to break up some pieces of this 

984
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,120
beautiful feta. 

985
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,400
Do you like feta? 

986
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,320
I love it. 

987
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,120
This is about 200g of the stuff. 

988
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,440
Carry on just crumbling it in. 

989
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,000
I'm going to get my hands in there 

990
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,120
and just mix all the ingredients together. 

991
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,960
I love doing jobs like this, especially mucky jobs. 

992
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,320
This is going to be the main body of the filo pastry. 

993
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,680
OK, that's our ingredients for the filling finished. 

994
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,640
All we've got to prepare now is the pastry. 

995
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,920
A winning filo pastry should be rolled thin enough to read 

996
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,240
a newspaper through. 

997
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,960
So, I've got my home-made broomstick that my dear husband did for me. 

998
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,200
I sent him to the garden centre one morning. 

999
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,920
What I do like about this is the fact that it's quite long, 

1000
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,320
so when the sheet gets bigger, 

1001
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,440
you know you've got an even thickness to the pastry. 

1002
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,040
My battle's going well at the moment. I am defeating filo. 

1003
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,520
What I'm finding is that it takes me roughly going on two hours 

1004
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,120
to get all of these rolled out, so I need to crack on, really. 

1005
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,800
Here we go, Mary. We've got the pastry 

1006
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,360
that's been resting in the fridge for at least an hour. 

1007
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,880
It's nice and cold, and it's quite relaxed now as well. 

1008
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,080
Because what I'm about to do to it is alter its world. 

1009
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,160
I'm going to stick it through this pasta machine. 

1010
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,520
I think that's a brilliant idea, 

1011
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,080
because a lot of people have got that tucked in the cupboard. 

1012
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,800
Pasta machines are quite simple to use. 

1013
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,160
I mean, they are very useful, but no-one actually uses them a lot. 

1014
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,720
It is one of those things that you just leave in the cupboard. 

1015
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,200
A second use for it, excellent! 

1016
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,160
Here's my dough. 

1017
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,080
Just put a little bit of cornflour in it. 

1018
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:30,040
I'm going to divide this dough into five pieces. 

1019
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,840
It's like plaiting a loaf. 

1020
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:36,880
If I start taking this through on its highest setting at the moment... 

1021
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,760
Take it through again. 

1022
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,800
When you say "the highest setting", 

1023
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,160
you mean as thin as it can go or as wide as it can go? 

1024
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,160
No, this is the widest, this is the widest. 

1025
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,400
You know, the thickest it will allow through. 

1026
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,400
So, take it through a couple of times. 

1027
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,880
And then begin slowly to take it down to three, 

1028
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,040
take it through again and again. 

1029
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,360
Take it down. 

1030
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:05,120
So what you do is begin to stretch the dough this way. 

1031
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,320
You can see, it's like a strudel. 

1032
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,240
You know when you're working with a strudel, 

1033
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:13,040
the strudel itself, you should be able to read a newspaper through it. 

1034
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,960
And as I gently stretch that... 

1035
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,160
Shall I go and get a newspaper for you to have a read? 

1036
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,680
- HE LAUGHS 
- Can you hold that side there? 

1037
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,560
If you could just begin to stretch it this way. 

1038
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,840
Do you know, it feels like silk. 

1039
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,560
Yeah, I know. It's got no yeast in it, 

1040
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,160
so it's got nothing forcing air into it. 

1041
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:39,200
What we're doing is gently taking this out, 

1042
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,560
taking out the sides first. 

1043
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,280
And then what I'm going to do is just pull out the interior as well. 

1044
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,160
Nice and gently. As you can see, it's not ripping at the moment, 

1045
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,960
and if you do it gently and just wobble it, 

1046
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,560
you're enticing it to come out. 

1047
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,720
And you see how thin that's getting now. 

1048
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,520
You can actually start to see the bench through it, you know? 

1049
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,720
Repeat the rolling out process with the remaining dough 

1050
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,440
to make five layers. 

1051
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,960
How would you do it if you hadn't got a pasta machine? 

1052
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,200
Rolling pin. Rolling pin and plenty of cornflour. 

1053
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,880
And just literally bear with it 

1054
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,960
and just stretch, stretch, stretch all the time. 

1055
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,800
Brush each layer with melted butter before placing the next on top. 

1056
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,560
So, it's very flexible, isn't it? 

1057
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,200
It is. Even with the five layers on now. 

1058
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,200
I'm just going to put a bit of extra butter on it. 

1059
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,080
OK, so we've coated that in butter 

1060
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,440
and I think we're good to go with the filling. 

1061
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,440
The bakers' ambitions were high 

1062
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,720
when it came to their filo Showstoppers, 

1063
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,520
with Ali trying to impress on a grand scale. 

1064
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,880
Ali, do you need all of that bench?! 

1065
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,640
The thing is, mine is two metres long. 

1066
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,880
I'll see what I can do, don't worry. Thanks, Ali. 

1067
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,880
- Sorry, Kimberly.
- No worries. 

1068
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,120
This is all part of the DVD you'll be releasing. 

1069
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,720
This my baking fitness DVD! 

1070
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,240
Filo Yourself Thin! 

1071
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:08,560
Last one! Oh, dear! I thought I'd never get to the bottom of this! 

1072
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,360
This is the most complicated bit. 

1073
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,120
That is one large sort of filo snake you need to wrangle. 

1074
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,480
- Yes!
- Yeah! 

1075
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,720
Now we bring the filling in, which is here. 

1076
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:26,400
Pile the spinach mixture onto the pastry in an even line. 

1077
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,200
What I'm going to do is just gently fold over the ends 

1078
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,960
just to seal it up slightly. 

1079
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,000
And what I'm going to do is just roll over the top. 

1080
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,400
Again, that puts a little bit of stretch on it as well. 

1081
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,800
It's a bit like doing the swiss roll at this stage, you know? 

1082
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,800
Just going to stretch... 

1083
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,080
Hold the dough and just gently tease it there. 

1084
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,280
Now we need...I'm just going to move that paper. 

1085
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,440
- Give it to me. I'll have it up this end.
- Thank you. 

1086
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,400
What I'm going to do is just coil this whole thing up. 

1087
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,200
The end bit, just tuck it underneath. 

1088
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,200
Brush it with some more butter. 

1089
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,000
Could you get an egg for me, please? 

1090
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,680
I just need a beaten egg as well. 

1091
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,400
All right. So it's butter AND egg? 

1092
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,280
Yeah. You want that strong colour. 

1093
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,440
You want that really dark colour on top, 

1094
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,720
and it will give a slight crispiness to it as well. 

1095
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:30,080
For me, there's only one ingredient that's fantastic to go in there 

1096
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,640
and that's sesame seed. 

1097
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,000
Those are untoasted? 

1098
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,840
Untoasted, it'll roast in the oven. 

1099
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:39,800
So a good drizzle of sesame seeds on the top. 

1100
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,400
Here we've got our spanakopita to go in the oven. 

1101
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,840
We set the oven to 190, fan, 

1102
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,680
and this will go in for about 35 to 40 minutes. 

1103
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,120
Beautiful golden brown. 

1104
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,480
There we have it, Mary. 

1105
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,640
That looks absolutely wonderful. 

1106
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,000
It's a bit hot. So, what I need to do... 

1107
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,360
Very hot, lovely and crispy. 

1108
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,400
I quite understand why you put that butter AND egg on top. 

1109
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,800
It gives a lovely colour. 

1110
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,040
- What I'm going to do is place it straight onto this.
- Right. 

1111
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,680
The smell is lovely! 

1112
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,560
Smell, you can smell the feta, the melted feta, the spinach. 

1113
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,680
Gorgeous colour. 

1114
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,280
It's crispy, it's got loads of layers, full of butter, 

1115
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,280
topped with beautiful sesame seeds. 

1116
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,000
That will be delicious. 

1117
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,360
I can't wait! 

1118
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,560
Here we go, then, Mary. 

1119
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,720
Oh, I like that. I really like that. 

1120
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,080
One of the things that I think really lifts it is the lemon. 

1121
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,120
That lemon that's inside as well with the spinach 

1122
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,760
and feta, I think is gorgeous. 

1123
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,080
Just look at that! Conker-brown underneath, really good. 

1124
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,720
And I can see all the layers. Lovely. 

1125
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,320
Do you think it's better than the shop-bought filo? 

1126
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,040
- Paul Hollywood's, every time.
- Good! 

1127
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,960
Well, that's all our bakes done there, Mary, 

1128
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,720
so we're going to be back next time 

1129
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,640
and we're actually going to be hitting some very tricky bakes. 

1130
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,480
We'll have to do some practising. 

1131
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,200
Do you know what, I don't know why I'm using a fork. 

1132
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,600
It one of those things that you just use your hands for, you know? 

1133
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,520
Next time, Mary and Paul take on 

1134
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,040
five more of the challenges that they set the bakers. 

1135
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,160
Right, that's absolutely perfect. 

1136
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,440
Gosh, rich and indulgent! 

1137
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,040
But why not, every so often? 

1138
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,280
Our lord and lady of the kitchen will take you through their 

1139
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:43,000
favourite Signatures, Technical and Showstoppers, step by step... 

1140
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,840
Now I'm going to show you how to do it myself - PROPERLY! 

1141
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,560
..offering all the hints and tips, 

1142
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:53,080
so that you can achieve baking excellence at home, every time. 

1143
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,560
Well?! 

1144
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:58,040
It feels very naughty, and I'm enjoying every mouthful. 

1145
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,760
Paul reveals his own recipe for sourdough starter, 

1146
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,240
and Mary shows us how to make creamy, fresh butter. 

1147
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,920
Join us next time for The Great British Bake Off Masterclass. 

1148
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,240
I can't wait to see that sliced straight through the cherries. 

1149
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,400
Lovely! 

1150
