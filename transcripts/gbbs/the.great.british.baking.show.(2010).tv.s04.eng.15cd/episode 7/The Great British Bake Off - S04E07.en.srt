1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,520
Week seven of the Bake Off, and I think, between us, 

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,440
- we've committed all seven of the deadly sins.
- Gluttony, natch. 

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,000
Lust, I mean some of those buns are...very attractive. 

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,720
- Sloth.
- Pies, pies. Wrath, yeah, Paul's got that covered. 

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,120
Envy. Ooh, now, did Deborah steal Howard's custard? 

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,520
And pride! 

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,480
And goodness only knows we've got precious little of that left. 

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,200
Welcome to the Great British Bake Off. 

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,680
Last time... 

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,400
Ooh, no, no, it's terribly wrong. 

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,520
Sweet dough proved bitter for some. 

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,600
Oh! 

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,440
I can't taste the peach. 

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,600
And Howard's time in the tent was up. 

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,320
Oh, bless! 

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,240
It should have been me. 

17
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,320
But Ruby's sweet buns... 

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,480
They're delicious. 

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,080
..saw her crowned Star Baker for the second time. 

20
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,080
Now the remaining six bakers face a pastry marathon. 

21
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,600
It's going to be very tight. 

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,040
A suet signature... 

23
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,480
That's perfecto! 

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,680
..that brings back the horrors of school dinners. 

25
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,320
No, don't burn that bit! Grrr! 

26
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,080
I've never known my hand to shake! 

27
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,040
One hell of a technical challenge... 

28
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,280
What an ugly bunch of nuns! 

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,480
And a Showstopper... 

30
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,520
Oh, God! 

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,880
..that leaves them out of puff. 

32
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,240
This is so stressful! 

33
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,720
And with a place in the quarterfinals up for grabs, 

34
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,040
the bakers are at breaking point. 

35
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,240
- Get a grip.
- Thanks. 

36
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,960
- Just get a grip.
- Thank you. 

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,000
Get a ruddy grip! 

38
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,040
Now there are six main types of pastry. 

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,840
I bet you can't name them all. 

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,840
Oh, um, sweet crust, shortcrust, suet, puff, hot water crust... 

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,080
Choux? Yes? 

42
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,760
- Look, I'm working here, I'm busy! 
- (It's pastry week.) 

43
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,440
The fact that I'm in the final six tells me 

44
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,720
that I'm actually OK at doing this baking malarkey. 

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,560
Obviously, I got Star Baker last week, which was great. 

46
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,680
I think I feel more confident, I'm getting a bit more confident. 

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,400
The last man standing. 

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,160
Last week, I was very lucky to stay. 

49
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,640
My approach is just to get back to enjoying it. 

50
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,240
Good morning. Welcome to this Signature Challenge, bakers. 

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,080
This morning, Paul and Mary are asking for a heart-warming classic. 

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,000
It's a suet pudding, please. 

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,960
It can be sweet or savoury, should be family-sized, should be delicious. 

54
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,400
Now, your puds can be steamed, boiled, baked, 

55
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,880
but you've got three hours to make it. 

56
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,800
The sun is shining, all is well. 

57
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,480
- On your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake! 

58
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,080
This is not something I usually do. 

59
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,800
Practising this was the first time I'd ever done a suet pudding, 

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,760
and I think it might be, like, the second time 

61
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,640
I'd ever eaten a suet pudding, so it's all a bit new. 

62
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,080
It's not terribly difficult, making a pudding like this, 

63
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,040
but what you have got to do is keep it light, 

64
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,920
and it must be well cooked, 

65
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,360
because a slightly raw, heavy, suet pudding is no joy. 

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,360
Suet is the hard white fat that surrounds the kidneys 

67
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,480
and loins of sheep and cattle. 

68
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,400
Grated, it's combined with flour, salt and liquid to make 

69
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,240
a pastry that's both light in texture and rich in flavour. 

70
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,120
If they've done it well, that is. 

71
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,040
Suet pastry is old-fashioned, really. 

72
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,080
People don't make it very often. 

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,480
The mistakes will be when it comes to adding the liquid. 

74
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,840
Too much, they won't be able to handle it. 

75
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,040
If they don't add enough, it'll be too dry and crumbly. 

76
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,120
What I'm looking for is a lovely, crispy exterior. 

77
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,560
Inside must be nice and soft. The last thing I want is stodgy suet. 

78
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,600
It's revolting. 

79
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,600
I am making a big roly-poly pudding, 

80
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,720
and my pudding is baked. 

81
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,480
So it is a bit more fig roll than jam roly-poly. 

82
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,120
Criticised in the past for focusing too much on the look of her bakes, 

83
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,760
this week Frances is concentrating on flavour. 

84
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,200
Her fig roly-poly pudding has a swirl of fig and thyme honey, 

85
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,000
and comes with caramelised walnut and honey ice cream. 

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,160
So can you tell us about the pastry itself? 

87
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,400
It's actually got ground almonds in. Because I'm baking it, 

88
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,320
it adds an extra moistness and an even nuttier taste, 

89
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,760
and then I'm serving it with a honey lemon ice cream 

90
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,560
with caramelised walnuts with a hint of goat's cheese. 

91
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,600
Hint of goat? In your ice cream?! How's that going to work? 

92
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,400
I know, seemed quite controversial. 

93
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,360
I've lowered the level of goat as the week's gone on. 

94
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,720
He was out the paddock initially, 

95
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,920
so he should just be a little subtle hint. 

96
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,920
- A kid.
- A little kid. 
- A whiff of kid. 

97
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,040
- OK, good luck.
- Baa! 

98
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,200
Thank you. 

99
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,000
As well as traditional suet, there's also a vegetarian option, 

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
made synthetically from palm oil and rice flour. 

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,280
I've only eaten pastry and suet pudding all week 

102
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,200
so I'm not feeling very sprightly now. 

103
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,400
I'm using vegetable suet. It seems to work fine, 

104
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,080
it doesn't taste any different or anything like that. 

105
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,520
Ruby's vegetarian offering is a plum jam roly-poly with ginger ice cream. 

106
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,400
But this week her suet practice bakes have had to compete 

107
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,640
with a new addition to her life. 

108
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,640
This is really, really sad but actually, we got a new cat 

109
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,200
so I've just been playing with the cat all the time, 

110
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,320
so I don't want to bake - I've just been having fun with Rupert. 

111
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,960
So I always knew I'd end up a crazy cat lady, and it's finally happened. 

112
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,240
I am experienced with suet pastry 

113
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,920
because this is my husband's most favourite dessert in the universe. 

114
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Spotted dick suet pudding. 

115
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,800
I'm putting a little chopped ginger into my fruit. 

116
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,600
We like it, so I hope Paul and Mary will like it. 

117
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,200
Christine's playing it safe with her tried and tested classic, 

118
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,200
spotted dick with a vanilla custard ice cream. 

119
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,640
I'm going to do it in the traditional way 

120
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,160
my grandma used to do it. 

121
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,080
Rolled in the muslin and steamed. 

122
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,360
And you've incorporated the fruit actually in the suet crust itself? 

123
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,520
Now what I did, Mary, was, I rolled out my suet crust 

124
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,600
and put half the fruit on, rolled it again, 

125
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,880
put the other half of the fruit on, because I found when you cut 

126
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,400
the slices, you've got more dough, fruit, rather than all fruit. 

127
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,080
That's very simple, very classic, and it's got to be very good. 

128
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,840
Mary, I sincerely hope it is. 

129
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,280
Kimberley is bravely attempting a modern twist on the same classic. 

130
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,800
It's a spotted dick by any other name, but there aren't any currants 

131
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,640
in it, I've replaced those with Persian berries. 

132
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,720
These are barberries. Flavour-wise they are kind of a cross between 

133
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,040
a sharp cranberry and a raisin. 

134
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,000
I think I have issues with authority, 

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,240
I don't like being told what to do, so even when I get a recipe 

136
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,080
I kind of decide I'm going to do something else instead. 

137
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,280
In addition to her barberries, Kimberley is adding dried apple 

138
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,880
to her spotted dick, and they're not just there for flavour. 

139
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,160
That'll absorb some of the liquid as it steams and swells up. 

140
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,680
It'll help to dry the pudding out a little bit, 

141
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,520
and help to keep it kind of light and airy. Hopefully. 

142
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,080
While she's taking care to reduce moisture, Glenn is piling it in. 

143
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,760
Agen prunes, and Armagnac. 

144
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,320
If the bake doesn't go well, I'll just drown my sorrows. 

145
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,600
HE BREATHES IN DEEPLY 

146
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,400
While most bakers are making sweet puddings, 

147
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,200
Beca is attempting a savoury take on the suet pud. 

148
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,240
I'm just getting a little bit of colour on the meat 

149
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,760
just so it seals, 

150
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,360
and I just need the vegetables to be parboiled as well. 

151
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,320
Beca usually tries to incorporate some traditional Welsh flavour 

152
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,200
to her baking, and today she's making a spring lamb 

153
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,000
and vegetable suet pudding with redcurrant gravy. 

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The traditional dish in Wales is cawl, 

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,480
and it's based on that originally, so I've got the leek 

156
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,200
and the carrot and swede, with lamb inside the pudding. 

157
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,120
So the actual pastry itself goes round the outside. 

158
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,120
How do you combat all the juice coming out of the mixture, 

159
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,720
the vegetables and the meat? 

160
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,440
That's why I've parboiled things and browned things off. 

161
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,240
First time I did it I put things in raw. 

162
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,360
That didn't work - as soon as I cut it, there was juice everywhere. 

163
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,640
But this way of doing it, I know things are going to be cooked 

164
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,280
and there's not liquid coming out and it's holding its shape. 

165
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,600
OK, thanks, Beca. 

166
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,880
The bakers can shape their suet puddings any way they like. 

167
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,560
As a pie, 

168
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,640
a cake, 

169
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,480
or Chelsea bun roll. 

170
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,880
I've wrapped it in a buttered grease-proof paper 

171
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,400
and I've put a pleat in the top so that as the pudding expands 

172
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,280
it doesn't compress because it can't go anywhere. 

173
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,560
This is the pan, it's actually a milk loaf pan 

174
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,440
but I wanted to use something that would give it a nice shape, 

175
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,760
so I'm going to butter and sugar the inside of it, 

176
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,600
which helps give it a nice crust. 

177
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,560
I'm surprised to be here after last week, but happy to be here. 

178
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,480
Like all knocks in life, pick yourself up and get on with it. 

179
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,560
Glenn has often struggled with his timings, but is hoping 

180
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,240
his prune and Armagnac suet pudding will run like clockwork. 

181
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,760
This particular pudding. How much did you expect that to rise, 

182
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,280
right up to the top and be pushing against the top? 

183
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,520
Yes, I've actually got a little bit, but I hope not too much, mixture 

184
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,640
left over, because I do want it to come up to the top 

185
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,920
but also I don't want to have made a tin to keep it stodgy and stop it 

186
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,120
having the right rise, so I've had to experiment a bit with that. 

187
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,840
You're also bang on trend. 

188
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,240
That is very summer into autumn clutch bag, 2013. 

189
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,080
Well, obviously I was thinking about that! 

190
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,880
Rock the clutch, Glenn. Rock the clutch! 

191
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,200
- Amazing.
- Good luck.
- Thank you. 

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,120
Right, I'm going to pop this now in my steamer. 

193
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,200
Suet puddings can be boiled, steamed, or baked. 

194
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,760
This is just some vanilla sugar, 

195
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,360
that gives it a bit of crispy crunch like you'd find on a fig roll. 

196
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,280
And each method presents its own challenges, 

197
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,040
affecting the taste and texture of the pudding. 

198
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,440
Seal the pudding off. I'm just doing a little handle, 

199
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,920
so it's easier to get out later, because it'll be hot. 

200
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,280
That's going to steam/boil for an hour and a half. 

201
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,120
Many of our favourite puds traditionally used suet 

202
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,560
to bind the ingredients together, but on the Isle of Mull, 

203
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,120
suet binds the entire community. 

204
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,360
Sticky! 

205
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,120
The island of Mull is one of the best examples 

206
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,000
of the tradition of Scottish crofting. 

207
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,240
Since the early 1700s, 

208
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,120
families rented small areas of land called crofts, 

209
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,840
where they reared animals and grew produce to feed their family. 

210
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,560
The crofter on Mull 

211
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,880
mainly produced vegetables, potatoes and grain. 

212
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,880
Other than that, there's nothing for them to produce 

213
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,560
because the land is so bare, so hard, that they had to take 

214
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,760
a small area of land and make the most of it. 

215
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,160
As well as their own smallholding, the crofters shared communal land 

216
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,760
that was harder to farm, so was used for grazing and foraging. 

217
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,600
This shared responsibility resulted in a strong sense of community. 

218
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,360
The crofter would never be isolated, and whatever job had to be done, 

219
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
they would all turn their hand to it. 

220
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,800
Taking in driftwood, taking home fish from the catch, 

221
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,920
taking the boat ashore, whatever was necessary, 

222
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,840
they would all band together and the job was done. 

223
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,320
The community spirit affording to them was unique. 

224
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,000
Community celebrations were typically marked 

225
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,840
with a suet pudding known as the clootie dumpling. 

226
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,320
The main ingredients are 

227
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,480
flour, raisins, sugar and suet. 

228
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,720
The suet was readily available 

229
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,120
because it's the fatty membrane surrounding the kidney 

230
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,600
of the animal. In most cases it would have been a sheep. 

231
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,720
The suet prevents the ingredients seeping out into the pan. 

232
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,240
Over the years, as transportation of goods from the mainland improved, 

233
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,960
the recipe evolved and imported spices and treacle were added 

234
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,400
to enhance the flavour of the dumpling, 

235
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,040
but the cooking method has remained the same for centuries. 

236
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,760
Clootie is an old Scottish word for cloth. 

237
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,440
It's a very tight cotton cloth. 

238
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,760
The mixture is put in the middle of the clootie 

239
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,160
and then it's tied with string. 

240
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,560
And everybody's cloth is special and you look after it 

241
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,160
because you have it for your lifetime. 

242
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,600
Traditionally, the dumpling is boiled for three hours before 

243
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,400
being dried in front of an open fire. 

244
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,960
Clootie dumpling was received by many people, and still is, 

245
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,200
at celebrations, births, weddings and ceilidhs. 

246
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,320
It would be a way that a community could almost come together 

247
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,280
with a good, big clootie dumpling. 

248
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,080
45 minutes remain in the Suet Signature Challenge. 

249
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,680
That's had about an hour-and-a-half, and it only needs two hours 

250
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,200
so, hopefully, it should be good to go in a little bit, 

251
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,240
so I'm just preparing my custard. 

252
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,360
I'm really chilled out. 

253
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,120
It's mysterious, you know, week seven, 

254
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,040
I should be much more anxious than this 

255
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,360
but, so far, everything is going to plan and I've got plenty of time. 

256
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,800
As this goes on, I don't feel any less stressed, 

257
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,920
just as the standard is getting higher, as well, 

258
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,360
so you just can't be making any mistakes. 

259
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,280
That's a worry. 

260
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,720
I'm just mixing condensed milk 

261
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,920
with goat's cheese for my ice cream. 

262
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,360
I don't want someone getting a whole chunk of goat. 

263
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,160
There's a bit of goat, but he's not kicking too much. 

264
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,240
Butterscotch sauce, I don't mind a little bit 

265
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,040
of the raw alcohol flavour, so you get a sense of what it is, 

266
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,080
but I try and get it so that they'll both be happy. 

267
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,760
Enough booze to keep Mary happy 

268
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,160
but not the raw alcohol flavour that will offend Paul. 

269
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,320
Ho, ho! How good does that smell?! 

270
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,080
Hello, Christine, you're lost in custard. 

271
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,200
- Good morning, I am lost in custard. 
- What's your earliest memory of suet? 

272
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,080
My grandma doing one of these. 

273
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,680
That's my earliest memory of suet. 

274
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,400
When you're doing something like a spotted dick, which is a classic, 

275
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,080
- I've added a little bit of ginger to give it a kick.
- Yeah. 

276
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,960
- You can't change it too much.
- No! 

277
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,440
Otherwise it's not a spotted dick any more, it's something else. 

278
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,480
It's just a ginger dick otherwise. 

279
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,440
I mean, which is good. 

280
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,560
I'm just, basically, trying to get all this goodness 

281
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,080
off the bottom of the pan to go into the gravy. 

282
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,480
Our gravy is never this thin and normally there's a vat load, 

283
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,120
because in our family once you've had your Sunday roast 

284
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,120
you mop up the gravy with your bread, 

285
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,440
so this is posh gravy. 

286
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,400
Half an hour left, bakers. Half an hour on your signature suet. 

287
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,400
I'm just going to take the pudding out now. 

288
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,880
Whoops, we're breaking, which is good because it means it's light. 

289
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,320
There's quite a lot of butter running out 

290
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,720
which isn't very attractive. 

291
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,480
It looks like how it's supposed to look, I don't know what 

292
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,280
it's like inside, obviously, but... 

293
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,000
hopefully, it's all right. 

294
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,880
Oh, my God that smells amazing. 

295
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,080
Crusty... 

296
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,520
That's perfecto. 

297
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,880
That's quite nice, isn't it? 

298
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,800
Some of it's stuck, which isn't ideal. 

299
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,520
To give an extra bit of texture, I'm going to sift some sugar on the top 

300
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,120
which will crisp up. 

301
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,200
Also hopefully hiding the bit where the mixture clearly stuck. 

302
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,440
I don't know how to make the grill hotter. 

303
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,560
It doesn't seem to be doing much. We'll try that. 

304
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,160
The last thing I want to do is burn it. 

305
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Do you like goat? 

306
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,400
Are you getting goat? 

307
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,640
Too much goat? 

308
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,200
That's just not looking good. 

309
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,000
That's really good custard. 

310
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,440
I'm really happy with that. 

311
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,600
The bit I was hoping to hide, 

312
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,240
the sugar is drawing attention to it in a big white flash. 

313
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,960
I think what we might do... 

314
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,840
blow torch. 

315
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,120
Amazing! 

316
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,720
No, don't burn that bit! 

317
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,880
Grrrr! 

318
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,760
Bakers, the suet crisis is nearly over, one minute please. 

319
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
That's very good if I say so myself. 

320
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,440
You clever, clever boy. 

321
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,200
It's a pity that's broken 

322
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,720
but I don't think it will detract from the taste. 

323
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,520
That is an amazing piece of work, 

324
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,160
let's have a little sniffingtons. 

325
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
- Happy...
- Hello, sailor.
- Cheers. 

326
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,800
Bakers, your Signature Challenge is over. 

327
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,320
How boozy is this sauce? Is it...? 

328
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,120
There's a fair bit of Armagnac in it 

329
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,920
- but I'm hoping I've cooked it off a bit.
- Very standard. 

330
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,640
Even for me, there's too much alcohol in there. 

331
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,880
I love it! 

332
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,280
What's happened? What's happened? 

333
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,520
- That's weird. 
- That is weird, isn't it? 

334
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,080
Have you been palate swapping this weekend? 

335
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,960
That's delicious, the textures, the prunes are baked really well. 

336
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,040
I was really worried how much mixture you'd put into the tin 

337
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,360
because I thought you'd put too much in and it would give a very 

338
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,880
close texture. You hadn't put too much in and the texture is fine. 

339
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,880
Oh... 

340
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,680
It's absolutely beautifully flavoured. 

341
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,120
It's lovely, it's quite close textured 

342
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,360
- but it tastes beautiful, doesn't it? 
- I love that ice cream. 

343
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,800
- Thank you. 
- That's really good as well. 

344
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,040
- I love the plums that are going through it.
- Yeah. 

345
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,280
If that was on a menu, I'd choose that, yeah. 

346
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,280
- Oh, hello. 
- Doesn't that look attractive! 

347
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,080
I was a bit concerned you adding ground almonds 

348
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,360
but I can see there's a lovely texture. 

349
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,840
There is a hint of the cheese. 

350
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,480
I don't really like goat's cheese, 

351
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,200
but the hint actually goes with the sweetness of the fig, 

352
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,880
and the fig roly-poly is fantastic. 

353
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,120
Very, very good flavours. 

354
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,480
Well thought through and you haven't concentrated too much on the style, 

355
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,400
- you concentrated on substance, well done.
- Thank you. 

356
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,240
Well, it's holding together, Beca, isn't it? 

357
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,680
You've actually got a tender meat, but your vegetables 

358
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,360
are just about cooked as well, and that gravy is beautiful. 

359
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,000
- But I think you could have got away with a little less suet crust.
- OK. 

360
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,080
It's quite a lot, would you say that would serve six or eight? 

361
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,400
My family, maybe four! 

362
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,320
It's an awful lot of suet crust. 

363
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,080
I was looking at it as an intimate meal for two, to be honest! 

364
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,040
But you've got your flavours right. It's good, isn't it? 

365
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,120
- Yeah, I think it works.
- Thank you. 
- Cracking Welsh pud, well done. 

366
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,080
Very good flavours. 

367
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,440
The barberries are quite sharp, aren't they? 

368
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,720
I think what you've got is you've got this huge sort of sourness, which I love by the way, 

369
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,240
and then you've got the sweetness coming through in the custard. 

370
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,880
That is steamed perfectly. 

371
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,320
Extremely good. 

372
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,480
- You've got a split there, what happened?
- I'm not quite sure, 

373
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,800
just when I unwrapped the buttered grease-proof, it was like that. 

374
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,680
It's got a beautiful texture, 

375
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,960
you've cleverly got the fruit all the way through. 

376
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,240
Everything about that is right. 

377
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,000
It's moist, it's got good colour, the ginger even helps it, 

378
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,600
and the ice cream is perfect. 

379
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,480
That's a really nice dish. 

380
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,920
That's delicious. 

381
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,600
I don't know where they're going because I'm not leaving. 

382
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,480
I'm over the moon, I knew that the pudding would be good. 

383
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,360
I'm just hoping it's what Paul and Mary like, 

384
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,320
and they obviously did. 

385
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
I've done it a few times to practise, 

386
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,000
that's the best it's ever turned out, so brilliant. 

387
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,640
They liked the pudding, they liked the taste, yeah, really pleased with everything. 

388
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,440
That is exactly what I wanted to hear, 

389
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,200
that I'd got sophisticated style, with good substance, 

390
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,280
with a goat in there for good measure. 

391
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,520
With suet success all round, spirits in the tent are high. 

392
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,520
So, it's time to bring them back down to Earth, with a bump. 

393
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,240
Bakers, time for the Technical Challenge. 

394
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,960
Now this recipe today is one of old laser eyes herself, Mary Berry's. 

395
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,280
- Look at them, just boring in. 
- Terrified. 

396
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,040
Terrified, I can't look at her. 

397
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,640
So Mary, Paul, I'm going to have to ask you to leave, 

398
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,880
off they go, to the love dungeon there. 

399
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,840
- Off they go.
- Should tip him upside down and check he's not got a soggy bottom? 

400
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,480
Paul and Mary would like you please to make 

401
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,320
eight religieuses which means "nun" in French. 

402
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,800
Eight little nuns, a French classic, made from choux pastry. 

403
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,360
They should be filled with creme patissiere, 

404
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,120
smothered in chocolate ganache 

405
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,920
and piped with whipped cream. 

406
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,800
You've got two hours to bake and present your religieuses. 

407
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,400
I've never eaten a nun before. 

408
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,920
On your marks. 

409
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,440
Get set. 

410
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,720
# Bake! # 

411
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,720
I have never made these. 

412
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,160
I don't even know quite how to pronounce it. 

413
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,280
I've eaten plenty of these, I've never made one. 

414
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,280
I know what one of these is meant to look like, 

415
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,840
so that's a start. 

416
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,680
Even though I've made choux pastry quite often, 

417
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,320
I feel physically sick. 

418
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,760
It's not very complicated. 

419
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,800
I think people are scared of it much more than they need to be 

420
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,680
because it's actually very simple. 

421
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,400
- Oh, wow. 
- This'll take careful baking. 

422
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,880
Firstly they must make choux pastry. 

423
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,560
They've got to get it to the right consistency, 

424
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,680
it's got to be stiff enough to pipe. 

425
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,160
They must make creme patissiere, if it's too runny it'll ooze out, 

426
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,840
if it's too stiff they won't get it out of the end of the piping tube. 

427
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,880
The ganache has to be done carefully, hasn't it? 

428
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,440
It's quite tricky to get that wonderful shine. 

429
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,480
This is without doubt a difficult Technical Challenge. 

430
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,600
They had it easy with the suet crust, I think, 

431
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,200
this is going to sort them out. 

432
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,120
Choux is different to all other pastries 

433
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,080
as it's first cooked in a pan. 

434
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,240
I've got my water and butter in here. 

435
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,920
Once the butter's melted, 

436
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,760
then I need to get my flour in all in one go and give it a beat. 

437
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,520
Beginning to cook off now, and it'll go a bit stiffer 

438
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,600
as the flour cooks a bit. 

439
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,560
Then you whisk in eggs 

440
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,480
and that's the part you've got to get right. 

441
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,120
Mary's recipe doesn't specify how thick... 

442
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,680
It's a good work-out. 

443
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,160
..the choux paste should be. 

444
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,160
I would have expected it to be a bit thicker. 

445
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,520
I think I just have to use my intuition a bit, 

446
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,480
and just get to the stage where I recognise it as choux pastry. 

447
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,280
What have I done. Calm down, Glenn, get it together. 

448
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,960
I'm starting again, I've done choux like a million times, 

449
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,400
and there's a stage after you've added the flour in 

450
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,720
then you need to dry the mixture off a bit with plenty of heat, 

451
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,120
and give it a sound beating before you add the eggs 

452
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,280
and I've just shoved the eggs in. 

453
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,480
Well, if I beat that over a high heat I'm going to end up 

454
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,680
with a scrambled, floury mess, so scratch that 

455
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,120
and start again. 

456
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,520
Now normally when I make choux buns, I kind of do it into a ball, 

457
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,720
but this says to pipe round discs. 

458
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,240
Round discs, I'm terrible at piping, 

459
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,120
absolutely abysmal at piping. 

460
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,440
The shaping is important on this one because the whole of the bake 

461
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,520
is about the shape, it's supposed to look like a little pastry nun. 

462
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,960
It's about making sure you've got the right consistency 

463
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,000
of your batter that's not too loose. 

464
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,120
Batch number two, happy bunny. 

465
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,800
I can feel the texture's right so I know it's going to pipe nicely 

466
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,200
and then puff up nicely. 

467
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,600
I'm just smoothing it out to fill the circle. 

468
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,040
Once it's in the oven, it does tend to do its own thing. 

469
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,880
Hopefully the right thing, which is puff up nicely, nice and brown. 

470
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,480
A hot oven is crucial. 

471
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,520
To get that all-important rise, 

472
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,480
choux buns must be baked at a high temperature. 

473
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,080
Come on babies, rise! 

474
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,200
The moisture in the paste quickly turns to steam, 

475
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,720
puffing the pastry into hollow shells. 

476
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,920
Well, my little ones are puffing up well. 

477
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,160
Yeah, they've puffed up nicely, I'm happy with that. 

478
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,920
Quite flat... 

479
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,560
They haven't risen up like a choux bun should. 

480
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,240
Rubbish! 

481
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,640
This has never happened before at home, ever. 

482
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,800
Ever. 

483
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,120
How are your hot nuns? 

484
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,360
Ooo... 

485
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,520
Amen, Beca. 

486
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,080
So that is so you can get the filling in? 

487
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,520
But also to let any additional steam out so that the inside dries out. 

488
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,080
Bakers, you've got half an hour left of nun bun fun. 

489
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,600
Half an hour left. 

490
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,360
OK, make the creme pat, make the chocolate ganache. 

491
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,840
Just make stuff, just make it! 

492
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,240
So you want like a nice, thick, glossy consistency. 

493
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,840
I just want to make it extra smooth and silky, it is for nuns after all! 

494
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,840
That is some darn good looking creme pat you've got there, Christine. 

495
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,160
It's not bad, is it? 

496
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,240
If it's too runny, it'll ooze out of every little crevice, 

497
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,480
every little hole. 

498
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,760
Ugh! 

499
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,120
Production line, inject those nuns. 

500
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,000
My technique is to go right down to the top 

501
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,840
and just keep going until it spills out, really. 

502
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,160
My days... 

503
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,000
That's like filling the car up with petrol, isn't it? 

504
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,760
Oh! 

505
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,040
The texture is all wrong, too thin, 

506
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,320
creme pat, big mistake. 

507
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,440
Messy, messy. 

508
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,920
Five minutes, bakers, before those nuns meet their maker. 

509
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,320
Five minutes. 

510
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,640
Just dipping the big ones, 

511
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,840
that's all quite successful. 

512
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,160
So all the cream is just going to stream out the bottom. 

513
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,240
I think when Mary comes to taste them, she'll know. 

514
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,320
I don't think I'd be able to cover it up with ganache, 

515
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,800
or filling, to be honest. 

516
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,920
Mary's too canny for that. 

517
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,200
This is where a judicious shove might just.. 

518
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,080
- Oh, that's very precarious! 
- Oh, that's brilliant.
- That's scary. 

519
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,040
It's looking good. 

520
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,520
Oh, we've got a decapitated nun! She's down! 

521
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,440
Oh... 

522
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,320
This is just a fiddly nightmare, 

523
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,120
this is just the kind of stuff I hate. 

524
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,080
Would you stop falling over? 

525
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,400
Bakers, in one minute, the abbey bell will toll 

526
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,720
and all the little nuns need to come scurrying up to the table. 

527
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,800
I've never known my hand to shake! 

528
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,560
What an ugly bunch of nuns! 

529
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,160
- OK, bakers, time's up. 
- SHE SIGHS 

530
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,240
Let's eat. 

531
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,160
As the bakers bring their religieuses up to be judged, 

532
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,200
there's nothing more they can do. 

533
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,760
Fortunately, Mary and Paul have no idea whose bakes are whose. 

534
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,120
I think we've got good batches here, don't you? 

535
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,080
Most of them do look all similar sizes. 

536
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,760
There's one that doesn't, 

537
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,520
but shall we start from this one? 

538
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,400
These are very tall nuns, aren't they? 

539
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,160
There's a bit of an issue there with the creme patissiere, 

540
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
it's just runny. 

541
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,760
It's a good flavour and the choux pastry itself is crisp. 

542
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,360
These are pretty good. 

543
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,600
The creme patissiere is just the right consistency 

544
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,360
and it holds the whole thing together. 

545
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,480
The chocolate looks good, all look pretty even, 

546
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,280
nice pipe work round the outside as well. I like that. 

547
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,960
And this one... 

548
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,720
It's a nice bake. The texture on the choux bun is good. 

549
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,360
But the creme pat is positively runny. 

550
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,520
These baby fellas, this has had a few issues 

551
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,760
with the choux pastry itself, it's too small and it's also burnt. 

552
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,600
Tastes a little burnt. 

553
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,080
- A lot of chocolate on this, isn't there, crispy though.
- Mm-hm. 

554
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,440
- Lovely shine on the icing, good piping.
- A bit irregular though. 

555
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,240
Not quite perfect. 

556
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,320
- And the last one...
- The piping is poor round the outside. 

557
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,600
- If you see it's sort of dot and carry one there.
- Tastes good. 

558
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,880
- Creme patissiere's a good consistency.
- OK. 

559
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,520
It's decision time. 

560
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,760
Paul and Mary will now rank the bakers in reverse order. 

561
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,840
Right, in sixth place is this one, obviously. 

562
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,640
Christine, it was burnt and there was not enough rise in the choux. 

563
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,480
And so number five here, the creme patissiere was a bit runny. 

564
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,440
And number four is this one. 

565
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,000
Good pipe work around the outside, 

566
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,480
creme pat is very good inside, it's nice and stiff, 

567
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,560
the only issue I had was inconsistency in size. 

568
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,960
And who's number three here? 

569
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,800
It would have even gone higher if it hadn't been such a runny creme pat. 

570
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,160
And number two is this one. 

571
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,880
Good layer of chocolate, the profiterole was nice and crispy 

572
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,280
and the creme pat was good. 

573
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,000
And who is number one? 

574
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,360
Yay, well done, Beca! 

575
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,520
APPLAUSE 

576
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,000
Evenly baked, lovely creme patissiere, 

577
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,200
neat piping, well done. 

578
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,680
Thank you. Thank you. 

579
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,440
I'm so chuffed, I've just been wanting to be top 

580
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,040
in the technical ever since week one. It's amazing to have it now. 

581
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,480
I came third, what I like is that even when you're in the middle 

582
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,720
of the pack, when it's a small number 

583
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,800
that's still a bronze medal, Hurray! 

584
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,120
What can I say? They were rubbish. 

585
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,280
But I knew they were. I've done one good bake. 

586
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,520
That was obviously poor, tomorrow's just got to be good. 

587
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,840
A brand-new day in the bake off tent. 

588
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,200
And the bakers have reached the final leg of their pastry marathon. 

589
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,160
Morning, bakers, and welcome to the Showstopper Challenge. 

590
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,640
Now today, we're looking for three types of puff pastry. 

591
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,360
Now think palmier, think lattice, 

592
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,080
think pinwheel, mainly think massive horn. 

593
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,000
We'd like one type filled, one type iced, 

594
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,280
you can do whatever you want with the final type 

595
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,760
but we need 12 of each. 

596
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,200
Now no presh, but you are baking for a place in the quarterfinal, OK? 

597
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,440
You've got four hours, bakers. On your marks... 

598
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,400
- Get set.
- Bake! 

599
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,640
Of all the pastries the bakers have tackled so far, 

600
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,800
puff is the most technically challenging 

601
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,280
and time consuming to make. 

602
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,040
I've made flaky pastry and rough puff pastry 

603
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,800
but never full-on puff pastry. There's a lot of processes. 

604
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,760
It just takes for ever, 

605
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,240
and we don't have for ever, so that's what is worrying. 

606
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,480
To make a full-blooded puff pastry you need time, 

607
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,640
you need patience and you need precision. 

608
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,040
It's all about the lamination, building up the layers 

609
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,480
of butter dough, butter dough. As the dough melts, 

610
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,280
it creates steam and that brings up the layers of the two doughs 

611
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,080
apart from each other, that's what gives it the rise. 

612
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,840
We're looking for a very professional finish. 

613
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,480
Every single one has got to be even, 

614
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,920
good flavours, good textures, 

615
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,480
and I think we should get a great variety. 

616
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,560
Frankly, anybody who has a life, or a job, or a family, or friends 

617
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,200
doesn't do this often. 

618
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,920
The pastry itself I quite like making. 

619
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,080
I think it's the whole process, I've really quite got into it, actually. 

620
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,520
Puff pastry has a much higher fat content than short pastries, 

621
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,480
often having the same quantity of flour and butter. 

622
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,200
The remaining chilled butter is flattened 

623
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,680
so that it can be encased in the dough. 

624
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,400
Although I had a good day yesterday, I'm not sitting back. 

625
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,480
I am going full speed ahead to get all the elements done 

626
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,920
because I know that if I can pull it off like I have at home, 

627
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,480
they're beautiful and I'm really happy with them. 

628
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,240
Beca is making nectarine and frangipane squares, 

629
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,680
sweet vol-au-vents filled with chocolate and hazelnut, 

630
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,800
and strawberries and cream mille-feuilles. 

631
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,840
That's the one that takes the most time towards the end. 

632
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,480
The vol-au-vents and the filled squares, it's filling them and ensuring they're glazed and equal. 

633
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,040
So how are you doing for time 

634
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,800
because you haven't got your pastry in? 

635
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,000
I'm OK, I've allocated the first two hours to pretty much 

636
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,560
doing everything individually and I've got the middle hour 

637
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,520
to bake and the last hour to assemble, 

638
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,400
so really tight but it's worked. 

639
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,520
We'll leave you in peace. 

640
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,840
- I was going to say, would it help if we left?
- Probably, yes. 

641
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,080
So you just seal the butter inside a kind of envelope of the pastry. 

642
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,600
If you enclose it first, you get another additional set of layers, 

643
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,880
you've already started with the layers, 

644
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,080
I've got pastry, butter, pastry already 

645
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,240
before I get round to even doing my first fold. 

646
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,520
While most of the bakers 

647
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,040
are sticking to the traditional method, 

648
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,280
Glenn is ripping up the rule book. 

649
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,720
I'm using the inverted 

650
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,680
or inside-out puff method. 

651
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,120
So rather than folding the butter inside the dough, 

652
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,840
I'm rolling the dough inside the butter. 

653
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,440
I've tried both ways and, for me, this works to give 

654
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,440
a nice, light, flaky result. 

655
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,080
Glenn is making caramelised apple and marzipan tartlets, 

656
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,120
chocolate elephant ears, 

657
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,360
and passion fruit mille-feuilles from his inside-out pastry. 

658
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,320
- Yours is going to have butter on the outside?
- It's very hard to tell 

659
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,880
but after the first few turns, the outside doesn't feel 

660
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,320
like butter, it sort of feels like dough. 

661
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,080
I'm not convinced... I think the traditional way, 

662
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,560
- you can get extremely good results. 
- Oh, no doubt. Yeah. 

663
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,800
Your flavours are fairly straightforward, 

664
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,240
I'm curious to see what the finished result is with this new pastry. 

665
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,080
- We'll see.
- Good luck, Glenn. 

666
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,600
This is the way the French do it. 

667
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,240
I know there are other methods, 

668
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,400
there's probably loads of different methods going on around the room, 

669
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,360
this just works for me. So if it's not broke, don't fix it. 

670
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,480
Frances is making French cream horns, sheet music mille-feuilles, 

671
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,520
and bass clef palmiers, inspired by French singer, Edith Piaf. 

672
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,880
- Is this your first turn?
- This is first, I'm going to do six in total 

673
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,760
and then 20 minutes rest in the fridge. 

674
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,280
You're handling that very well and it's not oozing out, 

675
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,520
it looks fairly even all the way along. 

676
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,400
- I always find, near the end, it gets easier to handle. 
- This is my worst nightmare, this. 

677
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,200
- It involves concentration and patience - two things I don't have. 
- I enjoy doing it at home. 

678
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,240
Initially I hadn't done a lot of pastry but I've quite got into it. 

679
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,640
At the moment I'm using the book turns 

680
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,920
because it gets you an extra layer, every layer helps. 

681
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,080
It's a really funny dough to work with 

682
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,640
because it looks really, really ugly for a while 

683
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,520
and then after a few rolls, it's beautiful, 

684
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,600
it's like an ugly duckling. 

685
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,320
I'm about to embark on the first fold of the inverted puff pastry, 

686
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:28,800
so this is the beurrage which is the cold butter... 

687
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,920
then I shall enfold the pastry in the butter. 

688
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,680
It seems crazy, but it works. 

689
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,520
Although I have a point to prove now, because there was a certain 

690
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,680
amount of scepticism and I can feel them watching me even as we speak. 

691
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,760
I hope I prove them wrong! 

692
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,080
I hope they eat their words 

693
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,320
and say these are the best puff pastries we've ever had. 

694
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,880
They won't go that far, let's not get carried away, Glenn. 

695
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,360
I hope they say it works. 

696
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,000
The pastry is put in the freezer between turns, 

697
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,120
to allow the butter to chill and the dough to rest. 

698
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,720
But there is no such luck for the bakers. 

699
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,000
So I'm making the frangipane now whilst that's having a rest 

700
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,160
and then... 

701
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,280
fold, turn, fold, turn, rest. 

702
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,640
Make more stuff. 

703
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,160
Right... 

704
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,560
it's knackering. 

705
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,520
I'm just making my white chocolate ganache at the moment. 

706
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,320
This is for the mille-feuilles, 

707
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,560
so this is going to go in the lower layer and then... 

708
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,280
And, then, other stuff in the upper layer. 

709
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,520
More specifically, Ruby's mille-feuilles will be filled 

710
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,280
with raspberry and passion fruit. 

711
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,600
She's also making caramelised apple lattice 

712
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,040
and Portuguese custard tarts. 

713
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,000
The whole idea of doing the mille-feuilles 

714
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,520
with the passion fruit, the raspberry and the chocolate, 

715
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,080
are you going to portion each one once you've baked it as a log 

716
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,240
or are you going to do them individually? 

717
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,120
Um, I'm baking sheets and, then... 

718
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,840
I'm not 100% sure whether I'm going to assemble and then cut 

719
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,960
or cut and then assemble, 

720
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,400
but it really does depend on how set my creme pat is and stuff like that. 

721
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,920
I think you're winging it. 

722
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,560
I'm trying not to wing it, I've done a lot of practising 

723
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,200
but there's always things that need to be ironed out, there are always bits. 

724
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,200
Good luck. Are you going to be all right for time, do you think? 

725
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,000
I'm going to be really pushed for time. 

726
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,280
At the moment, everything's going to plan and everything's to time, 

727
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,720
maybe even... I wish I did have a time chart 

728
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,920
because, maybe, I might be ahead of time. 

729
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,840
The major part of today's bake will be the foundation, 

730
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,800
which is getting a good puff, that's going to be the skill 

731
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,920
and the technique that's really going be under scrutiny today. 

732
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,080
Kimberley's puff pastries are pear, malt and butterscotch 

733
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,000
mille-feuilles, blackberry and lemon creme brulee custard tarts, 

734
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,160
and fig, orange and thyme galettes. 

735
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,160
I was just checking to see how the butter was doing 

736
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,720
and the butter is spread between the layers, which is good. 

737
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,680
This goes back into the freezer for another ten minutes, 

738
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,200
and then I'll give it its final turn. 

739
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,160
Bakers, you're halfway through your showstopper, two hours gone, 

740
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,880
two hours still to go. 

741
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,640
The layers look OK in the puff, so I'm pleased about that. 

742
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,080
I've divided my puff pastry for the mille-feuilles. 

743
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,920
I'm rolling out three sheets that'll be baked 

744
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,640
and then I'll trim them later. 

745
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,560
You can cut them to size beforehand, some others are doing that. 

746
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,520
I've worked hard to get as many layers as I can in the pastry 

747
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,640
so I want it to come through once it's baked. 

748
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,760
The colder the butter and the hotter the oven, 

749
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,960
the better the rise in the puff pastry. 

750
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,280
Weighing the sheets down helps control the rise, 

751
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,680
resulting in thinner, crispier pastry. 

752
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,240
I am on time, but you literally have no rest. 

753
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,880
I just need to crack on. 

754
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,640
I've got butter and I've just put some brown sugar in there. 

755
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:18,200
I'm going to weigh off some currants, 14oz, 

756
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,480
this is the mix for my Eccles cakes. 

757
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,600
When I was a child, I called them fly pie. 

758
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,280
I think a lot of people call them fly pie, which sounds horrible. 

759
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,840
As well as her fly pies, Christine is making fresh fruit baskets 

760
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,560
and lemon cream Eton Mess mille-feuilles. 

761
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,000
I think you start feeling that you've got to do well and the 

762
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,160
pressure's really on and I think you can probably not perform so well. 

763
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,440
So I'm just going to do every stage as best I can 

764
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,480
and produce the best I can. 

765
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,840
If I've done that, then I'll be happy. 

766
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,400
OK, pastry puffers, you've got one hour. 

767
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,720
One hour left, thank you. 

768
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,360
The base for the galette is in the oven now, 

769
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,160
that just needs to puff up. 

770
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,800
I might just give that a few more minutes. 

771
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,920
There's so much to do, 

772
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,800
I wanted nearly everything to be baked by now. 

773
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,120
The mille-feuilles are in so that's good, 

774
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,400
but other things need to be further ahead. 

775
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,120
- (Quite a different atmosphere in here, isn't it?)
- Yeah, it is. 

776
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,240
No-one's really talking to each other, are they? 

777
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,200
- No, focusing on what needs to be done.
- Does that feel odd? 

778
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,240
I'm quite glad actually to be here at the front, 

779
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,040
just so I can't see behind me. 

780
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,360
- Shall I tell you what's going on?
- No. 

781
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,880
I'm just lining muffin tins for my custard tarts. 

782
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,560
I hate being stressed out and this, for me, 

783
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,160
is four hours of solid stress, heart pounding, 

784
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,880
can't even function. 

785
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,200
I thought I'd get used to the stress but it doesn't get better. 

786
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,120
I'm just going to fill my Eccles cakes. 

787
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,480
The secret is not to over-fill them 

788
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,320
so that all the filling splurges out. 

789
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,520
At this level and with the other bakers, 

790
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,240
who are absolutely brilliant, 

791
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,720
as well as it being great puff pastry and really nice fillings, 

792
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,480
they've got to be finished off beautifully 

793
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,880
and presented beautifully. 

794
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,920
This is the palmier, so it has cinnamon sugar rolled in it, 

795
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,600
so it ends up being flaky and crunchy. 

796
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,400
I have seen them as big as a small child's head. 

797
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,720
These might be big as a small adult's head. 

798
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,920
I'm not putting too much of the frangipane in because the pastry 

799
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,040
will puff up, the frangipane will spread out a bit, I'm just going to 

800
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,160
put a little teaspoon of nectarine goodness that I made earlier. 

801
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,680
It's going to be tight, it's going to be very tight, 

802
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,120
but I can't think of what can go wrong, 

803
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,920
I've just got to focus on each task in hand. 

804
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,280
This is caramel to go on my tarts, 

805
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,560
and I'm going to try to fix a verbena leaf inside, 

806
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,280
so it looks like a stained glass window. 

807
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,640
My Eccles cakes, they are in the oven. 

808
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,240
And rising. Ohh, thank you. 

809
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,200
Wowsers, what's that? 

810
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,280
That is passion-fruit caramel. 

811
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,600
MEL CHUCKLES 

812
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,160
Smells absolutely phenomenal. Are you enjoying this, Ruby? 

813
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,240
I'm seriously stressed out. 

814
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,200
OK, now, do I need to slap you? 

815
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,200
Well, save it for when I'm in a real... 

816
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,960
Save it for the last five minutes, 

817
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,040
- because that's when it's all going to go really wrong.
- OK. 

818
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,880
Assemble and cut mille-feuilles. 

819
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,720
'Meaning a thousand leaves, 

820
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,000
'mille-feuille should be cut into thin, elegant pieces.' 

821
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,040
Look at the rise on that. 

822
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,600
It's like a pillow, Beca! 

823
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,280
Pipe for Britain, Frances! 

824
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:35,000
Gentle...gentle. It is quite tense, yes. 

825
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,360
Agh! 

826
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,560
Ugh, what a mess! I'm not having any fun. 

827
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,760
This is not fun. This is not fun. 

828
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,760
OK, bakers, five minutes left, five minutes left. 

829
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,080
The pressure's getting to me. 

830
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,680
I am pleased with them, I just... want to get finished! 

831
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,040
Just cut, cut, just keep cutting, mate. 

832
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,560
Oh, for the love of Pete! 

833
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,680
- Mel?
- Yes, lovey? 

834
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,800
I need a talking-to. 

835
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,280
Right, sorry, give me one second. 

836
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,880
- Get a grip.
- Thank you. 

837
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,480
- Just get a grip, OK?
- Thank you. 
- Get a ruddy grip. 

838
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,080
I promised her I'd do that. 

839
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,920
OK, bakers, ten seconds remaining. 

840
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,040
Oh, God. 

841
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,320
Nine... 

842
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,640
This is so stressful. 

843
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,360
..eight, seven... 

844
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,440
Whatever state they're in, they're coming out. 

845
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,840
..six... Ooh, nice. Five, four... 

846
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:14,320
three, two, one. 

847
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,640
Out of time! 

848
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,880
It's nice. 

849
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,960
HE SIGHS 

850
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,520
I never want to go through four hours like that again. 

851
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,880
They look shocking, but there are 12 portions, 

852
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,440
and some of them aren't too bad. 

853
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,400
They should be enough to keep me in. 

854
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,600
Yeah. This is that magic pastry, isn't it? 

855
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,760
I'm not convinced, it's more like a sweet pastry than a rough puff. 

856
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,440
It's a buttery, rich pastry, but we haven't got the layers, have we? 

857
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,600
You haven't got the layers, haven't got the flake. 

858
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,720
They don't look appetising, do they? 

859
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,080
They look awful, I mean, you look at that. 

860
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,680
You don't need me to tell you, 

861
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,800
the cinnamon in there as well is very strong. 

862
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,320
Let's move on to the mille-feuilles. 

863
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,760
- The flavour's all right.
- Mmm. 

864
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,800
It's cream with icing, with pastry in-between. What's not to like? 

865
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,960
- But they look hideous altogether, they're a mess.
- Agreed. 

866
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,160
It looks like they've been dropped. Let's have a look at the tarts. 

867
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,040
These look, I think, really pretty. 

868
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,800
- Oh, dear.
- They do look borderline raw as well. 

869
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,320
The flavour of the apple and marzipan is lovely 

870
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,800
but the actual pastry itself underneath isn't quite cooked. 

871
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,120
Hugely disappointed. 

872
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,600
I have absolutely no idea where those four hours have gone, 

873
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,880
or what I did, but I managed to come out the other side, 

874
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,160
and I can hand on my heart say that running a marathon 

875
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,520
is ten times easier than doing that. 

876
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,640
You've got a hell of a rise from your puff pastry, 

877
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,640
it's a very good pastry. 

878
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,680
My issue is the finishing on them. There's no shine, 

879
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,640
there's no elegance to it, it's sort of, 

880
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,880
a bit of fruit inside that and baked off and that's it. 

881
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,320
The mille-feuilles does look as though the pastry was 

882
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,560
a little bit thick. 

883
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,080
- Inside it looks quite raw, and quite wet inside the middle.
- OK. 

884
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,120
OK, let's look at the vol-au-vents. 

885
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,960
Good bake, good rise out of the puff as well. 

886
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,400
Very flaky, very buttery. 

887
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,560
- Good flavours, just a little more polish on the finish.
- OK. 

888
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,520
- They certainly look impressive. 
- Thank you. 

889
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,320
You always have a theme, and this is a great theme. 

890
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,000
It's got a good flake on that, 

891
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,640
you can see that the colour's good all the way through. 

892
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,840
Very good flavours, I'll go for that. 

893
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,240
Right, the horn. 

894
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,240
The pastry is in good layers, well cooked through. 

895
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,000
I would have liked to have seen more of a deeper colour on it, 

896
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,880
to be honest, but the flavour combinations 

897
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,080
inside are delicious, the raspberry and the ripple is superb. 

898
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,960
I think you've done really well. 

899
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,000
Great flake on there, it's good. 

900
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,480
It's a lovely flavour, little bit difficult to eat that 

901
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,480
circle of caramel, 

902
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,560
maybe it could have been crushed on the top. 

903
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:58,000
Yeah, this is the tricky one. The base has fallen apart already. 

904
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,760
The jelly on the top tastes fantastic, nice and zingy, 

905
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,800
but the issue really is the puff pastry on the bottom, 

906
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,120
it's just not bonded. 

907
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,680
Um, they're a bit untidy, they are a bit untidy. 

908
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,680
Portuguese tarts, technically they're burnt. 

909
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,920
Well, the custard isn't overcooked, looking at it from the side, 

910
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,400
there are no bubbles in there. 

911
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,840
It actually tastes really nice. 

912
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,200
It's just a pity that they're a little bit messy. 

913
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,760
Quite a lot messy. But they don't half taste good. 

914
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,360
- Thank you, Ruby. MEL AND SUE:
- Well done, Ruby. 

915
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,800
If I get through, I'll be thrilled. 

916
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,240
If I don't, I couldn't have done any better than I've just done. 

917
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,280
And that's all I wanted to do. 

918
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,640
Do you want to start with the Eccles cake, Mary? 

919
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,360
A lovely traditional recipe, 

920
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,920
just like you gave us before with your suet pudding. 

921
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,960
They're well baked, masses of currants in there, 

922
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,440
nice glaze on top. 

923
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,120
It does taste good, the flake's good, I think it works. 

924
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,240
Then we come to your mille-feuilles. 

925
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:27,240
I don't know how well raw fruit goes with the mille-feuilles really. 

926
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,040
The pastry is very, very good. 

927
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,440
Now these look beautiful. 

928
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,520
That's very delicious. 

929
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,320
The baskets are unique, they look very uniform, great colour, 

930
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,320
great puff, great flavour. 

931
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,880
- Good, thank you.
- Thank you. 

932
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,880
So, generally this weekend, a very high standard. 

933
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,640
When you look at all three challenges, 

934
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,760
Frances has done extremely well, I think, 

935
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,920
Frances has been very consistent throughout. 

936
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,160
What about Beca? Came first in the technical. 

937
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,400
Yes, Beca did do well, but she's usually made use of her time 

938
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,880
properly and she didn't do her glazing of the pastry. 

939
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,640
I was expecting a little more from her, because she's got it within her. 

940
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,960
Who's had problems? 

941
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,520
Glenn has had problems. 

942
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,520
He wanted to do his pastry in a different way from anybody else, 

943
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,240
and it didn't really work. 

944
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,880
- It just wasn't executed well today. 
- What about Christine? 

945
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,960
She had a tough day yesterday, she came out last in the technical. 

946
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,240
She came back today. 

947
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,400
She's very sensible the way she chooses her bakes. 

948
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,480
To choose Eccles cakes, they were really absolutely delicious. 

949
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,320
This is a tough decision for you two, only six left. 

950
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,120
Going through to the quarterfinals, you don't take that lightly, 

951
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,680
and if someone does fall off a cliff 

952
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,880
then unfortunately they've got to go. 

953
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:03,560
Bakers, all six of you, that was a heroic weekend. 

954
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,280
Now I have the joy of announcing who Paul and Mary 

955
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,320
have decided will be this week's Star Baker. 

956
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,400
I think it's fair to say that this person really shouldn't 

957
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,240
regrette rien, 

958
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,640
and that she should literally go 

959
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,640
and blow on her French horn of victory. 

960
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,040
Frances, you're our Star Baker. Well done. 

961
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,480
Finally! > 

962
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,200
This week I get the sadder job of saying 

963
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,600
who won't be joining us next week. 

964
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,640
And the person leaving us is... 

965
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,040
..Glenn. 

966
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,320
You beautiful big bear, come on, let's turn him. 

967
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,960
SHE GROANS 

968
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,920
- MUFFLED:
- We'll miss you! 

969
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:05,400
'I'm obviously very sad it's over. I don't know quite' 

970
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,040
what's going to fill the huge gap that Bake Off will leave in my life. 

971
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,760
And these guys, how class, they did a fantastic job. 

972
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,840
I've done well, I've got a long way through 

973
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,800
and I've absolutely loved it. 

974
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,760
'I feel a great measure of relief' 

975
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,640
and a great measure of sadness, 

976
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,240
because of Glenn. 

977
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,080
We shall so miss him. 

978
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,480
I feel ecstatic, that whole style over substance, 

979
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,840
I think the substance has shone through this weekend. 

980
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,120
Quarterfinalist, amazing! Yay! 

981
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,280
No, I did not, you nailed it. 

982
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,640
I know everybody's supportive and we all get on, 

983
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,120
but it's still a competition 

984
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,000
and everybody wants to get as far as they physically can. 

985
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,680
I think you will see a definite change in the atmosphere 

986
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,800
in the tent next week. Watch this space I think. 

987
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,880
Next time... 

988
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,080
Oh, hello, cheeky! 

989
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,320
..it's the quarterfinal. 

990
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,120
I've just got to concentrate on each task 

991
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,040
and not think about what could go wrong. 

992
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:13,960
And the stress... 

993
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,120
I can't believe this. 

994
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,480
..is getting to the bakers. 

995
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,880
It's not playing ball. 

996
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,440
The judging gets harsher... 

997
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,720
- Too bland. 
- That was just brutal. 

998
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,520
..the challenges get harder... 

999
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,440
It feels like the most complex technical so far. 

1000
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,960
..the tension in the tent rises. 

1001
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,240
This is quite an important bake for me. 

1002
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,200
But who will survive to tell the tale? 

1003
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,000
Like the Incredible Hulk! 

1004
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,400
