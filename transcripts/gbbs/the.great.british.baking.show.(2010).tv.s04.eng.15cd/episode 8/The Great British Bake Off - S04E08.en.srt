1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,240
It's the quarterfinal of the bake off and the tension is palpable. 

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,560
- Bunting?
- Check.
- Sugar?
- Check. 

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,800
- Eggs?
- Check.
- Flour?
- Check. 

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,080
- Butter?
- Check.
- Nostril trimmer? 
- Check. 

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,320
- Gingham?
- Check. 

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,240
- Yes, it is, five bakers desperate to make it to the semifinal?
- Check. 

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,440
Can only be the Great British Bake Off. 

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,880
- Tartan?
- Check.
- Yes, isn't it?! 

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,680
Vaclav Havel? BOTH: Czech! 

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,800
'Last time...' 

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,280
Oh, no, my hand's shaking! 

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,040
'Our six bakers put their twist on a signature suet pudding...' 

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,440
That's perfecto. 

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,680
'Survived one hell of a technical challenge...' 

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,840
What an ugly bunch of nuns. 

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,160
'And made 252 show-stopping puff pastries which put them in a spin.' 

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,280
- Get a grip.
- Thank you. 
- Just get a grip. 

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,520
'Frances excelled...' 

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,720
The flavour combinations inside are delicious. 

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,800
'Finally being awarded Star Baker.' 

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,440
APPLAUSE 

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,360
'The bakers raced against time... 

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,960
HE SIGHS 

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,120
'..and Glenn became the eighth baker to leave. 

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,560
'Now for the all-female quarter finalists, it's make or break.' 

26
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,960
GLASS SHATTERS 

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,640
It's like the Incredible Hulk! 

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,360
'As they battle it out for a place in the semifinal.' 

29
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,320
I've just got to concentrate on each task 

30
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,160
and not think about what could go wrong. 

31
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,240
'As the judges seek perfection.' 

32
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,360
At this stage, I'm not afraid of being critical. 

33
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,640
The disappointment is when you get into the cake, which is rather sad. 

34
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,880
Too bland. 

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,480
That was just brutal. 

36
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,120
'Who will stay?' 

37
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,800
I do feel that this is quite an important bake for me. 

38
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,320
- I'm not convinced you weighed everything up properly.
- Really? 

39
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,240
'And who will leave the Bake Off tent?' 

40
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,200
# I'm coming out, woo! 

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,280
# I want the world to know... # 

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,000
THEY HUM 

43
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,880
This week the bakers have been challenged with 

44
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,440
the task of making everything free. 

45
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,200
Not in a financial sense, but more gluten-free, wheat-free, dairy-free sort of a thing. 

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,640
Yeah, we're not free, though. We're about Â£5 an hour to hire for parties. 

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,600
I'm undercutting her, I'm four. 

48
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm starting to feel the pressure, 

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
my parents have both aged ten years they keep on telling me. 

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,680
They're more stressed than I am. 

51
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,360
I still need to get that blinkin' elusive Star Baker, the only one 

52
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,120
of the five who hasn't had it now, so it's really eating at me slightly. 

53
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,680
I think this week, I'm not going to slag off my bakes to Mary 

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,640
and Paul because if they've got a problem with it, they'll tell me, 

55
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
there's no point in me putting ideas in their mind. 

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,120
Nobody's really used the word "finals", actually, which is interesting, 

57
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,720
no-one's actually said it. 

58
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,320
We've just been talking quite normally, as we usually do 

59
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,880
about which recipes you're doing this week. 

60
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,440
Bakers, welcome to the quarterfinal. 

61
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,800
Not even a sniff of a Y-chromosome in the tent. 

62
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,400
That includes you, Paul. 

63
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,800
Right, so today we'd like you to make a loaf. 

64
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,400
Not just any loaf, 

65
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,960
we'd like you to make a loaf using unusual flours, such as chestnut 

66
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,120
or rye or rice, or you can use a grandfather grain which is 

67
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,400
the same as a normal grain but it talks about the war and falls asleep 

68
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,320
in front of a bar fire. Those are things like spelt, things like that. 

69
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,760
Well done. You can use any flavours you want, of course, 

70
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,240
they're up to you. 

71
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,160
You should bake it freeform or in a tin, again the choice is yours. 

72
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,800
You've got three hours on your Signature Bake, so on your marks... 

73
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,160
- Get set...
- Bake! 

74
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,080
'The bakers have already been tested on their conventional 

75
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,960
'bread-making skills, now they face the even trickier task 

76
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,760
'of mastering unconventional flours to create the perfect loaf.' 

77
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,440
Each flour has a different gluten level. 

78
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,760
This is the binding agent in all bread. 

79
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,560
And so therefore the bread reacts in a totally different way - 

80
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,760
is it going to affect the bake or is it going to affect the proving 

81
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,640
or is it going to affect both of them? 

82
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,600
It's got to hold its shape, it's got to cut well, 

83
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,720
we're looking for a good texture, 

84
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,280
a good rise and, above all, a good flavour. 

85
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,640
My friend Elle, she's got a slight wheat intolerance, so we often 

86
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,080
used to make spelt hot cross buns or spelt soda breads and stuff. 

87
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,240
'Spelt flour has a wheat gluten structure 

88
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,600
'and is being used by Frances, Kimberley, Beca and Ruby.' 

89
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,360
Spelt flour's like a really old type of flour, 

90
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,600
like an ancestor of conventional wheat flour. 

91
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,760
'Because of its different gluten structure, 

92
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,600
'spelt can be more unpredictable to work with than regular wheat flour.' 

93
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,920
One thing spelt does, it tends to fall out more than rise up. 

94
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,960
And my dough's quite a wet dough 

95
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,600
which also means that the shape itself, 

96
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,320
slightly sort of, I like to say blossoms. 

97
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,320
'Frances is making a tear and share loaf in the style of a Chelsea bun. 

98
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
'Her spelt Chelsea Flour Show loaf is flavoured with orange zest 

99
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,760
'and decorated with honeycomb and bees.' 

100
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,560
Is it going in a tin or are you doing it on a flat plate? 

101
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,480
I'm going to prove it in one of these tins to begin with. 

102
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,920
Is that a good idea to do that? 

103
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,080
When you're dealing with spelt, it can flow, 

104
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,960
that's the term that we use in the industry. 

105
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,880
- I've found it's flowed, yes.
- And because of that, if you contain it, 

106
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,360
the fact that you're doing a Chelsea bun will give it 

107
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,080
rigidity as well. You've got to get the texture right. 

108
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,360
It's going to be difficult. 

109
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,640
So I'm just measuring this water quite precisely. 

110
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm making a spelt loaf, it's mango and nigella seeds, 

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,480
so the idea is kind of like a mango chutney in a bread. 

112
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,360
'Ruby claimed Star Baker using conventional flour in bread week, 

113
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,600
'so is hoping to do the same with her freeform spelt cob.' 

114
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,280
I don't feel as emotional a baker as I maybe was at the start, 

115
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,560
but I've really built up my stress tolerance over the last few weeks, 

116
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,720
I'm less easily panicked. 

117
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,160
Because when I was doing my exams as well, I just went in 

118
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,640
and did what I needed to do, 

119
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,600
whereas before I would have been stressing out like crazy, so I think 

120
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,920
it's actually been good for me being this stressed out for this long. 

121
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,600
I think it's done a good thing. 

122
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,800
'To help reinforce the structure of her loaf, Beca has a secret weapon.' 

123
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,200
So my potatoes are ready, my rosemary's ready, the potatoes 

124
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,480
add the extra stickiness from the starch that they obviously let out. 

125
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,960
'Beca's using mashed potato, rosemary and spelt flour, 

126
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,320
'mixed to make her version of an Italian focaccia.' 

127
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,800
What sort of rise are you looking at and what sort of texture 

128
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,640
are you going to get at the end? Cake-like? 

129
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,840
When I was experimenting in the week, it had a nice uneven texture 

130
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,400
with nice air holes and it's quite a wet dough. 

131
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,440
It'll be nice to have something savoury. 

132
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,960
Thank you. Thank you very much. 

133
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,120
I'm using a completely gluten-free flour, 

134
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,560
it's a mixture of tapioca, rice and potato. 

135
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,600
'Christine's wheat-free loaf is the only one that's also gluten free. 

136
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,160
'It will be topped and filled with pumpkin, sesame and sunflower seeds.' 

137
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,680
When I made this loaf in the week, 

138
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,080
I wasn't quite sure, because I hadn't made one before, 

139
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,800
what it was supposed to look like, 

140
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,400
or how tall it was supposed to be, so I went up to see my baker 

141
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,520
at the local mill and took a chunk of it up there to show him 

142
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,800
and he did tell me that it was just as a gluten-free loaf should be. 

143
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,280
'While those using spelt gently knead their dough...' 

144
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,000
You need to build up the gluten a little bit, so that's why 

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,640
I'm working it a little bit more than I normally would. 

146
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,720
'..Christine's completely gluten-free mixture needs a different approach.' 

147
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,480
With a balloon whisk, you can see you couldn't possibly knead that. 

148
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,600
Well, you could, but you'd get into an awful mess. 

149
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Right, now that's going to go in to prove 

150
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,000
for about an hour and a quarter. 

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,760
Shower cap and then in there. 

152
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,960
I'll look at it in half an hour and then see if it needs more. 

153
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,840
So I'm not going to put it in the proving drawer just yet, 

154
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,840
I'm going to see how it goes because it's had raw mashed potato 

155
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,720
and warm water in, it's already starting to... 

156
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,160
And I don't want to over-prove. 

157
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,120
I like a loaf that looks good on the inside. 

158
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,840
'Kimberley's taking a risk 

159
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,120
'as the only baker filling her dough before proving.' 

160
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,040
I'm just wanting to make it so that 

161
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,920
when you roll it up, there's an unbroken line of the ham. 

162
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,760
'Her loaf is made with plain and wholemeal spelt 

163
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,720
'and filled with Parma ham and freshly made wild garlic pesto.' 

164
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,600
My boyfriend and my sister are my most reliable testers, 

165
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,800
and my sister is now over several times a week. 

166
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,000
She just comes in, she literally walks past me 

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,160
into the kitchen to see what's there. 

168
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,480
It does look exciting. 

169
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,520
I held my breath all the way through! 

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,480
Bakers, in latest grandfather grain news, you have one hour. 

171
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:26,680
It's alive. Yeah, lots of bubbles, it's quite a wet and soft dough. 

172
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,560
Yep, happy with that. 

173
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,040
Doesn't look as big as it usually would, but I think it's proved 

174
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,880
as much as I needed it to, so I feel happy about that. 

175
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,800
If you press it and it holds the indent then it's proved enough. 

176
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,280
Yep, if it springs back then it needs a bit more time. 

177
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,680
Buongiorno. 

178
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,600
Everything you do is aesthetically so pleasing. Colour coordinated. 

179
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,160
I love working with colour 

180
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,720
and I think food, as well, it's all about texture. 

181
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,640
- Are your family being good? 
- They've been incredibly supportive. 

182
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,520
In fact, my sister, she lives over in Vancouver and she sent a photo 

183
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,440
the other day of me when I was about five with one of my birthday cakes 

184
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,560
and she said, "Look, you've always been happiest surrounded by cake." 

185
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,920
You didn't make a birthday cake at five, did you? No. 

186
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,800
I've just got this bit of dough which doesn't have any mango in, 

187
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,480
for just tucking over like a protective cover. 

188
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,240
Because the gluten is not as strong as in a normal flour, 

189
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,480
if the mango's on the surface it can rupture 

190
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,280
and mango burns on the surface anyway, so I'm hiding mango 

191
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,040
and getting it all covered up. So it should make it rise more evenly. 

192
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,840
It's hard to imagine, with our obsession with diverse and artisanal loaves, 

193
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,040
that just 70 years ago, the Ministry of Food could have forced us 

194
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,320
to eat just one - the national loaf - 

195
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,960
which helped ensure health for the wartime nation. 

196
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,480
'Before World War II, Britain imported over 20 million tonnes of 

197
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,480
'food, but a key strategy of the enemy was to starve 

198
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,160
'the nation into submission, so the Ministry of Food 

199
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,840
'needed to come up with ways of keeping the nation fed.' 

200
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,760
Wheat was in very short supply because 70% of our imports 

201
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,320
were coming in from Canada, across the Atlantic. 

202
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,640
And this route was very vulnerable to attack from German U-boats. 

203
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,840
Hitler's intention was to very much destroy the docks, 

204
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,880
stop the imports and to starve the country out. 

205
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,480
'The Ministry of Food had to come up with a plan 

206
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,560
'to make the grain we had go further.' 

207
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,280
The white bread that people enjoyed eating was made using 

208
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,320
only 70% of the milled wheat grains, 

209
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,760
and this was seen as very wasteful in wartime. 

210
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,520
The Ministry of Food figured out that by including the bran 

211
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,120
and the germ of the wheat, they could reduce the amount of wheat 

212
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,240
that Britain required by a whole 10% and even make the bread 

213
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,720
more nutritious. This was then used to create the national loaf. 

214
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,440
'But, for a nation raised on soft white bread, 

215
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,920
'the government standard loaf proved hard to stomach.' 

216
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,360
The national loaf was rough and coarse and hard, 

217
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
and people were not used to it. 

218
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,840
An added problem was the national loaf was often stale. 

219
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,360
Bakers were not allowed to sell the loaf until a day after baking, 

220
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,720
so that it would slice more thinly and so the loaf would go further. 

221
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,680
'The public found it so grey and unappealing 

222
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,560
'they even nicknamed it Hitler's secret weapon.' 

223
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,560
The Ministry of Food tried very hard to persuade people to love 

224
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,960
the national loaf and they put a lot of effort into publicity campaigns. 

225
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,800
Lord Wolston is rumoured to have started a rumour that 

226
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,600
because the national loaf had increased amounts of vitamin E, 

227
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,160
which helps aid fertility, it was an aphrodisiac. 

228
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,560
All of this government propaganda does seem ultimately to have worked. 

229
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,760
By the end of the war, people were eating 20% more bread. 

230
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,440
It seems that they had finally learned to love the national loaf. 

231
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,560
OK, bakers, that's five minutes, or if you want a spelt version - 

232
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,240
F-I-V-E M-I-N-U-T-E-S. 

233
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,480
I'm just going to turn it around. 

234
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,360
Nearly done. I'm just putting an egg wash on the top. 

235
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,040
It looks like a beautiful cabbage. 

236
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,280
Yeah, it's supposed to look like a rose. 

237
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh, sorry, was it a rose? I said cabbage. 

238
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,400
No, no, cabbage is fine. 

239
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,080
# I'm coming out, woo! 

240
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,000
# I want the world to know... # 

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,600
THEY HUM 

242
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,240
It looks bronzed and cooked underneath. Oh, I don't know. 

243
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,440
Oh, hello, cheeky! That'll do. 

244
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,480
Bakers, that's one minute left. 

245
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,440
It's not playing ball. I can't believe this. 

246
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,440
It's got baking parchment underneath it, it should not have stuck. 

247
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,560
Let's try and get it out in one piece 

248
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,760
and just gently, gently put it on the top like a crown. 

249
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,200
There we go, OK. Jigsaw. 

250
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,240
It's cooked. Thank God it's the bottom. 

251
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,960
Bakers, this bake is officially closed. 

252
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,680
Well done, you. 

253
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,040
Loaves on boards, please. 

254
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,400
I mean, Lord, look at Frances', 

255
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,040
a broken loaf will not compete with that. 

256
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,240
'Each unconventional loaf will now be judged by Paul and Mary.' 

257
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,840
I think the style is amazing, what you've done, 

258
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,960
but it's got to taste good, so let's take a chunk out of here. 

259
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,400
It's got a good bake on it all the way down. 

260
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,920
It's full of flavour, I can taste everything from oranges to 

261
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,400
apricots, I think it would be great to tear and share. 

262
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,920
I think it could have done with more proving. 

263
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,960
I think it's a little bit too dense, I probably wouldn't have put 

264
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,360
any hindrance inside the dough because you added the orange zest. 

265
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,400
Yeah. 

266
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,200
OK, it's got a nice colour. 

267
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,520
I'll leave that on there. That's pretty good! 

268
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,160
When he says pretty good, I reckon that's really good. 

269
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,520
Amazing! 

270
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,080
I think it's absolutely scrummy, I think it's really lovely. 

271
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,840
The potato has broken up the gluten slightly 

272
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,880
so it's made it easy to chew. It melts in your mouth. 

273
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,720
You've ended up with a good, uneven, irregular crumb 

274
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,840
which is what you expect from a focaccia 

275
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,160
and actually, that's a very good focaccia. 

276
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,440
Thank you. High praise indeed. Gosh, thanks. 

277
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,560
Nice crust on the top, that's the part I like. 

278
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,080
Let's have a look inside. 

279
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,120
- Oh, it's going to be so bad, oh, no.
- Ready? 

280
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,520
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong with it? 

281
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,360
It's under-proved, it's under-baked, it's horrible. 

282
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,440
It's a winner for flavour, you've got a nice lot of mango in there. 

283
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,480
The technique was good, it was freeform, 

284
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,680
tricky to do with a flour like this. 

285
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,160
However, it is under-proved, and it's under-baked. 

286
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,280
- Beautiful pattern in there. Look at that!
- Isn't it just! 

287
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,320
And of course, so often when you put Parma ham in a bread 

288
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,080
it becomes crispy and hard. 

289
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,840
This will have softened and, I hope, added some really good flavour. 

290
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,040
SHE GIGGLES 

291
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
I actually love the flavours. 

292
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,240
The problem is, there's so much filling in there 

293
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,880
and the fact it's a wholemeal and the fact that you've cut it 

294
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,520
and the fact that you've twisted it, it's got nowhere to go. 

295
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,640
The texture is all wrong because it's too dry inside. 

296
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,240
- Dry?
- Yeah.
- Oh, OK. 

297
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,160
- It's a mess round the side. 
- I know. 

298
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,080
The bake looks pretty good, I do like the look of it actually, 

299
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,840
I like the seeds on the top. 

300
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,000
Nice structure. 

301
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,360
The seeds look evenly distributed in the middle. 

302
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,800
I think the flavour's good. 

303
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,000
I think the flavour and the texture are good and I do like that crust 

304
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,120
round the outside, it's a lovely colour and I like a crusty loaf. 

305
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,240
Well done, it's a tricky thing to do, but you've done well. 

306
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,040
- Thank you very much.
- Well done, Christine.
- Thank you. 

307
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,080
I'm pleased with that and I shall make some more because 

308
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,640
I do have a couple of friends who are gluten intolerant, 

309
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,000
and it would be lovely to give them a home-made loaf instead of a bought one. 

310
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,520
And save me touring the supermarket looking for it. 

311
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,480
That was a brilliant start for me. 

312
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,040
What is wrong with me? 

313
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,680
I was sitting in there like, this might be under-proved. 

314
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,760
Why did I just take it out of the drawer and put it...? I'm just an idiot. 

315
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,320
You're at the stage where you want everything to be perfect 

316
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,760
so to get valid criticisms is just a bit disappointing. 

317
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,800
I hope I've still got a chance to get through to the semis because 

318
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,040
I don't even want to anticipate not being there next week, so yeah. 

319
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,480
Prove. Prove, prove. 

320
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,760
'For their second challenge, 

321
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,240
'the quarterfinalists now face the unknown.' 

322
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,920
So, bakers, welcome to the Technical Challenge. 

323
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,720
Now, this particular challenge is one of Mary's recipes. 

324
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,480
Seeing as this morning we've had some gluten-free 

325
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,560
and some wheat-free, I'm suggesting this should be judge free. 

326
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,200
So, with the best will in the world, please, jog on. 

327
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,120
So what is it? 

328
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,560
Well, Mary has left you with a decadent little recipe 

329
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,960
which she likes to knock up for people who are on a gluten-free diet. 

330
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,840
It's a French classic, it's a hazelnut dacquoise. 

331
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,680
You've got two hours and 45 minutes to concoct 

332
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,400
- this delicious little bake, so on your marks...
- Get set... 

333
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,880
BOTH: Bake! 

334
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,800
The instructions, I wouldn't say they were crystal clear. 

335
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,160
I know what it is, I've never made it though. A dacquoise! 

336
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,640
'The dacquoise is a dessert cake originating from the spa town 

337
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,480
'of Dax in southwest France. 

338
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,240
'And it comprises several layers of nut meringue and rich cream.' 

339
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,960
It feels like the most complex technical so far. 

340
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
I think it's just going to be a timing thing. 

341
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,320
I at least know what one is, so that's the kind of terror, 

342
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,000
like, what if I don't know what this is? At all? 

343
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,320
Hazelnut dacquoise, this French classic of 

344
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,040
three layers of meringue with hazelnuts in the meringue mixture. 

345
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,440
If they roast them and they're too dark, they'll be bitter. 

346
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,040
If they chop them too finely, this releases too much oil 

347
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,720
and then the meringue will go runny. 

348
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,560
So there's several things that could really go wrong here. 

349
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,320
One would be on the meringue itself, 

350
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,120
and I actually think in the construction of it, 

351
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,280
to keep it nice and level. And finally, to put those 

352
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,520
12 ganache piped swirls on the top, and then topped with the praline. 

353
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,760
Absolutely gorgeous, 

354
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,280
one of my favourite ones you've done there, Mary. 

355
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,440
I've never done nuts in a meringue before, but I know you can. 

356
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,160
'If the hazelnuts are chopped too finely... 

357
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,280
'the excess oil released can deflate the meringue.' 

358
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,400
The key thing is just to get these in the oven 

359
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,800
to roast as quickly as possible. 

360
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,160
Make the meringue. 

361
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,760
'Meringue is the perfect foundation for a baked gluten-free dessert.' 

362
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,720
I'm not that good at meringues, mainly because until recently 

363
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,160
I didn't have any sort of electric whisk at home and I'm not going 

364
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,680
to spend half an hour whisking up a meringue so I never really bothered. 

365
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,720
Clearly I need to bother now. 

366
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,560
'It's up to the bakers to decide 

367
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,720
'when to add the meringue's additional ingredients.' 

368
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,080
I'm just adding in the sugar now. 

369
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,600
Glossy, stiff peaks should form. 

370
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,760
I've never put cornflour into a meringue before. 

371
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,200
I would imagine it gives it a bit of substance. 

372
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,960
And once the meringue's all made, then I'll stir through 

373
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,480
the hazelnuts. I might sieve them to get rid of the bigger bits. 

374
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,800
I might stick these in the fridge for a little while. 

375
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,160
I don't think it'll do them any harm. 

376
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,120
I think I'm just folding these in, just fold. 

377
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,520
So you've got to make sure that you don't let the air out. 

378
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,760
Flake the mixture. 

379
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,840
That looks blooming good! 

380
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,160
There isn't much time to mess about with these ones. 

381
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,280
If you make a mistake you'd have to work really quickly 

382
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,960
because the oil in the nuts is starting already 

383
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,680
to break down the egg whites. 

384
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,360
Oh, I think that looks good. You've got no worries. 

385
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Slightly flatulent piping bag, got lots of air pockets. 

386
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,880
It's quite rude, isn't it? 

387
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,720
'Mary's recipe does not specify a baking time.' 

388
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,760
I've no idea how long these need to go in the oven for 

389
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,160
so I'll have to keep an eye on them. 

390
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,120
'The meringue should be baked until just light and crisp. 

391
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,880
'Any further and the hazelnut will become bitter.' 

392
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,640
I just switched the meringues round because I am finding that 

393
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,560
the ones at the bottom actually are browning a little bit quicker 

394
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,320
than the other ones, just to get an even distribution of colour. 

395
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,560
It says the next step on this is to make the ganache. 

396
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,680
But I'd rather get the custard done and cooling, because then 

397
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,920
that needs to have whipped cream folded in, and ganache won't take 

398
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,840
as long to cool so I'm switching round the order a little bit. 

399
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,280
I'm seeing how thick it needs to be, because it's a custard, 

400
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,360
that's what I need to remind myself. 

401
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,640
It's done. 

402
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,840
'A coffee custard forms the base of the creme mousseline.' 

403
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,760
So what's different about this custard? 

404
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,760
Well, it's got the cream going through it 

405
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,440
so it's almost like a slightly more mousse-y custard. 

406
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,600
- It's mousse. 
- Mousseline, ah! Got you. 

407
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,800
'The bakers need to leave enough time for it to cool completely 

408
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,400
'before adding the whipped cream.' 

409
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,560
It just keeps on going on, so many steps to this. 

410
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,920
OK, bakers, that's one hour before there's a mousseline 

411
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,000
loosenine aboot this hooseline... 

412
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It didn't work but you can't fault me trying. 

413
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,800
I don't think it's far off, to be honest with you. 

414
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,760
I'm guessing. 

415
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,800
My meringues are not looking good. They're not crisping up at all. 

416
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,600
Oh, dear, I'm giving up. 

417
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,000
'Whipped cream should be carefully folded into 

418
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,240
'the cooled coffee custard.' 

419
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,800
I don't really know. It looks quite thick, it looks like it's holding. 

420
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,360
'If any air is lost from the mixture, 

421
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,960
'it may not be able to support the layers of meringue.' 

422
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,800
It might not be thick enough but we just have to hope. 

423
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,200
'The meringues need to be out of the oven and given enough time 

424
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,880
'to cool completely before the dacquoise is assembled.' 

425
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,800
Yeah, I'm really happy with those. 

426
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,840
The temperature of the oven's right, it might crisp up. 

427
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,840
I'm going to make some praline now. 

428
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,800
'Sugar needs to be melted until it just caramelises...' 

429
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,680
I just want to make sure I don't miss anything. 

430
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,480
'..Before stirring in hazelnuts and lemon juice.' 

431
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,360
The way it says to do the thing on the spoon, 

432
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,240
that's slightly flummoxing me. 

433
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,520
'Each praline cluster should have three perfectly caramelised nuts.' 

434
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,600
It's just fiddly because it's hot 

435
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,000
and the caramel obviously hardens really quickly. 

436
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,160
'And each dacquoise should have 12 clusters.' 

437
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,120
I'm being really silly and using my fingers. 

438
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,960
Bakers, you've got ten minutes left. 

439
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,360
'Once assembled, each layer of the dacquoise should be distinct.' 

440
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,440
You've got double piping action going on here, what's going on? 

441
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,320
I think I'm going to pipe the coffee one in 

442
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,840
just because otherwise I know I'll just splodge it on. 

443
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,720
If I pipe it, it will be an even layer. 

444
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,080
But then I don't want to squeeze all the air out. 

445
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,800
So maybe we'll just splodge it on. 

446
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,200
Will it take the air out if you pipe? 

447
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,960
I think it might. 

448
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,040
- Splodge then, mate, splodge. 
- Yeah, I might do a splodge.
- Splodge. 

449
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,360
It's just a little bit thin. I should have thickened it 

450
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,760
a little bit more before I took it off the heat. 

451
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,840
So I'm just going to try and neaten it up as much as I can. 

452
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,880
Bakers, you've got five minutes on your nut clustering, 

453
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,880
five minutes to go. 

454
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,320
So, quite large nibbed nuts you've gone for. 

455
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,920
Well, I've sort of done them by hand, yeah. 

456
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,800
We're getting there. 

457
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,520
That's got carpet tile written all over it. 

458
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,080
- Asking for disaster. 
- Oh! Beautifully done. 

459
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,880
It just says, "Pipe swirls of ganache on top 

460
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,440
"and then decorate with the praline." 

461
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,760
That's good, that's good. Yeah, nice and generous. 

462
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,200
Nice and generous. 

463
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,600
Famous Five, your eighth technical challenge is now over, 

464
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,680
please step away from your dacquoises. 

465
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,520
If you'd like to bring them up, 

466
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,080
pop them behind the photo of yourself, I'll start eating them. 

467
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,840
'Mary and Paul will be looking for a delicate and elegant dacquoise, 

468
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,840
'with even layers and firm mousseline, 

469
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,280
'and light, crispy nut meringue.' 

470
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,240
Well, we have five and they look good, don't they? 

471
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,000
Right, we'll start with this one. 

472
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,680
This one's got a decent meringue, it's quite tough, it's got a bit 

473
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,600
of bite to it. You can tell, because it cracked all the way through. 

474
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,880
The filling, it's holding quite well, the praline looks nice. 

475
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,760
We've good definition between the meringue and the filling 

476
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,560
all the way through, you can see the layers quite clearly. 

477
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,640
I think the meringue's crispy enough 

478
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,160
and the flavour's excellent all the way down. 

479
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,600
Let's try the next one. 

480
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,080
This meringue looks pretty poor, actually, 

481
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,920
it's not crispy at all, although the filling's holding quite well. 

482
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,480
The nuts are a little coarser, which gives a better texture. 

483
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,040
The ganache is good. 

484
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,280
- But the custard is not thick enough. 
- No. 

485
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,080
This is interesting. The layers are so thin in that meringue. 

486
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,880
Look at it, it's lost all its definition. 

487
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,400
- It's too chewy. 
- It's been baked too quick. 

488
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,560
It should have taken about an hour in the oven, 

489
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,800
and I think that that would have had considerably less. 

490
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,880
And that means that the meringue hasn't dried out. 

491
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,120
It just looks untidy around the edge, you know. 

492
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,680
We can still see the layers, which is lucky, 

493
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,120
and on top the ganache needed to be left longer 

494
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,040
to become cool to keep the definition of the piping. 

495
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
The cream's quite wet, it needs to be stiffer. 

496
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,280
It's still got some crunch there, though. 

497
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,800
It has got some, yeah. 

498
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,920
They're not very thick, are they, the layers of meringue? 

499
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,560
It's quite neat at the sides, this one. 

500
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,280
You can definitely see the three layers of meringue 

501
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,120
and the two layers of filling. 

502
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,440
- Good crunch.
- It looks good. 

503
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,840
It's neat, it's neat. Yeah. 

504
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,640
'Mary and Paul will now rank the dacquoises.' 

505
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,720
In fifth place - this one. 

506
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,880
Rather an uneven finish and the filling was rather runny. 

507
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,840
Number four is this one. 

508
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,760
Your praline's not very good, your ganache has probably been put on... 

509
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,000
It was just not cool enough. 

510
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,800
And in third place. 

511
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,400
Good even piping, but the meringue itself, a little too runny. 

512
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,000
And number two is this one. 

513
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,520
It came down to the volume in the meringue between one and two. 

514
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,160
And in first place, Ruby! 

515
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,920
Well done, Ruby. 

516
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,720
APPLAUSE 

517
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,520
Good height, good definition of the meringue 

518
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,120
and the filling held together very well. Well done. 

519
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,760
One would have been better, but two's all right. 

520
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,360
I'm astounded. I did not think I was going to win. 

521
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,040
Could have been better, could have been not last. 

522
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,720
Things haven't gone totally to plan, but tomorrow's a new day. 

523
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,680
'One challenge remaining in the quarterfinal.' 

524
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,440
All five bakers fighting it out for a place in the semis. 

525
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,040
Let's start with Ruby. 

526
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,000
Ruby always has a blip, and then instantly rectifies it. 

527
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,440
Is she safe, though, do you think she's in the semis? 

528
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,840
Coming first in the technical, 

529
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,280
if she has a really bad day today it might not be enough. 

530
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,000
Kimberley was second in the technical, 

531
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,800
and she had similar problems with her signature loaf, didn't she? 

532
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,440
The texture was a bit wrong. 

533
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,840
And Frances, who was mid-way in the technical? 

534
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,520
Her Chelsea buns looked so good, it looked so inviting, 

535
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,160
you wanted to tear off a chunk. 

536
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,800
And I think in the Showstopper today, 

537
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,400
I hope she doesn't over decorate it. 

538
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,760
Christine, she had a mix of sort of rice flour and potato flour 

539
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,640
and possibly some tapioca in there, quite well baked, you thought? 

540
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,960
I thought it was OK, I thought she was last, 

541
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,520
she's got to come up today. 

542
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,720
Finally Beca, who came fourth in the technical 

543
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,280
but did very well in her focaccia. 

544
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,040
The flavours that she got, it did look like a focaccia, the structure was all right. 

545
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,400
Does that save her? 

546
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,960
It depends on what she does today, this is the problem. 

547
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,800
It's almost in reverse from signature to technical. 

548
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,600
It could go any way. 

549
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,360
- Well, now I'm on tenterhooks. 
- So am I.
- I can't cope. 

550
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,600
Good morning, bakers, and welcome to the Showstopper Challenge. 

551
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,160
And what you bake today could secure your place in the semifinals, 

552
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,880
so no biggy. 

553
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,480
What we'd like you to bake is a 3-D novelty cake. 

554
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,200
Now this could be in any shape you like - a shoe, a cat, 

555
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,400
a pair of Paul Hollywood's budgie smugglers - we don't mind. 

556
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,520
But it's got to be dairy-free - no butter, no cheese, 

557
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,840
no milk inside or out, none of that. 

558
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,920
Now, bakers, we'd like it to be a vegetable cake, please. 

559
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,960
You can use any vegetables you choose, 

560
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,200
you've got four hours on the clock. So, on your marks... 

561
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,880
- Get set...
- BOTH: Bake! 

562
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,920
'Nearly all recipes for vegetable cake are dairy-free, 

563
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,040
'as they traditionally feature oil rather than butter.' 

564
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,520
Most cakes will have butter in, they'll have eggs, 

565
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,040
they'll have milk in there 

566
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,040
but by taking out the dairy, they've got to think outside the box. 

567
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Then they've got to think of the vegetables. 

568
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,960
The vegetables release oil, they release a natural flavouring, 

569
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,200
and it's about the quantity you put in there, 

570
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,360
because it will restrict and retard whatever flour you're going to use. 

571
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,720
So it's very tricky when you bring all those components together 

572
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,640
to actually bake something that looks good and tastes good. 

573
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,080
Most of them will have made a carrot cake, 

574
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,240
they may even have made a courgette cake 

575
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,480
but they've got to think beyond that. 

576
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,960
It's difficult when you're using vegetables, 

577
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,040
they're often a very close texture, very moist. 

578
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,120
We are looking for a cake with a good base 

579
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,400
and then they've got to be all out for a good decoration. 

580
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,720
I am making a 3-D sweet potato cake 

581
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
in the shape of a guitar. 

582
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,000
I've made it twice, this cake. 

583
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,480
And both times it's come out really good 

584
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,560
so I don't foresee any problems. 

585
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,240
'Christine is flavouring her sweet potato electric guitar with 

586
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,600
'fresh pineapple, spices, and fresh passion fruit icing.' 

587
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,440
It's quite a dense cake, it's a bit like a bread pudding texture. 

588
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,840
It's got lots of spices, it is delicious. 

589
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,480
So what are you using to cover the cake with? 

590
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:15,040
I'm making a marshmallow fondant, which is quite quick to make. 

591
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,840
And what are you thinking? 

592
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,040
Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Brian May, Jimi Hendrix? 

593
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,200
- Brian May. Every time. 
- May, all the time. 

594
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,480
- Jimmy Page.
- Page?
- Jimmy Page. 

595
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,760
My 3-D novelty cake is going to be made into the shape 

596
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,520
of a wooden board with a massive chunk of cheese sat on top. 

597
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,840
'Beca's using butternut squash as the basis for her cheeseboard cake, 

598

599
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,680
I haven't practised this cake, so I don't know how it's going to go. 

600
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,760
Winging it slightly, but, yeah, should all be fine hopefully. 

601
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,080
'Kimberley's also using butternut squash in her cake, 

602
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,440
'inspired by childhood memories.' 

603
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,440
This toadstool cake is the cake my mum made for my brother when he was little, 

604
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,960
so I remember being quite small and fascinated by it. 

605
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,720
I thought it would be quite a nice little kind of tribute 

606
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,080
to those memories. 

607
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,360

'surrounded by fondant decorations.' 

610
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,680
The plan is just to get the cake in as soon as possible. 

611
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:31,240
I want to speed through this part, so I've got as much time as possible 

612
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,080
to do the decorations properly 

613
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,680
without having to feel like I'm rushing them. 

614
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,720
I'm making a carrot cake in the shape of an allotment plot. 

615
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,760
So there's going to be a shed and vegetable beds and stuff like that. 

616
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,200
'Ruby's allotment will have poppy seed soil and pistachio grass, 

617

00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,760
'and a praline roof.' 

619
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,600
So this is your basic cake mixture for the big cake? 

620
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,280
I don't know if this is a big enough bowl for all of that. 

621
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,920
- It's a big mix.
- It's a huge mix. 

622
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,320
Is this the biggest mix you've ever worked with, Ruby? 

623
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,160
I've never made a cake this big, this is really weird for me. 

624
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,240
I can't wait to see how you get on with it. 

625
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,920
Very exciting to do it, quite different 

626
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,240
and I'm looking forward to it.

00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,880
I'm making my hidden carrot cake. 

630
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,720
It's going to be a sort of pot and then I'm having three carrots 

631
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,280
hidden in there and then I'll have dill acting as the carrot top. 

632
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,760
Then I'm going to make some edible bulbs and mini little edible plants 

633
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,880
and then a little plant label topper and some sesame seeds. 

634
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,000

'and orange zest and topped with a ground praline chocolate soil.' 

638
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,680
Well, beetroot and walnuts are so good. And also, I find beetroot is 

639
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:05,280
quite an earthy, soily taste anyway. It's not overpowering and also 

640
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,120
it adds a real nice moistness to the cake because I can't use butter.

643

647
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,680
it's the first time you're going to see her out of her comfort zone 

648

and she's actually making something look very pretty and very different. 

649
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,920
Frances, as usual, is doing lots of intricate things 

650

in her vegetable garden. 

651
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,200
And I just hope she doesn't spend too much time 

652
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,520
on all things round rather than the actual cake.

Christine's will be finished impeccably, 

654
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,720
but I don't like the idea when she said it's a bit like bread pudding. 

655
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,960
The bake itself, the all-important part, well, it's got to be good. 

656
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,240
Not quite, you can see a little bit of wet on the skewer. 

657
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,840
I might give it another five minutes just to be safe. 

658
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,120
Yep, very happy with my cakes. 

659
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,040
OK, cakes...done. 

660
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,120
'Vegetable cakes are heavy, so building them 

661
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:55,320
'into 3-D novelty shapes requires a fair bit of precision.' 

662
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,320
OK, this looks good. There's a lot of construction work on the shed. 

663
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,560
There's quite a lot of construction work going on. 

664
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,680
And can you remember all your measurements? 

665
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,840
I can remember some of my measurements. 

666
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,880
I just need to get them cooled in time, is the only thing now. 

667
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,240
So I can ice them without the buttercream melting off 

668
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,720
or anything like that. 

669
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,000
It's one of those things where it looks really, really rubbish 

670
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,920
until the last few moments when you put the final touches on. 

671
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,960
So let's just hope I have time to do those final touches. 

672
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,440
'Buttercream is often used to decorate and fill cakes, 

673
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,680
'so to make a non-dairy alternative, Christine, Kimberley, Ruby 

674
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,680
'and Beca are using sunflower or soya-based spreads.' 

675
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,880
The problem with using the margarine is, 

676
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,760
it's got quite a high water content 

677
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,680
so it takes loads of sugar to get a decent consistency, 

678
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,480
and what the cider vinegar does is just adds that real... 

679
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,560
You only use a tiny bit 

680
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,440
but it just adds that slight tang to make it more like a cream cheese. 

681
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,640
'Frances is going one step further, 

682
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,040
'by making a non-dairy dark chocolate fudge sauce.' 

683
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:16,120
I use coconut cream with chocolate and golden syrup and orange rind. 

684
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,200
It quite tastes like that famous lovely chocolate orange bar 

685
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,680
at the end of it all. 

686
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,040
I thought I was tidy before I came on here 

687
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,480
and then it became very clear to me that I was anything but. 

688
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,400
I guess I am just messy, I'm just messy. 

689
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,320
GLASS BREAKS 

690
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,320
I'm so sorry. 

691
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,920
I'm so sorry! 

692
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,560
I'm so sorry! It's like the Incredible Hulk! 

693
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,560
Oh, no, I'm too embarrassed to bake any more! I can't do it. 

694
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,480
I'm just about to make my front door. 

695
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:09,400
It's quite outside my comfort zone, this kind of baking. I don't do 

696
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,280
cake decorating, I've never actually done any real cake decorating. 

697
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,040
So it's a real step outside for me, 

698
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,880
but hopefully I can do a good job of it. 

699
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,360

00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,360
It is quite a fun bit, this, it's quite fiddly, 

702
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,600
it's quite therapeutic, I find. 

703
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,080
I like little details and I've got an image of what this cake looks like 

704
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,800
in my head and I'm just trying to replicate it as best I can. 

705
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,520

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,680
It's still sort of hot, it's lovely. 

708
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,080
Yeah, but the more I knead it, it'll get cold, 

709
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,440
then I can use it straightaway. 

710
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,560
It is a messy procedure but it makes lovely fondant. 

711
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,280
It is, I feel like I'm in a Kate Bush video in the late '70s. 

712
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,760
'Ruby and Frances are channelling their inner chocolatier

I didn't know it was possible to burn chocolate. 

715
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,600
I've achieved it, I've achieved it. 

716
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:30,000
Look at this Vesuvian marvel. Gosh, that is quite a dense crust on that. 

717
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,200
- That's not going to go in the soil. 
- No, I think probably not. 

718
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:40,280
I'm making the wooden planks from the shed and for the vegetable beds 

719
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,520
and so I'm just moving the chocolate over the templates. 

720
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,400
The chocolate that I may or may not have tempered successfully. 

721
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:57,280
Bakers, you've got 18 minutes of novelty cakery 3-D-ness to go, 18. 

722
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:10,080
So I'm just filling the cake with the carrots at the moment. 

723
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,280
This whole thing is very pressurised but I've just got to 

724
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,080
concentrate on each task and not think about what could go wrong. 

725
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,480
I'm just making the roof for the shed, so it's basically 

726
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,360
a caramel that gets poured over these almonds, and then basically 

727
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,840
I cut that into two halves, so two rectangles for the roof. 

728
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,120
Are those pebbles edible as well? 

729
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,560
Yep, everything's edible because I know Mary's 

730
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,880
- quite a stickler for everything on there being edible.
- Totally. 

731
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,000
Is the board edible? 

732
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,720
THEY LAUGH 

733
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:58,320
Not far off. I've just got to string it, as yet it's not playable. 

734
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,440
- Do you want to stay until next week? How much?
- So much. 

735
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,200
This much? 

736
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,080
No. The size of this tent and 20 million times more. 

737
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,800
You're enjoying this, Beca, I can tell. 

738
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,560
Love it. Absolutely love it. 

739
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,400
- You thrive in a competitive atmosphere, don't you?
- Massively. 

740
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,840
OK, bakers, five minutes left on your 

741
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,240
three-dimensional vegetable challenge. 

742
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,720
At the moment, it's obviously still got a way to go, but it's not 

743
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,640
the mess I thought it would be halfway through this challenge, 

744
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,600
because I was doing really badly and now I'm just doing quite badly. 

745
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,120
I don't want to look. 

746
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,680
I've just put the roof on, put the butterflies on 

747
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,320
and see if I can make a bird's nest. 

748
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,680
I do feel that this is quite an important bake for me. 

749
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,480
Oh, there's more to do, there's always more. 

750
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,520
What can I do, love? Tidy. I need to tidy. 

751
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,880
It's OK because any of these bits might actually be vegetables. 

752
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,240
OK. OK. 

753
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,560
Ooh, my little knob's fallen out. 

754
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,960
Bakers, your showstoppers have almost showstopped. 

755
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,440
One minute to go. 

756
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,480
OK, those turnip towers, those swede sponges are over, 

757
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:24,200
baking has finished, so please, put your vegetables to the end of the bench. 

758
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,480
Oh, Frances, what have you done? 

759
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,440
I've gone crazy. 

760
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,760
It looks amazing. 

761
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,320
Yours does as well, Ruby. 

762
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,080
Oh, it's a mess. 

763
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,760
I've got a lopsided shed. Ridiculous, it's going to fall over. 

764
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,400
If I haven't earned a place in the semifinal, 

765
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,920
with that final bake, then I don't deserve to be there 

766
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,960
because that's probably, at this stage, the best that I can do. 

767
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,080
I think it looks great, great detail which I like anyway. 

768
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,320
And very precise. I will go straight through the middle. 

769
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,640
It is the texture that you expect from butternut squash, 

770
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,120
pumpkin, they're always very moist 

771
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,920
and this one's quite close textured, but it's a good flavour. 

772
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,080
It's a good thing you've got that icing on it 

773
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,040
because the actual cake itself is not sweet. 

774
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,840
No, the filling's good, it's the filling that balances it all out. 

775
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,360
It is baked, it's full of flavour, 

776
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,840
the spices blend really well with it as well. 

777
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,680
I think it's been executed perfectly. 

778
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,520
I mean, you've managed to come up with something that looks 

779
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,680
very good and the bake inside is excellent. 

780
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,640
I feel pleased with what I've presented in there 

781
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,440
and I hope it is enough to get me through to the semis. 

782
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,000
I hope the taste comes across as much as the final look of it all. 

783
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,360
Just looking at it, there's an element 

784
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,040
that I'm not too happy about and that is that you've spent 

785
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,640
an awful lot of time doing things 

786
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,440
but you haven't made your pots. 

787
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,400
Oh, right. 

788
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,840
MEL: Oh, that's clever. 

789
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,760
There's no icing in it. 

790
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,520
The middle of that cake, the carrot is dry. 

791
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,920
The outside of the cake is quite dense. 

792
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,120
It's moist, but you couldn't have more than a thimble full 

793
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,040
because your mouth would just seize up. 

794
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,120
It's too bitter. 

795
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,960
It's like sometimes when you eat a rich, expensive dark chocolate, 

796
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,360
you can't eat a lot of it. 

797
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,840
You can eat a little piece and then you're finished. 

798
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,520
And I think on this occasion, 

799
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,480
style and substance may come into play again. 

800
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,680
To be honest, that is 

801
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,400
the most highly finished thing I've ever made. 

802
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,480
I've never done anything anywhere near that level of decoration before 

803
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,480
so for me it's good, for me it's like a personal best. 

804
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,640
I think you've done some very clever things here. 

805
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,560
I think the caramel roof, I've never seen that before. 

806
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,760
And that's what we're always looking for, something original. 

807
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,240
I love the idea of the poppy seed. 

808
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,400
I like what you've done to the top of the cake, 

809
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,480
your chocolate work's good as well. 

810
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,000
I do like the excess of pistachio nuts, 

811
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,120
that really comes through. 

812
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,600
The bake's great on the cake, it's got a great flavour. 

813
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,440
Good amount of ingredients in there and textures. 

814
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,760
Are you pleased with it? 

815
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,960
It's probably the best-looking thing I've ever made. 

816
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,760
Yay, you said something positive! 

817
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,840
I know I was taking a bit of a risk making a cake 

818
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,800
that I'd never made or practised before 

819
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,040
but it looked exactly how I wanted it to, 

820
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,680
if not actually better than 

821
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,240
I had anticipated in my head. So really, really chuffed. 

822
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,080
It's very simple, but effective. 

823
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:31,000
I like...it's sharp, you know exactly what it is. 

824
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,360
But for me that cake has to taste fantastic. 

825
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,560
- Can I take that off? 
- Yeah. Absolutely. 

826
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,040
I'm afraid the cake for me doesn't have a great deal of flavour. 

827
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,800
No flavour. The only flavour I'm getting is sweetness from the icing. 

828
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,440
I'm not convinced you weighed everything up properly. 

829
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,400
- Really?
- Mmm. 

830
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,720
There's just no flavour, it's like an after-taste, 

831
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:58,000
sometimes of ginger, but it's just bland all the way through. 

832
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,920
I think it's such a wonderful looking cake, it looks such fun 

833
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,320
but the disappointment is when you get into the cake 

834
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,120
which is rather sad. 

835
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,040
I'm really disappointed that it's not tasting as it should, 

836
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,120
- and I can only apologise for that. 
- Thank you very much. 

837
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,920
I really, really enjoyed that bake. 

838
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,120
The cakes came out superbly, 

839
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,440
better even than I've made them at home, 

840
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,920
so I'm pretty confident that Paul and Mary will like the cake. 

841
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,520
I like the simplicity, I like the way you've shaped it yourself, 

842
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,760
it's very effective. 

843
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,320
The one thing I want to know is what it's like inside. 

844
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,640
It's got to taste good. 

845
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,200
Too bland. 

846
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:58,480
Now the problem is, the outside is beautiful, that chewiness, 

847
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,320
it's got sweetness to it, it's not too much, I think it's perfect. 

848
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,640
I've never seen that before and it really does work. 

849
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,240
The inside is quite... 

850
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,560
It doesn't hit you between the teeth. 

851
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,440
It's got quite a lot of spice in it. 

852
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,560
Yeah, I'm getting some of that, it just doesn't overwhelm me. 

853
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:21,040
It needed a point, one thing that ran through it to make it stand out. 

854
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,680
If there had been a little more of the passion icing, 

855
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,800
that would have helped. 

856
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,480
I would have liked a bit more spice in the cake itself. 

857
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,960
You don't get the passion fruit, it doesn't come through. 

858
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,400
I had a couple of bites and it just didn't come through. 

859
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,760
That line round the outside, 

860
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,320
if you had more of that, then perhaps that was the answer as well. 

861
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,040
I thought this was good. 

862
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,320
And I put everything into it, so if it is me going today, 

863
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,560
I feel I've done my best. 

864
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,720
This just means so much and I would hate to go out on a cake that 

865
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,360
actually means so much to me that I felt really fitted the brief. 

866
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,720
You know, this whole style over substance thing. 

867
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:14,120
I felt the substance was there and I can pack so much more substance in. 

868
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,600
I'm really annoyed that I'm so upset about it 

869
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,440
but that was just brutal, just really horrible. 

870
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,000
It's just a waiting game now to see what's happening, 

871
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,760
and it's horrible, it really is. 

872
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,960
Some fairly harsh, uncompromising judging there. 

873
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,440
You didn't pull your punches, judges. 

874
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,720
It's the quarterfinals going into the semifinals, 

875
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,400
you have to be honest with them. We praised where praise was needed 

876
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,760
and we were critical, I think, where criticism had to be placed. 

877
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,320
I tell you when Mel and I found it a little harsh, correct me 

878
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,320
if I'm wrong, but particularly with Frances. 

879
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,880
There's a lot of process there. 

880
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,320
She is brilliant really, 

881
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,920
but she will not concentrate on the main thing, the cake. 

882
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,440
She often goes off on the fringe things, 

883
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,720
the little additions that she puts on. 

884
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,280
Again, you're looking at style/substance again 

885
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,200
and how many times have we said that to her? 

886
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,560
- About 11,000.
- She'd mid-way ranking on the technical bake. 

887
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,840
Do you think because of your feelings about this cake 

888
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,800
that's put her in trouble? 

889
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,040
It's put her in trouble, but I'm going back to those wonderful 

890
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,680
Chelsea buns, and gosh those were good. 

891
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:26,920
Let's move onto boogie sponge-a-land, Christine's amazing orange guitar. 

892
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,960
It needed one flavour to come through, 

893
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,440
or something to lift it up and lighten it. 

894
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,600
I didn't get any passion fruit at all. All I was interested in 

895
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,840
was the icing around the outside because that is delicious. 

896
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,000
She did come last in Technical 

897
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,640
and her gluten-free bread actually was all right. 

898
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,080
So where does that leave Christine then? 

899
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,280
I think, for me, in the danger zone. 

900
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,120
Now Beca's, you thought, was possibly a bit on the simple side. 

901
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,360
Well, look at it, it is simple. 

902
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,280
From your comments, you found that the blandest of all the cakes. 

903
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,120
Yes, I did, you're right. 

904
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,080
And she did come fourth in the Technical Challenge. 

905
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,160
This has brought her right down from focaccia glory. 

906
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:09,320
OK, let's turn our view to Ruby who, I think it's fair to say, 

907
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,000
has had a pretty good weekend. 

908
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,880
She was top of the Technical, and her loaf tasted good. 

909
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,280
But this has taken Ruby into a new direction, 

910
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,560
this allotment and shed cake, hasn't it? 

911
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,880
There's a lot of techniques in there and overall, artistic at the end. 

912
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,920
And she just got there, there was a huge mess on her table 

913
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,600
and in the middle there was this delightful allotment. 

914
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,560
Which leaves us with the magic mushroom. 

915
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,720
Now, you thought the texture and taste was pretty good. 

916
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,560
When you look at what Kimberley did, the textures, the structure, 

917
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,920
the stability, the attention to detail, 

918
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,760
the flavour of that, the cream running through it, all good. 

919
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,560
So where does that leave Kimberley? 

920
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,760
I think Kimberley's up there, you know, in line with... 

921
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,160
she's up there, possibly Star Baker. 

922
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,520
- OK.
- But having said that... 

923
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,360
- Ruby?
- Ruby's up there for Star Baker as well. 

924
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,720
OK, well, two at the top and three at the bottom, 

925
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,920
a lot of decisions and discussions to have. 

926
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,440
That's between Mary and I. 

927
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:24,640
Bakers, very tough judging today and equally tough deliberations. 

928
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,560
You are all so very good, it gets harder and harder. 

929
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:33,440
Thankfully, this week I have the pleasant side of the deal 

930
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,280
in that I get to award Star Baker. 

931
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,480
And this week it goes to a woman. 

932
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,200
THEY LAUGH 

933
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,720
Do you need more clues? 

934
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,240
OK, this is a woman who's mastered the dacquoise, 

935
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,760
this is a woman who serves everything with a side order 

936
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,120
of size, this is a woman who makes the best tasting roof I've ever had. 

937
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,560
Ruby, congratulations, you're our Star Baker. 

938
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,040
And I've got the miserable job. 

939
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,800
Paul and Mary have said that this is the closest quarterfinal 

940
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:08,160
we've ever had. One of you will have to go, and the person that 

941
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,160
we have great sadness in saying goodbye to... 

942
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,840
is... 

943
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,120
..Christine. 

944
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,320
Oh, Christine, my love. Have a big sandwich, come on. 

945
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,680
You'll be so terribly missed. 

946
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,160
I have learnt so much over these eight weeks, 

947
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:51,120
it's been the best thing I've ever done in my life by a mile. 

948
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,240
And I haven't had a boring life. 

949
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,200
You are brilliant, you are brilliant. 

950
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,840
It was very, very difficult to choose. 

951
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:04,840
Ultimately it came down to taste, texture and appearance. 

952
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,720
Ruby showed all the skills, she tempered her chocolate, 

953
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,400
every item was made by her. 

954
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,920
The whole finish was enchanting, she deserved to be Star Baker. 

955
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,720
I think this weekend's really helped to build my confidence. 

956
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,560
Up until now, I've focused only on the current week 

957
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,280
but I guess I would like to get to the final. 

958
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,440
All along I had week nine in my sights and I've got it now 

959
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,480
so I need to really prove my worth. 

960
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,640
I don't want to change the way I think, 

961
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,760
the way I design in the kitchen. 

962
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:44,480
It's been tough but hopefully it'll make me stronger. 

963
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:50,360
Now the margin of error is, I don't think there is one actually. 

964
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,840
The pressure now is about bringing perfection to every bake. 

965
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,440
'Next time, the semifinalists take on the French.' 

966
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,960
Bienvenue a la demi-finale de Great British Bake Off. 

967
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,160
'The four remaining bakers bake savoury signature canape.' 

968
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,720
Have you just gone freestyle? 

969
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,200
- I haven't got time, really. 
- You daredevil. 

970
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,960
'A Technical Challenge that's enough to make their heads hurt.' 

971
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,960
This is going to be a mess, it really will look like a brain. 

972
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,920
'And a Showstopper that has to hit the right note.' 

973
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,040
SING-SONG: Ground up something or other, I don't know what that is. 

974
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,840
SING-SONG: It's grounded banana chips.
