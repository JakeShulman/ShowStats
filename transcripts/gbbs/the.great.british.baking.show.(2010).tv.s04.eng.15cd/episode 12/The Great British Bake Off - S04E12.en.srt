00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,080
Over ten weeks, The Great British Bake Off 

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,680
pushed 13 of Britain's best amateur bakers to their limit... 

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,160
..as they battled it out to be crowned this year's winner. 

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,800
Success! Ha-ha! 

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,000
Some proved they had what it takes... 

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,360
Yes! 

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,240
..while others melted in the heat of the moment. 

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,640
Oh...ooh, I feel sick, making this! 

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,520
Every week, the bakers were set three challenges... 

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,600
- I'm behind.
- Yep.
- Stressed.
- Yep. 

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,920
The Signature Bake showcased their personality 

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,280
and creative flair. 

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,480
All in all... 

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,800
..not a good bake. 

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,360
The terrifying Technical, 

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,640
where their intuition and instinct were put under a microscope. 

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,840
I mean...what? 

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,000
There will be grandmothers up and down the country 

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,840
being like, "Oh, she can't even make a piping bag." 

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,400
And the Showstopper, 

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,880
where nothing less than absolutely spectacular 

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,440
was expected. 

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,040
Casting their critical eye were Bake Off's very own judges - 

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,080
doyen of the dough Paul Hollywood 

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,840
and renowned home cook Mary Berry. 

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,800
Oh, dear - it's so doughy, and it's not well-risen. 

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,000
I can't eat this. 

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
It's totally different. Never seen anything like it before. 

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,120
It is a piece of art. 

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,440
HOWARD LAUGHS 

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,440
I've been baking for 50 years. 

32
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,040
and I've learnt lots of new ideas from our bakers. 

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,240
How about that? 

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,120
The standard in the tent got higher and higher. 

35
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,760
They actually inspired me as well 

36
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,040
with a couple of new ideas I'd never seen before, 

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,600
which never happened before. 

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,920
But now it's Mary and Paul's turn to get baking themselves... 

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,080
You like doing that. 

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,040
What Mary and I are going to show you 

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,480
are our favourite Signatures, our favourite Technicals 

42
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,920
and our favourite Showstopper challenges. 

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,880
..giving us their own delectable take on cakes and breads. 

44
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,680
To be honest with you, Mary, I've been dying to eat this all day. 

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,160
Coming up, Mary's moist, citrusy sandwich cake, 

46
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,960
filled with orange butter cream, 

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,880
the angel food cake with its soft light sponge 

48
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,240
and a sumptuous lemon and passion fruit curd, 

49
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,520
Paul's crunchy yeasted breadsticks 

50
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,240
packed full of juicy whole green olives 

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,840
and a delightful English muffin 

52
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,320
with its soft pillowy centre and a golden brown top. 

53
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,800
Finally, Mary and Paul give you their take 

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,520
on week one's Showstopper - 

55
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,040
a gorgeous three-tiered chocolate fudge gateaux, 

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,800
encased in swirls of tempered chocolate. 

57
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,120
And if you've ever wondered how to pull off 

58
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,600
a perfectly-plaited loaf, 

59
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
or create beautiful two-tone icing rosettes, 

60
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,680
Mary and Paul show you how to get the perfect results 

61
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,040
with some quick tips. 

62
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Mary and I are going to show you some techniques, some styles, 

63
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,760
some creative ideas that will take your baking to another level. 

64
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,240
This year, the bakers began with cakes, 

65
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,560
starting with a deceptively simple home baking staple - 

66
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,760
their take on a classic sandwich cake. 

67
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,560
What Mary and Paul are looking for 

68
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,520
is a twist on a British classic - a sandwich cake. 

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,440
The filling of your sandwich can be anything from lemon drizzle, 

70
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,000
coffee and walnut, ham, 

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
to a classic Victoria. 

72
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,360
You've got two hours to bake, decorate and serve your cakes, and... 

73
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,840
Mel, if you'd like to dust down that catch phrase. 

74
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,640
- For the first time - on your marks...
- Get set... 

75
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,720
BOTH: Bake! 

76
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,000
It's a cardamom sponge. I went to India last year. 

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,760
It would have been fresh cardamom there, 

78
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,320
and I had cardamom in lots of different food. 

79
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,840
I'm making cake, I think. Lemon and poppy seed cake. 

80
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,600
Comes out really nice, as long as I don't put too much lemon in. 

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,320
Which I've done before. 

82
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,640
I'm putting it in sandwich moulds, so it's going to be sliced up 

83
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,480
like a giant jam sandwich, Victoria sponge. 

84
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,760
Normally people like my cakes. 

85
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,560
But then the people who eat my cakes 

86
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,200
aren't normally professionals, or judges...or professional judges. 

87
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,400
Mary's sandwich cake uses a simple but unusual ingredient throughout. 

88
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,840
What are you going to make? 

89
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,000
If this was your challenge, what would you do? 

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,440
I'm going to make a whole spiced orange cake. 

91
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,120
It really is rather different 

92
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,720
and has a wonderful, strong orange flavour 

93
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,160
with a little bit of spice. 

94
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,160
Cook a whole orange 

95
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,280
by placing it in a pan of boiling water 

96
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,800
for 30 minutes until soft. 

97
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,840
You just put in a point of a knife and when it comes out easily, 

98
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,040
you know it's done. 

99
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,520
There's the orange, all beautifully soft, 

100
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,040
and to chop it up, I use a processor. 

101
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,880
We do not want a smooth puree. 

102
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,760
We want nice little bits in there. 

103
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,560
That consistency is just perfect. 

104
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,000
It really does give it the most lovely orange flavour. 

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,320
That little bit of a kick to it as well 

106
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,120
and then the sweetness inside. 

107
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,360
It's a good idea to use the whole thing. 

108
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,040
I'm going to take two tablespoonfuls, ready for the icing, 

109
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,520
and that will give flavour to the icing. 

110
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,040
This is ready to go back into the actual cake mixture. 

111
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,800
So the cake mixture is a classic Victoria sandwich mixture, 

112
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,120
with added spices. 

113
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,440
For Mary's simple all-in-one cake mix, 

114
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,320
start by taking four eggs. 

115
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,040
If I do that, it goes all the way down the side. 

116
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,160
It doesn't really matter, does it? 

117
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,720
But you like doing that. You like doing that. 

118
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,960
Add 275g of self-raising flour 

119
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,600
and two level teaspoons of baking powder. 

120
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,720
Now you may be thinking, 

121
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,080
"Why am I adding baking powder to self-raising flour?" 

122
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,280
For the all-in-one method, 

123
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,520
I've always added just a little baking powder. 

124
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,080
If you add too much, it will rise up and fall down again in the oven. 

125
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,280
- Yes. 
- So it's not clever to add too much. 

126
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,320
Then add one teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 

127
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,200
one teaspoon of mixed spice, 

128
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,120
275g of baking spread 

129
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,560
and 275g of caster sugar. 

130
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,760
So just put that on and mix it until it's blended together. 

131
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,320
Don't go on and on, because it doesn't make a better mixture. 

132
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,000
Just until everything's smooth. 

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,320
Overworking the mixture 

134
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,960
will develop the gluten in the flour, 

135
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,720
resulting in a heavy sponge. 

136
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,080
It's very quick - just check and have a look. 

137
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,760
That's fine. 

138
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,440
If you haven't got a processor, 

139
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,280
you've chopped up the orange by hand, 

140
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,480
you could do it with a hand beater, all in one, or with a wooden spoon. 

141
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,360
Now is the stage to add this brightly-coloured orange. 

142
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,720
- That literally took seconds, didn't it?
- It did. 

143
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,200
You should have a thick drop batter that holds the fruit in place. 

144
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,680
Once blended, divide the mixture equally between two 20cm cake tins 

145
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,520
and smooth out until even. 

146
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,000
Well, those look fine and the oven is set. 

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,800
160 fan. That's 180 conventional. 

148
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,960
About 30 to 35 minutes. 

149
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,920
Every oven has different instructions. 

150
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,120
You know your own oven at home. It may take longer than I say. 

151
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,800
Put both tins on the same shelf and keep the oven door closed 

152
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,480
until the cakes are coming away from the sides, 

153
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,840
otherwise they could sink - as one of our bakers found out. 

154
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Oh! What...? 

155
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,200
That...is not cooking. 

156
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,400
No, no, no, no. 

157
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,680
MARK LAUGHS 

158
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,080
No, no, no! 

159
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,240
- Smell that. The orange and the spices are coming through.
- Lovely. 

160
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,160
- Most people get hold of that... 
- Watch your fingers, Mary. 

161
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
You've got asbestos fingers, haven't you? 

162
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,760
That's exactly what the children say 

163
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,880
when I take hot plates out of the oven. 

164
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,720
- Most people would turn that straight on to the rack.
- Yeah. 

165
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,440
And then you get the imprint on the top. 

166
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,960
So if you actually put that between, like that, 

167
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
and then lift that off. 

168
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,120
And then you can peel the paper off at this stage or later, 

169
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,880
but it does let you see the beautiful even colour. 

170
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,720
You then take this and flip it over like that. 

171
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,240
I'll leave those to get quite cold, put them over here. 

172
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,120
And the icing is a butter icing, but butter icing with a difference. 

173
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,280
To make the icing, 

174
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,680
cream 50g of softened butter in a bowl 

175
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
until it's light, fluffy and pale. 

176
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,120
Then sift in 175g of icing sugar. 

177
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,200
So will you put in 250g full-fat mascarpone? 

178
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,960
Look carefully on the label. 

179
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,320
If you get low fat, it's watery and the icing will be too runny. 

180
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,040
Nothing better than full-fat, Mary. 

181
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,600
Nothing wrong with full fat, I've said it so many times. 

182
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,480
Just have a smaller slice. 

183
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,760
HE LAUGHS 

184
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,160
Doesn't work with me. 

185
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,240
So you can put all that in now. 

186
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,000
Oops! 

187
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,520
PAUL CHUCKLES 

188
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,120
Look at it! 

189
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
I'll get my own back. 

190
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,800
Whisk everything together until you have a smooth mix. 

191
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,600
Lastly, in goes the reserved orange. Then just work that in. 

192
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,360
You can do it with a wooden spoon or you can do it like this. 

193
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,280
It then has this lovely, bright orange colour. 

194
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,680
That's it. So there's the mixture. It's a good colour. 

195
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,680
It's obvious that it's orange 

196
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,000
and it's spreadable, holding its shape. 

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,440
Just what we want it to be. 

198
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,520
To pack in more of her citrus icing, 

199
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,120
Mary creates four layers out of the two sandwich cakes. 

200
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,080
The bottom layer can go straight on the actual serving dish. 

201
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,480
- Get that out of your way. 
- There we are. 

202
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,160
Now you can look and see the mixture. 

203
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,800
It's well-risen, it's even aeration in there 

204
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,440
and the little flecks of orange. 

205
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,960
- It's beautiful. It smells fantastic. 
- Doesn't it?
- Yeah. 

206
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,520
So just spread it fairly evenly, right to the edges there. 

207
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,640
- You want to see it, don't you? 
- You want to see it. 

208
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,560
Then we put the next one on top. 

209
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,440
Dividing your icing into quarters 

210
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,280
will give you an equal amount of icing on each layer. 

211
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,480
Pop that over the top. 

212
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,520
Press it down with your hands 

213
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,080
so that your icing is just coming out. 

214
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,480
Scrape every scrap out of the bowl. Just level that all the way round. 

215
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,040
So that's our cake, but it just needs to be made more elegant. 

216
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,480
Simple decoration can be very effective. 

217
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,400
Something which some of our bakers may have forgotten. 

218
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,920
I was going to cut it into the shape of a lemon 

219
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,280
but it turns out I'm cutting off the only bit of the cake 

220
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,600
that's actually cooked. 

221
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,960
Oh, God. 

222
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,440
I am just going to cover it in the butter cream. 

223
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,080
Hopefully the expert bakers won't notice that it's terrible. 

224
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,480
MARK CHUCKLES 

225
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,400
Right - the decoration I've chosen to do 

226
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,400
is to take a slightly larger orange and crystallise it. 

227
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,800
Hold it firmly, it doesn't matter which way up you've got it, 

228
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,720
and press that very, very hard and pull strips from it. 

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,360
This simple, tasty decoration of crystallised orange zest 

230
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,840
is made by peeling thin strips of orange. 

231
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,480
And it isn't difficult to do and it's not really very wasteful, 

232
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,240
- because you can use the orange in fruit salad afterwards.
- Yeah. 

233
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,440
Place in a pan with 50g of sugar. Add water. 

234
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,240
I'm going to shake that a bit and let that bubble up 

235
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,240
and it'll take about ten minutes. 

236
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,480
Keep an eye on it. 

237
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,360
Then drain, dry off and place onto a lined baking tray. 

238
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,080
And then you just sprinkle sugar, caster sugar, over the top, 

239
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,760
and leave it on top of a radiator for about 12 hours. 

240
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,160
And you could just put a little design around the outside. 

241
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,000
And everybody gets to taste. 

242
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,200
This is one of my favourite cakes. 

243
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,520
It's the sort of cake that I have in the cake tin. 

244
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,600
- Would you be tempted? 
- I would be tempted. 

245
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
It's simple, but there's been another element added, 

246
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,320
which is the orange. 

247
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,920
You just want to eat it now. 

248
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,480
I just...oh, yeah. 

249
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,760
I think we'll save it for a little bit later. 

250
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,480
- Oh, Paul!
- Oh Paul? 
- You can't wait, can you? 

251
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,680
That's ridiculous. 

252
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,240
It's nothing if not fresh. 

253
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,280
That was more than the slice that I had accounted for. 

254
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,000
It's supposed to serve eight. 

255
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,640
It's moist, got a great sponge. 

256
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,200
I think that with a cup of tea would be a marriage made in heaven. 

257
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,320
Well, to think that a cake that I've made for you 

258
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,240
is a marriage made in heaven, I think that is a compliment. 

259
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,400
- Thank you very much. MUFFLED:
- No problem. 

260
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,760
And now, Paul's top tip for a perfectly-plaited loaf. 

261
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,200
I'm going to show you how to make a basic plait. 

262
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,680
Watch carefully. 

263
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,640
Bring your dough out of the bowl. 

264
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,400
Divide it into two, 

265
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,560
right down the middle. 

266
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,040
Roll each piece out by stretching it, 

267
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,240
flattening it down. 

268
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,960
Use your knuckles 

269
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,160
and then roll out - 

270
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,400
all the same, right the way along. 

271
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,600
Likewise, the second one. Perfect - two of them. 

272
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,840
Now the plaiting. 

273
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,440
Shape it into a cross. 

274
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,720
What you've got to do is use these two, then those two. 

275
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,320
You start with the top, move it down one. 

276
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,360
This one is the opposite side, you move it down two, 

277
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,960
so you go one-two, move it up. 

278
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,320
Again, this one comes down one, this one goes up two. 

279
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,840
This one comes down one, 

280
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,200
this goes up two. 

281
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,560
Same again. 

282
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,080
Down one, up two. 

283
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,960
Down one, up two. 

284
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,560
Down one, up two - all the way down to the bottom 

285
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,240
and you end up with a beautiful plait, 

286
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,920
just like that. 

287
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,520
The second bake of Cake Week 

288
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,360
was the one bakers had been dreading - 

289
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,960
their first ever Technical Challenge. 

290
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,480
As always, they had no clue what they might be baking, 

291
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,760
so Mary kicked off with a classic cake 

292
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,960
that's notoriously difficult to get right. 

293
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,360
Bakers, it's time for your first Technical Challenge. 

294
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,840
Let's have a communal shoulder roll. De-stress. 

295
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,200
Devilishly difficult, Beelzebub's last stand - 

296
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,560
it's an angel food cake. 

297
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,360
This is a delicate, light sponge topped with whipped cream 

298
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,160
and drizzled with a lemon and passion fruit curd. 

299
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,280
- On your marks...
- Get set... 
- BOTH: Bake! 

300
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,120
I've never seen an angel food cake. 

301
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,920
If I was expecting to be spoon fed, I don't think it's going to happen. 

302
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,720
Although difficult, Mary will explain 

303
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,240
how to achieve a beautiful angel food cake in simple steps. 

304
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,680
This is a first. We've never had this on the Bake Off. 

305
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,840
It's a wonderful, traditional white cake. 

306
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,640
It's white because it's made from just the egg whites. 

307
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,080
A good recipe, it will work. 

308
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,800
But you've got to take great care. 

309
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,680
Start by separating ten large eggs, 

310
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,160
setting aside the yolks for later to make the lemon curd. 

311
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,120
Now you see the way that egg white clings to the egg yolk. 

312
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,400
That shows a really fresh egg. 

313
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,320
Add the finely-grated zest of two unwaxed lemons, 

314
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,040
one teaspoon of cream of tartar, 

315
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,840
half a teaspoon of salt 

316
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,360
and a tablespoon of lemon juice. 

317
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,200
I'm going to make this in a big freestanding mixer 

318
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,960
because there's an awful lot to whisk. 

319
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,000
Beat it until it sort of looks like cloud. 

320
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,880
Whisk the egg whites on a high speed for about one minute. 

321
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,280
Angel food cake's light and delicate sponge 

322
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,880
gets its rise and height from the air in this meringue-like mix. 

323
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
Ah...peace reigns. 

324
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,200
Now that is frothy, it's light. 

325
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,080
If you've got a hand mixer, you need the biggest bowl you've got. 

326
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,800
So I'm going to add now, on full speed, 

327
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,320
little by little, the sugar, 

328
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,120
and it will get much firmer. 

329
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,240
A spoonful at a time, add 200g of caster sugar 

330
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,280
until you have a firm meringue. 

331
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,440
Now that's done. It's risen well up the bowl. 

332
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,200
It's lovely and frothy. 

333
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,600
Then add to your meringue a mix of 125g of plain flour 

334
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,640
and 100g of caster sugar. 

335
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,200
You've got to get that flour in beautifully evenly 

336
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,720
without having pockets of flour. 

337
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,480
Keeping that lightness in the meringue, 

338
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,520
that delicacy, that air in the meringue. 

339
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,000
That's the key to this. 

340
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,920
Adding flour turns the mix from a meringue to a cake. 

341
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,840
But you must take care not to knock the air out. 

342
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,920
I don't know whether to sift the flour in 

343
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,160
or whether to mix some of this with that 

344
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,240
and then fold through the rest. 

345
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,640
I think I'll just sift it in gradually. 

346
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,160
Will I? I'm not sure. 

347
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,200
You spend a lot of time getting air into the egg whites 

348
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,080
and then you have to not get rid of it. 

349
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,920
The easiest task becomes like a minefield of difficulties 

350
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,840
in the Technical Challenge. 

351
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,480
I'm massacring it. 

352
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,920
I've got all the air out of it, somehow. 

353
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,840
I'm going to have to start again. 

354
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,880
This airy, delicate mixture needs a unique kind of tin. 

355
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,400
So this is a special tin for making angel cake in. 

356
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,520
It has a loose base like this. 

357
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,600
But not everybody's got that tin 

358
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,800
and perhaps you don't want to go out and buy one, 

359
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,440
so I've got a sort of suggestion here, 

360
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,360
after a lot of experimenting. 

361
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,120
Take a 24cm to 28cm spring form tin, 

362
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,760
place an empty drinks can in the centre 

363
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,040
and line the bottom with baking parchment. 

364
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,640
Right, move that to one side and we'll use our special tin. 

365
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,600
You don't grease it. 

366
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,320
If you grease the tin, it has nothing to support it, 

367
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,840
because it grips all the way up and hangs to the side of the tin 

368
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,800
and that's very important. 

369
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,440
So we just tip that in... 

370
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,520
- Do you want me to hold that, Mary? 
- That's lovely. 

371
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,120
Don't hold it from a great height, 

372
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,080
because you'll lose some of the air that you've meticulously beaten in. 

373
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,840
Level out the mixture, then put in an oven for 45 minutes. 

374
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,040
Set at 170 degrees, or 150 degrees for a fan oven, 

375
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,400
until the cake is well-risen up the sides 

376
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,640
and golden brown on top. 

377
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,960
Here we go, then. 

378
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Leave to cool upside down. 

379
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,480
Does that mean the cake or me? 

380
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,400
Very weird, but that's what the instruction says. 

381
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,840
How can that be right? 

382
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,560
That's why it's got legs, Glenn, that's what they're there for. 

383
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,640
The legs are there because it needs to be upside down. 

384
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,960
Either I have got it wrong 

385
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,840
- or everyone else has got it wrong. 
- Right. 

386
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,160
It says leave to cool upside down. To me, this is upside down. 

387
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,480
- Which way did you put it in the oven?
- It went in this way. 

388
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,080
So this is upside down 

389
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,640
and I will turn it the right way up to serve it. 

390
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,600
That looks a bit of all right. 

391
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,680
- Looks OK that, Maz. 
- It certainly does. 

392
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,360
You turn it upside down 

393
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,040
and it is gripping to the side of the tin. 

394
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,280
It isn't going to fall out, so we just cool it in the tin 

395
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,520
and that's exactly how you leave it. 

396
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,240
And the reason for doing that is to allow the air bubbles, 

397
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,640
while they're still warm, to settle, 

398
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,120
rather than concertinaing down at the bottom, 

399
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,480
which is what would happen. 

400
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,200
It would have a great big dip in it. 

401
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,600
So we can really put that behind us for the moment. 

402
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,240
While your cake is cooling, make the lemon curd 

403
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,880
using the ten egg yolks saved from earlier. 

404
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,760
Add to these the zest of two large lemons. 

405
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,240
Then, into a pan, put the juice of six large lemons, 

406
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,120
400g of caster sugar 

407
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,160
and the blended egg yolks. 

408
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,880
I'm going to do it directly over the heat. 

409
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,320
If you're at all nervous, 

410
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,880
you can put it over a pan of simmering water 

411
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,440
in an oven glass bowl and just stir it. 

412
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,520
But I am going to wing it and do it directly on the heat. 

413
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,240
And I'm going to stir that constantly. 

414
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,080
This is something that you can't leave. 

415
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,600
You mustn't have too much heat underneath this. 

416
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,480
You must be able to feel the sides of the pan. 

417
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,360
It will turn into scrambled egg 

418
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,480
if you don't watch it for every moment. 

419
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,440
Put 175g of cubed butter into the pan 

420
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,840
and heat until it's just melted. 

421
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,200
You can see there's just a few little pieces of butter there 

422
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,960
and that will just melt into the lemon curd. 

423
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,240
So you need to decant that now, do you? 

424
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,800
Set half the curd aside to add passion fruit to later. 

425
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,120
The other half will keep in a jar in the fridge for up to a month. 

426
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,440
Lemon curd made. 

427
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,520
What we've got to do is whip the cream. 

428
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,120
Then, in a large bowl, put 300ml of pouring double cream, 

429
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,360
and half a teaspoon of vanilla extract, 

430
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,320
whisking until it's formed soft peaks. 

431
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,640
That looks just the right consistency to me. 

432
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,320
It's holding its own. That's ready for the angel cake. 

433
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,080
Using a palette knife, loosen the cake from the tin 

434
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,400
and turn out onto the serving dish. 

435
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,720
Now we've got our whipped cream here. 

436
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,080
The cream should cover your entire cake. 

437
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,120
So once one's evenly coated it, 

438
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,240
you can decide whether you are going to have it rough like a snow scene 

439
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,640
or whether you're going to have it very sort of tailored and smooth. 

440
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,920
What would you go for? 

441
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,160
Smooth. 

442
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,880
So, Paul, we now need to have 

443
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,440
a drizzle of lemon curd and passion fruit. 

444
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,520
Oh! And the other one? 

445
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,000
Well done. Thank you very much. 

446
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,960
Mix the passion fruit flesh and seeds into the lemon curd 

447
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,360
until thoroughly blended. 

448
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,240
Spoon the curd over the cake, 

449
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,880
letting it drizzle over the sides for a natural-looking finish. 

450
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,360
And there it is - ready to serve. 

451
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,920
And the remainder of this, put in a small bowl 

452
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,440
and everybody can have a little bit more. 

453
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,160
There's my angel food cake, masked with cream 

454
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,400
and then we have the lovely lemon curd and passion fruit. 

455
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,200
Can't wait to try it, Mary. 

456
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,920
So, Paul, what do you think of my angel food cake? 

457
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,440
It's all right. 

458
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,240
To be honest with you, Mary, I've been dying to eat this all day. 

459
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,000
It's been cooling down, 

460
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,680
you finished it off, it looks amazing. 

461
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,440
I just want to have a slice of it now. 

462
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,400
It's just such a different cake. 

463
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,440
It's good that we had time to make a nice lot of lemon curd 

464
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,080
so as not to waste those egg yolks. 

465
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,720
That does look good. 

466
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,160
You see, it's so light and so white inside, 

467
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,960
the meringue in there. 

468
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,440
It's beautiful. It's the rising agent in this. 

469
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,840
The outside looks delicious 

470
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,960
and then the curd with the passion fruit in there looks stunning 

471
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,920
and to be honest...I've got to have a piece. 

472
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,360
Mary Berry... 

473
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,400
You've nailed that one, Mary. 

474
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,600
Week two of the Bake Off 

475
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,800
saw the bakers having to tackle bread. 

476
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,080
They kneaded... 

477
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,280
It's really sticky 

478
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,360
and actually, it's quite nice working with it. 

479
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,480
I love kneading. 

480
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,760
..proved... 

481
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,480
Awesome. 

482
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,640
..and shaped. 

483
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,160
Where did you get the inspiration for this? 

484
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,680
It sounds weird, but it actually came in a dream. 

485
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,120
But Paul Hollywood began by taking them back to basics, 

486
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,080
asking the bakers to make a personal favourite of his. 

487
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,320
Now, for your Signature Bake today, please, 

488
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,320
we'd like you to make 36 breadsticks. 

489
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,560
Mary and Paul are looking for a crisp, dry texture, 

490
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,200
something you can just snap in half when you break it - 

491
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,040
a little bit like one of Paul's hair shards. 

492
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,000
You've got two hours in which to bake. 

493
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,040
- So on your marks...
- Get set... 
- Bake! 

494
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,200
I'm making fennel and chilli breadsticks today. 

495
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,240
Rather than just getting heat, you get a subtlety of flavour. 

496
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,920
I'm making rosemary and raisin breadsticks. 

497
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,880
It's a classic Italian flavour. 

498
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,920
It's sort of laced with ginger and I'm using chilli oil 

499
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,560
and then the tip of the match 

500
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,040
is going to be a chilli-infused dark chocolate. 

501
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,120
But Paul's yeasted breadsticks are packed with juicy green olives 

502
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,720
with a good snap that perfectly contrasts 

503
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,440
the tangy softness of the olives. 

504
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,920
Now, what I'm going to show you is a fantastic idea 

505
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,280
that is using yeasted dough but we're using whole green olives. 

506
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,840
So it's that additional something, a little bit different. 

507
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,200
Now to start with, I need to weigh the ingredients - 

508
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,280
well, sorry, YOU have to weigh the ingredients. 

509
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,680
Can I have a kilo of strong flour, please? 

510
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,960
Right. 

511
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,120
I use strong flour because it's got a lot of gluten in there. 

512
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,880
It's got a lot of bonding agent. 

513
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,840
Because of the liquid that's going in this, 

514
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,080
which is nearly 80% liquid, 

515
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,480
you need that gluten to be able to bind it together, 

516
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,640
to stretch the dough. 

517
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,480
Along with the flour, 

518
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,600
put 20g of salt and 20g of yeast into a bowl... 

519
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,080
..keeping these separate, so the yeast isn't slowed 

520
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,160
by coming into contact with the salt. 

521
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,080
In there, a good glug of olive oil. 

522
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,600
And over here, I've got 800mls of water. 

523
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,720
Now, this is cool water, not warm water. 

524
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,760
In all your bread making, you use cold water? 

525
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,720
Yeah, because I don't want to speed up the proving process, 

526
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,600
because the proving process should be slow. 

527
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,040
The slower it proves, the more flavour you get. 

528
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,480
The faster it proves, the less flavour it gets. 

529
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,120
Start it off slow, 

530
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,320
purely because I don't want to get covered in flour, 

531
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,360
and just mix it, mix it, mix it. 

532
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,200
Start with only half the water in the bowl, 

533
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,360
and then add the rest of it bit by bit. 

534
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,560
You can hear - hear the motor's struggling? 

535
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,080
It's telling you it needs more water so a little bit more water in there. 

536
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,720
Switch to a high speed and mix for ten minutes 

537
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,320
to ensure the gluten is properly developed 

538
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,280
and a good dough is formed. 

539
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,120
Thinking of what you say to the bakers, 

540
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,600
you usually like them to do everything by hand. 

541
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,200
This is one of the first occasions I've heard you say, 

542
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,640
"Use a mixing machine. It'll be better." 

543
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,280
Because it's such a wet dough. 

544
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,160
To do it by hand is possible, 

545
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,800
but I would advise people who had a mixer to use it. 

546
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,240
I'm very keen on that. 

547
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,160
I am today, actually. My arms are sore. 

548
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,120
Let's have a quick look at this. 

549
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,080
You see? It's stretching now. 

550
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,280
What I'm going to do is add some olives to that. 

551
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,400
- They look good.
- They do. 
- And they are pitted olives. 

552
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,760
Pitted green olives - go straight in. 

553
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,160
The kilo of olives must be incorporated slowly 

554
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,200
so they stay whole and moist. 

555
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,640
If you don't like green olives, sun dried tomatoes, bacon, 

556
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,240
mushrooms, peppers - anything you want. 

557
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,000
Once the olives are mixed evenly throughout the dough, 

558
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
separate it into two oiled, rectangular boxes. 

559
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
- You don't need to level it off? 
- No. 

560
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,160
It's a living thing, a dough, and it'll want to grow. 

561
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,480
And that's its job. 

562
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,680
Prove for about an hour or until the dough has doubled in size. 

563
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,200
A good prove helps develop the gluten 

564
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,000
and lets the olive flavour infiltrate the dough. 

565
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,080
OK, Mary, look at them. If I take the lid off this... 

566
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,200
This has been left for about an hour. 

567
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,760
It's full of life, it's very soft, 

568
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,640
and what I've got here is a bit of semolina 

569
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,880
and this helps it not to stick too much to the bench. 

570
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,000
Just dust the top. 

571
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,720
As well as the dough, 

572
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,920
cover the worktop with a mixture of flour and semolina. 

573
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,720
- You like doing that, don't you? 
- I love doing that. 

574
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,400
One of my favourite things. 

575
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,080
And then you grab your dough. 

576
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,960
Basically, what you've got to do is coax it out onto the bench. 

577
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,040
You can see the bubbles, the gluten, the stretch, the air holes. 

578
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,440
But it's so heavy with olives. 

579
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,760
Now I'll work on these two, put that to one side. 

580
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,160
That would make a good focaccia. 

581
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,440
Just stretch it out, put it on a tray, 

582
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,640
fingers in, olive oil, prove for half an hour, bang - great focaccia. 

583
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,400
But I'm going to show you how to make some sticks with this. 

584
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,920
What to do, Scotch scraper... 

585
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,720
You find the width of an olive and then you trim like that 

586
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,960
and then flick it away. 

587
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,600
You're trying not to cut an olive in half. 

588
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,000
You try not to, try to keep them as whole as possible. 

589
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,320
and then flick them away. 

590
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,040
You do this all the way along. 

591
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,120
- So if you handle these too much, do you lose all your air?
- Yeah. 

592
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,680
This has got all the air in it already that I need. 

593
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,720
- So you don't handle it any more. 
- If I flatten that now, it's wasted. 

594
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,000
You're just stretching it, that's all you're doing - 

595
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,520
you're cutting and stretching. 

596
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,600
The proving has actually already happened. 

597
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,080
Grab each one. 

598
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,480
Perfect at the beginning of a meal. Bit of olive oil, bit of balsamic. 

599
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,760
Maybe serve with some Parma ham. It's delicious. 

600
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,400
- You could wrap round... 
- Exactly. 

601
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,360
- And you leave all this surplus flour, all this - no glaze?
- No, nothing. 

602
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,400
- Really very simple to make, isn't it? 
- It is. 

603
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,560
Soon as they're finished, 

604
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,360
because they've got lots of air in them, 

605
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,760
I'll whack them straight in the oven and bake them off. 

606
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,280
And do you have a hot oven for that? 

607
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,520
I would do 220, yeah, which would be fan. 

608
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,920
- 220 fan?
- 220. 

609
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,440
We bake in the bakery at 240 with these 

610
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,320
and then normally stay in for about 20 minutes, 15 minutes. 

611
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,280
You'd have to keep your eye on them. 

612
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,520
Timing and temperature are crucial to producing a good breadstick. 

613
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,400
I've turned the oven up a bit to try and get them to cook quicker, 

614
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,240
which is probably the wrong thing to do. 

615
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,600
Just seconds too long in the oven and they'll burn. 

616
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,440
I don't know whether to turn the oven up. 

617
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,080
Sod it. Up. We're going hotter, we're going hotter. 

618
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,640
Get the temperature wrong 

619
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,920
and you could end up with a soft breadstick 

620
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,120
with no snap. 

621
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,120
No. Needs more. 

622
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,800
Excuse me, Mary. I think these guys will be done. 

623
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,400
- And indeed they are. Look at these.
- Wow. 

624
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,720
I'll slide them off. 

625
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,560
- Do you swap them around at all? 
- No. The oven's quite well balanced. 

626
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,320
At home, you might have to swap them about, 

627
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,200
because not all ovens are even. 

628
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,960
Yeah, exactly. There you have 'em. 

629
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,480
Beautiful, Italian sfilatino olive sticks. 

630
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,560
Green olives, lots of flavour, 

631
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,200
beautiful ciabatta-style bread as well. 

632
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,880
Lovely and crispy. Fantastic at any party. 

633
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,400
Very simple and very quick to make. 

634
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,760
Choose you weapon, Mary. 

635
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,440
I think I'll just have half. They look splendid. 

636
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,800
I'll have the other half of that, no problem. 

637
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,760
I'm choosing the one with the olive next to it. 

638
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,840
Mmm...I'd go for that. 

639
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,600
They've got that crispness, they've got that bite, 

640
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,240
they've got that...you know, real strength to the dough. 

641
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,480
- Mmm.
- Beautiful, aren't they? 

642
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,040
I think, for the best result, you've got to have green olives. 

643
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,920
Now, Mary's top tip on how to pipe beautiful two-toned rosettes. 

644
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,880
If you want to make an impressive finish on a cake, 

645
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,240
two-tone icing is fun to do. 

646
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,840
So you put the icing into the piping bag, 

647
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,600
drop it down and see if you can get it on one side 

648
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,400
and then go with another colour in the other side. 

649
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,600
And just enough in the bag so you can get going. 

650
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,320
You can just about see through the bag, 

651
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,840
I've got some pink and some white. 

652
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,600
And you get this lovely stripy effect. 

653
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,720
I've done mine in eight portions, so everybody gets a rosette. 

654
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,000
You may want to cover the whole cake with rosettes. 

655
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,880
Just whatever takes your fancy. 

656
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,800
That's it, a lovely decorative cake. 

657
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,160
Very quickly done, without special equipment. 

658
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,960
After surviving the Signature Challenge on week two, 

659
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,640
the bakers faced the terrifying prospect 

660
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,920
of a bread Technical Challenge set by our master baker. 

661
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,240
In his element, Paul ensured they had nowhere to hide 

662
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,120
by choosing an absolute classic. 

663
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,400
Today, we're asking you to make eight identical English muffins. 

664
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,360
Now what we are looking for is an even bake, a chewy texture 

665
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,000
and light air holes in the actual crumb texture. 

666
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,560
- On your marks...
- Get set... 
- Bake! 

667
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,440
The only thing that'll help me on this 

668
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,960
is the fact that I know what the end result should be like. 

669
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,880
This is a journey into the unknown. 

670
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,240
I have made them before, but they were a complete disaster. 

671
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,360
My husband still ate them, though, bless him. 

672
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,920
Paul's traditional English muffin is toasted on a griddle 

673
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,680
until golden brown. 

674
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,320
Right, Mary. English muffins. 

675
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,800
I promise you, they are a great favourite of mine. 

676
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,280
They are one of my favourites. 

677
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,600
I've been making them for years in hotels, you know - 

678
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,920
English muffin for breakfast, eggs Benedict. Very classic. 

679
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,560
I'll show you how to make them. Fairly straightforward. 

680
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,560
I need to weigh up the ingredients and I'll do this one by hand. 

681
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,280
- So can I have 300g of strong bread flour, please?
- Right. 

682
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,920
I'm using strong bread flour again - 

683
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,760
I want that gluten, I want that protein, 

684
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,440
I want that rise, I want that power that the flour will give me. 

685
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,240
- Any time today, Mary, will be great. 
- I just am careful. 

686
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,040
300 - thank you very much indeed. 

687
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,720
I'm just going to crack one small egg into that as well. 

688
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,240
Add 6g of yeast and 6g of salt on opposite sides of the bowl. 

689
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,680
Can I have 15g of caster sugar 

690
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,280
and 15g of softened butter, please? 

691
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,160
You will need up to about 200ml of full-fat milk. 

692
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,400
Now what you do is you start off by pouring the milk into the middle. 

693
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,920
Hands in. Just turn it round with your hand first, 

694
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,480
break that egg up. 

695
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,360
You can see that needs more of that milk, 

696
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:03,400
so you add a little bit at a time and you begin to crush it 

697
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,880
and it begins to absorb all that flour. 

698
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,600
You're choosing milk as your liquid and not water. 

699
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,160
It gives it a slightly denser structure 

700
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,280
and alters the flavour slightly as well. 

701
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,640
Milk will tend to sit on the dough and it's not going to go "boom!" 

702
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,120
like a bread would and bloom in the oven. 

703
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,040
The acid in the milk actually slows the yeast down a little bit. 

704
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,280
But it adds to the flavour. 

705
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,120
Because I've got eggs in there and butter, 

706
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,840
I'm actually going to use flour on the bench instead of olive oil. 

707
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840
If you use olive oil with the egg and the butter, 

708
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,480
you'll see all the white come out of it, 

709
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,920
it'll emulsify too much. 

710
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,400
What I'm going to do is just mix all those ingredients together. 

711
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:45,640
Incorporate all the butter and then begin to roll up the dough. 

712
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,360
Knead the dough for ten minutes until it becomes smooth and silky. 

713
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,560
It's just to make sure 

714
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,400
that I've got some gluten building up in there as well. 

715
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,560
The technique is heel of the palm, fingers and roll it up. 

716
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,520
Heel of the palm, fingers and roll it up. 

717
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,120
Now you can see already how smooth that's gone 

718
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,800
just in the time that I've done it. 

719
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,840
In a bowl. 

720
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,360
- You don't flour the bowl or grease the bowl?
- Don't need to. 

721
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,800
And what I'm going to do now is give it a bit of rest time. 

722
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,960
It's important that you give it this rest time 

723
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,160
because if you don't, it'll have no flavour. 

724
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,840
The flavour comes from the proving of the dough itself. 

725
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,800
Cover it up and then leave it for about half an hour 

726
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,920
just to activate it - and it will grow. 

727
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,960
Look at the size of that. 

728
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,520
That's actually been just under an hour, it's taken an hour. 

729
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
- That was in a warming drawer? 
- A warming drawer. 

730
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,080
So if they were just proving in a warm kitchen, 

731
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,000
that would take about one and a half times as long, wouldn't it? 

732
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Yeah, it'd probably take an hour and a half. 

733
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,720
- But it would give the same results. 
- Exact same result, yes. 

734
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,840
What I'm going to do is gently lift out the dough. 

735
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,920
You can see it collapses down to nothing again, 

736
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,520
and then gently just shape it into a rough ball. 

737
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,560
I've got semolina and flour. 

738
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,000
Again, the semolina is just a bit of grit 

739
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,040
cos what we're going to do is put this on a bake stone to bake it 

740
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,320
and then the grit will just rise it slightly off the hot plate 

741
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,840
and stop it from burning too much. 

742
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,240
It's a little bit of protection. 

743
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,440
I'm going to roll it out to roughly the thickness 

744
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,840
of about an inch. 

745
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,280
Just gently pat it, relax it, 

746
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,120
cos if you don't relax it, when you cut it, it will shrink in. 

747
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,320
We're looking for eight of these, so we start here, 

748
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,520
cut straight down, twist. 

749
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,000
So you twist... 

750
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,720
And twist... 

751
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,520
Once the first four muffins have been cut out, 

752
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,760
gently re-roll the dough to the same depth 

753
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,880
and cut out again. 

754
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,800
Repeat the process until there are eight muffins. 

755
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,960
So the secret is to get them all at the same height at this stage. 

756
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,960
Yeah, exactly. 

757
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,880
Grab your muffins. 

758
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,640
Just place them carefully onto a tray, 

759
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,040
because these have now got to prove up. 

760
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,680
Leave the muffins somewhere warm and prove for 30 minutes 

761
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,040
until they spring back when touched. 

762
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,360
There we go. These guys have been resting. 

763
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,200
Now you can see, they're full of air. 

764
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,200
You see? They bounce back. Feel them. 

765
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,320
They've sort of got a skin across the top. 

766
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,960
Push the sides, you can see there's resistance. 

767
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,600
They're very delicate. 

768
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,960
What you've got here is the hot plate. 

769
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
- So that's not greased? 
- No, you don't need to. 

770
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,720
What's happened is you've got semolina 

771
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,120
on the bottom of these muffins 

772
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,720
and that will prevent them from sticking on there. 

773
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,040
What's happening now, the yeast is in there, 

774
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,920
the yeast is going to become highly active 

775
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,320
because there's heat underneath baking it. 

776
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,720
There's nothing on the top 

777
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,280
so the top can freely grow, which is what's going to happen. 

778
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,840
But treat it and think of it like a salmon. 

779
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,680
You know when you cook a salmon fillet 

780
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,760
and you place it on a frying pan, 

781
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,280
and you see the way it cooks halfway up... 

782
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,000
Halfway. ..and then you flip it, and then it meets in the middle, 

783
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,040
and then you have a beautifully-cooked salmon. 

784
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,520
Exactly the same method for this 

785
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,680
If you haven't got such a thing as a plate like that, 

786
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,040
- you could use a very heavy frying pan.
- Yes. 

787
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,280
Put in a frying pan, on high, pop it in there, 

788
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,080
and it will do exactly the same. 

789
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,720
Each side needs five to six minutes, 

790
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,880
but, despite being straightforward, 

791
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,120
this didn't stop the bakers being confounded. 

792
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,200
It's a bit of an unknown quantity, this bit. 

793
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,680
That's just not meant to happen! 

794
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,080
Urgh! 

795
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,680
I'm thinking a long, slow griddle. 

796
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,480
I think they're going to take quite a long time to cook 

797
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,600
Oh, that one's sizzling a bit. I don't know what happened there. 

798
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,720
I'm in danger of overcooking them, 

799
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,480
but I really don't want them to be doughy in the middle. 

800
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,040
Argh! How do you know?! How do you know?! 

801
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,560
Not quite an even bake, is it? 

802
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,120
That one there is still showing a bit of the yellow. 

803
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,720
That's it. Best I can do. 

804
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,760
They do look good. 

805
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,160
Every one exactly the same size, same rise. 

806
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,320
- Can we have a taste?
- Nope. 

807
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,440
Why not? 

808
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,040
The main reason why you can't eat them now is because they're 

809
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,720
still warm, they're still doughy inside, so, if you eat them, 

810
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,920
they'll give you really bad indigestion, 

811
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,040
- so you need to leave them to cool first.
- How long? 

812
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,480
- About an hour, hour and a half. 
- I'll be back. 

813
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,640
There they are, then, Mary. 

814
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,960
You can smell them, can't you? 

815
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,040
They're still just off-warm, so they're just cool enough now to eat. 

816
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,520
They look absolutely beautiful. 

817
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,880
English muffins are quite my most favourite. 

818
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,840
Oh, lovely. 

819
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,680
Oh, yes. 

820
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,680
Beautiful colour, top and bottom. 

821
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,360
The texture - it's open enough, it's got lots of flavour, 

822
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,280
it's got that beautiful dark colour on the top and the bottom, 

823
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,240
and it's baked all the way through. 

824
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,760
It's got everything. 

825
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,000
It doesn't really need anything on it, at all, 

826
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,280
just a good butter on top. 

827
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,440
So good. In fact, I'm going to have some more. 

828
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,520
Maybe an egg...with a hollandaise sauce, 

829
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,000
and a little bit of bacon. 

830
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,200
Now Paul gives us his quick tip on how to shape a country loaf. 

831
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,760
This took me a while to learn how to do properly, 

832
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,320
but I'm going to show you. 

833
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,360
I was let into this secret about two years into my baking career. 

834
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,280
You need to cut off a third like that. 

835
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,400
There's the top, there's the bottom. 

836
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,080
Roll it up and then shape it round. 

837
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,320
Using the heel of your palm, and shaping into the table. 

838
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,720
Pat down one side. 

839
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,960
Get the other piece, place it on top. 

840
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,720
Push it down quite firmly. 

841
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,040
Bit of flour on the top of that. 

842
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,920
Fingers right the way through till you feel the bench underneath. 

843
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,120
Get your knife, 

844
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:10,040
cut all the way around. Quite deep. 

845
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,720
Place it on your bench, 

846
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,960
finger in, and the cuts, as you see, will open up, 

847
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,120
goes into an oven and makes that cottage loaf beautifully crispy. 

848
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,560
Now you've got to try it. 

849
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,920
For the first time ever, Mary and Paul are going to 

850
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,120
make their take on a Showstopper - making the chocolate creation cake 

851
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,320
that they set the bakers in their first week in the tent. 

852
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:43,520
It had to be big and bold, with beautiful chocolate decoration. 

853
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,520
We are looking for a magnificent chocolate cake. 

854
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,400
We want you to go cocoa loco. 

855
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,720
We want tiers, if you like, it can be a novelty cake... 

856
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,000
The judges would love you to use at least two types of chocolate 

857
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,520
to decorate your cakes. 

858
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,520
- So, on your marks... 
- Get set... 

859
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,000
BOTH: Bake! 

860
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,720
Mary and Paul were looking for them to demonstrate their creativity... 

861
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,360
I'm just going to pick off individual thyme leaves 

862
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,080
and scatter them over the top of my baking parchment. 

863
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,480
..a real attention to detail... 

864
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,120
I want that richness from the chocolate, and then you get 

865
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,200
a burst of raspberry to cut through that. 

866
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,720
..and incredible chocolate decoration skills. 

867
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,120
Success! 

868
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,600
But not everything went according to plan. 

869
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,840
We've got about an hour left, and I need more than an hour to 

870
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,720
even finish with any semblance of a cake. 

871
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,240
Mary and Paul are going to make a spectacular 

872
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,680
three-tiered chocolate gateaux, 

873
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,960
decorated with three types of chocolate. 

874
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,800
So, on to our Showstopper cake. 

875
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,480
We've chosen a really lovely chocolate cake. 

876
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,600
It's got to be bold and beautiful, so I thought three layers, 

877
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:55,240
three tiers of chocolate, a white chocolate ganache. 

878
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,680
And you're quite good at tempering chocolate - 

879
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,480
we'll do a design around the outside. 

880
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,680
- OK.
- Now, this cake is something I've been making for years. 

881
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,320
I call it my chocolate fudge cake. 

882
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,880
It's a very good base for a cake, it's lovely and moist, 

883
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,840
it's really chocolaty, 

884
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,200
and I find, to make a good chocolate flavour, you should use cocoa. 

885
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,200
So, if you could measure me 125g of cocoa, 

886
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,520
and that gives a strong chocolate flavour. 

887
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,560
Into the cocoa, stir 200ml of boiling water. 

888
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,120
And it should be a thick paste. 

889
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,200
Add six large eggs, 100ml of milk, 

890
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,880
350g of self-raising flour, 

891
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,120
and a tablespoon of baking powder. 

892
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,600
- That is... There you are. 
- One tablespoon... 

893
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,240
15 mill, one tablespoon... 

894
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,600
- One tablespoon, OK...
- But... 

895
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,080
- I've never heard of it... 
- Level it.
- I'm doing it now! 

896
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,320
What are you like? 

897
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,920
Nagging. Nagging. I'm seeking perfection. 

898
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,000
Add 550g of caster sugar and 200g of softened butter. 

899
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,800
So, down with the top. 

900
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,920
I'm going to speed that up for a moment. 

901
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,440
Mary's all-in-one method, 

902
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,160
using extra baking powder, means you only need to do 

903
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,760
one mix of the ingredients to guarantee you 

904
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,400
a rich, chocolaty sponge. 

905
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,600
So, what are you looking for when you're mixing it? 

906
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,320
What sort of consistency and texture? 

907
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,160
It's a soft dropping batter. 

908
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,640
That looks right to me. 

909
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,720
Can I just have a look at that inside? 

910
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,080
It's such a nice colour. 

911
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,080
Mary gets the perfect cake height 

912
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,440
by filling two 20cm sandwich tins to halfway... 

913
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,640
- It's a lovely mixture, isn't it? 
- It is. 

914
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,880
..and one 10cm and one 15cm cake tin 

915
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,640
to two thirds full. 

916
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,920
The 20cm tins need 25 to 30 minutes, 

917
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,600
the 10cm tin needs 35 to 40 minutes, 

918
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,000
and the 15cm tin needs 45 to 50 minutes. 

919
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,800
So, our fudge cakes are beautifully baked, 

920
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,440
nice and level on top, and they need to be stone-cold. 

921
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,040
I'm now going to make some white chocolate ganache. 

922
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,720
Now, that can be very tricky to make, 

923
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,040
but I've evolved a recipe that is foolproof. 

924
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,040
I've got 300ml of double cream here. 

925
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,160
Pour the cream in a pan and heat until it's hand hot. 

926
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,200
Then break up 400g of white chocolate. 

927
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,920
I'm not accounting for any that you might eat en route. 

928
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,960
Add to the pan and stir until it's dissolved. 

929
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,160
You see, I've still got my hand here, touching the side of the pan, 

930
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,240
so you realise it's not getting too hot. 

931
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,960
Because of its high fat content, 

932
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,080
white chocolate can easily split, so be careful. 

933
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,320
As soon as the chocolate is fully melted, 

934
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,560
pour into a bowl and let it set in the fridge. 

935
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,000
Going to get that last little drop out. 

936
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,240
- Looks like curd, doesn't it, at this stage?
- It's lovely. 

937
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,920
So, that needs to get absolutely cold. 

938
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,000
Once cooled, beat it into 300g of cream cheese, 

939
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,800
a spoonful at a time. 

940
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,680
Do you want to mix, and I'll put it in? 

941
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,840
- I think I'd rather you mixed and I put it in.
- Ah, OK, then! 

942
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,960
Now, that looks absolutely perfect. The consistency that we want. 

943
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,920
Look, it's just sort of spreadable. 

944
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,720
- Yep.
- And we'll be able to get a nice finish to that cake. 

945
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,320
Working with chocolate is easy, 

946
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,480
just as long as you follow some simple rules. 

947
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,200
But, as our bakers discovered, 

948
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,600
just one mistake, and things could get very sticky. 

949
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,240
- I'm behind...
- Yep. 

950
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,720
- ..stressed...
- Yep. 

951
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,280
..slightly doolally. 

952
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,360
These are optimal conditions for Bake Off. 

953
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,400
My ganache has gone wrong. 

954
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,480
This is meant to be a lot more solid than it is. 

955
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,440
As you can see, it's very runny. 

956
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,320
There's no way this will set in time. 

957
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,200
Leave the rest up to the one up there. 

958
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,200
Well, and Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry. 

959
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,360
I tried the chocolate stripe cigars a few times, 

960
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,200
with no success whatsoever. 

961
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,600
I tried it the other day and it worked, so I'm going with it... 

962
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,400
on the strength of that one trial. 

963
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,960
Ah-ha! 

964
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,640
Those have worked really well. Are you pleased? 

965
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,600
They're all right. You can tell the ones that have tempered better. 

966
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,240
You've got a tiny temper there. 

967
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,440
These are hopefully going to sit on... 

968
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,320
This is really nerve-racking. 

969
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,520
Chocolate tempering needn't be nerve-racking, 

970
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,960
or so Paul says... 

971
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,560
Basically, what we're going to do is build a collar 

972
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,200
to go around the outside of your chocolate cake. 

973
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,560
Tempering is the process of heating and cooling chocolate 

974
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,880
to create a high shine and a good snap. 

975
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,840
Once it's melted, we take it up to 47. 

976
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,400
Once it reaches 47, I'll just take it off the heat, 

977
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,280
and then it needs to cool down to 31. 

978
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,000
At 31 degrees C, you can then pipe it, do something with it, 

979
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,280
and then it will set. 

980
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,440
Tempering creates new small crystals in the chocolate, 

981
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,720
that gives it its professional-looking finish. 

982
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,640
Nearly there. 46. 

983
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,880
Going over 47 degrees risks burning the chocolate, 

984
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,120
making it lumpy and bitter. 

985
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,040
47. And off it comes. 

986
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,200
Rest of the buttons will go in there, 

987
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,080
and we need to cool that down to 31. 

988
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,000
Paul's using the seeding method of tempering, 

989
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,480
adding cold chocolate. 

990
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,680
It's like adding ice cubes to your gin and tonic. 

991
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,920
- Do you remember that, Mary? 
- I do, very well. 

992
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,480
There's no sign of any now. 

993
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,160
If you look at that now, it's just dropped below 31, 

994
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,200
so we're now good to go. 

995
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,880
Pipe directly on to acetate, which has been marked out 

996
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,960
to the height of the collar. 

997
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,960
And what sort of shop would sell acetate? 

998
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,120
- Model shops would have it. 
- Model shops. 

999
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,560
Acetate provides a flexible template for your tempered chocolate, 

1000
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,840
allowing you to wrap it around the cake. 

1001
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,600
Literally just doing circles... 

1002
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,720
Excuse me, Mary. 

1003
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,680
And then, once I've done that, I'm going to strengthen it 

1004
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,440
by just going over the bottom bit a little bit thicker, you know? 

1005
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,520
Because what we don't want to do is see this thing collapse. 

1006
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,160
Can you straighten out that bit of acetate for me, please? 

1007
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,080
That's it, thank you. Just to flatten it down a bit. 

1008
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,760
You can do anything on acetate. You could do someone's name... 

1009
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,920
Mary... 

1010
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,920
You don't need any help with the spelling? 

1011
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,200
I've got a long way to go, you know, 

1012
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,960
but I'll still be here to keep an eye on you. 

1013
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,560
The piped chocolate needs to be left to set at room temperature. 

1014
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,520
Time to assemble the cakes. 

1015
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,480
- They feel lovely and squidgy and fresh.
- Yes, they do. 

1016
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,600
- These are quite soft at the edge... 
- They are. 

1017
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,240
..which is as they should be. 

1018
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,080
Slice in half the 10cm and the 15cm cakes. 

1019
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,240
Sawing action, backwards and forwards. 

1020
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,960
So, we've got a bowl full of icing here. 

1021
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,440
Half will do to cover the whole cake. 

1022
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,160
- And the rest will do to sandwich the layers.
- OK. 

1023
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,920
- It spreads beautifully, doesn't it? 
- It does. 

1024
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,160
Sandwich each layer together. 

1025
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,040
This is going to taste good, Mary, I just know it is. 

1026
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,200
Then we have our little... 

1027
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,280
I've been just a little too generous there, haven't I? 

1028
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,240
Now we come to the assembly. 

1029
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:38,040
Heated and sieved apricot jam is used to stick the cakes together. 

1030
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,880
Right, that's on top. 

1031
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,480
Also known as masking jam, it helps prevent the crumbs 

1032
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,160
from getting into the icing. 

1033
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,160
So, I'm going to start here... 

1034
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,240
Take your time to ensure your icing is even. 

1035
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,720
Paul, this is taking me a long time, because it's very, very fresh to do. 

1036
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,440
How about you starting on the other side? 

1037
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,720
- I'll try. 
- We'll put the bowl between us. 

1038
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,960
But, for our bakers, as time ran out, 

1039
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,160
icing was the least of their worries. 

1040
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,400
It's not going to stay, that is not going to stay. 

1041
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,400
Um... 

1042
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,840
No, I am not very organised, at this point. 

1043
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,880
It's not cold enough yet, and I'm worried. 

1044
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,600
OK, bakers, that's one minute left. 

1045
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,160
Come on, come on. 

1046
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,960
It hasn't worked. 

1047
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,520
It would not be a Bake Off squirrel without a pair of hazelnuts. 

1048
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,840
There we go. 

1049
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,640
Please don't break. Please don't break. 

1050
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,600
Oh, you son of a...! 

1051
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,000
So, I'm just finishing that off. So, that's fine. 

1052
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,600
It's all ready for your beautiful finish. 

1053
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:00,040
What we'll do is start one side here, 

1054
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,520
feed this... 

1055
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,400
I'm going in a bit blind. Am I still on target there? 

1056
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,400
You're on target and you're level. 

1057
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,160
Put the bottom one on now. 

1058
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,280
Gently coax it round. 

1059
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:20,080
What I'm going to do is just gently peel off... 

1060
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,880
Got to be careful... 

1061
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,160
It's looking good. 

1062
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,120
I feel like giving you a big clap. 

1063
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,800
If you don't have a thermometer, 

1064
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,600
Mary has a simple tip to produce elegant chocolate curls. 

1065
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,520
I've been doing a bit of experimenting, 

1066
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,960
and I find a combination of half chocolate cake covering 

1067
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:46,280
and half a less expensive chocolate, 

1068
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:50,040
with about cocoa solids between 35 and 40, 

1069
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,880
that is put in a bowl over hot water, 

1070
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,920
melted together, and then poured out like that... 

1071
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,960
And then, if you take a cheese parer... 

1072
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,320
This one was bought for Â£1.50. 

1073
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,320
And then you just drag it across the top. 

1074
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,120
I think that's rather pretty, with a little pleating on it. 

1075
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,360
I like that one, yes. 

1076
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,760
So, press it down really, really hard. 

1077
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,680
Give it a little wriggle... 

1078
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,040
Really big, bold rolls. 

1079
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,120
I think that you could put some on the top. 

1080
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,520
Just pile them up. 

1081
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,200
You're known for dusting flour all over the place with your hands. 

1082
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,120
I'll do it with icing sugar all over the top. 

1083
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,080
It just gives a little finish like snow. 

1084
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,520
Such a special occasion. 

1085
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,360
That, I think, is a true Showstopper. 

1086
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,920
That looks great. 

1087
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,160
That would certainly get through to the next round, 

1088
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,920
- and possibly even Star Baker. Well done, Mary.
- Thank you. 

1089
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,680
Well, Paul, this is our Showstopper chocolate creation. 

1090
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,520
The snap on that chocolate is beautiful. 

1091
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,000
And you've got such a good shine from it. 

1092
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,680
- There's your piece.
- Lovely. 

1093
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,000
I'm just going to get my knife in here. 

1094
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,680
Get myself a wedge, too. 

1095
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,640
Now for the eating. The sponge looks great. 

1096
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,960
I think it was right that we filled the middle of each one, 

1097
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,760
otherwise it would be too solid and chocolate... 

1098
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,720
Gosh, that white chocolate ganache goes really well 

1099
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,440
with the simple chocolate cake base. 

1100
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,360
So, you've got a sponge chocolate, you've got a ganache, 

1101
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,760
you've got tempered chocolate. 

1102
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,360
Three different types of chocolate going on in there, 

1103
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,280
and three different textures, 

1104
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,760
but, all together, the flavours work really well. 

1105
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,920
The bakers did a fantastic job, they reached great heights. 

1106
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,240
The standard has risen tremendously. 

1107
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,400
I think, the next time we're together, 

1108
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,280
we're going to start raising our standards, as well, 

1109
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,120
to show people exactly how they can do the Signatures, 

1110
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,440
the Technical, and the Showstoppers, to our level. 

1111
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,640
Not their level, our level. 

1112
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,960
I'll keep practising, Mr Hollywood 

1113
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,480
So will I! 

1114
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,600
Next time... 

1115
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,880
How about that? 

1116
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,600
..Mary and Paul take on five more of the tasks which they set the bakers. 

1117
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,280
The challenges get more difficult, 

1118
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,720
but Paul and I are here to show you every trick in the book. 

1119
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,040
Our judges will take us through each of the recipes, step by step... 

1120
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,960
If you do this, 

1121
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,960
all your baking at home will get better and better. I promise 

1122
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:44,560
..letting us in on all the secrets, to achieve outstanding results. 

1123
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,600
Do you think it's better than the shop-bought filo? 

1124
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,480
- Paul Hollywood's every time.
- Good. 

1125
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,440
And Paul also shows us the trick to blind-baking pastry, 

1126
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:58,400
while Mary reveals a fun cake decorating tip for kids. 

1127
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,920
The children will have such fun doing this. 

1128
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,640
Join us next time for The Great British Bake Off Masterclass 

1129
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,080
It doesn't matter if it's hard, 

1130
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,440
it doesn't matter if it's got stages in, 

1131
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,800
follow us, we'll show you the correct way of doing it, 

1132
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,800
so you can impress all your friends. 

1133
