1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,800
Taking part in the Great British Bake Off 

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,440
is an ambition of amateur bakers across the country. 

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,280
I could pinch myself, I'm in the Bake-Off tent! I can't believe it! 

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,440
But what is it really like inside the tent? 

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,520
You're sort of stood there at the gingham altar 

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,440
and you're just thinking, "Just shoot me." 

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,720
What are the side effects 

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,120
of being exposed to Paul's steely blue eyes... 

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,960
Paul came across as a bit of a... 

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,840
bit of an arrogant so-and-so in some instances. 

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,680
- I don't like that. 
- Don't you?
- At all.
- Oh. 

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,560
- You may as well be chewing on a piece of card.
- That's a bit harsh. 

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,600
No, honestly. 

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,880
..and the possibility of disappointing Mary Berry? 

15
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,120
Look at her eyes, she's telling you with her eyes, 

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,840
"Take that and put it in the fridge, 

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,080
"otherwise the pastry's going to melt." 

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,440
Are Mel and Sue a help or a hindrance? 

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,560
It's really annoying, you have some ingredients there, she'll come 

20
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,600
and peck at it and you won't believe it, she'll sometimes finish it off! 

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,280
Reliving their highs... 

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,160
You nailed that one, Ryan. 

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,160
The relief when you put a bake down and they said, "That's all right." 

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,480
..and lows. 

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,200
I knew that I was going, 

26
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,160
so from the minute I sat on the seat, I was going to cry. 

27
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,320
The class of 2012 revisit their experience 

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,600
and reveal their lives after the Bake Off. 

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,800
It's been extraordinary, what's happened. 

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,560
- The bakers, I mean...
- 2012... 

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,240
I can remember faces, but the names escape me. 

32
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,200
There were some blokes, weren't there? 

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,120
There was one with glasses, he was quite a honey. 

34
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,520
- They're a blur, they're a blur. 
- It's gone, really. 

35
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,960
I'm sure they were nice, I'm sure they were lovely. 

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,600
Lovely, but to be honest, once their back's turned on the tent, 

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,720
it's just...missed. 

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,960
In April of last year, 12 of the country's best home bakers 

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,560
gathered in a field in Somerset, 

40
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,680
crossed a small wooden bridge 

41
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,920
and walked into the jaws of the Bake Off tent for the first time. 

42
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,160
The first day, walking into that tent, 

43
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,080
I've never felt as much apprehension 

44
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,720
and been so nervous than I have done 

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,160
in the whole of my life, including getting married. 

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,200
It was actually really scary, 

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,520
thinking that, "What have I got myself into?" 

48
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,840
On the first day, I think everyone was a bit on edge, 

49
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,800
because no-one knew each other, 

50
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,600
we hadn't become the great friends we are now. 

51
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,520
A very warm welcome, bakers, to our Bake Off tent. 

52
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,720
Initially, it's just almost as if you think, "I need to pinch myself, 

53
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,320
"I'm in the Bake Off tent, I can't believe it." You know? 

54
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,440
It was really surreal, 

55
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,480
but everything happens so quickly, you don't have time to think. 

56
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,720
Whereas you'd seen it on television, it doesn't prepare you 

57
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,680
for the actual sight and the work stations, and so forth. 

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,440
And before I knew it, Sue was saying, 

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,760
"Ready, steady, bake," and I was like, 

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,720
"OK, we're actually doing this, then, this is happening now." 

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,720
- For the first time... 
- On your marks... 

62
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,480
Get set... BOTH: Bake! 

63
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,640
'Oh, there's a story, there's a story, 

64
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,240
'behind the "On your marks, get set, bake."' 

65
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,000
Well, it took five months, I used a flip chart, 

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,760
- we used diagrams, and we just thought...
- On your marks... 

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,800
Get set... I came up with "get set". You came up with "on your marks", 

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,320
- I did "get set".
- And then "bake" just came out of nowhere. 

69
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,000
It's like sometimes the universe gives you a gift. 

70
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,200
Everyone was sort of checking each other out 

71
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,240
and jockeying for position and trying to sort of work out 

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,400
who were the potential contenders to go on and win. 

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,920
Don't underestimate this lady, she keeps on saying how nervous she is, 

74
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,120
but actually she's very determined. 

75
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,040
I just remember feeling so nervous, so sick. 

76
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,200
I hadn't eaten anything because I was so nervous. 

77
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,920
Just make sure your timing is perfect, it's all about timing. 

78
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,560
I feel the need just to reach across very briefly, 

79
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,320
unclench your hands, there we go. 

80
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,640
- Breathe, relax.
- Thank you. 

81
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,640
- Good luck.
- Thank you. 

82
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,240
You sort of look around and you think, 

83
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,040
"OK, what ingredients has he got? What ingredients has she got?" 

84
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,400
You sort of think, "Am I good enough for this, really?" 

85
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,760
I've got apples, Manisha had peaches, Natasha had pineapples. 

86
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,760
So I just thought, "Oh, crumbs, I'm going to be kicked out first." 

87
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,160
The realisation they'd have to bake like never before 

88
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,000
to keep their place in the tent 

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,920
dawned with the first Showstopper Challenge - a hidden design cake. 

90
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,040
It's a really menacing task for us bakers, so whoever invented it, 

91
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,520
I'm cursing their name right now. 

92
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,240
It was such a technical thing to do. 

93
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,560
I mean, putting a design inside a cake is crazy work. 

94
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,000
We've moved out of baking, in a sense, 

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,440
- and into kind of...
- It's joinery. 

96
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,760
It's joinery, isn't it? 

97
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,720
And two of the bakers were in direct competition. 

98
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,560
I'm going for a Union Jack cake. 

99
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,560
I'm doing a Union Jack hidden design cake. 

100
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,760
I was really pleased with the Union Jack cake, 

101
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,160
because I had spent a huge amount of time making sure 

102
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,160
that everything could have worked out on the day. 

103
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,040
It's a work of beauty, it's a work of precision. 

104
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,840
It was quite a technical piece of engineering out of sponge, 

105
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,040
and I think it was really great to be able to compare that to Stuart's, 

106
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,800
because then it made it quite obvious 

107
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,000
that there were so many potential pitfalls, 

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,080
and how it could have gone wrong. 

109
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,840
It's gone a bit awry on the structure of it, technically. 

110
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,920
My disaster of a Union Jack cake, 

111
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,040
it didn't really turn out well for me at all. 

112
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,560
When we went up for judging 

113
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,400
and I think he'd actually said I'd nailed it, it was really fantastic. 

114
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,240
That was one of the great moments of being on the programme. 

115
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,560
Most impressive. It's very sweet, it's moist. You've got there. 

116
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,040
- Well done.
- Thank you. 

117
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,440
Sorry, Stuart. 

118
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,200
Some bakers shone from the very beginning. 

119
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,600
Very, very pretty. 

120
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,440
Very impressed, I mean, a design inside a cake, 

121
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,600
it's got that little step further. 

122
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,120
Thank you very much indeed. 

123
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,640
It's a very clever concept. 

124
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,160
And one in particular made a big impression. 

125
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,440
- That is one monster of a cake. 
- It's very bold. 

126
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,400
Have you got a shovel or anything I can use to cut this up? 

127
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,680
- Can you tell me what we're expecting to see inside?
- A sun. 

128
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,280
- And this is genoise?
- Yeah. 
- It's quite heavy. 

129
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,840
- No, I think what it is... 
- The weight of it crushing down. 

130
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,360
So much weight, yeah. 

131
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,320
My very first Showstopper was awful, 

132
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,040
I was quite surprised I didn't go in the first week. 

133
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,880
It's the first cake we've ever had you can see from space as well. 

134
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,120
Big things are always better, aren't they? 

135
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,960
But James wasn't the only one to struggle. 

136
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,000
When I originally compiled the recipe, 

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,880
I'd wondered if it was too simple. 

138
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm glad to have something that's got less chance of failing 

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,560
and isn't too complicated. 

140
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,960
'I was hoping to do a graduated layer cake,' 

141
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,240
and I was trying to play safe, and I suppose the irony is 

142
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,440
I couldn't even get a simple bake right. 

143
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,960
The saucepan's heavy, and I just want some pressure on 

144
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,080
so those layers will stick together. 

145
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,720
I need this to go right, so...yeah. 

146
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,760
I was quite satisfied by the finish of the cake, 

147
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,160
but I knew that the sponge inside was a disaster, 

148
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,440
and I think you'll see me lean over as Paul cuts into the cake. 

149
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,560
He commented on how heavy it was and my heart was just pounding, 

150
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,600
cos it's awful, 

151
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,760
that moment where you know everyone's going to discover 

152
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,640
what you already knew, that that cake is a disaster. 

153
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,960
It looks more like a paste than it does a sponge, 

154
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,560
because it's concertinaed up. 

155
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,440
It looks as though it has been oversoaked as well. 

156
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,120
- Yeah, it might have been, yeah. 
- It looks absolutely solid. 

157
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,400
Technically, it's raw. 

158
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,360
The judging of the baking was scary. 

159
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,280
I don't think I can look when you do that. 

160
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,840
It is the first time that your baking is being judged, you know? 

161
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,200
Nobody has ever done that to me before, 

162
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,160
I've never entered any kind of competition. 

163
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,800
If I make something for my family, then they eat it. 

164
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,600
You and your family have 

165
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,600
a particular type of, I suppose, taste that they like, 

166
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,080
and it's not until I got into that tent last year 

167
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,560
that I actually had real criticism from professionals 

168
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,800
who actually know what they're talking about. 

169
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
I think it could be better. 

170
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,920
We find we have to hold back, actually, because our knowledge 

171
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,000
is so extensive of baking. Don't you find that? 

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,760
What she doesn't know about ganache isn't worth knowing. 

173
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,000
Do you know what I mean? We let them judge, we just hold back. 

174
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,600
Week after week, the bakers would make the long, lonely walk 

175
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,680
to the gingham altar, 

176
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,160
praying they'd done enough to impress Mary and Paul. 

177
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,480
You're just shaking, it's like a firing squad. 

178
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,240
Just get it over and done with and shoot me. 

179
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,640
It looks like a chocolate breezeblock. 

180
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,800
I'm not very good at many things, 

181
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,840
but I think I'm quite good at baking, and to have somebody say, 

182
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,520
"Actually, this is a bit naff," it's hard to hear that. 

183
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,840
It's a little bit dry and a little bit lacking in flavour. 

184
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,320
Is it really? Oh, goodness. 

185
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,800
Waiting in the queue, 

186
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,760
you've overheard some of the other judgements and then you start 

187
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,720
looking again at your bake, trying to anticipate some of the feedback. 

188
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,920
There were a few moments I can think of in particular where 

189
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,480
I stood waiting at the judging and was trying quite hard not to cry, 

190
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,720
because that's what you're there for, it all builds up to that point. 

191
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,120
You're a bit worried as that knife's going down. 

192
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,240
Just massaging the temples in stress. 

193
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,720
People tell me all the time that I looked terrified 

194
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,200
most of the time. I think I probably was terrified most of the time. 

195
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,880
And if there's one thing Mary and Paul like to do, 

196
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,280
it's make the bakers sweat. 

197
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,880
It's like life is moving in slow motion, so they slowly taste it 

198
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,880
and you're just watching for any sort of emotion on their faces. 

199
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,000
You feel like you've got a big, fat spotlight hovering above you. 

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,120
You're hoping that it's baked properly, 

201
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,720
because that's a key component, that the crumb is right, 

202
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,720
and your balance of flavourings is right, 

203
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,040
and so all of these things are going through your head, 

204
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,120
which makes you apprehensive at that point, 

205
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,400
and you're just hoping that all the elements come together. 

206
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,800
Yeah, well done. 

207
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,480
The relief, I suppose, was amazing. 

208
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,520
That was the best feeling, the relief when you put a bake down 

209
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,520
and they said, "That's all right." 

210
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,240
- Great flavour.
- Good, thank you. 

211
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,640
Lovely crust on it. 

212
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm loving that. 

213
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,640
You kind of wait for the facial expression, 

214
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,600
and if you know that they like it, you feel happy. 

215
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,720
That tastes absolutely delicious. 

216
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,440
I was kind of shocked every time I got positive feedback 

217
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,920
from the judges, it's just the best feeling. 

218
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,280
If you get one very, very good remark from the judging, 

219
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,840
it helps you for your next bake and kind of takes the pressure off. 

220
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,920
It makes your day. 

221
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,720
It reminds me of those '70s cakes. 

222
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,360
It's Technicolor, it's great, it's beautiful. 

223
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,120
I remember Paul made this comment which sort of stuck with me 

224
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,680
for the rest of the series. 

225
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,240
I think you've done a good job there, 

226
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,640
but keep away from the '70s decoration. 

227
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,480
There was a lot of teasing going on. 

228
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Is it '70s delight today, or is it something more in the '80s? 

229
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,360
They say '70s, but I think I'm a great bridge 

230
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,880
between the '70s and today. 

231
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,800
I'm giving the '70s the modern twist. 

232
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,480
I hope he heard that. 

233
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,200
Since the Bake Off, life has changed for many of them. 

234
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,040
Brendan's spare time has become saturated with baking. 

235
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,880
He now shares his knowledge twice a month at a cookery school. 

236
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,960
I love teaching, I've reached that stage of my life now, 

237
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,560
I'm in my early 60s, I've reached that stage where I'm keen to pass on 

238
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,880
the skill to those who are keen to have it. 

239
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,360
A quick way is to just do that, it's called fluffing. 

240
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,400
- Fluffing?
- Yeah. 

241
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,200
If you fluff it like you would a sheet when you're making the bed, 

242
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,520
that helps the tension to go a bit. 

243
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,640
And his flair for mixing the old with the new 

244
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,760
is being used by a local restaurant. 

245
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,200
This is a project I'm doing on behalf of a restaurateur, 

246
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,600
and it's reviving some of the old classics. 

247
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,680
For example, this is a black forest gateau, 

248
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,280
which was hugely popular in the '70s and '80s, 

249
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,240
and then became over-exposed and people grew tired of it. 

250
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,560
Being on Bake Off, it's been extraordinary, what's happened, 

251
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,000
so, yes, it's opened doors everywhere, really. 

252
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,080
During the Bake Off, Brendan and his fellow bakers 

253
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,360
wanted to please a woman whose name is synonymous with baking. 

254
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,160
Mary Berry's recipes, such pressure. 

255
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,320
If I don't present them as perfect, I'm going to feel dreadful. 

256
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,480
Even now, I can't believe, really, that I've baked for Mary. 

257
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,720
It just is amazing. 

258
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,080
That looks amazing, there are even cobwebs here! 

259
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,440
Oh, Mary was always so nice, 

260
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,040
you didn't feel any stress baking for Mary, did you? 

261
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,560
Actually, the parsnip is not coming through strongly as parsnip, 

262
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,120
but very brave to put that parsnip in, even though we can't find it. 

263
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,200
In many ways, it felt like a bit of an honour. You really, really didn't 

264
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,720
want to disappoint them. It was like baking for the Queen, or something. 

265
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,840
These are for good appetites, aren't they? 

266
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,320
When I got praise from Mary, it was actually something special. 

267
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,040
I think, actually, that's delicious. 

268
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,240
Thank you. 

269
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,680
She's got so much knowledge, 

270
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,240
you just worry that you'll do something wrong technically 

271
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,920
in front of her, and so when she comes along, I always pray to myself, 

272
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,880
"Don't be doing something quite technical, 

273
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,560
"peel some fruits or something, yeah?" So it doesn't look bad. 

274
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,600
I don't want her to go, 

275
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,600
"Ryan, why are you doing that? It's wrong, yeah?" It's quite worrying. 

276
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,400
While many flourished with a good word from Mary, 

277
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,120
even the hardiest bakers crumbled 

278
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,600
under the steely gaze of Paul Hollywood. 

279
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,920
- The sponge is bland. 
- Bland?
- Absolutely. 

280
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,320
Paul's a bit more of a tricky creature to please. 

281
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,920
You may as well be chewing on a piece of card. 

282
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,120
- Well, that's a bit harsh. 
- No, honestly. 

283
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,920
There's always something there that he wants you to improve on, 

284
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,960
but he's a professional, and of course, that's his line of business. 

285
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,960
The flavour's there, the texture's there, but the look is terrible. 

286
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,680
With Paul, I mean, yes, he doesn't have that... 

287
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,120
Graciousness is the word that comes to mind. 

288
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,800
Neither would you put him into the diplomatic service either, 

289
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,720
because he'd create incidents, I suspect. 

290
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,800
This one's had some serious issues. 

291
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,680
They've had problems with the dough, 

292
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,720
they probably haven't blended it together properly, worked it. 

293
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,040
I'll talk to this person later. 

294
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,640
But you do respect the quality of his judging. 

295
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,280
Say something nice. 

296
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,640
It's got a nice glaze on it, but it's like raw dough in the middle. 

297
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,360
When someone criticises your bakes, it can be really quite difficult. 

298
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,320
It's a comment that can come from someone like Paul that takes you 

299
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,400
from a really upbeat high, 

300
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,400
and then you're into a really downbeat moment again. 

301
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,960
You have got some burnt ones and you have got some light ones. 

302
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,240
Burnt's maybe a bit harsh. 

303
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,280
Paul came across as a bit of... 

304
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,000
an arrogant so-and-so in some instances. 

305
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,480
Paul put up with me, I think he always thought I was quite cheeky. 

306
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,720
I was under the understanding it was meant to be finished with a barn. 

307
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,000
No, it wasn't, this is exactly how I intended it, 

308
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,160
it's a piece of modern art. 

309
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,320
Paul was never really that impressed with me, I don't think. 

310
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,800
He was not a fan of my bread 

311
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,920
when I served him that enriched dough thing, 

312
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,280
he wasn't impressed with that. 

313
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,200
- Yeah, it's raw.
- Raw?
- Yeah. 

314
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,200
There were times when you sort of wanted to just leap off that chair 

315
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,080
and strangle Paul Hollywood by the scruff of his neck. 

316
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,000
It's beginning to weld my mouth together, 

317
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,280
which is probably not a bad thing. 

318
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,800
Well, of course, you know, you'd get kicked out for that, 

319
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,080
so I was quite restrained. 

320
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,920
Grr, stress. Hello, are you in there? 

321
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,000
I feel a bit panicky already, which is not a good way to start. 

322
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,720
But no amount of practice at home could prepare the bakers 

323
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,680
for the effects of being in the Bake Off tent. 

324
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,800
I'm going to give that five more and then I'm going to bring it out. 

325
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,000
Maybe not even five, maybe just four. 

326
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,600
No, because I've opened the oven, I'll give it five. 

327
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,320
It was so different, baking in there, to being in my own kitchen. 

328
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,000
Everything worked in there, for a start, which is always good. 

329
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,960
Not everything works in my kitchen. 

330
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,800
It's not a normal baking environment, 

331
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,800
although it's a lovely environment, but it's not like being at home. 

332
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,000
And you either look at what other people are doing... 

333
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,280
I would be the first person in the oil. 

334
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,800
Maybe I should just take the oily plunge. 

335
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,840
So you spend your time worrying about what you're doing, 

336
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,000
kind of worrying about what everyone else is doing 

337
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,320
and just hoping that everything turns out all right. 

338
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,520
Oh, my giddy aunt. 

339
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,400
The pressure's just incredible. 

340
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,760
You could hear a penny drop. 

341
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,520
It's the make or break of people, I think, in that tent. 

342
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
There's problems with it, there's issues. 

343
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,400
When I look back, I had fond memories, 

344
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,720
but after seeing the programme, 

345
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,440
it all floods back how, actually, quite stressful it is. 

346
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,960
I might be in a bit of trouble, because if he believes 

347
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:56,280
it's overproved again, he'll say this is a constant mistake. 

348
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,440
The other biggest challenge we had was it was either 

349
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,800
bucketing down when we had to work with meringue-like mixtures... 

350
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,160
..and you do not make meringues when there's a lot of dampness 

351
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,560
in the atmosphere, because you're beating in damp air 

352
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,960
into the egg white, 

353
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,040
or it was sweltering hot and we were now working with chocolate. 

354
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,520
Today, we're asking you to make six chocolate teacakes. 

355
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,320
- In 30-degree heat. 
- Enjoy tempering that. 

356
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,600
I can't work in this heat, I'm actually dripping in sweat. 

357
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,480
So, the weather conditions 

358
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,120
as well as all the other areas in addition. 

359
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,600
It's so strange, there's so much going on in that little tent, 

360
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,360
it's like a TARDIS. You think it's a tiny little tent in the middle 

361
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,720
of a quaint field, but actually it's a baking whirlwind inside that tent. 

362
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,920
Slowly, the quest for perfect pastry 

363
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,880
and brilliant bread took over the bakers' every moment. 

364
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,600
If I wasn't on the show, I was at home practising, 

365
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,800
so it was just baking, baking, baking, 24/7. 

366
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,440
The Bake Off did become my life, I was baking like mad, 

367
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,480
and even dominated my family's life. Me and my wife... 

368
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,520
She'd had enough even before we started the Bake Off, 

369
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,240
because flour's everywhere in the kitchen. 

370
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,560
So it really dominated my life for that period, yes. 

371
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,760
Oh, pants! 

372
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,840
I'm not going to tell you I became slightly obsessive, 

373
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,120
even though I might have done. 

374
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,800
I'm checking the time on my timer, because I didn't set it, 

375
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,920
but then I remembered I didn't set it, so it's not actually coming out 

376
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,760
in one minute, but it was check it in one minute, 

377
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,440
but they're not ready to come out, but I need a small saucepan. 

378
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,120
It feels like it's the centre of the universe, it really does. 

379
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,600
It sounds ridiculous, and that's why people maybe can't understand 

380
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,320
why we're so emotional about it, but it's everything when you're doing it. 

381
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,240
I thought it looked good as it was, and it didn't. 

382
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,880
I can't believe I've actually cried, it's ridiculous. 

383
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,360
It's a bloody treacle tart. 

384
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,680
At that time, baking was everything. Literally, I couldn't think about 

385
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,440
anything else, all I thought about was baking, constantly. 

386
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,280
I remember we were in the hotel and Sarah-Jane said that she thought 

387
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,240
the little light on her television was the oven light, so she got up 

388
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,760
in the middle of the night, walked over to the television 

389
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,920
and tried to turn it off, thinking it was the oven. 

390
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,080
You hallucinate, you hallucinate Mary Berry 

391
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,960
and Paul coming out of a big cake. It's bonkers. 

392
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,920
It's a total rollercoaster, this Bake Off. 

393
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,760
I thought it would just be a nice, gentle plod. 

394
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,760
It's not, it's the craziest rollercoaster you've ever been on. 

395
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,200
In a marquee, in the middle of a field. It's mental. 

396
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,320
And the Bake Off rollercoaster was unrelenting. 

397
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,640
And for some, it became a physical problem. 

398
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,480
The week I cut my finger, I think I was more embarrassed than 

399
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,280
actually in pain, because what a stupid thing to do. 

400
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,720
His glove, it's full of blood, and it's all down his arm. 

401
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,400
John's really cut himself. 

402
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,120
His glove is full of blood. 

403
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,800
And I was just so embarrassed, I went quite pale at one point. 

404
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,400
Along with the Bake Off medic, a fellow baker came to John's aid. 

405
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,000
- Don't worry.
- I just keep feeling really dizzy.
- That's fine. 

406
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,880
Just sit down, I'm going to have a quick look, all right? Don't look. 

407
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,400
You just do what you need to do. 

408
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,560
I just had to sit down and Danny had to help me, 

409
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,880
because she's the doctor, and I was just embarrassed, 

410
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,680
I was so embarrassed, I just felt so stupid that I'd done it. 

411
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,360
I've done everything, all I need to do now is make the dough. 

412
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,960
You can't do your strudel with your finger like this. 

413
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,760
The last thing you need to worry about right now is a strudel. 

414
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,120
I was really gutted, because I honestly thought that 

415
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,240
I would get kicked out for that, because obviously it's a competition, 

416
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,640
you can't make stupid moves like that, and if you do something stupid, 

417
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,880
you will get kicked out. 

418
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,400
But after much deliberation, 

419
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,960
Paul and Mary called for something that had never been done before. 

420
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,600
The journey has to end this week for somebody. 

421
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,800
And that person is... 

422
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,560
..nobody. No-one's going! Because it just wasn't fair. 

423
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,080
Oh, my days. 

424
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,840
Not only was the tent full of stress, panic and mayhem, 

425
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,280
there were two other ingredients essential to the mix, 

426
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,880
and it wasn't the judges. 

427
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
Paul and Mary, off you trot. 

428
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,280
Literally trot, please, Mary, rising trot, good girl. 

429
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,760
She can still do it, won several gymkhanas. Good girl. Lovely filly. 

430
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,400
I love Mel and Sue, like, I literally love them. 

431
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,400
What we're looking for is your own personal spin 

432
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,200
on an absolute classic - the upside-down cake. 

433
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,440
Or, as the Australians call it, cake. 

434
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,920
Those girls are just fabulous. 

435
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,000
Mel and Sue were brilliant, when you had a negative or a down day, 

436
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,920
they would come and lift your spirits high. 

437
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,880
This is semi-finalitis, mate. Just calm down a bit, yeah? 

438
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,600
- It's all right, you're going to be fine.
- Thanks for that, Mel. 

439
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,640
There was one particular occasion when Mel and I were talking 

440
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,760
about the '70s label. 

441
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,880
Were you a bit of a groovester? 

442
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,800
I used to love disco, and Gloria Gaynor, 

443
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,680
I was very good at Gloria Gaynor, 

444
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,840
and I was known for my dips, as it were. 

445
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,720
Dip for me, please. 

446
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,200
- There's a little wiggle you have to do.
- Oh, one of these? 

447
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,960
Exactly, shimmy a bit. 

448
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,880
When you needed the sort of arm round the shoulder 

449
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,120
or a shoulder to cry on, you thought of Mel... 

450
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,480
Do you know what? My dad always told this to me. 

451
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,640
If I was doing an exam or I was really nervous... 

452
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,440
- Don't say pretend they're naked. 
- ..pretend they're naked. 

453
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,480
I knew you were going to say that. That'll make it so much worse. 

454
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,560
Pretend Hollywood and Berry are fully in the buff - 

455
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,200
that will help, seriously. 

456
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,000
Exactly, seriously. 

457
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,920
..whereas Sue on the other hand had a different technique. 

458
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,040
She'd ask you a simple question, you'd give her a simple answer 

459
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,880
and it'd suddenly be taken into the realms of the absurd. 

460
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,680
I think that's marvellous, 

461
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,400
it's the best use I've seen for a mug tree since mugs went on it. 

462
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,680
People don't understand how hard it is, really, 

463
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,520
to once every three or four hours 

464
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,360
just walk over to somebody and say, "How are you doing?" 

465
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,680
Because it's not the phrase "How are you doing?" - 

466
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,160
- it's the way you say it.
- Well, it's 25 years, it's 25 years of hard graft 

467
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,680
and experience that goes into that. 

468
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,680
Mel and Sue were little mischiefs. 

469
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,320
- Are these going spare? 
- They are going spare. 

470
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,720
Not for any longer they're not. 

471
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,200
But one thing Sue does is she nicks your ingredients. 

472
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,160
How many macaroons do you need? 

473
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,120
Not as many as that. 

474
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,280
It's really annoying, she'll come and peck at it 

475
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,960
and you won't believe it, and she'll sometimes finish it off! 

476
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,240
And this one, because it's got a tail, 

477
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,600
I don't think you want Mary to see that. 

478
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,760
No, Mary, that one did not exist. 

479
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,120
That's a genetic mutation. It's gone now. 

480
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,640
They were a help at times and a hindrance at other times, 

481
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,640
but they were good fun. They kept us alive, I think. 

482
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,360
When not filling their faces, 

483
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,280
Mel and Sue had the other enjoyable task of announcing the Star Baker. 

484
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,320
It's the one and the only Brendan. Star Baker, well done. 

485
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,560
Danny, Star Baker, well done. 

486
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,320
And they're giving it this week to the best tank top in the room - 

487
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,720
it's James. 

488
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,680
James' skills would lead him to win Star Baker 

489
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,240
a series best of three times. 

490
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,920
You're such a clever thing, you are. Clever and cosy. 

491
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,880
I think the tank tops and the fair isle, 

492
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,160
I think I've done my bit now for Shetland knitting. 

493
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,000
I think it's very nice that almost everything you do, 

494
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,520
you bring from Scotland, including your jumper. 

495
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,880
Since leaving Bake Off, James has taken his baking knowledge 

496
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,080
and stylish knitwear to a new venture. 

497
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,640
I've chosen this particular tank top today 

498
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,400
because this is actually the same, the very same tank top, 

499
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,000
that I wore on episode three. 

500
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,520
I was very happy and very lucky to win Star Baker that week, 

501
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,600
so this tank top has got good memories. 

502
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,400
It's very exciting, it's just absolutely very... This is amazing. 

503
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,120
Today, he is at a photo shoot for his first baking book. 

504
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,040
It's a lovely smile, it's great. 

505
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,920
This is the fifth day of our photo shoot for my new book, 

506
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:14,160
and we've just got the cover done, and we're just interspersing that 

507
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,800
with a few breads to go inside as well. 

508
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,720
I just wanted to show people, bread is so, so easy to make, 

509
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,160
and it's so, so good when you make it yourself. 

510
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,160
I hope Paul and Mary, they'll be at least a little bit proud. 

511
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,680
I've got a lot to thank them for, 

512
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,920
but I don't want this book to outsell Paul's. 

513
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,000
During his time in the tent, James produced some spectacular creations. 

514
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,680
I think it's really most unusual, and certainly you've been inventive. 

515
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,400
I liked the whisky. Whisky was good. 

516
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,320
Whisky with orange, whisky with anything. 

517
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,280
- So this is agar and whisky?
- Yeah. 
- Basically, whisky jelly. 

518
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,440
Can I eat this? 

519
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,320
Goodness, that is strong. 

520
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,120
- Woo!
- That is strong! 

521
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,840
And he wasn't the only one to produce some incredible bakes. 

522
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,480
I think the bakes that I was most proud of, 

523
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,840
there were a number I was really very happy with, 

524
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,040
but I liked particularly the finish to the Gateau St Honore. 

525
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,560
The moment I'm most proud of, it has to be the key lime pie. 

526
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,920
Watch it, it might splash. 

527
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,560
To this day, I get so many people stopping me 

528
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,400
and asking me for recipes and talk about the key lime pie. 

529
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,480
I think it looks absolutely lovely, so fresh. 

530
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,040
To have it, instantly, you know that it's key lime pie, 

531
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,000
because you've got the little pieces of lime. 

532
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,600
Well, the first thing was I noticed he was chewing for ages 

533
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,640
without saying anything, and I thought, "This is a very good sign 

534
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,240
"or a very bad sign," and I weren't sure, and I was so worried, 

535
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,280
because for the technical challenge that week, I came bottom. 

536
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,520
So I thought, "Uh-oh, if that is a bad sign, 

537
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,600
"I am in big, big trouble." So I was actually really freaked out. 

538
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,200
You nailed that one, Ryan. You've absolutely nailed that. 

539
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,480
When he said it was amazing, I didn't actually feel happy at that time. 

540
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,240
It was more of a relief, and then the emotions kicked in 

541
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,000
and I got a bit wet and soppy and a tear ran down my cheek. 

542
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,720
- That is very special.
- Oh, thank you. 

543
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,840
- That's a very nice pie.
- Sheer perfection.
- Oh, thank you. 

544
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,240
The comments I got from the judges were just amazing. 

545
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,320
This pie was so good that Paul and Mary wanted Ryan to know 

546
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,320
it was one of the best things they have tasted 

547
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,200
in all three series of the Bake Off. Congratulations, Ryan. 

548
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,920
I didn't realise it was that good. 

549
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,240
But the scales of baking success could always tip the other way. 

550
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,720
Oh. 

551
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,040
What a mess. Total disaster. 

552
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,960
They're not ready! 

553
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,720
Messed up again. 

554
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,720
Oh, my God. 

555
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,680
They're not ready! 

556
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,560
I've burnt my first batch. 

557
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,400
It's all gone wrong. 

558
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,080
- They're broken!
- What do you mean, they're broken? They're separating? 

559
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,920
No, look! What am I going to do? 

560
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,520
- Fridge and pray.
- Oh, my giddy aunt. 

561
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,840
When things went wrong, it did kind of feel awful, it's like, 

562
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,200
"Come on, why are all these things going wrong?" 

563
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,600
And once one went wrong, something else went wrong, 

564
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,200
and then something else went wrong. 

565
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,240
Slide that on top, Bob's your uncle. 

566
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,720
Let's try that again. 

567
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,320
My strudel's got a haemorrhage. Do I mean haemorrhage? 

568
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,640
Haemorrhage or haemorrhoid? 

569
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,840
You've only got one opportunity, you can't just say, "Actually, I know 

570
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,800
"it's a bit pants, do you mind if I go and quickly bake another one?" 

571
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,040
Oh, my giddy aunt. 

572
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,760
I'm going to have to start again. 

573
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,480
When things went wrong, you did try and sort of get round it, 

574
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,600
and I'd throw it in the bin or throw it at somebody else. 

575
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,000
Mary always says that if you drop something on the floor, 

576
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,800
if no-one's looking, pick it back up and throw it back in the pot, 

577
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,280
and I completely agree. 

578
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,400
One thing I learnt, that if you make a mistake, don't tell Paul Hollywood 

579
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,880
about it or he'll pick up on it. Don't give him a reason 

580
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,000
to get rid of you, just pretend nothing happened and just drive on. 

581
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,600
- Hi, Paul.
- Am I not wanted at the moment? 

582
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,640
- No, no, you're always wanted. 
- It's a mess in here.
- Yes, it is. 

583
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,000
When I did the upside-down cake, I wanted to do something really... 

584
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,480
I suppose out of the norm, 

585
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,840
and just try and impress on the first episode. 

586
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,480
I've tweaked it by making it a little bit more tomatoey 

587
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,040
by adding some more tomato jam with it as well. 

588
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,720
- Well, he's original anyway, we're waiting.
- He's a maverick. 

589
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,920
And I forgot to put the jam in, 

590
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,520
which is obviously the main component 

591
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,120
of the tomato upside-down cake. 

592
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,440
- I forgot to put my tomato jam in! 
- What? 

593
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,360
Yeah, gutted. Stupid error. 

594
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,920
In blind panic, I put the cake in the oven before putting 

595
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,440
the tomato jam on. It adds to the flavour of it. 

596
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,000
Other than that, it's just a cake with tomato decorations on top. 

597
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,720
I should spread it on top. 

598
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,640
I've messed up big style here. 

599
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,160
Of course, you have a pot of sugar and a pot of salt here 

600
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,480
and you can't tell the difference unless you taste it. 

601
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,600
I should have dipped my finger in, but I didn't, 

602
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,000
so I salted the tin and it was too late by the time I found out, 

603
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,560
because I'd baked the rum baba. 

604
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,160
That is disgusting. It's going to put me in the bad books. 

605
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,600
I genuinely believed that I was going home. 

606
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,640
Not even that week - I thought after that challenge 

607
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,720
they'd say, "What the hell are you doing here? Get out." 

608
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,160
It made Paul Hollywood gag, 

609
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,360
and that's something... That's an achievement in itself, isn't it? 

610
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,920
Oh, jeez! 

611
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,080
What is it, Paul? 

612
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,240
There's too much salt in there. Ugh! 

613
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,160
During the American Pie Showstopper Challenge, 

614
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,680
Cathryn took the unusual step of using an ingredient she didn't like. 

615
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,760
My brother lives in America, so I got a few tips from him, 

616
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,000
and he did say peanut butter was a goer, 

617
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,240
so that's what I went with. 

618
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,680
It was the most stupid thing I could have done. 

619
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:28,280
To make something that, actually, I thought was horrible. 

620
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,560
Other people had told me it was nice, and I believed them. 

621
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,280
- I don't like that.
- Don't you? 
- At all. 

622
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,560
It's like eating a pot full of crunchy peanut butter, 

623
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,080
- but none of the flavour.
- Oh. 

624
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,600
What a stupid thing, 

625
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,040
to make something that you don't like the taste of yourself. 

626
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,000
Oh, my God almighty! 

627
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,400
Sarah-Jane, keep it in the oven. 

628
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,080
I can't keep it in the oven, John. It's melting. 

629
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,360
A particular disaster that sticks in my mind is my Wellington. 

630
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:07,040
I can't watch it, I can't watch that moment at all. 

631
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:13,840
I had it on the other day, and it was the bit where Mary came over 

632
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,960
and she was asking me why the joint of meat was in the silver foil. 

633
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,280
Why have you got your beef in foil? 

634
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,160
I seared it in the pan and then I roasted it in the oven 

635
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,840
just for 15 minutes, and put it in the foil so that all the steam would 

636
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,960
stay in and try and keep it as moist as possible. So, that's the plan. 

637
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,160
I had some answer at the time, but I watch it back now, 

638
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,400
I was just screaming at the telly, "Look at her eyes! 

639
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,080
"She's telling you with her eyes, take that 

640
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,120
"and put it in the fridge, otherwise the pastry's going to melt." 

641
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,880
And I can see it in her face 

642
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,840
and she's just getting really frustrated. You can see 

643
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,600
she really wants to say something, but she doesn't, 

644
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,560
but she's looking at me in that kind of, 

645
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,000
"I know better - put it in the fridge," kind of way. 

646
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,680
Oh, no! 

647
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,120
This is the worst thing I've ever made in my whole entire life. 

648
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,680
I've got to serve it to Paul and Mary. 

649
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,400
She was exactly right, I put it in the oven and the whole thing melted 

650
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,600
and it looked like something out of a horror film. 

651
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,280
I think it's quite coquettish. 

652
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,160
It's saying, "Look at me, look what's inside, come on in." 

653
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,000
I think it looks like the Alien film. 

654
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,760
It was the worst thing I'd ever made. 

655
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,240
So awful. 

656
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,720
Sarah-Jane pulled herself back from her calamitous Wellington, 

657
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,080
and, post-Bake Off, is working in a local patisserie. 

658
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,120
Every other Thursday, I'm in the kitchen, 

659
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,360
under the instruction of Denise. 

660
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,400
- And obviously, I've pre-processed this.
- Yes. 

661
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,240
What is this? 

662
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,200
- Sun-dried tomatoes and garlic.
- OK. 

663
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,920
And then that'll just... knock it in a bit for us. 

664
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,360
Probably the best thing that has come out of the Bake Off is 

665
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,400
that I now know that I want to work in a kitchen, 

666
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,040
so I'm really, really lucky, I feel really lucky to be able to be here 

667
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,880
in such a lovely environment and be taught by Denise, it's brilliant. 

668
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,400
And Sarah-Jane keeps her baking guardian angel close by. 

669
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,720
I've got a little picture of Mary watching over us 

670
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,200
when we're baking, for a little bit of inspiration. 

671
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,440
If we're lacking a bit of energy, 

672
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,720
we look to Mary and her beautiful smile cheers us up. 

673
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,680
During her time in the Bake Off, Sarah-Jane developed 

674
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,000
a very close relationship with one of her fellow bakers. 

675
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,200
I think Cathryn and I got on so well because we'd both come 

676
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,600
from similar situations, we both had a husband and children at home. 

677
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,000
Sarah-Jane and I had the most brilliant relationship. 

678
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,320
We would have such a laugh and we were always really happy 

679
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,520
if our benches were near each other, so we could have a bit of a chat 

680
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,400
and maybe try and help each other a bit, 

681
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,880
and we'd always be peeping in each other's ovens. 

682
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,320
But this baking camaraderie nearly led to baking disaster 

683
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,640
during the strudel Showstopper Challenge. 

684
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,520
Paul had come over to me and shown me 

685
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,600
a way that he did it of grabbing the end of the dough, twisting it over 

686
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,320
and flicking it at the same time, in kind of that sort of motion. 

687
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,920
Hang on, hang on, is that kneaded? Is that what you do? 

688
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,120
That's not what I've been doing. 

689
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:38,640
All you're trying to do on a strudel is build up the resistance, 

690
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,520
build up the gluten in the actual dough itself by stretching it. 

691
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,240
Because we liked to share tips and help each other along, 

692
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,920
Sarah-Jane came back and we were having a chat 

693
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,040
and she decided to show me this ingenious kneading technique 

694
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,240
of Paul's that would obviously make my strudel superior, 

695
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,600
so if it's good enough for Hollywood, it's good enough for me. 

696
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,040
- Hold it by the end and flick it. 
- This is horrible. 

697
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,600
No, no, that looks really good. 

698
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,360
So I was listening to Sarah-Jane's instructions 

699
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,120
and...I had a... 

700
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,240
A bit stayed in my hand, but the rest just launched. 

701
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,120
So far that you can... 

702
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,520
Ooh! 

703
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,200
Well, I'm glad I wasn't standing there! 

704
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,360
Oh, Sarah-Jane! 

705
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,120
It was then covered in green carpet, which she didn't feel 

706
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,360
she could serve to Mary Berry, for some reason. 

707
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,680
- Oh, it's so hairy. 
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry! 

708
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,360
Don't be silly, you didn't throw it on the floor. 

709
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,280
But I made you try and throw it on the floor. Don't throw it away, 

710
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,240
- it's really nice.
- You can see carpet in it.
- Just take the carpet out. 

711
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,160
Wrap it in some oil and put it on a table. 

712
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,040
It's got green carpet in it, I'm not serving Mary Berry green carpet. 

713
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,200
Cathryn, do you blame me? 

714
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,400
Completely, but, you know, I'll get over it(!) 

715
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,440
Course I don't, it's fine. 

716
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,680
I get lots and lots of people say that that's their funniest, 

717
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,840
most calamitous moment of Bake Off, and it is really funny, 

718
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,680
my children think it's hilarious. 

719
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,280
Luckily, it went really well for her and they loved her strudel. 

720
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,320
It's good strudel, it's nice and thin 

721
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,800
and the interior is delicious, it all goes really well together. 

722
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,480
Thanks. 

723
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,520
But if it hadn't have gone well, I'd have felt awful. 

724
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,800
Luckily, it went terribly for me. 

725
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,040
The strudel itself is not crisp. 

726
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,720
- No.
- OK. 
- It's not strudel-like.
- OK. 

727
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,000
- Can I borrow your golden syrup, please, James?
- Yes.
- Excuse me. 

728
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,720
The friendships in the tent were surprising. 

729
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,320
I thought it was going to be quite intense in there, 

730
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,560
no-one was going to talk to each other, 

731
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,360
but in fact, it was totally the opposite. 

732
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,320
We became kind of a close family. 

733
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,160
Oh, wow, this is really, really good. 

734
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,760
That's a good marshmallow. 

735
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,440
There was a strong sense of friendship and loyalty 

736
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,800
between all the bakers, there wasn't really any jealousy 

737
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,480
or any moments you wanted to trip someone up. 

738
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,160
My goodness, that is massive. 

739
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,800
It's huge. Isn't it massive? 

740
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,560
- That is beef, yeah?
- I hope so. 

741
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,520
Most of the time, it just felt like we were just a group of friends 

742
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,680
baking together in a tent, in the middle of a field, as you do. 

743
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,840
12 months later, lots of us are all still in touch, 

744
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,160
so that says it all, really. 

745
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,200
Oh, I like that. 

746
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,080
We were like a little family, and it's so nice, and every time 

747
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,800
we see each other, we don't shut up. All of us, we had the best time. 

748
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,080
Beautiful. 

749
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,000
Please tell me you are going to dust that with icing sugar. 

750
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,960
- Liberally.
- Oh, it's going to be beautiful! 

751
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,680
There definitely was a sense of, "We're all in this together." 

752
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,880
There was a great sense of solidarity. 

753
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,600
We knew we were competing, we knew we'd be judged on it. 

754
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,960
But there was a togetherness there that was impressive. 

755
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,640
This sense of solidarity made it all the more difficult 

756
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,600
when it came to say goodbye. 

757
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,880
Natasha, I'm so sorry, darling. 

758
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,720
- Thank you.
- I'm so sorry, sweetheart. 
- I think that's fair. 

759
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,880
I think it was the right decision, I suppose I just didn't do my best. 

760
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,360
I was quite emotional, and anybody who knows me 

761
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,560
knows I'm not an emotional person at all, 

762
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,800
so lots of people saw me cry on the Bake Off for the first time. 

763
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,080
People who've known me all their lives have never seen me cry. 

764
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,720
Peter... 

765
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,400
Let me give you a massive Mel and Sue sandwich, 

766
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,640
the like of which you can only have in your worst nightmares. 

767
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,760
I'm so sorry. 

768
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,520
- It's been fantastic. 
- A round of applause.
- Thank you. 

769
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,800
Victoria. 

770
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,320
It's absolutely the right decision that my bake was not up to scratch, 

771
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,520
and that's how it's judged. Yeah, no case to answer. Guilty, m'lud. 

772
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,680
Stuart. 

773
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,200
We're going to miss you, Stuart, come on. 

774
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,320
Go on! 

775
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,880
It just felt...everything was in slow motion. 

776
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,480
As cliched as that sounds, 

777
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,520
everything was in slow motion when Sue said my name 

778
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,440
and...I don't know, it was the realisation 

779
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,880
that it was all over, it was really, really sad when it was all over. 

780
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,920
Manisha. 

781
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,720
- We're going to miss you. 
- We are going to miss you. 

782
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,640
It is quite sad because, you know, I would like to stay more 

783
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,800
and carry on baking more, 

784
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,240
but it was my time to go, so, you know, I had to leave. 

785
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,360
It was almost like standing on the edge of a cliff, 

786
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,520
waiting to jump off. 

787
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,480
I knew what was going to happen, I knew the outcome, 

788
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,040
but that really long pause they have between was just purgatory. 

789
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm very sorry to say that the people not coming with us 

790
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,520
on our journey next week are Sarah-Jane... 

791
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,040
..and Ryan. 

792
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,960
I was actually devastated when I got kicked out. 

793
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,480
You know, at first, when I came onto Bake Off, 

794
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,560
I didn't actually take it that seriously, it was for fun. 

795
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,840
But I somehow got wrapped into it. 

796
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,960
It was really sad at the time, really sad, 

797
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
because I was just having so much fun 

798
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,320
and we were all getting on so well. 

799
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,040
- Just having a really, really good time.
- Oh! 

800
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:21,120
I wanted to just carry on right to the end, but I messed it up. 

801
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,760
With only five bakers left in the quarter-final... 

802
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,480
One, two, three, four, five... 

803
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,440
..the rivalry reached boiling point. 

804
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,920
It's 35 degrees in here. 

805
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,600
Oh, dear, and you want your chocolate to be 33. 

806
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,240
- 33 or 32, yeah. 
- OK, so we've got an issue already. 

807
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,760
Oh, it's so hot! 

808
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,200
And for one baker, the cracks really started to show. 

809
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,280
Honestly, I've completely lost it, this is car-crash crackers. 

810
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,360
I had an absolute shocker. 

811
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,200
Don't be scared of the cracker breads. 

812
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,960
Oh, gosh, I've got others in the oven, they'll be totally burnt! 

813
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,080
- Oh!
- Don't worry, that's all right. 

814
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,440
Yeah, they're a little bit burnt. 

815
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,320
Heavens to Betsy, what am I doing? 

816
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,560
I just wasn't... I just wasn't on it. 

817
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,760
I'm really sorry, I'm so embarrassed, 

818
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,040
they're really disastrous, I'm really sorry. 

819
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,760
There are only 46, for which I'm also sorry. 

820
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,600
- They don't look particularly good. 
- No, they're shocking. 

821
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,680
They're thick and thin and irregular colours. 

822
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,520
- The bakes, you go from that to that. 
- Yeah, I know. 

823
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,120
- Yeah, I know. 
- That one, you can bend. 

824
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,440
Dreadful, I know. 

825
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,440
Partly, choosing to make Buckingham Palace out of gingerbread 

826
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,800
was another not-so-wonderful idea. 

827
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,880
I don't think the Queen would like this much, 

828
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,120
I think she'd be a bit naffed off with me if she saw this. 

829
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,240
I was so gutted that I hadn't done my best. 

830
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,240
If I'd gone home on a week where I had done my best 

831
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,920
and that just hadn't matched up and been good enough, 

832
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,640
I'd have felt so cool about it, 

833
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,760
but because I really felt I hadn't done a good enough job, 

834
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,160
it was horrible. 

835
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,240
Is that chocolate and ginger? 

836
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,600
Yeah, and orange. 

837
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,040
It needs to choose one and run with it. 

838
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,800
Usually, when we're sat on the stools waiting to find out 

839
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,640
who's going home, there's always that slight, "Could it be me? 

840
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,920
"Could it be that person?" 

841
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,080
On the week I went, 

842
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,520
there was not 1% of doubt in anybody's mind, 

843
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,080
I was definitely going home, so that was horrible, 

844
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,400
because I almost felt everyone had gone, "Oh, sorry, Cathryn." 

845
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,880
Oh, God, here we go! 

846
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,440
And I had to sit there and I knew I was going 

847
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,760
and I knew I looked quite hot 

848
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,720
and, you know, my hair was quite flat 

849
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,120
and I was quite flat and I knew I was going home, 

850
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,600
so from the minute I sat on the seat, I was going to cry, 

851
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,280
and I was sort of crying from the minute I sat down, 

852
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,680
which is embarrassing. 

853
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,560
The person leaving us today is... 

854
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,520
..Cathryn. 

855
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,280
We're going to really, really, really miss you. 

856
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,800
Thanks. 

857
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,640
We're going to miss you so much. It's ludicrous. 

858
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,240
Come have a Mel-Sue sandwich. Come on. It's a scary thought. 

859
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,560
It's very unpleasant. 

860
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,600
Every time I watch it, 

861
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,760
because we watch it all the time, the whole series, we're quite sad, 

862
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,640
and every time I watch it, I think, "I'm going to be fine this time," 

863
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,040
and I sit down and it gets towards the end and I think, 

864
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,760
"Oh, no, you're going to cry again." 

865
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,800
And I don't just have a little tear - I do the proper crying. 

866
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,560
Every time. 

867
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,520
But Cathryn's love of baking didn't crumble with biscuit week 

868
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,080
as, after Bake Off, she started working at a local cafe and bakery. 

869
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,440
Morning! 

870
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,400
After Bake Off, I asked if I could come and work here, 

871
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,560
and it's been so nice to have a job that fits in with my family, 

872
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,080
but also where I'm learning loads 

873
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,960
and putting all of that work into practice, it's really fun. 

874
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,440
I have learnt a lot about macaroons since getting my job here, 

875
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,760
I literally couldn't make them before, and now I'm quite good, eh? 

876
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,080
- Getting there, I suppose.
- Thank you! 

877
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,400
She's also working on a book of baking recipes for children. 

878
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,400
I said, right at the beginning, I remember talking to someone 

879
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,800
and they said, "What would be your dream?" 

880
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,920
And one recipe in a magazine would have been completely amazing, 

881
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,280
so the thought that there will be somewhere at some point 

882
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,680
a collection of recipes that are all mine and a book 

883
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:52,440
that I actually wrote on a shop shelf somewhere will be ridiculous. 

884
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,520
Semi-final, mate. 

885
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,880
Come on! 

886
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,160
As the last four bakers battled for a place in the final... 

887
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,320
My creme pat has got cellulite at the moment. 

888
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,360
Oh, my God! 

889
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,720
I can't do it. 

890
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,400
..John and Danny both struggled 

891
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,360
under the pressure of producing perfect patisserie. 

892
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,720
There's nothing I can do, everything's just gone to pot. 

893
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,840
- Breathe.
- Don't be nice, I'll start crying. 

894
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,880
It's all right. 

895
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,000
Oh, God above, just look at that! 

896
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,240
It looks hideous. 

897
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,120
Danny's fraisier cake failure... 

898
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,200
Oh, dear, we need a spoon with this, rather than a slice. 

899
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,280
This has got serious problems with the creme pat. 

900
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,360
- The creme patissiere is not thick enough.
- No. 

901
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,560
..meant she was the last girl to leave. 

902
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,640
So I'm afraid the person who will not be joining us 

903
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,720
next week for the Great British Bake Off final is... 

904
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,680
- ..Danny.
- Thank you for all your help. 

905
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,880
This has pushed me as far as anything can push me, 

906
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,240
and it's been a good experience. 

907
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,040
Danny, whom I had a great regard for, I was sad to see her go. 

908
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,520
I felt bad that Danny got kicked out. 

909
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,680
I was glad I got through and she didn't, but I felt bad for her. 

910
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,040
- 'Hello?'
- Hi, Mum, it's only me. 

911
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,320
'Hi, darling.' 

912
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,880
- You've got a little big boy who's in the final.
- 'Oh, my God!' 

913
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,960
And for the first time, it was an all-male final. 

914
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,280
It's such an amazing thing that it was an all-male final. 

915
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,560
It was baking. I think that's brilliant, 

916
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,000
to hopefully inspire more men to take up the craft. 

917
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,360
I think the fact that it was an all-male final made it 

918
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,040
that bit more competitive. There was testosterone involved, 

919
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,280
Testosterone to a certain extent, with me and Brendan and James - 

920
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,240
we're not the most butch of lads, are we? 

921
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,920
I was delighted to get through, 

922
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,000
because that's what I'd set my objective from, 

923
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,560
from the early stages, 

924
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,480
because you've got no chance of winning unless you're in the final. 

925
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,760
I don't remember the final last year cos I was very heavily medicated. 

926
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,600
Perhaps you can shed some light on that? 

927
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,680
- There were three boys.
- Yes. 

928
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,880
Um...they did... They did a cake, 

929
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,120
- a big cake at the end. 
- They had a party, 

930
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,640
and I remember the police came. 

931
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,200
- That's right, yes. 
- Do you remember? The police came. 

932
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,200
After a close final, 

933
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,640
who would be crowned champion of Bake Off Series 3 

934
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,240
all came down to the very last Showstopper Challenge. 

935
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:45,520
It is absolutely delicious, and I love the fresh raspberry topping. 

936
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,320
- Well done.
- Thank you very much. 
- Well done, Brendan. 

937
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,440
Congrats, Brendan. 

938
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,160
I don't know what to say, really. 

939
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,880
I just had disaster after disaster after disaster in the final. 

940
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,520
- It's far too dry.
- Oh, no! 

941
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,280
That last bake, what I came out with was rubbish. 

942
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,640
But I had great fun making it. 

943
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,480
But it was John's heaven and hell chiffon cake 

944
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,120
that astounded the judges. 

945
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,000
It's rich. 

946
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,360
It's absolutely lovely. 

947
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,400
Mmm! 

948
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,280
That really works, you've got a beautiful blend of the chocolate. 

949
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,680
Paul and Mary have made their decision, 

950
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:37,520
and we're very, very pleased to announce that the winner 

951
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,280
of the Great British Bake Off 2012 is... 

952
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,200
..John. 

953
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,280
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE 

954
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,800
Being in the final was one thing, winning was another thing, 

955
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,000
I just can't describe it. I mean, I almost... 

956
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,880
My legs buckled, and I'm six foot two, 

957
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,560
I'm quite stocky, I'm not very dainty, 

958
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,840
but I almost keeled over, 

959
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,200
and my legs almost snapped beneath my weight. 

960
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,760
It was the strangest thing. 

961
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,440
I've never felt that sort of shock, 

962
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,200
that sensation of dread, excitement, 

963
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,240
all these indescribable emotions, I have never felt that before, 

964
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,680
and I don't think I'll ever experience that again. 

965
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,240
I'm not going to be a banker. 

966
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,440
My mum's so proud. That's the biggest prize I've got out of this, 

967
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,840
is my mum being happy with me, and... 

968
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,880
I just feel like I've finally done something that I've wanted to do 

969
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,120
to please her, do you know what I mean? 

970
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,720
So it means the absolute world to me. 

971
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,320
Oh, God! 

972
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:50,120
When it was announced, I thought, yes, there's a passion about John 

973
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,840
and there's no doubt he will... we'll be hearing more of him. 

974
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,080
And I just wanted to... The first thing I did was 

975
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,480
to stop at a shop and buy two big packets of crisps, 

976
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,080
because I was sick of the sugar and the buttercreams 

977
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,720
and I wanted something salty, and I ate the two of them, 

978
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,800
which was absolute heaven, really. 

979
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,480
When John appeared on the Bake Off, 

980
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,880
he was studying for the finals of a law degree. 

981
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,880
Despite gaining a first, he has left his books behind 

982
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,520
to fulfil his dream of studying French patisserie. 

983
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,920
Winning the Bake Off was the best thing, 

984
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,520
not only because it was winning in itself, 

985
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,960
but because it led to the Cordon Bleu, which is amazing. 

986
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,240
Being here makes the Great British Bake Off feel like 

987
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,400
a walk in the park. 

988
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,440
OK, so in this technical, we're going to look at chocolate techniques. 

989
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,680
It's not easy, 

990
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,000
but it doesn't have the sort of sweetness that the Bake Off had. 

991
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,640
I've not got Cathryn there with me. 

992
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,560
If Cathryn was here, it'd be a lot easier. 

993
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,960
Will that do? Is it level in your...? 

994
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,760
No, actually, that's dropping. Will you level that out a bit? 

995
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,240
All right. Bossy. 

996
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,680
I've learnt so much already, 

997
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,280
and I've only been here for a few months so far. 

998
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,000
My swan's got a bit of a limp neck. 

999
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,400
It's a very classical French institution, so you have to learn 

1000
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,720
the classic and hard way, but the things you learn, 

1001
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,520
you can really easily translate them into modern cuisine, which is great. 

1002
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,280
He has also presented live baking demonstrations 

1003
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,600
alongside Mary Berry herself... 

1004
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,760
..as well as working on his own baking recipe book. 

1005
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,880
To see my recipes being created, to such a high standard as well, 

1006
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,360
it's just overwhelming, it really is. 

1007
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:47,000
- Comme ca?
- Comme ca.
- Bon. 
- C'est absolument parfait. 

1008
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,880
It's like the fondant fancies all over again on Bake Off. 

1009
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,680
Almost finished me off, that. 

1010
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,240
I'd like to think Mary and Paul would be happy for me, 

1011
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,080
being here today, doing this photo shoot, 

1012
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,440
because that's the one thing you want out of baking, 

1013
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,720
to make people proud of you 

1014
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,200
through what you create, and also make people happy. 

1015
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,080
I'm still in touch with Paul, and he's been a great mentor, 

1016
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,120
he's been absolutely fantastic, and a really good guy. 

1017
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,640
So I've made a good friend in Paul Hollywood, 

1018
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,440
which I never thought I would. I was always scared of him, 

1019
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,680
but he's actually a lovely, lovely guy. 

1020
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,360
The blueberries look shiny, don't they? 

1021
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,440
The year since we were in Bake Off has been 

1022
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,600
the best year of my life so far, and I just hope it's not the best - 

1023
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,560
I hope it gets even better, touch wood. 

1024
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,640
But today, alongside Cathryn, James and Sarah-Jane, 

1025
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,800
John has returned to the Bake Off tent. 

1026
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,440
It's the most amazing thing, coming back. 

1027
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,680
When I was driving up the road, 

1028
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,000
honestly, truly, I had the same butterflies in my stomach 

1029
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,680
and the same sick feeling, and I just had to remind myself, 

1030
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,840
"No, you're not actually going to bake anything, 

1031
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,520
"you're just going for a nice chat." 

1032
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,400
It feels like I'm back in Bake Off land. 

1033
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,680
- Oh, my goodness!
- It looks bigger. 

1034
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,000
It looks so much bigger, look at all the space! 

1035
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
- There aren't as many benches, look. 
- That's true. 

1036
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,440
It's still pastels, we're all right. James, fraisier. 

1037
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,520
- That was your one.
- Look! Those pies! 

1038
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,920
I'd give anything to come back here and start again, would you? 

1039
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,240
- Me too.
- I'm not sure I could take it. 

1040
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,600
It's amazing, being back, to be honest, it's really, really nice. 

1041
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,360
It's exactly the same time of year as when we were doing it, 

1042
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,480
so it seems very familiar. 

1043
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,960
Look at all this stuff! 

1044
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,480
Ooh, blowtorch, what have they been doing with that? 

1045
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,400
- It's exactly the same. 
- My baking beans! 

1046
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,200
- Shall we put the timer on? - Yes! 

1047
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,760
- Oh, my God, there's a recipe, I found a recipe!
- Shut up.
- Divulge. 

1048
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,920
Puff pastry selection. 

1049
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,560
Filming the Bake Off was a massive part of our life, 

1050
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,120
and it's like trying to rekindle a relationship that was fantastic 

1051
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,720
but can't exist any more. It's really sad to be back here. 

1052
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,000
It's a massive mix of emotions. 

1053
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,680
It was amazing, baking in there. I did cry a lot. 

1054
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:10,600
It was, you know... I can only remember the happy things about it. 

1055
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,720
For those who enter the tent, the experience is unique 

1056
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,440
and has a lasting impression. 

1057
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,440
There's something very special about baking in the Bake Off marquee. 

1058
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,880
That is, you know, every baker's dream, almost, isn't it, 

1059
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,520
to bake in the Bake Off marquee? 

1060
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,920
And I'm really lucky I got to do it, and I loved it. 

1061
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,920
I don't think anybody can go through the Bake Off process 

1062
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,880
and not describe it as life-changing. 

1063
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,080
Even me, who went first. 

1064
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,200
Psyching myself up. 

1065
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,640
The Bake Off is actually an experience beyond baking. 

1066
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,480
You discover more about yourself, your flaws and your strengths, 

1067
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,960
previously you weren't aware of. 

1068
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,440
Fingers crossed, everybody. 

1069
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,760
Being part of the Bake Off was probably the one biggest experience 

1070
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,080
of my life, you know? I'm really happy that I chose to do it 

1071
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,000
and picked up the courage. 

1072
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,480
Just go for it, what's the worst that can happen? 

1073
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,800
I think everything I've done so far in my life, 

1074
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,960
this has got to be one of the most unforgettable experiences. 

1075
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,600
It's a fantastic opportunity, I'll never, ever get to do that again. 

1076
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,520
Good luck to anyone who steps in that tent from now. 

1077
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,920
The Bake Off has kind of changed everything, 

1078
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,040
I'm so lucky to have been part of it. 

1079
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:28,160
It's the most... Other than having my children, by far the best thing 

1080
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,640
that's ever happened, I love it so much. 

1081
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:36,160
I wake up to the Bake Off theme tune, it's my alarm clock in the morning. 

1082
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,040
So, every day, I wake up... 

1083
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,480
# Da-da-da-da... # 

1084
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,200
..and I'm ready to go for the day. 

1085
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,120
It was just the most wonderful, surreal experience. 

1086
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:51,360
It's an amazing setting, an amazing place, with amazing people, 

1087
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,040
just an amazing experience. 

1088
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,760
Definitely do it again, but I don't think they'd have me back. 

1089
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,480
Where am I? Right... 

1090
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,760
Yes, I'd be very happy to do it again, 

1091
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,640
and this time, even better, as a consequence. 

1092
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,640
The Bake Off has been the best thing I've ever done, 

1093
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,040
and if you said to me now, 

1094
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,920
"Get back in that tent and start again," I'd do it. 

1095
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,760
Bake Off, it's made me more confident in my baking, 

1096
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,040
I can talk more about food and stuff, and it's made me 

1097
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,400
more obsessed with food. I didn't think it was possible, but it is. 

1098
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,240
But as a person, I go home every night 

1099
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,960
and I cook my partner's tea for him, 

1100
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,360
and it won't change who I am, I don't think. 

1101
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,040
I've not started walking down red carpets 

1102
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,120
and demanding candles and Chihuahuas just yet. 

1103
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,760
