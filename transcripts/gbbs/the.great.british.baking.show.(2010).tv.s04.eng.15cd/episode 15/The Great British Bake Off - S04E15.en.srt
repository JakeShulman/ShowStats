1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,520
After weeks spent conquering cakes, tackling tuile 

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,840
and duelling over doughs... 

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,080
Come on! 

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,880
..the heat was turned up as the remaining bakers 

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,760
fought for a place in the finals. 

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,080
Last one. 

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,360
Each week they faced three challenges demanding 

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,840
high-level skill, intricacy and baking intuition. 

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,120
Looks all right. 

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,400
Some surpassed their own expectations... 

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,800
I don't know what I was thinking. 

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,960
They're delicious. 

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,240
THEY CHEER 

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,440
Yay! 

15
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,120
While others collapsed under the pressure... 

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,720
and left the tent for good. 

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,240
It just gets to you. 

18
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,640
Having taught us how to temper chocolate, master muffins 

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,800
and impress with perfect pies and puddings, legendry judging duo 

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,920
Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood 

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,640
are taking over the tent for the final time, 

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,400
with five of their favourite challenges from the last few weeks 

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,480
of The Great British Bake Off. 

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,560
From pastry to French week, and even some ideas from the final programme. 

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,880
Coming in here, baking with nobody around me bar Mary Berry - 

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,120
it's a dream to me and I find it the easiest job in the world. 

27
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,440
Coming up... 

28
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,960
Mary's take on the classic Sussex pond pudding, 

29
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,640
given a new lease of life with the addition of apples. 

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,240
A French delicacy - religieuses. 

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,400
Crisp choux pastry filled with sumptuous creme patissiere and 

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,120
glazed with a rich chocolate ganache. 

33
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,920
Paul's signature wheat-free loaf. 

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,280
A deliciously dark rye bread with a secret ingredient. 

35
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,920
And perfect pretzels, step by step. 

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,640
Paul shows us how to make a savoury and a sweet version of these 

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,960
doughy delights. 

38
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,400
For the grand finale, Mary shares with us 

39
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,800
her own take on a classic opera cake. 

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,960
And if you've ever wondered how to spin the perfect pizza base 

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,200
or tell if your eggs are fresh, then Paul and Mary will be 

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,240
letting you in on some secrets along the way. 

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,320
As the final came ever closer, 

44
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,720
the difficulty of the bakes stepped up a gear. 

45
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,000
And week seven's Signature Challenge asked for a new take 

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,280
on an old favourite. 

47
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,680
Paul and Mary are asking for a heart-warming classic. 

48
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,240
It's a suet pudding, please. It could be sweet or savoury. 

49
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,480
Should be family-sized, should be delicious. 

50
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,080
Now, your pud can be steamed, boiled, baked 

51
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,760
but you've got three hours to make it. So on your marks... 

52
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,320
- Get set...
- BOTH: Bake! 

53
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,880
It's not terribly difficult making a pudding like this. 

54
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,720
It must be well cooked. 

55
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,440
Because a slightly raw, heavy suet pudding is no joy. 

56
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,320
I'm making a big roly-poly pudding. 

57
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,960
Agen prunes and Armagnac. 

58
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,240
I mean, it's a spotted dick by any other name, 

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,280
but there aren't any currants in it. 

60
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,240
I replaced those with... 

61
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,680
Persian berries. 

62
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,720
If the bake doesn't go well, I'll just drown my sorrows. 

63
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,320
For Mary's suet pudding, she's making a traditional 

64
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,280
Sussex pond pudding, 

65
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,200
packing it full of apples for extra flavour. 

66
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,520
Sussex pond pudding, a classic. 

67
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,320
Traditionally, put a lemon in the middle. 

68
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,120
A lemon? A whole lemon in the middle? 

69
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,240
A whole lemon, and then add butter and muscovado sugar. 

70
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,040
It's terribly calorific. 

71
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,400
I've cut down on the butter and the sugar and I've put lots of apple 

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,880
in it, because there's nothing nicer than an apple suet crust. 

73
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,800
So the first thing I'm going to do is make the suet crust pastry. 

74
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,160
Start by weighing 225g of self-raising flour into a bowl. 

75
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,280
Then add 100g of suet. 

76
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,640
- So if I can have those...
- Yes. 

77
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,720
Then I add... The liquid for this is milk and water. 

78
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,360
Add 75ml of water to 75ml of milk. 

79
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,840
That's it. 

80
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,800
Pour into the flour and suet. 

81
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,240
So you used to eat this when you were a little girl. 

82
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,040
We had all sorts of different puddings. 

83
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,960
Because, of course, it was economical. 

84
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,160
When my mother made suet crust puddings, you went to the 

85
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,800
butchers and you took the fat off from around the beef kidney. 

86
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,120
Mum would come home and grate it and use it in steamed puddings - 

87
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,240
- roly-polies and things like that. 
- Yes. 

88
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,000
So just mix that until it holds together. 

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,520
And you want to use a blunt knife. 

90
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,600
And you notice how I'm doing a cutting action. 

91
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,360
There certainly is no reason to get out a machine for that. 

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,480
Now I'll see if it will come together with my hands. 

93
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,160
- Can I have a feel?
- Yes. 

94
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,880
Oh, yes it's nice. Nice dough. 

95
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,000
That's right. It's coming together. 

96
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,400
Do you still like baking, Mary? 

97
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,080
I love it. I absolutely love it. 

98
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,000
You know, at the end of the day, when you've had a really tiring day, 

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
there's nothing I like more than coming home, baking, cooking. 

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,160
I enjoy it. Now just go on until you've cleaned the bowl. 

101
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,800
When the dough has come together, lightly dust the work surface 

102
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,000
and roll out to a circle roughly 30cm in width. 

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,360
And if you start off with a round-shape ball 

104
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,040
it's quite easy to keep it into a circle. 

105
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,360
I'm going to get the ruler out in a minute. 

106
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,400
- Not bad.
- That's 30. 

107
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Now, I've got a very well-buttered bowl here. 

108
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,840
When you've got bowls in the cupboard you never remember 

109
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,080
how big they are. So what I do is get the bowl and I write on the bottom. 

110
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,600
This is a 1.5 litre, two and three-quarter pint. 

111
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,800
Do it with a marker pen, you know where you are. 

112
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,400
That's a good idea. 

113
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Cut one quarter out of the circle and set aside for the lid. 

114
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,480
Lift the rest into the bowl to line it. 

115
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,200
It doesn't matter if you handle it too much. 

116
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,120
You just follow the recipe. I'm going to push that down. 

117
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,080
You've done this before, haven't you, Mary? 

118
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,280
I have. And really work that join so nothing could leak. 

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,760
Now we come to the lid. 

120
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,040
Doesn't need to be too thick, it's not going to leak out. 

121
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,760
Put it to one side. So I've got the basin done, the lid done. 

122
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,360
Now to the filling. 

123
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,680
If you can just cut the end off the lemon and prick it all over 

124
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,240
with a cocktail stick, and that lets some of the juices flow. 

125
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,400
Peel, core and dice three Cox's apples. 

126
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,840
If you use Bramley's, which is the normal apple for cooking, 

127
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,640
they just disintegrate. 

128
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,960
Add 175g of light muscovado sugar and 150g of cubed butter. 

129
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,480
And you can imagine what happens. 

130
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,560
It all melts and becomes a wonderful sauce. 

131
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,800
Start with a layer of the apple, sit the lemon on top, 

132
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,480
then pack in the rest of the filling. 

133
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,840
What happens to it is it shrinks down, 

134
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:43,360
so I'm packing it absolutely in and it'll actually dome up over the top. 

135
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,600
Dampen the edges of the pastry with some water, place the lid on top 

136
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,120
and press down to seal completely. 

137
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,280
And it doesn't need any fancy edging. 

138
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,840
You don't need to pleat it or do anything. 

139
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,320
I was going to offer. 

140
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,080
No, no, no. Because you don't see it. So there it is. 

141
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,280
I'm going to put a lid on it and I've got some non-stick paper... 

142
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,120
and some foil. 

143
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,880
Cut a square of foil and a square of non-stick baking parchment. 

144
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,880
Make a pleat in both to allow the pudding to expand as it cooks. 

145
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,760
Then tuck the edges under the rim of basin. 

146
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,320
Of course, I remember when there wasn't foil. 

147
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,400
I remember when it was introduced, I suppose it was about 1966. 

148
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,840
We were terribly excited. I was on a magazine 

149
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,800
and the first roll came from America. So useful. 

150
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,360
What were you using, rock and flint? 

151
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,880
I'm not going to answer that. Right, that's it. 

152
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,640
Take a long strip of foil, fold in half lengthways 

153
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,120
and then in half again to strengthen it. 

154
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,800
Then you take a lid, 

155
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,960
because if the bottom here 

156
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,720
touches the bottom, 

157
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,040
it cooks too quickly. 

158
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,160
So if you put it like that, then sit that on top... 

159
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,640
- Nice idea.
- And then you put that over the top, like that. 

160
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,880
So lift that carefully into the pan. 

161
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,680
And the water should come halfway up. 

162
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,440
Fold it over the top. Lid on. 

163
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,680
And let that simmer, 

164
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,800
look after itself for about three and a half hours. 

165
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,560
Shall we have a cup of tea, then? 

166
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,720
Check on your pudding occasionally and top up the water if necessary. 

167
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,080
In the tent, the bakers were cooking their suet puddings 

168
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,040
in a variety of ways. Some with better results than others. 

169
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,520
Some of it's stuck, which isn't ideal. 

170
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,440
It looks like how it's supposed to look. 

171
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,600
I don't know what it's like inside, obviously, 

172
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,320
but hopefully it's all right. 

173
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,800
To give an extra bit of texture, 

174
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,480
I'm going to sift some sugar on the top, which will crisp up. 

175
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,520
Also, hopefully, hiding the bit where the mixture clearly stuck. 

176
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,160
I don't know. 

177
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,480
Oh, my God, that smells amazing! 

178
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,320
I think what we might do... Blowtorch. 

179
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,960
That's perfecto. That's quite nice, isn't it? 

180
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,360
- No, don't burn that bit. 
- HE GROANS 

181
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,280
I might have to slice that bit off. 

182
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,200
The Sussex pond pudding should be ready by now. 

183
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,040
It's had about three and a half hours. Take the foil off. 

184
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,440
Wow! 

185
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,560
And you see what a lovely colour it is. 

186
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,760
Let that rest a few moments, just while it's shrinking back. 

187
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,720
Hold it in a tea towel and just see that it's loosened at the sides. 

188
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,480
- Which it is. 
- You can see that, can't you? Yes. 

189
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,600
If it doesn't come out in one piece, it's not the end of the world. 

190
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,040
- Nobody's going to notice.
- I will. 

191
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,560
It often actually bursts because of all that sugar and butter inside. 

192
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,360
It's best to turn the pudding out onto a plate with high sides, 

193
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,720
to catch any juices that may escape. 

194
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,120
Come on. 

195
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,160
Ah... Look at that. That looks amazing! 

196
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,960
I think we ought to get in there while it's wonderfully hot. 

197
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,880
I think we should as well, Mary. 

198
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,240
As I cut through here, I'm going through the lemon. 

199
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,560
You can smell it. 

200
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,840
- We'll share a plate.
- No. 
- Well, we've only got one plate 

201
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,560
so you're going to have to share a plate. 

202
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,600
That's it. You do the cream. Not all over for me. 

203
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,000
- Shall I just keep it on the side, then?
- Yes. 

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,440
There? 

205
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,600
I think you should taste it first. 

206
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,880
- This was a Signature Bake, wasn't it?
- It was. 

207
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,440
OK, so could you tell us about your Signature Bake, please? 

208
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,280
My Signature Bake is Sussex pond pudding but my version, 

209
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,320
and I hope that you're going to like it... Come on, have a... 

210
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,280
I mean, the overall look of it I like. 

211
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,440
I think it's creative, you've used some great flavours 

212
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,720
but I think ultimately it comes down to the flavour, Mary. 

213
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,040
Don't be beastly. 

214
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,080
- Bit of all right. 
- I'll have some more of that, yeah. 

215
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,480
Lovely, that, Mary. 

216
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,800
- I'm through to the next round. 
- You are.
- Thank you. 

217
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,840
Now, if you've always wanted to shape pizza like a pro, 

218
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,160
here's Paul with some tips. 

219
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,280
Now, I'm going to show you how to roll out a pizza properly. 

220
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,920
Very simple, really. 

221
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,040
Here's my beautiful piece of pizza dough. 

222
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,320
I've also got to add some semolina-and-flour mix. 

223
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,480
And the reason why I add semolina to the flour is because it adds that 

224
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,600
little bit of graininess to it, it keeps the pizza base really crisp. 

225
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,200
Pizza should be in the oven for a maximum of seven minutes. 

226
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,280
Any more than that dries it out 

227
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,240
and it loses what I think is a proper pizza base. 

228
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
Now. Lift up your dough. 

229
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,240
Place it in the flour-semolina mix. 

230
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,720
Roll it round. 

231
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Big, heavy rolling pin. 

232
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,920
From the middle up, middle down. 

233
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,200
Turn it. 

234
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,920
Try and keep it as circular as you possibly can. 

235
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,480
Now, that is enough. This is the fun bit. 

236
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,440
That, at the moment, 

237
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,720
is one equal level throughout. 

238
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,200
Now, what I'm going to do is pick it up, 

239
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,000
stretch it slightly with my fingers and then throw it up in the sky. 

240
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You need to do it at least three times, 

241
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,920
and it sends all the dough that's in the middle to the outside. 

242
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,480
It's centrifugal force. That's all I'm doing with this. 

243
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,640
Throw it up, throw it up, catch it on the back of your hand. 

244
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,240
If you catch it with your fingers it will go straight through. 

245
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,320
Throw it up. Put that back down. 

246
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,240
You can see the air and how light that is underneath. 

247
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,080
It's all gone thick around the outside 

248
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,320
and it's thin in the middle, ready for your topping. 

249
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,520
With their signature suet pudding safely under their belts, 

250
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,360
the bakers faced a terrifying technical. 

251
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,240
And, as usual, they had no idea what to expect. 

252
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,040
Paul and Mary would like you, please, to make eight religieuses, 

253
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,720
which means "nun" in French. Made from choux pastry. 

254
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,240
They should be filled with creme patissiere, 

255
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,600
smothered in chocolate ganache and piped with whipped cream. 

256
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,600
I've never eaten a nun before. On your marks... 

257
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,080
Get set... 

258
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,400
(SINGING) Baaaaake! 

259
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,360
I've eaten plenty of these, I've never made one. 

260
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,840
I don't even know quite how to pronounce it. 

261
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,720
I know what it's meant to look like. So that's a start. 

262
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,360
Even though I've made choux pastry quite often, I feel physically sick. 

263
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,320
Mary's recipe for religieuses will help you master choux pastry 

264
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,200
and bring a certain je ne sais quoi to your baking. 

265
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,760
A real classic from France. You'll find them in every patisserie. 

266
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,240
When was the first time you had one of these? 

267
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,760
I had one of these when I went to the Cordon Bleu to do a course, 

268
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,200
- in my youth...
- Don't rub it in. 

269
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,600
You know, when you were in short trousers. 

270
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,720
Anyway, it isn't difficult, it's fun to do. 

271
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,760
You need to make a template. 

272
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,000
So you take some non-stick parchment and then find something 

273
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,680
about 5cm and run the pencil around the outside. 

274
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,120
Draw eight circles onto a sheet of baking paper. 

275
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,960
Then, using something smaller as a guide, 

276
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,800
draw another eight roughly half the size. 

277
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,600
Once you've done them a few times, you don't need a template, 

278
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,720
but it's best to start off with one. 

279
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,480
To make the choux pastry, 

280
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,800
put 150ml of water in a heavy saucepan. 

281
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,880
Add 60g of cubed butter and melt over a medium heat. 

282
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,640
If you put it in a solid block, it will just take longer. 

283
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,040
Once the butter has melted, take the pan off the heat 

284
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,280
and add 75g of plain flour all in one go. 

285
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,160
And to begin with, it looks awful and all lumpy, but that's where 

286
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:55,600
you have to give it a really, really good beat and it will come smooth. 

287
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,520
It clings together like a shiny ball. Look, that is quite smooth. 

288
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,440
- Yes.
- So back on the heat. 

289
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,920
Continue to beat over a low heat for three to five minutes. 

290
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,640
Stirring constantly to cook the flour. 

291
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,600
Remove the pan from the heat, 

292
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,160
leave to cool slightly before gradually adding in two beaten eggs. 

293
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,560
Just take a little of that to start with. 

294
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,720
If you added it on the heat, you'd find that you'd overcook the egg. 

295
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,200
- Scrambled egg.
- Scrambled egg, and we don't want that. 

296
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,080
Beat well between each addition to form a smooth and shiny paste. 

297
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,760
Without any detailed instructions to follow, the bakers had to 

298
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,160
rely on their experience to get it right. 

299
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,200
There's a stage once you've added the flour in 

300
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,600
and then you really need to dry the mixture off a bit. 

301
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,120
And I've just shoved the eggs in. 

302
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,880
I think I'll just have to use my intuition a little bit. 

303
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,800
Get to the stage where I recognise it as choux pastry. 

304
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,520
Would have expected it to be a bit thicker. 

305
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,720
Well, if I beat that over a high heat, I'm going to end up with 

306
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,120
a scrambled, floury mess, so scratch that. Let's start again. 

307
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,480
There we have the completed choux pastry. 

308
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,200
That is very stiff and firm. 

309
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,480
Going to cool that a little. Enough to handle. 

310
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,960
Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with 

311
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,360
a 1.5cm plain nozzle. 

312
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,880
Right, so we've got the template here, which slops about. 

313
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,840
So a tip is - just put a little bit in the corner 

314
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,080
and that will make the paper stick. 

315
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,520
Pipe round disks, using your templates as a guide. 

316
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,200
Pressing down to the edge of the circle and then up. 

317
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,280
Now, if I put them in the oven like that, they would rise up in peaks. 

318
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,160
So just take some water and dab it on top. 

319
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,240
This has got to be a little bit flat so that, 

320
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,720
when you put the top on, it sits well into it. 

321
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,720
That's it. So they go in the oven at 200 fan. 

322
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,160
And later on we'll be turning them down to dry them out. 

323
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,080
After ten minutes, reduce the temperature to 170 

324
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,960
and bake for a further 10 to 15 minutes. 

325
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,800
Make sure you keep a close eye on them. 

326
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,480
They can easily burn, as some of our bakers found out. 

327
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,320
Once it's in the oven, it does tend to do its own thing. 

328
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,440
Come on, babies, rise. 

329
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,720
Well, the little ones are puffing up well. 

330
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,600
Yeah, they've puffed up nicely. Happy with that. 

331
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,200
SUE: How are your hot nuns? 

332
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,840
Quite flat. Rubbish. They haven't risen up like a choux bun should. 

333
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,280
When the buns are golden brown and firm, remove from the oven 

334
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,800
and pierce each with a skewer to allow the steam to escape. 

335
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
And if you don't do that, 

336
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,360
you'll have a soggy middle - not a soggy bottom - a soggy middle. 

337
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,960
We've done soggy top, soggy bottom - now we've done soggy middle. 

338
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,560
They feel nice and dry on top but I know they'll be wet in the middle. 

339
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,760
Once all the choux buns are pierced, 

340
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,400
return them to the oven for four or five minutes. 

341
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,880
This extra time will allow them to thoroughly dry out. 

342
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,240
Now it's creme patissiere time. 

343
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,800
- I'm going to need 500ml of milk here. 
- Full-fat milk? 

344
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,320
Full-fat ideally, but it's not the end of the world. 

345
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,200
Whatever you've got in the fridge. 

346
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Add the seeds from one vanilla pod and slowly bring to the boil. 

347
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,880
Now, if you haven't got a vanilla pod, you could use vanilla extract, 

348
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,920
about a teaspoonful, or you could use a vanilla paste. 

349
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,880
Beat six egg yolks with 75g of caster sugar until pale and foamy. 

350
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,680
If you use granulated sugar, it would take longer to dissolve. 

351
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,400
But it would do the same thing. 

352
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,680
Then add 25g of plain flour and 20g of cornflour. 

353
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,360
It does need to be whisked in until it's smooth. 

354
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,360
Allow the milk to cool slightly and then pour into the egg mix. 

355
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,560
When combined, return to the heat. 

356
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,720
So back, watching it all the time because it could catch. 

357
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,800
The aim is to get that beautifully thickened 

358
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,440
because we've got to pipe it into the buns. 

359
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,320
When the creme patissiere is thick, pour it into a bowl to cool. 

360
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,600
And by now I think the choux buns should be really dried out. 

361
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,560
Oh, yes, look at those guys. 

362
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,240
They do look good. And also, when you pick them up now, 

363
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,520
which you can do, they should be crisp. 

364
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,200
- Can you hear? 
- I can feel how crisp they are. 

365
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,720
So I'm going to let the buns get cold, the creme patissiere get cold, 

366
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,560
and I ought to make the chocolate ganache to give a lovely finish. 

367
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,120
Bring to the boil 150ml of double cream, 

368
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,720
then break 200g of plain chocolate into squares. 

369
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,880
Now, the chocolate I've chosen to use is about 36 to 40 cocoa solids. 

370
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,240
- If you use a 70, it will separate. 
- Yes. 

371
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,080
And this is fine. Plain chocolate. 

372
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,720
That's come to be very, very hot. I'm going to move that off the heat 

373
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,160
and drop in all the chocolate. 

374
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,800
Stir the chocolate until melted and shiny. 

375
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,920
Now, it looks as though it's never going to dissolve, but it does. 

376
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,200
And no extra heat needed. 

377
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,000
Overheat it and you'll lose that shine. I'm going to put 

378
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,920
that into a small bowl like that, and then I will dip the buns in it. 

379
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,720
With all the elements made, you'd think the hardest part was over, 

380
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,520
but our bakers' troubles had only just begun. 

381
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,720
My days! 

382
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,560
- HE CHUCKLES 
- Messy, messy. 

383
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,960
Stay up! 

384
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,360
SHE SIGHS 

385
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,040
Oh! 

386
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,000
Just stop falling over. 

387
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,760
We're all organised. 

388
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,880
We've got our choux buns, creme patissiere, 

389
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,880
ganache and cream to do the little crown around the top. 

390
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,760
Make a hole in each of the buns, 

391
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,000
large enough to pipe in the creme patissiere. 

392
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,880
Just go through all of those. 

393
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,880
And these can be made ahead, but don't fill them 

394
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,440
with the creme patissiere because they'll go soft. 

395
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,000
To assemble the religieuses, 

396
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
pipe the cooled creme patissiere into the choux buns. 

397
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,680
In, and then squeeze until it comes out of the base. 

398
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,440
Can I have a go, Mary? 

399
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,120
Come on, you'll do it ten times quicker than me. 

400
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,440
Once they're all filled, 

401
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,760
it's time to coat the buns in the chocolate ganache. 

402
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,840
Right, so take each one and dip it in. 

403
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,200
Only halfway round. 

404
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,000
Like that. And then shake it about. 

405
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,120
Swirl it and then put it back on the tray. 

406
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,800
Repeat this until all of the choux buns are coated. 

407
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,520
Press it down and leave it. 

408
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,560
And you've got to really judge this. 

409
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,560
If that is still a bit runny, it will slip off to one side. 

410
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,600
So move it around until it sticks. 

411
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,560
For the finishing touch to your religieuses, 

412
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,600
pipe a ring of whipped cream stars around the buns. 

413
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,520
I think they look great, you know. 

414
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,800
I think they look quite professional. 

415
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,240
Right, let's have a try of this. 

416
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,360
I'm just going to see how you tackle it first. 

417
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,800
It's going to get messy any way you do it, you know. 

418
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,160
It is indulgent, isn't it? 

419
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,680
You've got that beautiful creme patissiere inside, 

420
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,120
that little bit of cream on the outside. 

421
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,200
The chocolate ganache is delicious. 

422
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,160
Well done, top of the class. Again. 

423
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,040
How many points? 

424
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,920
Out of ten? I never give ten... 

425
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,960
- 11. 
- MARY LAUGHS 

426
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,600
Week eight, and the bakers have proved their prowess with doughs, 

427
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,560
cakes, biscuits and pies 

428
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,440
but with the quarterfinal came new challenges. 

429
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,120
Working with unconventional ingredients. 

430
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,040
We'd like you to make a loaf. Not just any loaf. 

431
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,680
We'd like you to make a loaf using unusual flours, 

432
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,200
such as chestnut or rice. 

433
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,520
You can use any flavours you want, of course - they are up to you. 

434
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,400
You've got three hours on your Signature Bake, so on your marks... 

435
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,640
- Get set...
- Bake. 

436
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm making a spelt, potato and rosemary focaccia. 

437
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,160
I'm making a spelt loaf and it's mango and nigella seeds. 

438
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,960
I'm using a completely gluten-free flour. 

439
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,560
It's a mixture of tapioca, rice and potato. 

440
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
It's like mango chutney in a bread. 

441
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,840
It is a new experience for me, yes. 

442
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,440
Paul's rye loaf has a dark, earthy crumb, 

443
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,440
a crisp crust and a rich, malty taste. 

444
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,080
What I'm going to do now is show you how to make a wheat-free loaf. 

445
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,960
I'm actually going to use rye, and a lot of people think it's a wheat. 

446
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,080
It's not - it's actually a grass. It's a wild grass. 

447
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,520
So we're going to use rye flour and produce a 100% rye bread. 

448
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,760
So coeliacs will like this one? 

449
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,520
No. Coeliacs can't, because they can't eat gluten. 

450
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,040
I'm glad you're explaining it to me, because I don't know. 

451
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,360
Go on, start from scratch. 

452
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,080
What it's good for is for people who have a slight intolerance 

453
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,560
to gluten. Because it's less in gluten. 

454
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,760
Or if you have a total wheat allergy, again, 

455
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,960
- this is the bread to go for.
- Indeed. 

456
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,480
And do you know what, can I tell you a little secret? 

457
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,080
- I've got a little bit of hay fever and...
- Poor darling. 

458
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,760
And because the rye is a grass, with the dust spores 

459
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,120
I might sneeze a bit. So be careful when you weigh it up. 

460
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,440
Can I have 500g of rye flour, please? 

461
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,560
You go at that end of the bench. It is very fine, isn't it? 

462
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,880
It is, like talcum powder. 

463
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,720
Add to that 10g of salt and 10g of yeast. 

464
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,600
And I know to put the yeast exactly the other side. 

465
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,880
I'm sure it's the same with rye flour. 

466
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,200
It is, and because it's a rye flour, you expect it to be quite dark. 

467
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,600
Now, I'm going to make it even darker, by adding black treacle. 

468
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,880
Could you get one tablespoon of the black treacle? 

469
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,800
And again, this is going to give it the sweetness too, 

470
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,440
and give it a little bit of malt flavour to it. 

471
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,520
It's fantastic. Beautiful. Thank you very much indeed. 

472
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,880
Now, I also need my water, please. 

473
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,480
Take 350ml of cool water, 

474
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,400
putting three-quarters straight into the bowl. 

475
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,640
I'm actually not using my hands for this. 

476
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,640
It's quite a stiff dough and quite a difficult one to work with, 

477
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,680
so using a mixer's perfect. Pop it down. 

478
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,040
I'm just going pop it onto one, 

479
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,760
while I just stand over here a second. 

480
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,840
- I'll keep an eye on it.
- Mary, you just watch it for me. Thank you. 

481
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,280
As the dough starts to come together, 

482
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,680
gradually add the remaining water. 

483
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,840
Lovely. Thank you very much. Now we just leave the mixer to work. 

484
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,760
You don't want to put it on high speed. 

485
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,520
There's a couple of reasons, really. 

486
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,080
It's quite a dry dough, so what you've got to do is have a slow mix, 

487
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,000
If you go too fast, it can actually damage the machine. 

488
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,480
So what you're trying to do at this stage is mix it 

489
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,760
until the dough becomes nice and smooth. 

490
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,720
Is it going to be quite a close textured bread? 

491
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,520
It's the nature of the beast with rye. Yes, it's 100% rye. 

492
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,520
If you want to change it and put 20% wheat flour in, 

493
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,320
then put 20% wheat flour in, 

494
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,960
and that will lighten it up but still give you the flavour of rye. 

495
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,320
So I can change places with you now. Everything's absorbed 

496
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,040
OK, it's brought together the dough. It would struggle with a dough 

497
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,200
like this, so I'm just going to give it a little knead by hand. 

498
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,160
Could you pass me some olive oil, please? 

499
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,040
Coat the surface with the oil to stop the dough sticking. 

500
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,800
Back on the Bake Off, the final few were adjusting to 

501
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,640
using their alternative flours. 

502
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,080
For me, this is more difficult than normal flour. 

503
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,720
But I think part of that is just because it's so new. 

504
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,120
This has a balloon whisk and whisks for at least three to four minutes. 

505
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,840
Because it's the only way I'm going to get the air in it, 

506
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,480
apart from the yeast. 

507
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,600
Just need to build up the gluten a little bit, 

508
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,920
so that's why I'm working it a little bit more than I normally would. 

509
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,800
As you can see, you couldn't possibly knead that. 

510
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,200
You could, but you'd get into an awful mess. 

511
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,560
With Paul's rye bread, most of the work has been done in the mixer 

512
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,960
so it just needs shaping. 

513
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,120
All I'm doing here is tucking under the dough with my hands 

514
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,920
and spinning it in the oil. 

515
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,760
This is actually a very simple loaf to do, isn't it? 

516
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,240
It's a bit like a soda bread. 

517
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,840
It's just literally just bringing the stuff together. 

518
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,520
Now, what I'm going to do is put this dough into a banneton. 

519
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,280
It shapes the dough as it rises. 

520
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,120
So what I'm going to do is, to stop the dough from sticking too 

521
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,760
much to the material, I'm going to get some rye flour 

522
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,720
and just sprinkle it inside, all over. 

523
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,720
Put the dough into the floured banneton, 

524
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,280
placing the smooth top upside down. 

525
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,640
So when that's turned out, the underneath will be on top. 

526
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,080
- Yes.
- Ah, right. 
- That's why the rough bit is there, 

527
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,000
- where I tucked everything underneath.
- Yes. 

528
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,480
Smoothed it on the top, and then I'll tip this upside down. 

529
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,400
The material will come with it, the material pulls away and reveals 

530
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,720
the loaf. If you put it into a tin or a bowl, it will stick. 

531
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,480
This is known as a rye basket, because most rye breads 

532
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,040
are risen in baskets, because it controls the shape. 

533
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,280
But if people are watching at home and they haven't got this basket, 

534
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,520
could you just put it on a baking sheet? 

535
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,080
To be honest, what they can do is use a fruit bowl. 

536
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,240
You know the wicker baskets? Then cover it muslin, 

537
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,720
coat it in flour, and you'll have exactly the same thing. 

538
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,240
- Even a clean tea towel? 
- Yes. A tea towel's perfect. 

539
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,520
A linen tea towel. 

540
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,440
Brilliant. Now, that goes into a proving drawer. 

541
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,040
The dough needs to prove, so cover and leave to double in size. 

542
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,680
Right, Mary, let's have a look at this dough. 

543
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,720
It been in here an hour and a half. 

544
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,080
Obviously, an artificial heat, at 35 degrees, which forces this up. 

545
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,240
Over here I've got a baking tray. 

546
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,720
What I'm going to do is flip this dough out onto the tray now... 

547
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,480
and you'll find that the material just pulls away from the dough. 

548
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,080
It's a lovely sort of rustic look to it. 

549
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,600
It is indeed. 

550
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,640
Now, the oven has been preheated to 220 degrees. 

551
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,120
It needs to stay in there for a minimum of 30 minutes. 

552
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,760
What I tend to do, because I like a strong colour, 

553
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,440
I would actually leave it in there for about 40 minutes. 

554
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,640
- So...
- Also, it will give it a very good crust if you leave it in there. 

555
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,360
That's what you want on rye bread. You want the heavy crust. 

556
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,560
So I'm going to slash it with a knife. 

557
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,400
One, two, three, four, and get it straight into the oven. 

558
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,840
If you could open that up for me, Mary, please. 

559
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,680
In it goes, and we'll have a look at it in 30 minutes. 

560
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
For some, the alternative flours 

561
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,640
were turning out some unexpected results. 

562
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,640
Bakers, you've got ten minutes left. Time to stop loafing around. 

563
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,120
No, it's not playing ball. 

564
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,680
Oh, hello, cheeky. That'll do. 

565
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,920
- Let's try and get that in one piece and just...
- Jigsaw. 

566
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,840
Yes, I've looked underneath. 

567
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,560
A broken loaf will not compete with that. 

568
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,480
There it is, Mary. 

569
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,800
Crispy, crunchy, earthy rye bread which also has that little 

570
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,120
addition of black treacle, which gives it a gorgeous crumb inside. 

571
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,000
Well, it does look most inviting. 

572
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,040
Let me cut you off... Do you like the end? I love the end. 

573
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,560
Oh, please, yes. Well, we could share it. 

574
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,520
It is a robust loaf, isn't it? 

575
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,520
Yes. Very heavy. 

576
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,240
Look, see, Mary, how dense it is inside. 

577
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,560
- It is. Absolutely. 
- It tastes lovely, though. 

578
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,080
- Shall I just give you that wedge? 
- Yes. It's still warm. Lovely. 

579
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,480
Yes, it is. What are you going to have with this, Mary? 

580
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,240
I'd like some of that cream cheese, and ham would be nice. 

581
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,440
- Smoked ham goes awfully well with it. 
- Yes. No, I agree. 

582
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,640
Quite a crust on here, and that's just what I like. 

583
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,160
And a dough like this, 

584
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,240
because it's so dense, it will actually keep for about a week. 

585
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,080
- Where would you keep it? 
- Just in a bag.
- Not in the fridge? 

586
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,960
If you put bread in the fridge, it stales three times quicker. 

587
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,360
- Does it?
- Because it dries out the loaf. So always leave it outside. 

588
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,640
Just wrap it up in a bag and it'll be fine. 

589
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,520
I enjoyed that. 

590
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,160
Mm! Bit of all right. 

591
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,760
Ever wondered how to test the freshness of an egg? 

592
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,000
Mary has a handy tip. 

593
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,600
Nowadays, the eggs that you buy are all dated. 

594
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,480
They've also got a lion on, and the lion means that the chicken 

595
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,160
has been inoculated against salmonella. 

596
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,800
But sometimes you're given eggs from a farm or a friend, 

597
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,720
and you're never quite sure how old it is. 

598
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,760
As the eggs get older, the moisture inside evaporates 

599
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,360
and it becomes very light. So to test whether the eggs are fresh, 

600
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:11,240
let's first of all take the egg that's freshly bought and dated. 

601
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,920
And if you put it in water, it should sink. 

602
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,320
I'll do it gently because it might break at the bottom. 

603
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,040
There it is. 

604
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,120
Now, this egg, I happen to know, is pretty old 

605
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,040
so we'll see whether it floats... 

606
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,720
There you are. That's been about a bit, so throw it away. 

607
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,080
The final, and with just three bakers remaining, Paul had 

608
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,280
a troublesome technical challenge to put their baking skills to the test. 

609
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,800
OK, bakers. 

610
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,040
What we'd like you to make today, please, is something 

611
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,360
never before seen on the Bake Off. 

612
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,960
Pretzels. Six savoury, six sweet. 

613
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,680
We'd like them tied into a classic pretzel knot. 

614
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,240
Yeah, for sure - we all know what that is. 

615
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,200
And you've got two and a half hours in which to bake them. 

616
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,400
On your marks... 

617
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,320
- Get set...
- Bake. 

618
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,520
I love pretzels but I've never, ever made them before. 

619
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,760
I've not made them before. I've made bread similar to a pretzel before. 

620
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,000
Obviously, I know what pretzel is. 

621
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,480
The trick with the pretzel is going to be the shaping of it. 

622
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,480
So this is going to be quite some challenge. 

623
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,680
Obviously, I've never made it - who makes a pretzel? 

624
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,120
It's just not a thing. 

625
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,520
Paul's recipe is for both a traditional savoury pretzel 

626
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,920
and a zesty sweet variety. 

627
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,360
Right, Mary, it's my turn to do the technical challenge from the final. 

628
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,720
I'm going to show you how to make them properly. 

629
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,360
Could you weigh up for me 500g of strong white flour, please? 

630
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,000
Add 10g and salt and 7g of yeast. 

631
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,800
Now, I'll be using instant yeast, the fast-action stuff. 

632
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,080
If you haven't got fast-action and you really want to use fresh, 

633
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,320
you need to add about another third of the weight again. 

634
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,000
Add 40g of softened butter, and you'll also need 280ml of milk. 

635
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,680
Now, that jar, Mary, does that take you back at all? 

636
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,280
- I think that's... I think that's malt.
- It is malt. It's malt extract. 

637
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,120
We used to have this in the war. It was in the sideboard 

638
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,800
and we used to have to have a tablespoon of it a day. 

639
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,720
Don't ask me why. 

640
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,440
Spoon one tablespoon into the mix. 

641
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,800
It really does make a difference. It helps with the colour, you know, 

642
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,040
the richness of the colour of the pretzel, because you want that dark. 

643
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,360
Mixing by hand, gradually add the milk until a dough is formed. 

644
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,920
This is going to be quite stiff, 

645
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,600
because you want that definition in that pretzel shape. 

646
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,600
When the dough has come together, knead for ten minutes 

647
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
or until it's smooth and glossy. 

648
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,720
Now, all I'm doing... You see how all I'm doing is basically 

649
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,200
rolling up the dough. A bit of pressure on there. 

650
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,320
When the dough is smooth, 

651
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,640
divide in half and place each into a small bowl. 

652
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,480
Thank you very much, Mary. 

653
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:59,920
First one was the plain one, straight in. 

654
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,920
Second one is the sweet one. 

655
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,760
To the sweet half, add the zest of two oranges 

656
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,960
and 50g of poppy seeds. 

657
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,440
That will do. I'll need to work this mix together. 

658
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,680
- Look at that burst of colour in there.
- Lovely. 

659
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,160
It's such a nice dough. You can use any of the citrus fruits in here. 

660
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,480
It's the citrus flavour that drives through that darkness 

661
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,240
of the pretzel, and it's what you crave for. 

662
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,640
When you bite into it, you've got that crunch of the poppy 

663
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,480
and then you get that beautiful flavour, 

664
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,840
whether it's mandarin, satsuma, orange or lemon. 

665
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,600
Or lime, actually. Lime would be nice. 

666
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,720
When the zest and seeds have been thoroughly 

667
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,640
worked into the dough, shape into a ball. 

668
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,600
I'm going to place it back in the bowl, and then I'm going to 

669
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,760
wrap them with food wrap. 

670
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,520
- Is it there? 
- Men can never find anything. 

671
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,040
OK, rip out the food wrap. 

672
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,280
Could I do that in a machine? 

673
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,200
Think about how long it's just taken me to prepare those two doughs. 

674
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,160
Look at your shoulders, look at the muscle. I haven't got that. 

675
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,520
The thing is, that's just taken me five minutes. 

676
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,040
If you're using a machine, it takes four and a half minutes. 

677
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,840
People at home, if you haven't got a mixer, contact me 

678
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,400
and I'll go round there. Â£1,000 per pretzel. 

679
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,280
Leave to prove until doubled in size. 

680
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,880
With their dough made, 

681
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,680
the bakers had the most challenging bit to come - 

682
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,040
the shaping. 

683
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,400
Making no sense. 

684
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,040
It's got to be a double twist, though. 

685
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,800
- What?
- It says double twist. 

686
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,720
- A double twist? 
- Yes, my love. A double twist. 

687
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,920
- Double twist?!
- It's basically dough gymnastics, isn't it? 

688
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,080
Propel and twist. 

689
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,400
- That's normally a pretzel shape, isn't it?
- Is it? 

690
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,680
What people are doing... 

691
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,120
That's... No. Good luck, Frances. 

692
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,960
- Look at those guys.
- Gracious! 

693
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,160
You can see how much they grow. 

694
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,640
I'm just going to coat the bench in a little bit of flour. 

695
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,920
Each dough needs to be rolled out and divided in to six equal pieces. 

696
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,440
You start with one. 

697
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,400
You keep it fat and then taper it off. 

698
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,560
Apply some pressure to the dough, working from the middle outwards 

699
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,280
to push out any air bubbles that may have formed. 

700
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,120
That's the sort of shape you look for for a pretzel, OK? 

701
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,680
Then bring it to a U, and then you need to twist it twice, 

702
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,600
bring it back on itself, and tack it - all right? 

703
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,720
Lift it up and then just stretch it slightly. 

704
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,680
OK, so that's one. Do another one. 

705
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,120
Each piece should be 40 to 50cm in length. 

706
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,560
Resting them part way 

707
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,040
allows he gluten to relax, 

708
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,040
preventing them from springing back. 

709
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
I was working with guys in Germany 

710
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,640
- who picked it up did the twist, you know.
- Yeah. 

711
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,160
And they went back in and did it that way. 

712
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,640
But what I do is, I just grab the ends and twist twice, 

713
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,360
and then place it on the side, pinch it, and then you open it up. 

714
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,040
There's another pretzel. 

715
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,000
Do you want to have a go? 

716
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,880
I'm extremely nervous and I won't do them as well, but I will have a go. 

717
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,800
OK, so grab your dough and keep on rolling it all the way. 

718
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,080
That's not bad. 

719
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,240
It's not bad. So you make a U first. 

720
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,360
One hand over the other, twist it twice... 

721
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,480
..and then tack it to the side. 

722
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,960
PAUL CHUCKLES 

723
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,880
The bakers were also finding the pretzels a little tricky, 

724
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,880
and they were about to take the plunge. 

725
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,840
Please, please, please work. 

726
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,800
It just seems insane, popping these in here. 

727
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,680
If you leave them in too long, you boil them. 

728
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,080
And that's not going to be cool. 

729
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,280
Look at them. They look like flipping octopuses. 

730
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,520
They've been in a while. 

731
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,600
A minute in total, now. 

732
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,840
- They've sort of...expanded. 
- They've ballooned. 

733
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,040
These are not looking like the pretzels I like to enjoy. 

734
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,640
To get the pretzel its characteristic dark colour, 

735
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,080
we need to make a lye. 

736
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,640
We've got a pot here with boiling water to which I'm going to 

737
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,920
add bicarbonate of soda. 

738
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,840
The colour of the dough would normally be very mature and matt brown. 

739
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,400
You put this in, coat it, it gives it that shine 

740
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,520
and it alters the colour and gives it that very woody-looking finish. 

741
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,200
Add 21g of bicarbonate of soda into seven litres of boiling water. 

742
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,800
You can see it instantly starts frothing up. 

743
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,280
Gracious me! 

744
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,080
Now, I'll start with the savoury ones first. 

745
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,880
Gently drop each pretzel in to the boiling water. 

746
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,760
They basically have to be dipped. 

747
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,720
It's not like a bagel, where I'm going to poach them in there. 

748
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,520
All it is a dip. 

749
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,360
Remove onto a baking tray, reshaping if needed. 

750
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,320
While the pretzels are still wet, sprinkle 50g of sesame seeds 

751
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,720
and 20g of rock salt over the top. 

752
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,240
Before they go in the oven, they need to be cut. 

753
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,960
This is to let the devil out. 

754
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,440
So a deep slash right at the base. 

755
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,160
- A straight cut. 
- It will open up there as it bakes. 

756
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,560
Now repeat the process with the sweet pretzels. 

757
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,160
As soon as you've got the last one in, 

758
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,120
start bringing the first one out. 

759
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,560
So it's just literally in and out. 

760
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,160
Can you straighten that one up a little bit for me, Mary? 

761
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,400
You've got hands like asbestos. 

762
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,040
Of course I can, that's no problem. 

763
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,120
The pretzels will need to be baked at 200 degrees. 

764
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,840
Now they're all ready to go into the oven. 

765
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,520
- Very well. 
- Thank you very much, Mary. 

766
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,520
20, 25 minutes later, rich dark colour... 

767
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,520
We should have our pretzels. 

768
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,000
To decorate the sweet pretzels, 

769
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,080
Paul makes some candied orange zest and a syrupy glaze. 

770
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,760
Peel an orange and cut into thin slivers of zest. 

771
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,640
You would think I'm making marmalade. 

772
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,920
It's about the only time I cut up peel like this. 

773
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,120
Squeeze the juice from three oranges into a saucepan, 

774
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,640
add 100g of caster sugar and bring to the boil. 

775
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,920
And I'm also going to add now the rind, which is going to soften up. 

776
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,240
Boil for one minute and pass through a sieve. 

777
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,080
This has been softened in the syrup. 

778
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:45,800
Coat the zest in 25g of caster sugar and leave to dry. 

779
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,800
That will be fantastic and beautiful on top of the pretzels. 

780
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,280
Continue to cook the syrup until reduced and sticky. 

781
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,680
- They look about perfect.
- They do. 

782
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,600
Wow, look at them. Gorgeous. Nice deep, rich brown colour. 

783
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,240
Look at these guys. 

784
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,600
You need to put the syrup on while these pretzels are still hot, 

785
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,840
and these are still hot, so this is the perfect time to put it on. 

786
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,200
Immediately you do that and it sort of brings them alive, doesn't it? 

787
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,720
Oh, yes. 

788
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,200
Sprinkle over the candied peel to finish. 

789
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,120
So at the end of the day, Mary, 

790
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:23,200
after a hard day's toil, you end up with 12 pretzels. 

791
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,360
Six savoury with the rock salt and the sesame seed, 

792
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,040
and six beautiful sweet ones with the poppy seed and the orange. 

793
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,840
All very rewarding. 

794
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,520
I'll take this savoury one here. 

795
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,720
You can hear the crack on the outside. 

796
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,440
It's lovely, chewy and soft on the inside. 

797
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,720
- I'll give you half of that one. 
- I love the mahogany colour. 

798
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,520
Mmm. I like the soft centre. 

799
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,400
And yet it's all crispy and crackling at the ends. 

800
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,160
It's delicious. 

801
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:05,040
These look good. Orange and poppy seed. A wonderful combination. 

802
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,760
I'm just going to snap that in half. There we are, you can have half. 

803
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,280
Thank you. 

804
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,160
- What a shine from that orange glaze. 
- Yeah, I know. 

805
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,960
Mmm. And just a little bit of spring in the middle. 

806
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,000
And soft. So good. 

807
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,880
They're beautiful. The poppy seed adds to the texture 

808
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,760
and then that gorgeous orange flavour comes through. 

809
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,680
- It's one of my favourite bakes. 
- I'll have some more. 

810
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,200
PAUL CHUCKLES 

811
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,600
To end on a high note, we return to the semifinal. 

812
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,080
Bonjour, bakers. Welcome to your French Showstopper Challenge. 

813
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,000
Today we would like to make the most delicate 

814
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,280
and complex of cakes. The opera cake. 

815
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,520
When somebody looks at your opera cake, they should break into song. 

816
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,960
- So, ladies, on your marks... 
- Get your funk on, Brunnhildes... 

817
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,760
(OPERATICALLY) Bake! 

818
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,360
I'm making a passion fruit mousseline. 

819
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,480
I've got saffron as a flavour as well. 

820
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,120
So I'm making my lemon and lavender soap-opera cake. 

821
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,680
Ha-ha! 

822
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,680
- (SING SONG)
- Chocolate buttons, chocolate buttons! 

823
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,240
Caramel... 

824
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,200
Ground up something or another. I don't know what that is. 

825
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,320
- It's ground up banana chips. 
- Banana chips. 

826
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,440
Mary's opera cake is a lesson in elegance and precision 

827
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,080
and the perfect way to impress your guests. 

828
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,720
I think it's perhaps the most glamorous cake that I've ever made. 

829
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,640
It's a matter of getting all the layers right. 

830
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,920
First of all, you have a joconde sponge, which has almonds in it. 

831
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,960
And then it has chocolate ganache, creme au beurre, 

832
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,880
and you build up the layers. 

833
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,720
And on top, I put a layer of raspberry jam 

834
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,880
and lots of raspberries over the top. 

835
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,160
It's ticking all the boxes. I love chocolate, I love raspberries. 

836
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,320
Well, I'm going to start off. I soak the sponge with syrup. 

837
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:59,280
To make the syrup, pour 200ml of water into a saucepan 

838
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,240
and add 100g of caster sugar. 

839
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,240
Dissolve the sugar first of all, 

840
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,800
and then we'll boil it rapidly until it's a thin syrup. 

841
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,760
This should take four to five minutes, 

842
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,240
while you start on the meringue base for the joconde sponge. 

843
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,440
Could I have three egg whites? 

844
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,440
Reserve the egg yolks in a separate bowl. 

845
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,000
- I'm going to use those for the creme au beurre later.
- OK. 

846
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,920
So this is a whisked sponge, but it has the addition of almonds. 

847
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,200
It's full of flavour and it's a lovely close texture. 

848
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,960
There's your egg whites, Mary. 

849
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,160
So you make a meringue first of all. 

850
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,760
Whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks 

851
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,840
and then gradually add in 15g of caster sugar. 

852
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,520
When the meringue is glossy, cover and set aside. 

853
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,280
Now we come to the main part of the sponge 

854
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,120
- and I need 100g of ground almonds.
- OK. 

855
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,760
On top of the almonds, add 100g of icing sugar. 

856
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,360
No need to sieve the icing sugar. 

857
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,800
And in with the sugar and the almonds goes three eggs. 

858
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,720
I'm just going to check over here. 

859
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,920
The syrup is thick now, 

860
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,200
and I'm going to add the Kirsch and let it get cold. It's supposed 

861
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,400
to be three tablespoons, and we'd better be fairly accurate. 

862
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,840
No having quick swigs. 

863
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,320
Too late. 

864
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,080
If you haven't got Kirsch at home, you could always use something like 

865
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,840
orange liquor, cherry brandy. 

866
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,880
You could. Vodka, you could put in there, Mary. 

867
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,320
Put the syrup aside to cool, and continue with the sponge. 

868
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,720
Add the three eggs to the ground almonds and icing sugar. 

869
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,600
And you whisk that mixture until it is thick. 

870
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,640
That looks as though it's doubled its volume. 

871
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,560
It's still runny, but it's much thicker. 

872
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,480
Weigh out 30g of plain flour. 

873
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,240
I'll sieve it in just to make quite sure it's absolutely smooth. 

874
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,720
When the flour is combined, gently fold the meringue into the mix. 

875
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,320
And in order to get it in quite smoothly, 

876
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,400
you want to do this in three batches. 

877
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,000
The first third, you can be quite rough with, almost beating. 

878
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,360
Then when you get it slackened down, you can add the rest 

879
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,160
a little more quickly. 

880
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,720
There it is. It looks a bit like snow. 

881
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,960
- And that is your raising agent, because we've used plain flour.
- Yes. 

882
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,240
The final ingredient for the sponge is 30g of butter, 

883
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,080
melted and cooled. 

884
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,320
Pour it down the side of the bowl and then fold in. 

885
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,240
Why do you put it around the outside? 

886
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,880
You can bring it in gradually from the outside. 

887
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,920
If it's all in the middle, then it doesn't go in so easily. 

888
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,480
Again, very carefully. 

889
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,400
If you go on beating this, it will lose all its volume. 

890
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,800
When the butter is incorporated, pour the mix into a greased 

891
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,200
and lined Swiss roll tin. 

892
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,040
Just gently tip it in. Push it into the corners. 

893
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,200
And that is very important. 

894
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:12,440
It must be one level all the way over because I am going to split it. 

895
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,600
It's ready to go into the oven at 200 degrees 

896
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,360
and that's a fan oven and it'll take between five and seven minutes. 

897
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,520
It needs to be very carefully watched. 

898
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:28,440
The sponge is ready when it's a pale golden brown and springy to touch. 

899
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,480
- Yes, that looks right.
- Lovely. 

900
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,600
So this is how it should look. 

901
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,280
Shrinking away, as it is there, from the side. 

902
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,560
Turn the sponge onto a sheet of baking parchment. 

903
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:43,640
Don't do it straight onto the rack, because it'll stick to the rack. 

904
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,680
And tip it straight onto the paper like that. 

905
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,280
- Lift it away.
- Your hands are like asbestos, Mary.
- I know. 

906
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,440
Peel the paper off the sponge. 

907
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,240
So just pull that back gently, all the way, 

908
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,680
and leave that to get cool. 

909
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,080
When it is cold, I've got to put a sharp knife through that 

910
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:09,280
- and then I'll cut the strips in half and build up four layers.
- OK. 

911
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,240
So we'll just pop that to one side. 

912
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:15,800
To make the chocolate ganache filling, pour 100ml of double cream 

913
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,400
into a pan and heat until just bubbling. 

914
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,760
Now, that double cream should be pouring cream. 

915
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,000
Remove from the heat and add 100g of plain chocolate. 

916
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,480
Stir until all the chocolate has melted 

917
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,920
and the ganache is smooth and glossy. 

918
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:35,120
One of the most useful icings and so simple. That's it. 

919
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,160
Pour the ganache into a bowl to cool. 

920
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,920
Then we come to the posh creme au beurre. 

921
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,360
Very French and very traditional. 

922
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,120
- You remember we had three egg yolks?
- Yes. 

923
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,920
- I need those to put into the mixing bowl.
- There you go. 

924
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:55,200
Creme au beurre is a buttercream filling enriched with egg yolks 

925
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,120
and sweetened with a sugar syrup. 

926
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,640
I need 75g of caster sugar. 

927
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,080
Dissolve in three tablespoons of water, then boil steadily 

928
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,440
until the syrup reaches 110 degrees centigrade and thickens. 

929
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,400
Now, I've got a thermometer here and I'm going to test it, 

930
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,280
but you don't really need one. I can just show you the consistency. 

931
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,760
That's exactly 110. 

932
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:24,320
Now, I've got the egg yolks in here and I can start whisking those. 

933
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,560
With the food mixer running, pour the syrup over the egg yolks. 

934
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,400
So, it's sort of like a very runny golden syrup. 

935
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,400
Continue to whisk until the mixture is thick and mousse-like. 

936
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,600
That's just the consistency that I want. Sort of soft whipped cream. 

937
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,560
It's gone pale in colour and it's ready to have the butter in. 

938
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,200
OK. Is that softened butter that you're putting in, then? 

939
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,840
It's softened butter and while it's beating, 

940
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,080
you put it in little by little. 

941
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,280
So, full speed ahead. 

942
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,760
Add 225g of unsalted butter a little at a time. 

943
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,960
Now, the machine's done all the work. 

944
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,080
To finish, add two teaspoons of vanilla paste. 

945
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,880
You may have at home vanilla extract 

946
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:15,560
or you can scoop out the beans from a whole vanilla pod. 

947
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:20,080
You can actually see this paste now quite a lot, and you never used 

948
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,400
to see it, a few years ago. It's quite a new thing. 

949
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,280
It's sort of new and people are trying it, but I always say, 

950
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,080
"Use what you've already got." 

951
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,640
Continue to mix until well combined. 

952
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,920
We have achieved our creme au beurre. 

953
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,520
It looks incredible. It's got that lovely shine to it as well. 

954
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,720
So, what you can do with that, you can spread it, 

955
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,840
you can pipe it, you can colour it, you can flavour it. 

956
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,800
Now, we've got to start assembling our cake. 

957
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,200
But with the clock ticking, the bakers weren't quite as cool 

958
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,400
as Mary when it came to layering up their opera cakes. 

959
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,800
- What opera is your cake? 
- What's a tragedy? 

960
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,520
I'm going to start my construction because I will feel better 

961
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,160
in my soul knowing that I've got something together. 

962
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,280
I just want to get the buttercream really level. 

963
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,720
There's still one more layer of sponge, buttercream 

964
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,920
- and chocolate to go on.
- I've not got time to mess around loads. 

965
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,440
I feel like I'm about to have a heart attack. 

966
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,840
So, for our final act in the opera, we put it together. 

967
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:37,280
Using a bread knife, carefully slice the cooled sponge in half. 

968
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,120
You're doing a good job there, Mary. 

969
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,680
I hope the front door bell doesn't go or any of those things. 

970
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,360
I want to finish it. 

971
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,960
- How about that, then?
- That's good. 
- I'm out the other side. 

972
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,880
Now cut in half lengthways so you have four layers. 

973
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,680
- That's it.
- To assemble the cake, brush one of the sponges 

974
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,440
with one quarter of the Kirsch syrup. 

975
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,720
And you just dab it over. 

976
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,840
If you don't like alcohol, you could do it with just a lemon syrup. 

977
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,760
Then spread on half of the creme au beurre. 

978
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,600
Traditionally, each of the opera cake's thin layers 

979
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,440
should be exactly the same height. 

980
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,720
Do it to the edges. 

981
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,960
Remember that we are going to trim the edges. 

982
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,960
Right. We're on to the next layer. 

983
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,240
Place another sponge on top. 

984
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,760
Again, brush with one quarter of the Kirsch syrup, 

985
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,760
then spread over the chocolate ganache. 

986
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,960
If there's a birthday in the family, it would make a wonderful dessert 

987
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,880
and you could put candles all across the top. 

988
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,560
Mind you, when you get to my age, you wouldn't get them on, would you? 

989
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,920
Take a lot of wax, that, Mary. 

990
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,240
- Maybe just one big one. 
- I think that might be sensible. 

991
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,480
The next two layers are Kirsch-soaked sponge 

992
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,920
and the rest of the creme au beurre. 

993
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,000
Then we come to our final layer here. 

994
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,120
Flatten it down. 

995
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,880
Even if the mixture is oozing out, that's good. 

996
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,080
Spread over the remaining Kirsch syrup. 

997
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:10,480
I'm going to brush over some sieved raspberry jam. 

998
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,040
Smells good. And then on top of that, fresh raspberries. 

999
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,760
Arrange the raspberries close together 

1000
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,160
and remember to leave space to trim down the edges. 

1001
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,920
It works out very well, this, 

1002
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:30,120
because each person gets a double row of the raspberries. 

1003
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,840
And finally, brush over a little of the sieved jam, to glaze. 

1004
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,440
So if that goes into the fridge for two or three hours, really, 

1005
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,640
just to firm up and then we'll sharply cut it up. 

1006
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,920
Right. Into the fridge it goes. 

1007
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,920
When the cake is thoroughly chilled, 

1008
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,520
trim to reveal sharp, clean edges and clearly-defined layers. 

1009
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:57,760
Because we chilled it really well, it means that you get a nice, clear cut. 

1010
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,600
We're getting the distinct layers there. 

1011
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,880
Well, I'm quite proud of that. 

1012
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,640
It is tricky, it does take time but if you do it stage-by-stage, 

1013
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,920
you will achieve something exactly like that. 

1014
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,160
At the end of the day, if it looks like that, 

1015
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,760
it's well worth the effort. 

1016
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,280
Are you ready? 

1017
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,880
That's lovely, that, Mary. 

1018
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,760
I love to see the stripes all the way down. 

1019
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,400
Now, let's see what it tastes like. 

1020
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,200
The first thing I get is the Kirsch, and I like that. 

1021
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,120
Wow. You get a big kick from the Kirsch, don't you? 

1022
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,760
- You do.
- I like that. That's really nice. 

1023
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,480
And the creme au beurre is so creamy and soft 

1024
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,000
and then you come down to the chocolate ganache 

1025
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,840
and the whole thing is sharpened up by the raspberries on the top. 

1026
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,560
You can taste that beautiful sponge as well. 

1027
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,440
That all goes well as a package. I think it's a beautiful opera cake. 

1028
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,000
- well done, Mary. That's delish. 
- Quite impressive. 

1029
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Now, this is the last of our masterclass recipes. 

1030
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,440
Looking back, this year, the standard was so high 

1031
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,960
and got higher and higher all the way through. 

1032
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,480
- Where are we going to go next year? 
- I've no idea. 

1033
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:24,320
We've got to find even more tricky bakes that are well-worth making. 

1034
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,600
- Quite a challenge. 
- It's going to be fun. 

1035
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,200
