- 'After weeks of tackling tempering...'
- Ohh! 

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,960
'..panicking over petits fours and fighting filo...' 

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,760
I am defeating filo!

'..those left in the Bake Off 

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,600
'were back in the tent to face more gruelling challenges.' 

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,400
I might as well be doing this entire challenge like this, 

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,960
because that is how much of an idea I have. 

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,480

9

00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,760

- Oh!

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,720
Of course, it says "bake..." 

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,320
What does that mean? 

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,040

Well, these are burnt.

Overcooked. Both of them. 

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,520
- Annoyingly, I really like it! 
- How painful to give a compliment! 

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,640
I have to say that that is absolutely beautiful.

I love baking, I want you to have that passion, as well. 

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,880
But the hard bit for me is baking with Mary Berry. What's she going to say?! 

32
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,800
- Well...?
- It feels very naughty 

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,320

00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,480
so, at home, everybody will be able to recreate what's been done on the Bake Off.

'In week five of the Bake Off, it was time for traybakes and biscuits.

00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,920
'that gave the bakers an opportunity to show off their precision,

'and their own distinct baking personality.' 

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
For this Signature Challenge, 

54
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,320
we'd like you to make your favourite traybakes. 

55
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,040
This could be brownies, blondies, rocky roads, 

56
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,840
and because there's a recession on, millionaire shortbreads have been downgraded to a penny crunch. 

57
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,520
Paul and Mary have said the pieces should be identical in size 

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,840
and everything you make should be from scratch. 

59
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,360
- So on your marks...
- Get set... 
- BOTH: Bake! 

60
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,640
I'm making hazelnut and chocolate brownies. 

61
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,360
It's something that I make often at home. 

62
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,320
I've just pimped them up a bit, so I've added the cherries. 

63
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,920
It's an almond sponge in the bottom, 

64
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,800
and then it has a mixture of three berries, 

65
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,600
which is blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. 

66
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,800
I've got dried sour cherries, I've got some maraschino cherries just for colour. 

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,320
I've also got some normal glace cherries. 

68
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,480
Inside I'm using black cherry 

69
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,960
and damsons, which have a good kind of fruity, berry flavour. 

70
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,400
'But Mary's signature traybake is a spiced treacle and ginger cake, 

71
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,760
'topped with a delicious ginger icing.' 

72
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,160
When we gave them that challenge, it was deliberately, for us, we think simple, 

73
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,000
but it had to be perfect, didn't it? 

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,800
It had to be level, all the sides had to be uniform. It was about consistency. 

75
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,920
I am going to do a family favourite that I've been brought up with. 

76
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,400
It's a treacle-spiced ginger traybake. 

77
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,920
It is delicious. 

78
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,160
Where did this recipe come from? Is this your recipe? 

79
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,960
This was my mother's. She made it many years ago. 

80
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,760
What decade are we talking about? 

81
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,680
- Or what century?
- I think she would have done this in the '60s. 

82
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,360
- 1860s?
- 1960s! 

83
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,600
Well, Mum died at 105... 

84
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,360
- 1760s! 
- ..and she was always a great baker. 

85
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,560
It started off as a Victoria sandwich, 

86
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,320
then she added some treacle to it, which gave it a real richness. 

87
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,200
We were often given a stem ginger at Christmastime 

88
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,480
and nobody really ate it, 

89
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,760
so she chopped it up and put it in the traybake, and I've been doing it ever since. 

90
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,760
I'm going to take the eggs first, put the eggs in the bowl, 

91
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,400
because I find that if you put the eggs in the bowl, 

92
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,800
- as you mix it, it's damp underneath and it goes in more smoothly.
- Yes. 

93
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,360
- Four eggs, if I may.
- Four. 

94
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,080
'Add 225 grams of baking spread.' 

95
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,280
If you want to use butter, you can use butter, but that should be softened. 

96
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,000
'In a separate bowl, add 300 grams of self-raising flour 

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,560
'and two level teaspoons of baking powder.' 

98
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,520
It's the all-in-one method. You do everything in the bowl and you don't mix it for long. 

99
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,840
'Add one teaspoon of mixed spice, one teaspoon of allspice 

100
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,800
'and 175 grams of light muscovado sugar.' 

101
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,560
Sometimes light muscovado sugar, 

102
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,000
- when you leave it on the shelf, it gets a bit solid.
- Yes. 

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,720
So put it in the microwave, 

104
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,920
switching it on and off on full power until it becomes soft and not lumpy. 

105
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,720
'Pour in 200 grams of black treacle.' 

106
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,880
- That's quite a lot, then, isn't it? 
- It is, but it's good. 

107
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Don't be overgenerous with that, because if you do, it can dip. 

108
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,360
'Then add all these ingredients into the eggs and baking spread 

109
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,720
'and four tablespoons of milk.' 

110
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,640
If you can take out three bulbs of stem ginger... 

111
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,520
- Yes. 
- ..and chop it really, really finely. 

112
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,320
If you don't chop it finely, 

113
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,360
it will sink to the bottom of the traybake. 

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,440
- That's just perfect.
- Is that OK? 
- Yes. 

115
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,840
So all that remains is for me to mix that. 

116
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,960
You could be doing this with a small hand whisk, if you prefer. 

117
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,600
It's very easy when you get something like treacle in the mixture 

118
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,720
- because you can see it's one colour. 
- Yes. 

119
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,800
- Shall I clear down for you, Mary? 
- Lovely. 

120
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,320
That's perfect. Now, the texture of that 

121
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,360
is what I would've called at college "soft dropping". 

122
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,560
Now, this I can tip into the tin, already prepared. 

123
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,640
I've got the oven ready, 

124
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,880
and I'm going to bake that at 160 

125
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,320
and it will take about 35 or 40 minutes. 

126
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,920
I've made this traybake absolutely level on top. 

127
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,080
I don't find that a well in the centre makes it rise evenly. 

128
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,400
- If you put it too near the top of the oven, it will rise to a peak.
- Yes. 

129
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,440
But if you cook it lower down in the oven, you will get success. 

130
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,480
So there we are, in the oven. 

131
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,240
Don't be tempted to open the oven before about 30 minutes anyway, 

132
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,120
- because it would drop.
- OK. 

133
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,480
'It's sometimes difficult to tell when dark cake mixes are cooked. 

134
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,640
'You'll know it's ready when the cake shrinks away from the side of the tin.' 

135
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,600
'With time ticking in the tent, getting the bake right was proving tricky.' 

136
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,000
30 minutes left of traybake madness. 

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,240
30 minutes to go. 

138
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,280
It's still quite soggy. 

139
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,400
It's so difficult, because it needs to be gooey in the middle 

140
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,120
but it needs to be cooked. 

141
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,440
Right, OK, it's a little bit uneven, but we are where we are. 

142
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,160
Maybe I've slightly underperformed on this 

143
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,640
in that it might be a little bit on the simple side. 

144
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,120
Paul, that's about 35 minutes, 40 minutes. 

145
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,480
It's shrinking away from the sides of the paper here. 

146
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,440
If I touch it, it springs back, 

147
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,280
so I'll leave that in the tin to cool off 

148
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,840
- and then I'm going to ice it.
- OK. 

149
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,600
We want to have it a nice, shiny top of icing, 

150
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,280
and if you can put some icing sugar in there, 

151
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,000
about 75 grams, a bit more, 

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,400
and then I mix it with the syrup from the jar. 

153
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,560
Ah, OK. 

154
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,200
Just take some and mix it until it's nice and smooth. 

155
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,600
'For the decoration, you'll also need two to three bulbs of stem ginger, finely chopped.' 

156
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,040
It's a very sticky job, this. 

157
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,960
That traybake should be cold now. It's had about 30 minutes. 

158
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,040
If I can have it back and I'll ice it. 

159
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,080
There you go, Mary. 

160
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,000
There it is, cold. 

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,160
If you ice it when it's warm, the icing will run off it. 

162
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,560
'Carefully remove the cake from the tin and peel off the paper.' 

163
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,520
You've made me some good icing. 

164
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,280
- I need a palette knife. 
- Do you want me to drop it on? 
- You put it on there. 

165
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,280
And it really doesn't matter if it runs down the side. 

166
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
- Oh, it does!
- Oh, it doesn't to me. 

167
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,160
- I was trying to get it the right consistency for you. 
- I think you've done it before. 

168
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,640
'Completely cover the top of the cake, 

169
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,640
'ensuring that the outer edges are as evenly coated as the centre.' 

170
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,840
And if you get the icing too thick, 

171
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,160
- if you dip the actual knife into hot water...
- Yes. 

172
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,800
..it will help to spread it. 

173
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,160
And then you take the ginger 

174
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,000
and you just put that over the top, 

175
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,240
as haphazardly as you like. 

176
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,080
If you were doing it for children, you could just do a glace icing 

177
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,800
and it'll just be a bit spicy, and you could put all sorts of sweets. 

178
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,000
You could put a lemon icing or an orange icing on it, couldn't you? 

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,600
I think orange icing would go very well. 

180
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,200
Now, if I can have a serrated knife, 

181
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,920
if there's one in that block there... 

182
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,960
- There you go.
- I think it will cut, what, into about 18? 

183
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,240
'But as the pressure of cutting the perfect slice got to the bakers...' 

184
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,760
It's going to be difficult to get that exactly right. 

185
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
180... 

186
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,920
'..basic arithmetic became problematic.' 

187
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,920
- HE SIGHS 
- 18 by 3? 

188
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,320
Howard, are yours four-centimetre squares? 

189
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,280
Oh, gosh! I've done it by eye! I don't know! 

190
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,080
This is where delicate and finesse and I part company. 

191
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,760
Well, we never met. 

192
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,880
There we are. We've got 18 slices. 

193
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,880
I love that combination of that lovely ginger on top, 

194
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,960
then the lovely smooth icing, 

195
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,920
and you get a lovely texture inside 

196
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,640
with flecks of ginger all the way through. 

197
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,680
I'm very tempted to have some now, 

198
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,320
- but we'll save it and have it with a cup of tea.
- OK. 

199
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,720
Spiced treacle and ginger traybake, 

200
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,560
a great family favourite of ours. 

201
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,400
Mary, you promised I could have a piece when I got my tea. 

202
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,400
- I've got my tea, can I have a piece, please?
- Course you can. 

203
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,960
They look delicious. They're so... 

204
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,960
The smell of that ginger, as well, I think it works a treat. 

205
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,960
Got to have a cup of tea, as well. 

206
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,760
It works so well with tea. It's moist, the ginger's in there, 

207
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,840
that icing on the top is now dried and it tastes delicious, 

208
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,360
and then the stem ginger comes through, as well. 

209
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,040
- That's good, that. 
- It's really like a luxury gingerbread that's turned into a cake. 

210
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,400
Mm. Spot-on, that, Mary. 

211
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,720
'If you've ever wondered how to make your own sourdough starter, Paul shows us how.' 

212
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,960
This, basically, is making yeast. 

213
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,440
You're beginning to harness the yeast, the lactobacillus is in the air. 

214
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,880
Now, to do that, you need strong white flour, also an organic apple. 

215
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,000
Grate it straight into the flour. 

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It has to be organic. 

217
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,840
You can't have any chemicals on this at all. 

218
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,720
That will impede the growth of the starter itself, actual wild yeast. 

219
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,400
And then add water. 

220
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,960
Enough to make a thick batter. 

221
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,120
It's a bit like a pancake batter. 

222
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,640
That's perfect. It's just falling off the spoon. 

223
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,120
Now we need to pop that into a jar, seal it down, 

224
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,480
get a black marker pen and just mark the level of the dough. 

225
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,560
This will grow over the next two, three days. 

226
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,360
It'll probably double in size, if not more. 

227
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,840
You open it up and it'll fizz, like you just opened a bottle of lemonade. 

228
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,560
That's perfect. 

229
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,760
Get the dough that's in there, discard half of it. 

230
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,120
Put it in a bowl, feed it with more flour and water, 

231
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,160
take it back to a thick batter again and then pop it back into the jar. 

232
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,480
You need to do that every two, three days 

233
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,480
until the dough itself rises within 24 hours. 

234
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,320
Once it begins to rise within 24 hours, 

235
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,480
that is ready to use in replacement of yeast in your dough. 

236
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,280
'A simple and successful start to Biscuit Week 

237

'that was to be the most technically demanding so far.' 

241
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,160
- Hello, bakers. 
- Today, what we're asking you to make is a French classic. 

242
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,840
It is as French as striking, smoking and shrugging. 

243
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,880
- We would like you to make 18 tuiles. 
- Tuiles! 

244
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,400
You've got an hour and a half to make your tuiles. 

245
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,200
- On your marks...
- Get set... 
- BOTH: Bake! 

246
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,160
I've never made tuiles! 

247
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,040
I'm going to follow the instructions and just pray! 

248
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,320
I mean, what? 

249
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,080
I'm not going in completely clueless 

250
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,120
but about 80 per cent clueless, I'd say. 

251
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,520
'"Tuile" is French for "tile". 

252

'These delicate, elegant biscuits are often patterned with chocolate 

253
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,240
'and come in all shapes and sizes.' 

254
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,640
I'm going to make some cigar shapes, 

255
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,680
you know, those little rolls, the classic ones that you do over a rolling pin, 

256
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,480
and I'm also going to make a basket, 

257
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,160
because if you make a basket, you don't need any equipment, 

258
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,560
you can just do it on a baking tray. 

259
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,640
If you can get 200 grams of softened butter... 

260
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,800
I'm going to mix that with 180 grams of icing sugar, 

261
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,920
so they can both go in this bowl. 

262
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,760
Don't sieve the icing sugar, because we're giving it a good beat. 

263
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,920
I'm going to add a teaspoonful of vanilla extract. 

264
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,240
You could use vanilla paste if you've got it 

265
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,280
or scrape out the seeds straight out of the vanilla pod. 

266
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,680
The choice is yours. Whatever you've got in the cupboard. 

267
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,960
'Mix until you have a smooth paste.' 

268
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,640
I'm trying to get icing sugar not over you and me! 

269
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,560
I wish you were wearing your navy blue shirt. I'd have got it! 

270
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,800
'Then separate out six large eggs, discarding the yolks.' 

271
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,000
Of course, we could use those egg yolks up 

272
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,920
to make something like lemon curd. 

273
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,040
A good omelette. 

274
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,920
A very rich omelette, if I might say. 

275
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,000
A Sunday morning omelette - you can't beat it. 

276
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,640
Now, we need to slacken down that, 

277
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,200
only enough to blend it. 

278
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,400
I've now got to add the egg whites. 

279
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,120
Start very slowly. 

280
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,480
'Then weigh out 200 grams of flour and add it to your mixture.' 

281
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,960
It's important not to overwork the mixture. 

282
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,200
There's a happy medium between overworking and getting all the flour incorporated. 

283
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,880
If you do overmix that tuile mix, 

284
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,120
what could happen to the tuiles? 

285
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,800
They'll shrink. And we don't want them shrinking. 

286
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,040
'For the chocolate decoration, 

287

'take one sixth of your mixture and mix it with three level teaspoons of cocoa.' 

288
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,840
So there's the chocolate mixture and there's the tuile mixture. 

289
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,320
If those can just go in the fridge 

290
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,880
to chill for about 15 minutes, 20 minutes... 

291

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,080
So, Paul, those mixtures should've thickened up. 

294
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,760
They've had about 15, 20 minutes in the fridge.

297
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,080
You can take the top of an ice cream lid, 

298
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,800
cut round with sharp scissors and make it flat, 

299
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,000
and then make circles like this, 

300
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,680
and you'll get four on an ice cream lid. 

301
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,120
I'm going to do the next one down. Spread it across the top. 

302
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,320
You can go several times until you get it absolutely level. 

303
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,160
I'm really going for an effort to make it really thin. 

304

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,280
'or one that's too fragile to shape...' 

307
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,960
It's getting them thin enough without being too thin.

'..something the bakers were struggling to get right.' 

309

These aren't tuiles, these are paper! 

310
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,880
That's definitely not thick enough. 

311
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,200
There's a real knack to it, a knack which I... 

312
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
do not have! 

313
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,880
We need to lift this off in one upright movement. There we are. 

314
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,040
Now, let's make some of them chocolate. 

315
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,560
So you take the piping bag 

316
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
and then turn it back 

317
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
and push that right down. 

318
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,400
The amount of cocoa, we said three teaspoons, 

319
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,960
just enough to get it this nice colour. 

320
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,720
Shall I do one, 

321
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,960
and then I bet you'll speed up and do them like lightning. 

322
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,720
If they're a bit wiggly and it doesn't look perfect 

323
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,640
and you're doing it at home, at least you know it's home-made. 

324
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,720
It's really giving yourself time to do something like this. 

325
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,240
Don't do it in a hurry, because it does take time, 

326
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,680
it takes care. 

327
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,480
Right, we cook those at 160. That's set. 

328
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,720
If you can pop those in and we'll just keep an eye on them. About five minutes. 

329
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,800
I shall be standing here at four. 

330
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,160
'While the classic tuiles are baking, make your free-form basket 

331
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,720
'by spreading a very thin layer of tuile paste directly onto baking parchment 

332
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,040
'and shape it into a rough circle of about eight inches.' 

333
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,600
Now, that'll take, again, anything from about four minutes upwards. Keep an eye. 

334
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,240
When the edge of that is just a light brown colour, take it out. 

335
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,080
How are those doing there? 

336
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,200
Just a tinge of colour. 

337
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,160
So it's just the happy medium of getting them out 

338
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,960
that you can just get your hands on them. Let's just have a look. 

339
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,120
Let's lift these off. They've kept their shape beautifully. 

340
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,400
Just gently mould them over like that. 

341
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,440
You've got to be quick. 

342
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,000
'If they cool down they go hard, making them impossible to shape, 

343
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,160
'as some of our bakers found out.' 

344
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,800
They dry really quickly when they come out the oven! Ah! 

345
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,600
Oh, gosh! This is really hard. 

346
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,960
This is really hard. 

347
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,560
Some of these are, erm, 

348
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,280
a bit more like fag butts than cigars. 

349
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,360
'To soften them up again, pop them back in the oven for a few seconds. 

350
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,040
'At home, make smaller batches to ensure they can be quickly shaped straight from the oven.' 

351
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,640
And then the cigars... 

352
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,560
Let's try again with these. They've become soft. 

353
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,080
Pinch it over the top there and then roll round, 

354
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,760
and you can go on doing this. 

355
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
Keep that underneath. 

356
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,120
I'm going to try a wooden spoon. 

357
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,600
Just put that over. I've run out of rolling pin. 

358
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
- Anything round.
- Vodka bottle? 

359
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
A bit too big. 

360
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,000
Anyway, I haven't got a vodka bottle in my house. 

361
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,760
- Gin.
- They're the wrong shape. 

362
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,720
So we'll put them on a rack to cool. I certainly like your idea of doing it on a wooden spoon. 

363
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,080
Let's dip the ends in some melted chocolate. 

364
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,880
Do it one at a time and leave it on the rack there. 

365
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,680
You do one of yours. 

366
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,000
- As always, a very generous amount of chocolate.
- Of course. 

367
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,120
- My cigarillo is not going to be upstaged by yours, Mary.
- All right. 

368
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,480
'While the chocolate dries, shape your basket.' 

369
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,000
It's getting a colour around the outside. 

370
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,560
'Gently mould the hot biscuit over the top of a jar, tin or bowl 

371
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,600
'and let it cool.' 

372
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,040
In the basket, I'm going to make a rich, indulgent, 

373
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,960
very naughty mousse. 

374
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,200
For that, I need 300 grams of pouring double cream. 

375
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,000
'Pour half the cream into a pan, reserving the rest for later.' 

376
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,560
I'm going to turn that on and make it very, very hot, 

377
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,840
not boiling, but very, very hot. 

378
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,480
'Then break up 200 grams of chocolate.' 

379
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,840
I always use about a 40 per cent chocolate. 

380
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,040
You can use one with a 70 if you like. 

381
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,520
This has now come to a piping hot. 

382
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,120
Drop that chocolate in there. 

383
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,720
That's it. 

384
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,040
'Stir the chocolate until it's completely dissolved into the cream.' 

385
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,520
Right, that's absolutely perfect. Look at that. 

386
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,880
- You see?
- Yes. No lumps. 

387
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,440
No lumps of chocolate, you see? Perfect. 

388
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,640
I've got to chill that now, so in that goes into the bowl. 

389
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,200
Gosh, rich and indulgent! 

390
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,480
But why not, every so often? 

391
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,360
So that's ready to be put to one side to get cool. 

392
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,080
It'll only take about ten minutes. 

393
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
Then, to make it a little bit light, 

394
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,520
- I'm going to add whipped egg whites. 
- So it's a classic mousse.
- It is. 

395
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,560
'Whisk one egg white until it forms firm peaks. 

396
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,960
'Then add 50 grams of sugar, a spoonful at a time, 

397
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,720
'until you have a soft meringue.' 

398
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,520
That should've cooled. It has. 

399
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,000
And I'm going to slacken that down with the pouring double cream. 

400
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,320
'Once the remaining cold cream is fully incorporated, 

401
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,200
'carefully fold in your meringue.' 

402
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,400
You don't want it to be streaky. 

403
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,920
Get right down to the bottom of the bowl. 

404
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,760
That's it. 

405
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,680
So that doesn't need to be covered with anything. It doesn't get a skin on top. 

406
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,080
'Then put in the fridge to chill.' 

407
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,400
Now, I suppose you could pipe that, 

408
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,200
but I don't think I would bother to get out a piping bag, 

409
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,640
and I like the informality of spoons. 

410
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,120
So let's just take some out 

411
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,200
and just drop it in here. 

412
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,360
- Oh, it's lovely!
- Good mousse, that. 

413
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,040
Two scoops would be about right. 

414
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,840
Actually, it's rather a lot, but why not? 

415
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,080
I'm going to put three raspberries 

416
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,720
and I'm going to put a sifting of icing sugar. 

417
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,080
It's so delicate and special. 

418
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,480
So all from the same mixture, we've got a real variety. 

419
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,080
Tasting time! 

420
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,560
I'm going straight for this one in the front. 

421
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,960
I hope it's got a good snap. 

422
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,320
- Perfect!
- Try it, Mary, and tell us what you think. 

423
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,880
Oh! 

424
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,440
Crisp, crunchy, full of flavour. 

425
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,640
Lovely combination of the chocolate. 

426
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,920
I'm going to go with the chocolate one on this one, 

427
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,040
with the mousse, obviously! 

428
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,800
I'm not going to be left out. I'm dying to try the mousse. 

429
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,680
Mm! 

430
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,200
The addition of the chocolate with the mousse with these... 

431
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,120
- And what a crunch!
- It's a winner. 

432
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,160
'Week six of the Bake Off and Paul was back in charge, 

433
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,320
'but unperturbed by this, 

434
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,880
'the bakers were looking forward to a Signature bake 

435
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,960
'that allowed them to bring their personality and creative flair

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,000
'to a classic British tea loaf.' 

437
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,200
Hello, bakers. You can make any loaf you like. 

438
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,160
It could be the Welsh bara brith - apologies for the pronunciation - or the barmbrack from Ireland, 

439
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,000
or - my own favourite - the Croydon cob, 

440
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,080
which also doubles up as a weapon for close hand-to-hand combat. 

441
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,800
Paul and Mary would like you to use yeast. 

442
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,400
Any other ingredients are up to you. 

443
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,400
- So on your marks...
- Get set... 
- BOTH: Bake! 

444
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,240
This is sort of like a Chai latte. 

445
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,840
It's a spiced Indian tea drink, flavoured with cinnamon, cardamom and ginger. 

446
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,680
I like to do signature bakes that are true to me. 

447
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,640
I think Mary would've been a little bit upset and disappointed if I wasn't going to make bara brith. 

448
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,040
There are so many flavours and spices and food experiences out there 

449
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,400
that I kind of want to try them all. 

450
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,080
'For Paul's signature tea loaf, 

451
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,760
'he is making a fruit-filled giant iced bun.' 

452
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,160
We used to go to a bakery when we were kids, about 13, 14, 

453
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,080
and it wasn't even my dad's, it was another guy's bakery, 

454
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,840
but we used to buy this loaf and it was a massive iced bun. 

455
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,000
You need to make the base dough first. 

456
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,200
Could you weigh me up 400 grams of strong bread flour, please? 

457
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,640
Yes. 

458
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,760
I'm putting a teaspoon and a half of salt in there, which is about seven grams, 

459
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,760
and I've also got some fast-action yeast. 

460
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,800
That goes straight in, ten grams to the other side of the bowl. 

461
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,520
At this stage, what I'm doing is keeping the yeast and the salt apart from each other. 

462
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,360
'Then add 40 grams of caster sugar 

463
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,680
'and 40 grams of butter.' 

464
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,040
I've also got something which is used a lot in enriched doughs - milk. 

465
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,280
120ml of milk and 120ml of water. 

466
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,560
You can use all milk if you want, 

467
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,320
but the addition of the water slackens the dough and prevents that... 

468
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,720
we call it retardation of the yeast. 

469
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,960
All the milk goes in there, half the water, 

470
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,760
and get your hands in there, like a claw. 

471
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,960
Just turn it round. 

472
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,040
'Keep adding the water until the flour is incorporated 

473
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,560
'and you have a soft ball of dough.' 

474
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,760
I'm going to manipulate the dough slightly by rolling it up. 

475
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,240
Heel of the palm, fingers... 

476
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,440
..folding it, rolling it up all the way, 

477
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,520
building up the gluten levels in the dough. 

478
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,200
The impact of the sugar, what it does is, it feeds the yeast, 

479
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,000
but it tends to break it down so you've got to be careful. 

480
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,800
You've got to really work the dough to get the glutinous strands built up. 

481
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Strengthen them, basically. 

482
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,200
What the sugar takes away, your energy needs to get into it 

483
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,720
and get it going and build up that strength in it. 

484
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,960
OK, Mary, see how smooth that is now. 

485
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,920
- There you go, Mary. 
- It's totally changed texture. 

486
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,360
It's beautifully smooth, no loose flour. 

487
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,920
We'll leave that to rest for at least half an hour to an hour. 

488
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,600
Nice, smooth dough, full of gluten, it's got the protein, the yeast is beginning to activate. 

489
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,800
Pop it in the bowl, cover it up with prove wrap 

490
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,280
just to prevent a skin getting on it, that's all. 

491
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,520
'Prove the dough at room temperature for about an hour.' 

492
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,920
Gosh, that's grown a bit. 

493
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,160
What we need to do now is add the rest of the ingredients. 

494
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,680
'Weigh out 50 grams of sultanas and 60 grams of glace cherries, 

495
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,440
'then mix into these a teaspoon of cinnamon.' 

496
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,360
Don't put it straight into the dough. 

497
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,960
You'll get a more evenly distributed flavour if you coat the fruit rather than the dough. 

498
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,400
'Then grate in the zest of three large oranges.' 

499
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,400
I love the flavour of orange in this. 

500
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,320
Of course, you could always use these oranges up afterwards 

501
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,960
in a nice orange salad. 

502
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,840
- Yes.
- Slices, with a bit of Cointreau and sugar.
- Fruit salad. 

503
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,720
- Vodka...maybe?
- No! 

504
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,760
You need to incorporate that fruit - the cherries, the oranges - in, 

505
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,600
so you get the dough on the outside and you push it in. 

506
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,320
It's very elastic at this stage, isn't it? 

507
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,720
It's been resting, you see, so it's got air in it 

508
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,680
and all the gluten's there, the stretch is there. 

509
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,800
Once you've got your fruit in there, bring it out. 

510
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,440
That's your dough done. You need to shape your dough. 

511
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,800
The way they used to do it in the bakery down the road 

512
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,520
was like a torpedo sort of shape, you know? 

513
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,600
So what I'm going to do, flatten it down, 

514
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,960
fold it over, knuckles in, 

515
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,440
fold over the top and then shape. 

516
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,200
Tighten it with your fingers at the back... 

517
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,880
so you end up with one line down the middle, smooth on the top, 

518
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,560
tapered both ends. 

519
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,880
Onto the tray... 

520
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,960
Pop it in there. 

521
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,800
'Cover the dough in a plastic bag 

522
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,960
'to give the dough space to rise and stop a skin forming. 

523
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,480
'Prove it at room temperature for an hour 

524
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,840
'or until it's doubled in size.' 

525
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,000
Look at this. This has been rested for just under an hour. 

526
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,200
Let me bring it out and show you. You can see how big it's got. 

527
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,480
It's absolutely massive! 

528
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,920
It's lovely and soft, very light. 

529
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,360
It bounces, it's like a jelly. 

530
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,040
My oven's set at around 220. 

531
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,440
- That's very hot. 
- Bread bakes at a high temperature. 

532
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,200
It'll go in for about 25 minutes and it'll go a nice dark colour. 

533
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,520
Because of the sugar and butter in there, it will colour. Do not panic about the colour. 

534
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,600
Leave it in there for a minimum of that time, 

535
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,320
otherwise it's still going to be doughy inside. 

536
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,160
'But back on the Bake Off, 

537
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,120
'it wasn't just timing that caused problems.' 

538
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,200
I've got a loaf in there that doesn't look very attractive at the moment. 

539
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,200
- I think it looks nice! 
- It's a northern tea loaf that's a bit on the, er, 

540
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,560
rough and ready side! 

541
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,640
Hm... I could cry. 

542
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,160
- Oh, why?
- It's gone wrong. 

543
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,960
- Why?
- It should be higher than that. 
- Should it? 

544
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,000
I think mine's spread. 

545
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,240
It's gone... 

546
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,080
Here's our loaf. It's been out for an hour, it's nice and cool. 

547
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,800
To finish it off, which is a bit unusual, 

548
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,120
we're going to turn it into a massive iced bun. 

549
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,160
I need icing sugar and water. 

550
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,160
'You'll need around 75 grams of icing sugar to cover the loaf.' 

551
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,760
The trick is when you're mixing icing sugar - 

552
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,200
always start off with a little bit. 

553
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,840
Get your hands in there. 

554
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,440
- A little drop.
- A little bit more, always a little at a time. 

555
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,360
I suppose you could use some of that orange juice if you wanted to. 

556
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,800
- You could. 
- Because we've used the zest. 

557
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,280
What happens if the doorbell goes? 

558
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,800
"Hello?" Or "hello". 

559
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,240
- You always leave one free, Mary.
- OK. 

560
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,600
Again, that's nicely mixed in now, it's nice and smooth, 

561
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,520
- and it's ready to go on the loaf. 
- Just keep it there.
- High-five? 

562
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,200
- I'll clean my hands now. 
- I think that might be a good idea. 

563
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,400
Put your icing on it. Let it all drip down. 

564
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Think of it on a massive iced bun. 

565
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,800
So you just slice it and have it with a bit of butter. 

566
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,120
So just ice it right round the outside. 

567
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,440
Just try and take it down the side a little bit. 

568
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,160
You don't want to cover all of it, you just want to cover the crown. 

569
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,880
Now, you see, that looks like the loaf I used to buy 

570
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,680
when I was a teenager! 

571
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,200
It sets quite quick because it's a cool loaf. 

572
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,480
- You serve it sliced? 
- All you do is leave that to set. 

573
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,720
Once it's set, slice all the way down, 

574
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,600
bit of butter on it, cup of tea, job done - 

575
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,960
the perfect enriched dough. 

576
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,280
I can't wait to see that sliced straight through the cherries. 

577
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,320
Lovely. 

578
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,400
I'm going to cut you a slice of this, OK? 

579
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,600
See the structure inside? It's lovely, innit?! 

580
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,880
That looks lovely. And I can see a cherry coming through there. 

581
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,280
Now, if I cut this in half... 

582
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,920
I can see the flecks of orange through there. 

583
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,200
I've been a bit generous with the butter, but why not? 

584
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,560
Well...? 

585
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,160
It feels very naughty and I'm enjoying every mouthful! 

586
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,280
Isn't it like a massive iced bun? 

587
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,400
Well, it's an iced bun with a lot more interest in it - 

588
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,800
the cherries and the fruits, the raisins inside. 

589
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,440
Absolutely delicious! And lots of icing! 

590
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,320
- Such a treat.
- Thanks, Mary. 

591
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,040
'Now, Mary's special tip 

592
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,440
'on how to make your own butter...' 

593
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,520
I'm going to make something that I'm quite sure you've never made before. I'm going to make butter. 

594
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,000
To do this, you simply overwhip double cream. 

595
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,560
So full speed ahead until it turns 

596
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,160
and you notice a sort of cloudy liquid coming out. 

597
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,600
It's past the piping stage, it's solid, 

598
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,240
but I'm just waiting for the separation. 

599
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,840
We're nearly there. 

600
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,000
There it is. We've got butter. 

601
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,640
Now to strain it, 

602
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,360
because the buttermilk is not a flavour that you want. 

603
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,280
So just shake that to begin with to get some of that buttermilk out, 

604
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,360
and then you squeeze it 

605
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,920
until you get as much out as you can. 

606
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,360
So then run cold water through that. 

607
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,920
So all the buttermilk is washed out of that 

608
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,560
and the next process is to just put it in a cloth again 

609
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,440
and squeeze it so you get all the water out. 

610
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,640
Then you've got butter! I've got some just at that stage. 

611
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,920
Let's see what we've got inside here. Home-made butter. 

612
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,120
At this stage, you could add salt to it. 

613
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,240
If you want to be very French, you can add some coarse salt to it. 

614
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,800
It's really, I think, so good 

615
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,040
and a real treat. 

616
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,000
Mm. All that's missing is a nice dollop of marmalade. 

617
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,400
It's really good 

618
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,120
and I haven't wasted that last carton of cream that I might have thrown away. 

619
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,240
Mm! 

620
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,000
'As always, the terror-filled Technical 

621
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,680
'saw the bakers attempting to second-guess Paul. 

622
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,800
'He chose a French loaf that was technically tricky, 

623
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,360
'with an alarming level of detail and clever use of flavours.' 

624
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,560
The Technical Challenge is... 

625
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,920
an apricot couronne, OK? A traditional French sweet loaf. 

626
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,520
We need enriched dough, apricots, 

627
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,800
twisted and formed into a crown. 

628
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,840
- You have two and three quarter hours to bake it. So on your marks... 
- Get set, bake. 

629
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,760
I think it's like a twisted, sort of rounded thing. 

630
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,760
I think you do it a bit like a Swiss roll or a Chelsea bun and you split it in half. 

631
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,560
I might as well be doing this entire challenge like this, 

632
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,200
because that is how much of an idea I have. 

633
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,720
'This beautiful, traditional celebration bread, stuffed with fruit, 

634
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,920
'is a long-time favourite of Paul's.' 

635
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,200
I'm going to show you how to do it myself - properly. 

636
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,560
- Right!
- In fact, I'll mix this one by hand, I think. 

637
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,120
Can you weigh up for me 250 grams 

638
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,880
of strong white bread flour, please? 

639
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,440
- 250 grams.
- Thank you, Mary. 

640
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,760
Here we have our key ingredients again - 

641
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,720
the salt for flavour, the yeast for the rising. 

642
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,600
'Add five grams of salt 

643
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,440
'and seven grams of yeast on separate sides of the bowl. 

644
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,800
'Then add 50 grams of softened butter, one egg, 

645
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,360
'and, bit by bit, 105 millilitres of milk.' 

646
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,320
What I'm going to do is begin to crush the butter down into the flour, 

647
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,520
break up the egg in there, as well. You could do this in a mixer if you want. 

648
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,040
Gently twist the dough around, trying to pick up all the flour. 

649
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,160
I've still got some more milk to go. 

650
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,600
Now, we've already got a ball of dough here. 

651
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,960
So a bit of flour... 

652
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,320
Again, I'm using flour because it's got eggs in. 

653
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,200
It's an emulsified dough, it's got lots of butter in there, 

654
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,880
and all I'm going to do is manipulate that dough 

655
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,120
until it becomes nice, soft and elastic. 

656
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,600
'Knead your dough for around ten minutes.' 

657
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,440
While I'm doing this, would you mind chopping up into small pieces 

658
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,800
120 grams of the apricots? 

659
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,960
Now, what I've got here is my dough 

660
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,200
that's nice and soft and already elastic. 

661
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,160
All I'm going to do is pop that into a bowl, 

662
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,200
cover it in a tea towel, 

663
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,800
just to stop the air from getting to it too much. 

664
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,160
'And then set aside to prove.' 

665
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,480
- Is that about what you want? 
- That is pretty much perfect, Mary. 

666
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,520
I've got some orange juice. Because these are dried anyway, 

667
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,400
a little bit of juice just soaks that down a little bit. 

668
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,760
I'll leave these to soak for a minute. 

669
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,520
Is that fresh orange juice or the sort in a carton? 

670
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,760
You can use any juice, to be honest, but orange works well in this. 

671
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,920
'Leave the apricots to soak for 20 minutes, 

672
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,440
'then add to them 90 grams of softened butter, 

673
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,600
'70 grams of muscovado sugar 

674
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,880
'and 35 grams of plain flour.' 

675
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,400
This is a slight thickener with the flour. 

676
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,760
It's just to bring all the ingredients together. 

677
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,360
'Add the zest of an orange, 60 grams of raisins 

678
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,000
'and 65 grams of walnuts.' 

679
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,680
That's basically the filling for the couronne. 

680
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,120
There's a lot going on in there, you know. It's gorgeous. 

681
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,280
Bring back your dough, get some flour onto the bench. 

682
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,440
Look at that. See that air that's got in it already. 

683
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,200
It's bouncy, it's light. 

684
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,320
- And immediately you touch it, it drops down again.
- Yes. 

685
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,680
So to make the couronne, you need to stretch this out. 

686
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,080
So what you're going to do is roll out the dough. 

687
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,360
It looks positively alive. It keeps drooping back again. 

688
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,560
It will do. It'll stretch and then pull back on itself, but that's about right now. 

689
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,200
What you want to do is just tack... 

690
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,680
..the end of the dough to the table, as if you're making a Danish pastry. 

691
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,720
So, you're doing it like an eight-strand plait, 

692
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,120
- pressing it down, the dough on the table?
- No. 

693
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,680
It's more like a Chelsea bun or a Danish pastry. 

694
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,240
OK. I'm not going to argue with you. Get on. 

695
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,160
OK, so we've got our dough. We can get our filling. 

696
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,440
What I'm going to do is tip that onto here, 

697
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,720
like so... 

698
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,960
And then I've got a palette knife. Spread that out. 

699
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,680
'Make sure your filling is perfectly even across the whole rectangle. 

700
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,240
'That's if you've understood what a rectangle is...' 

701
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,200
So it just says, "Roll out the dough into a rectangle." 

702
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,400
"Roll up the dough and then cut it in half." 

703
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,600
How do you roll it up and cut it into two? 

704
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,480
Do you roll it that way? 

705
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,760
Am I reading this right? Oh, gosh! 

706
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,480
Near enough a rectangle to me. 

707
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,040
Then it says, 

708
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,200
"Spread the apricot mixture over the dough." 

709
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,000
It's all guesswork! SHE LAUGHS 

710
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,600
Right, now you've got to roll it up, 

711
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,320
- like you do, you know when you break the back of a roulade?
- Yes. 

712
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,400
- A bit like a Chelsea bun.
- Yes, it is. 

713
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,480
What you do is, you roll it up, 

714
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,840
keep that tacked down there so you've got some tension on it... 

715
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,680
- ..and then roll it up.
- Right. 

716
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,120
Tack all the dough so it's all joined together. 

717
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,800
This is very thin, this dough. 

718
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
You begin to roll it out a little bit, 

719
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,160
put a bit of pressure on there. 

720
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,600
And then just trim off - let's take that - 

721
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,440
square off the ends slightly. 

722
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,720
What we're going to do is cut it right down the middle, 

723
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,840
all the way... 

724
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,000
- ..like so.
- Right. 

725
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,480
Then you need to open the guts of it up. 

726
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,320
Likewise with this one. 

727
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,840
Each end - grip and then twist. 

728
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,600
Bring it round, underneath 

729
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,520
and then force it together. 

730
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,400
There is your couronne. 

731
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,840
That then goes onto... 

732
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,880
..a baking tray 

733
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,040
and is left to prove up for about 40 minutes. 

734
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,960
'But as Glenn and Howard found out, timings may differ.' 

735
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,200
Ooh, 'ello! That's a crown and a half. 

736
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,240
It's a bit big, isn't it? Yeah. 

737
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,840
I've just seen Howard's! 

738
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,480
It's not big enough. Howard's is like twice as big! 

739
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,000
- How long have we got left? 
- That's what it should look like. 

740
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,600
- How long have you got left? 
- I don't know because I don't know how long I need. 

741
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,840
I wanted to see something different. 

742
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,240
It sounds harder than it is. 

743
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,040
- It's just a Chelsea bun, by any other name.
- Yeah. 

744
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,360
Truly. 

745
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,280
There it is, Mary. This guy's been resting. 

746
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,000
- See the size of that fella now? 
- It's sort of puffed up, hasn't it? 

747
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,920
Now, it's set for 200 again, that's 180 fan. 

748
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,920
It's going to go in for about 25 minutes. 

749
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,480
Let the smells begin! 

750
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,400
There we have it, Mary, the cooled couronne. 

751
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,000
Beautiful colour. Nice, rich brown colour all the way through. 

752
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,800
The black spots are just where the sugar's come through. 

753
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,360
Now, there's three things I'm going to add to this. 

754
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,520
- The first is warmed apricot jam. 
- Is it sieved?
- It is sieved. 

755
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,040
You can buy masking glaze professionally. 

756
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,560
I know you can buy it in some stores, as well. 

757
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,600
I don't even mind if you put ordinary apricot jam over, with little bits. I hope I get the bits. 

758
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,280
Well, there's so many bits inside, why not? 

759
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,200
Loads of apricot jam, which just soaks into the dough. 

760
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,720
- It comes alive when you put that shine on.
- It's like varnishing it. 

761
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,000
The next thing I'm going to add is 200 grams of icing sugar, 

762
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,400
with 27, 28ml of water, that's it. 

763
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,760
Be quite loose with this. Try and be quite arty with it. 

764
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,600
- It's the informal finish. 
- Yes. I love this. I love this bit. 

765
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,480
You want it to be white, you want it to show up, you know? 

766
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,560
You want it to look attractive. 

767
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,760
It's zigzagged roughly all over the top. 

768
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,560
The last thing I'm going to add, I've got some flaked almonds here. 

769
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:26,600
Just crush them lightly and then just drizzle that... 

770
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,320
around the top. 

771
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,120
And there you go - a loaf that's fit for any festival. 

772
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,560
It looks wonderful for any occasion. 

773
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,280
I love the finish you've got there. 

774
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,600
It's sort of informal, but very special. 

775
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,520
I'll cut a wedge and I'll give you...give you a chance to try some. 

776
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,160
- Look at all that filling in there. 
- You packed so much filling in, 

777
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,160
I was wondering whether it would all come out, but it's kept in very well. 

778
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,360
It's absolutely packed with apricots and nuts, layer upon layer, 

779
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,160
and then that lovely finish of icing and nuts. 

780
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,840
It's all so tempting. 

781
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,800
That is wonderful. I was thinking, "We ought to put butter on it," but you couldn't possibly. 

782
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,200
There is so much fruit, so much flavour in there, 

783
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,320
it's just perfect as it is. 

784
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,320
One thing you can taste in the apricots 

785
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,560
is that orange juice which it was soaked in. 

786
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,800
There's a lot of zest in there, as well, which comes through in the dough. 

787
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,040
I think it's delicious. It's such a great loaf. 

788
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:36,520
'Now Mary's quick tip on how to give your butter a boost 

789
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,120
'with fresh herbs.' 

790
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,920
These are fresh chives. 

791
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,080
Get them into a tight bunch 

792
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,120
and then just chop them. 

793
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,880
This is salted butter. 

794
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,800
I like to put a little bit of pepper in there. 

795
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,080
Soften it down to begin with so it's workable, 

796
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:58,680
and then add all the chives in there, like that. 

797
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,160
So there it is. 

798
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,240
Make sure that it's evenly through the butter. 

799
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,280
And I'm using ice cube trays. This is a silicone, flexible one 

800
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,360
and that means it's easier to get out. 

801
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,760
So take a spoon 

802
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,800
and put spoonfuls into the ice cube tray, 

803
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,440
like that... 

804
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,000
..and then flatten it down right to the edges. 

805
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,240
If you were doing a lot, you could put it in a piping bag and it would be much quicker. 

806
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,200
And this amount is just the amount 

807
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,960
to perhaps put on the top of a steak or on fish, 

808
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,000
so it's very handy to have. 

809
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,840
So I'll put those in the freezer, 

810
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,160
and I've got some all ready there. 

811
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,120
So these are the ice cubes. 

812
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:48,160
Another way of doing it is to do it - you can tell it's frozen! - in a sort of sausage shape 

813
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,800
and then you just untwist the clingfilm and cut slices off. 

814
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,800
Maybe there's four of you for supper, four slices, 

815
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,200
then put what you don't use back in the freezer. 

816
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,920
'Mary and Paul wanted our bakers 

817
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,160
'to create something special for the sweet dough Showstopper - 

818
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,800
'European sweet buns. 

819
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,600
'With a whole continent of delicious bakes to choose from, 

820
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,840
'they could really show off.' 

821
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,600
Now, bakers, normally we'd of course send you home to bed with no supper, 

822
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,760
but it's sweet dough week and we know that these take time, 

823
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,320
so we're going to set you off on your Showstopper Challenge right now, this evening. 

824
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:38,240
We need you to make two different varieties of European sweet buns. 

825
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,280
You've got 30 minutes to start your dough, 

826
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,320
and that's in advance of a four-hour bake tomorrow. 

827
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,840
- So on your marks...
- Get set... 
- BOTH: Bake! 

828
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:56,480
Tomorrow, I'm making a couple of Scandinavian buns. 

829
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,360
When I was thinking about flavours, I wanted something rich. 

830
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,840
I just thought, "Let's use a bit of booze." 

831
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,760
I'm making peachy buns. 

832
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,280
The peachy buns have got pieces of peach inside, 

833
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,520
wrapped in a marzipan. 

834
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,840
You can't always be good in life. You've got to go naughty sometimes. 

835
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,240
Hopefully, it'll have a good night! 

836
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,320
'Paul's decided to make one of France's best-loved sweet breads - 

837
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,200
'the famous brioche tete. 

838
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,320
'He's going to show us just how easy it can be to make it at home.' 

839
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,320
I'm going to show you how to make a brioche tete. 

840
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:41,720
- Could you weigh me up 500 grams of strong white bread flour, please, Mary?
- All right. 

841
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:46,160
We gave the option to the bakers of using half an hour the day before to prepare the dough. 

842
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,840
I'm going to be using a mixer, because to make a brioche 

843
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,000
you need to mix the dough and then add all the butter at the end. 

844
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,600
So overnight, we chill it down, the butter hardens 

845
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,080
and then you can shape it into whatever way you want. 

846
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,480
- Is that 500?
- Exactly.
- Thank you. 

847
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,360
Can I have 50 grams of caster sugar, as well, please, Mary? 

848
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,320
Sugar's integral in brioche. 

849
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,200
It's inherently a very sweet dough. 

850
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:16,000
'To this, add seven grams of salt and ten grams of yeast. 

851
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,320
'Then add 140 millilitres of milk and five eggs.' 

852
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:25,480
It's a lot of eggs. It's nearly an egg to every 100 gram of flour. That's a lot. 

853
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,120
We start the mix off. 

854
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,600
Mix this together and form a paste. Let it become glutinous so it becomes stretchy. 

855
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,160
Leave it in there for about five minutes to develop the dough. 

856
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,000
'If you're making the dough by hand, 

857
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,240
'you'll need to mix it for around eight minutes to get the same results.' 

858
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,320
That's coming together nicely now. 

859
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,200
Now it's beginning to bind together as a lump, 

860
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,240
you just turn it up. 

861
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,200
- It's hard work, this baking, isn't it?
- I'm pleased to see you using a machine! 

862
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,480
It's not ready. You can still see the mottled effect of the dough inside. 

863
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,560
It's beginning to stretch now, see? But it's breaking apart too quickly. 

864
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,640
What we're trying to do is get that to be really smooth, 

865
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,240
so we're going to mix it a little bit longer. 

866
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:17,640
The more you work it, the smoother and softer and elastic it gets. 

867
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,920
OK. See how soft that is now and stretchy? 

868
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,640
I've been mixing that for about six minutes 

869
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,000
and it's ready now for the butter to go in. 

870
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,800
Pass me the butter, please. There's 250 grams of softened butter going into this. 

871
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:35,000
- All that?
- Yes. So it's basically a whole block of softened butter. 

872
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,440
It goes right in there, right in the middle of the dough. 

873
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,520
What we're going to do is incorporate that butter. 

874
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,800
'Mix for another six minutes, or ten minutes by hand, 

875
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,160
'until you have smooth and silky dough.' 

876
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,560
Have a look at that. See how glossy it's gone. 

877
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:55,800
That dough is soft, smooth, shiny, but you can't work it, look. 

878
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,520
- It sticks to your hand.
- It's a lump. You could never mould that.
- No. 

879
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,280
So to counter that, we pop it in the bowl. 

880
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,560
You can see how lovely and glossy this is, and stretchy. It's perfect brioche dough. 

881
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,600
If you just wrap that up for me, please. 

882
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,520
Now that needs to go into the fridge overnight, 

883
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,280
or for a minimum of eight hours, just to harden that butter. 

884
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,760
It will rise the dough slightly in the fridge, 

885
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,800
and it will ferment, so it will give it more flavour, as well. 

886
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,080
Obviously, we'll be able to use it, because at the moment it's a mess. 

887
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:31,040
- So are you, so get washed.
- Exactly. 
- I'll put this in the fridge.
- Thanks. 

888
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,440
'Having had the night to prove their dough, the bakers returned to the tent.' 

889
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,480
I needed it to kind of double in size. 

890
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,880
It has, although it's a little bit, I think, too cold in that fridge, actually. 

891
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,760
'This was a real opportunity to show off their baking 

892
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,560
- 'and mastery of flavours...' 
- I'm happy with it. 

893
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:53,000
'..with everyone making something different.' 

894
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,400
I can't get it out! 

895
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,640
It's wedged in. 

896
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,880
It did look a little bit rough when I took it out of the fridge. 

897
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:08,080
It looks as if it had a bad night, but, er, it should be OK. 

898
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,680
- That's risen!
- It rises a lot. 

899
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,240
What you've got is that hard dough, which now we can manipulate. 

900
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,760
What we've got here is six brioche moulds. 

901
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,080
Now, each piece you need to roll out. 

902
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:27,080
You can manipulate this dough now. You couldn't do yesterday, because it was like liquid. 

903
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,680
- It would stick to your hands yesterday.
- Precisely. 

904
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,240
Cut off the equivalent... 

905
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,440
It works out at 50 grams, 50 grams per ball. 

906
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,160
Now, each piece needs one small piece, 

907
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,760
which is the little tete - or head - on the top, and the main body of it. 

908
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,440
So you rip off roughly about six. 

909
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,840
So you've got your dough, make a cage 

910
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,600
and then move it very quickly in the flour and it smoothes it off. 

911
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,280
OK, likewise with this one - 

912
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,040
little bit of flour, spin it round, and there it is. 

913
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:03,040
Push down a little bit on the top, and it will get sticky anyway, 

914
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,640
take your little piece, pop on top so it looks like a cottage loaf. 

915
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,080
That then goes inside the mould... over there. 

916
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:15,560
You don't have to butter the moulds because they're lined and nonstick, 

917
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,840
and because there's so much butter in it, it's almost self-greasing. 

918
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,560
These need to prove up now. It's a slow prove. 

919
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,400
That's got butter in it, so you need to rise the dough, 

920
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,920
but at the same time not melt the butter. 

921
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,400
Leave it at an ambient temperature. 

922
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,360
Again, grab a bag, 

923
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,680
give a little bit of gap for them to grow. 

924
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,240
Those will rise for half an hour to an hour, 

925
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,400
depending on the temperature of your kitchen, 

926
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,640
and then we'll pop them in the oven, but for now, we'll leave them alone. 

927
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:50,000
- Are you waiting for them to rise to the top of the tin or...? 
- They'll grow to just below that. 

928
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,960
They've got a lot of growing to do. They'll at least double in size. 

929
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,400
- So we leave them right here on the worktop?
- Yes. 

930
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,720
- We can go and have a cup of tea. 
- Come on. 

931
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,920
Let's go and have a game of darts, Mary. 

932
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,120
'Leave to prove at room temperature 

933
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,320
'for around 45 minutes.' 

934
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,400
You can smell the butter. 

935
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,560
These are really soft and light. 

936
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:19,480
Touch them really lightly, because see how delicate they are? 

937
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,200
What I'm going to do is egg-wash them. 

938
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,240
Brush it well on the top and on top of the head. 

939
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,760
Do you have to be very careful not to drop that wash down the side? 

940
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,200
You can see that I'm staying on the top, 

941
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,000
- because what happens is... Very clever, Mary!
- I know. 

942
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,280
..if you get too much egg wash down the side, 

943
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,760
the dough then bonds itself to the inside of the mould. 

944
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,560
- And we won't get it out! 
- We won't get the thing out, correct. 

945
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:50,640
That's ready to go in the oven. It's set at 200, or 180 fan. 

946
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,040
In they go. 

947
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,560
I'm happy with those, but those are monsters so... 

948
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,240
- How beastly are they?
- Very. 

949
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,520
There's going to be no panic. 

950
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,240
Who am I kidding?! 

951
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,760
Oh, no! That was a crap idea. 

952
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,040
Look at those, Mary. 

953
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,920
They look absolutely perfect! 

954
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,000
I'm going to take these out of here. They should come out quite easily. 

955
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,240
They're a bit hot. 

956
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,960
You were pretty careful about not letting the egg wash go down onto the tin, 

957
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,080
because they wouldn't come out then so easily. 

958
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,800
It's classic brioche tete, served at breakfast time, 

959
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,720
cut and toasted. 

960
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,000
That is one of my favourite breakfast dishes. 

961
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,360
I think they're just lovely just warm, 

962
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,200
with lots more butter, 

963
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,600
little bit of marmalade on the side, lovely! 

964
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,080
Here you go, then, Mary, the brioches tetes. 

965
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,240
They're a beautiful, golden-brown, buttery, 

966
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,360
very traditional for breakfast, 

967
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:06,000
- and I'd love you to try one. 
- I'm dying to try one. Come on. 

968
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,960
It's lovely and light. They're like little clouds. 

969
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,560
I'll cut this one in half. 

970
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:21,080
Look at that! Beautiful and light inside. 

971
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:24,160
The smell is incredible when you first open it up. 

972
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,960
I'll give you that one. 

973
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,040
Now, over here, you need to have a little bit of butter on there, as well. 

974
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:34,280
It just looks so soft and lovely! 

975
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,240
Mm! 

976
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,320
It's so good. The smell, it's just pure buttery smell. 

977
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,800
So next time, Mary, we're getting to the final challenges, 

978
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,320
where we've ranked them up and they've got harder and harder, 

979
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,160
and we're going to be covering pastry, alternative 

980
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,360
and, of course, tricky French. 

981
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,760
I've got some very special recipes. 

982
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,280
I'm practising like mad so I make them perfect! 

983
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,280
Are you trying to tell me, Miss Berry, 

984
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,440
that you actually go home and practise all the recipes for this? 

985
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,800
I have a jolly good try! 

986
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,720
Nonsense! You know them off the top of your head! 

987
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:20,080
'Next time, Mary and Paul take on five challenges from the last weeks of the Bake Off.' 

988
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,920
From pastry to French Week, 

989
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,360
and even some ideas from the final programme. 

990
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,760
'Our king and queen of cakes will guide you through their favourite Signature, 

991
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,760
'Technical and Showstopper bakes.' 

992
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,640
The things that we show you how to make are quite tricky, 

993
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,080
but just bear with me and watch what I do, 

994
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:44,160
because I'm trying to impart what I have learnt over the years, over to you guys. 

995
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,960
'They'll give you all the knowledge you need 

996
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,840
'to get perfect results every time.' 

997
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,360
- Bit of all right! 
- I'll have some more of that, yeah! 

998
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,600
'Paul shows us how to spin pizza like a pro... 

999
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,800
'and Mary has a handy tip to tell a good egg from a bad. 

1000
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,040
'Join us next time 

1001
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,440
'for The Great British Bake Off Masterclass.' 

1002
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,360
This gives us an opportunity to do some very special bakes 

1003
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,880
that you will be able to impress your family with in your own kitchen. 

1004
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,400
If you're that good, we'll see you on Bake Off!
