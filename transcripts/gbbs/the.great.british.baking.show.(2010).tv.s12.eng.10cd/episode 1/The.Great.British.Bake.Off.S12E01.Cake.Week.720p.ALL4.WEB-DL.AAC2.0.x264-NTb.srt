BIRDSONG

The best home bakers from across the
country applied in their thousands.

8
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,280
Just 12 have made it...

9
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,840
Oh, blimey. Here we go.

10
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
Good luck, everyone!

11
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,080
..to our Bake Off bubble.

12
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,280
When you're telling people
that you're going away,

13
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,640
absolutely nobody's guessed where I'm going.

14
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,320
I mean, what's wrong with my cakes?

15
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,800
I wasn't gonna apply for Bake Off

16
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,480
and my sister was like,
"Just apply."

17
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,920
I was like, "Why did you tell me
to apply? Because I got through."

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,360
When we look in the tent,
it's the feeling you get

19
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
when you walk for the first
time into the... the Sistine Chapel.

20
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,920
Every aspect of their
baking skills will be tested...

21
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,640
On your marks... in 30...

22
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,200
Get set.
..brand-new challenges.

23
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,320
Bake! We're on the way.
Good luck in there.

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,040
My German brain gets active
when I make sweet stuff.

25
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,560
♪ More chocolate! ♪

26
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,160
I just enjoy feeding people
because that's what Greek people do.

27
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,960
Everything they create will be
judged by Prue Leith...

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,840
Don't wanna get emotional.
That's so delicious!

29
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,320
..and Paul Hollywood.
Don't look into his eyes.

30
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,760
I'm gonna stare him down.
Don't stare Paul down.

31
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
No.

32
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,360
We begin with incredible cakes.

33
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,120
Oh, my God! That's going in my eye.
Come on!

34
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,000
With a delicious childhood
favourite...

35
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,480
Cos they're mini,
you've got to get it really tight.

36
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
That's panicked me.

37
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,280
..one of the all-time
tea-time classics...

38
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,840
It doesn't wanna come off.
This is a joke!

39
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,960
It's very gooey. Ooh!

40
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,320
..and mind-bending showstoppers...

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,840
I feel sick.
..that defy the laws of gravity.

42
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,200
To me, to you. To you.
The cake is on the move, people.

43
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,360
To me. To you.
I'm so scared it's gonna fall.

44
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,440
Breathe in. Ah.

45
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,880
Worst thing that could happen
is that I will be walking towards

46
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,080
the judges and I will trip over
and go headfirst into my own cake.

47
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,240
SHATTERING Oh! Oh, my God!

48
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Oh, no.

49
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,640
Once again, we've
pitched our tent in the stunning

50
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,800
grounds of Down Hall, and our fresh
bubble of bakers are about to

51
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,040
face three cake-based challenges,

52
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,600
after which one of them will be
crowned Star Baker

53
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,040
and another will have to leave
the competition.

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,840
Bakers, welcome to the tent.
This is so exciting.

55
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,160
The winner of the 2021 Bake Off
is actually in this tent.

56
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,280
Whoa. How about that?

57
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,560
By the same token, the first person
to go home is also in this tent.

58
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,680
LAUGHTER It's none of you, don't worry.

59
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,520
It's Paul.

60
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,800
For your first Signature Challenge,
the judges would like you to

61
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,600
bake 12 decorative mini rolls.

62
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,720
These need to be your take on
mini rolls, so the type of sponge,

63
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,680
the flavours and the fillings
is entirely up to you.

64
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,120
You have two hours.

65
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,000
On your marks... Get set...

66
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,040
Bake!

67
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,040
Here we go,
it's lovely to start it, actually.

68
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,280
This is really happening, innit?
It's still shocking.

69
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,600
It's still not settled in yet.

70
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,160
I think I just need to put myself
back in my kitchen

71
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,000
and just get on with it.

72
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,640
I feel sick. Why did I apply
for this? What is wrong with me?

73
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,360
The mini roll packs a punch
in such a small little cake.

74
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,960
Think of the sponge,
think of the filling

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,560
and think of the overall look.

76
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,600
They have to be very elegant,
perfect swirl of filling inside.

77
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,160
And most of all
they must be delicious.

78
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,440
If the bakers get their timing
all wrong, there will be issues.

79
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,040
Cos as they put their filling
into a warm sponge,

80
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,040
it will collapse, ooze out.

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,040
It's the first time the bakers have
really got to impress us

82
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,280
and really show us what they can do.

83
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,200
Good morning. Good morning.
Hello, Crystelle.

84
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,600
Hi. Hello. Hi, how are you doing?

85
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,840
I want to know
about your mini rolls.

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,200
It's a chai-flavoured sponge,
so I've got jaggery. So jaggery's

87
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,760
like an unrefined sugar and it's
actually from Goa. So my grandma

88
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,240
gave me loads of jaggery from Goa,
so I'm putting that in my sponge.

89
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,480
Crystelle is a client
relationship manager

90
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,040
and lives in north London
with her parents and sisters.

91
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,680
But she's not been
able to see her nana Julie

92
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,440
and give her a hug for over a year.

93
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,200
Nana Julie's jaggery will sweeten
her coconut and chai tea mini rolls,

94
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,520
flavoured with cloves, ginger,
cinnamon and cardamom.

95
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,720
PAUL: That's strong, punchy
flavours for a mini roll.

96
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,440
What is so lovely is
the idea of coconut and chai. Yeah.

97
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,240
I've never had those two together.

98
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,320
Yeah. And I think
that might be wonderful.

99
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,080
Well, thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Good luck.

100
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,320
NOEL: Crystelle's not the only baker
paying

101
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,240
tribute to their family heritage.
I am from the Black Forest and, uh,

102
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,920
Black Forest gateau
has always been a favourite.

103
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,320
Jurgen works in IT
and with his wife Sophia

104
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,800
and son Benjamin loves to
play his trombone to serenade

105
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,000
the Brighton waterfront...

106
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,880
..along with his pet rabbit
Humphrey.

107
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,000
Great.

108
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,640
His classic Black Forest mini roll
will have a chocolate genoise sponge

109
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,400
filled with kirsch cream
and sour cherries.

110
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,160
Hello, there, Jurgen, how are you?

111
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,120
Hi, Matt, yes, I'm very well,
thank you.

112
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,640
You're a musical man. Yes. I thought
you might appreciate, uh, me

113
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,200
singing the theme
to the Flintstones in German.

114
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,560
I would. Here we go. Yeah.

Wilhelmina! What do you think?

127
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,000
Great, I haven't heard that in ages.

128
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,760
I translated it myself. Hmm!

129
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,400
I can't quite remember the text.

130
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,680
Well... But...

131
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,240
I wouldn't call it a text.

132
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,040
So my theme is
a Black Forest mini roll.

133
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm a bit worried about Jurgen
doing it

134
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,480
cos I think he said
he has family from the Black Forest.

135
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,400
So I'm thinking
he probably knows his stuff.

136
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,360
Tom and his family
are from Maidstone, in Kent

137
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,640
and run a model railway business.

138
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,120
Got people waiting for the train.

139
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,920
He'll fill his Black Forest
mini rolls with a cherry jam

140
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,240
before coating them
in thick dark chocolate.

141
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,480
Hi, Tom. You seem like you're
enjoying yourself.

142
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,680
Yeah, I mean, if I'm going to go
home week one, I need to enjoy
myself.

143
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,280
You are not going home week one.

144
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,920
You've got a good vibe and I think

145
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,120
your energy's gonna make it happen
for you.

146
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,400
Awesome. Thank you very much.
So I sound like a tarot reader.

147
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,280
You do. I didn't wanna say it.

148
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,320
You know when someone says
you've got a good vibe that means

149
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,800
you're not very good at baking.
Yeah!

150
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,520
Vibe's good, cakes taste like...

151
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,120
I am not copying Tom,
I am doing my own Black Forest.

152
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,600
Wild-swimming enthusiast
Amanda is a mum of two

153
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,840
and works as a detective
for the Metropolitan Police.

154
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,920
Not too cold, but cold enough.

155
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,240
She's adding a coffee twist to a
squad of cherry-topped mini rolls

156
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,640
that should set her apart
from her Black Forest rivals.

157
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,280
I thought I'd make them
standing up like little soldiers.

158
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,600
Yeah, like cherry soldiers
I'm gonna call them.

159
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,280
And it's gonna stand up?

160
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,880
They did stand up at home. Good.

161
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,840
Unless the bakers create
a sponge that's light and soft...

162
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,560
My sponge is a genoise
and it's getting beautiful volume.

163
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,040
..their mini rolls won't roll.

164
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,040
I am making carrot cake mini rolls.

165
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,840
And Rochica is risking
an unconventional batter.

166
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,240
I have spelt flour for my dad

167
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,040
because these rolls
were inspired by him.

168
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,680
Rochica works in HR and loves
to escape the home office to see

169
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,840
her nieces
and nephews with her dad Colin.

170
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
Dad!

171
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,840
LAUGHTER

172
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,640
Cinnamon and vanilla cream will
fill Colin's favourite spelt flour

173
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,520
carrot cake mini rolls.

174
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,400
He really enjoys my bakes
with spelt flour in it.

175
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,920
He's quite health conscious.

176
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,520
Whilst Rochica is rolling with
an unusual flour...

177
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,680
One, two, three.

178
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,000
..Maggie has decided not to
use any at all...

179
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,720
19 and 20.

180
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,440
..choosing, instead,
a tricky meringue-based batter.

181
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,360
This is a very dull time -
17, 18, 19, 20.

182
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,600
It's 20 seconds between every
spoonful.

183
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,160
George, sing for me.
I'm a terrible singer, Maggie.

184
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,520
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,000
Sports fanatic Maggie is a retired
midwife from Poole in Dorset

186
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,840
and has been baking
for over 60 years.

187
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,720
I was never,
ever going to reach that.

188
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,880
I still think I'm 20.

189
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,440
She plans to top her light flourless
chocolate orange mini rolls

190
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,520
with heavenly milk chocolate angels.

191
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,440
It's quite a difficult sponge
to do, a flourless one.

192
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,360
Yeah. Because it's very mousse-y
and it's sticky and it...

193
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,680
Yes, but it's very delicious
when it's right.

194
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,000
It's very delicious when it's right.

195
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,920
Have you practised this, Prue?
Um, Maggie.

196
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,480
Don't you start!
Were you separated at birth?

197
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
LAUGHTER

198
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
I think,
I think you're gonna do well.

199
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
We can sort him out,
we can sort him out.

200
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,520
Whilst Prue, I mean
Maggie, is going flourless...

201
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,520
This is aquafaba
that I've just whisked up.

202
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,920
..Freya is going dairy-free.

203
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,000
I have tried about
15 swiss roll recipes.

204
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,680
Uh, cried at about 12.

205
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,560
19-year-old Freya is a psychology
student from Scarborough.

206
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,000
She went vegan 18 months ago.

207
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,840
That is a very big circle.

208
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,160
Honestly, all I do
is get insults around here.

209
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,240
Her lemon and raspberry mini rolls
will be filled with a vegan

210
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,360
lemon meringue buttercream.
Are you the youngest in here?

211
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,040
Yeah. I think I'm the youngest
by... How old are you?

212
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,640
How old are you, 12? I'm... I'm 19.

213
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,760
You know there's
a Junior Bake Off, right?

214
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,560
So Junior Bake Off said no, they put
you into the main one,

215
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,800
which is a bit unfair.
Yeah. But fingers crossed.

216
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,200
There's always the
technical and the showstopper.

217
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,480
And those are generally easy, so...
Yeah, they sound way better, eh?

218
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,200
Good luck. Here we go.

219
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,400
The sooner the mini roll sponges
are baked,

220
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,720
the longer they'll have to cool.

221
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,120
We're on the way.

222
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Please be good to me.

223
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,520
Nine minutes. Is the plan.

224
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
Ten minutes and counting.

225
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,800
If the bakers
attempt to fill a warm sponge...

226
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,920
I'm starting to panic
cos I can hear everyone putting

227
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,520
stuff in the oven
and I've got nothing.

228
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,000
..their first-ever Signature Bake
will end in collapse.

229
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,640
Oh, my God - my oven door was open.

230
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,640
Oh. BLEEP!

231
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,480
George works with carers and adults

232
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,840
with learning disabilities
in north London.

233
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,120
He loves to recreate
the Greek Cypriot bakes

234
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,400
he grew up with at home
with his wife Oz,

235
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,840
his kids Nasis, Alarah and Elise
and their dog Ely.

236
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,040
Who's gonna do the washing-up?

237
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,560
DOG WHIMPERS

238
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,120
His milk chocolate mini rolls will
be filled with a hazelnut bavarois.

239
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,200
While the oven's warming up

240
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,120
I'll move onto something else cos
I need to.

241
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
George isn't the only one
running late.

242
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,000
Why are you at this stage
and not further down the line?

243
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,480
Clearly, just a slow person.

244
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,600
There's a plan behind this pattern.

245
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,120
Yeah, so it is meant to be
a giraffe and they're based on

246
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,200
going to Chester Zoo with my family.

247
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,040
You've got a dog, haven't you? Yeah.

248
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,160
What's your dog called?
Prudence.

249
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,400
Prudence. Prudence.

250
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,080
Yeah, well, I've got
photos of yous all on my mixer.

251
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,280
Paul, you've got a six-pack. I know!

252
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,480
LAUGHTER

253
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,120
Lizzie is from Liverpool and
when she's not at home baking with

254
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
the judges,
she builds luxury cars for a living.

255
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,760
Her giraffe print coffee sponge

256
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,200
will be rolled around a tahini
caramel filling.

257
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,680
Me and you have
got our wardrobes confused.

258
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,760
I mean, I think
this could be an issue.

259
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,480
We can just share clothes.
If I last more than one week.

260
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,920
I am a bit behind.
Don't worry about that so much.

261
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,640
I feel like it's gonna
look good cos you've got style.

262
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,240
Oh, have you seen my shoes?

263
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,080
Ears and tail.
I do like those shoes.

264
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,000
Don't let anyone see how
big my heels are, I'm like Prince.

265
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,600
I take these off, you will only see
the top of my head.

266
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,440
I've gotta go apparently cos
apparently you need

267
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,280
to get on with some baking.
This is a baking show. Good luck.

268
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
See ya.

269
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,200
Bakers. You are halfway through.

270
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,720
Can't be halfway?

271
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,240
The competition - you slept through
a couple of episodes.

272
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,200
LAUGHTER

273
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,320
Straight in the oven.

274
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,600
I think I'll be able to breathe
once I've got that done.

275
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,160
Oh, that's my timer.

276
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,800
Here we go -
right, let's check this guy out.

277
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,000
Can't see, mind you. Oh.

278
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,200
When baking thin
and fragile sponges...

279
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,600
It's a bit spongey but I'd
just like another couple of minutes.

280
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,400
..every second counts.
No, one more minute.

281
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,200
Just a fraction
too long in the oven...

282
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,880
It's coming out in about a minute.

283
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,680
..when rolled,
they'll crack and fall apart.

284
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,080
Now I'm gonna turn this out.

285
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,960
Please be careful,
I don't wanna burn any of you lot.
So do you enjoy baking?

286
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,160
Well, I've only been baking 12
months. Right. So I'm a proper...

287
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,440
Oh, my goodness... lockdown baker.

288
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,400
Chigs is a telephone
sales manager from Leicester.

289
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,960
And as well as baking,
lockdown has seen him rock climbing,

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,480
playing guitar, decorating his house
and cooking with his mum Joyti.

291
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,880
His marbled chocolate and vanilla
sponge will be filled

292
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,880
with a strawberry Chantilly cream.

293
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,040
The first Bake Off that I was
a judge for, the winner had only

294
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,040
been baking for six months. Oh, wow!

295
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,200
It's not necessarily
a handicap. Exactly.

296
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,120
In the last series, the winner had
only been baking for 13 or 14 years.

297
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,200
Oh, there you go, then!

298
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,400
I'm waiting on my sponges.

299
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,320
Helpless, aren't you?
A sitting duck.

300
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,080
Whilst the wait continues for Lizzie
and George

301
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,360
with sponges cooling,

302
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,720
the rest of the bakers still need to
perfect their fillings.

303
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,560
How are you?
Are you about to have a swig?

304
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,280
Has it got that bad already?

305
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,240
No, this is the syrup,
that's the stuff you wanna swig.

306
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,360
That's the stuff. Yeah.
Are you drunk yet? I am.

307
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,800
Are you? No, I'm not really.

308
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,080
Good on you. Course I'm not,
you weren't sure then!

309
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,600
I was just thinking, "Lucky you."

310
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,800
LAUGHTER

311
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,560
And Giuseppe's filling is
a taste of home.

312
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,760
I'm trying to translate
Italian flavours into whatever I'm

313
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,920
putting together.

314
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,840
That's part of my heritage,
that's... that's what I do best.

315
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,560
Giuseppe works as an engineer
in Bristol and passes on his Italian

316
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,480
culinary heritage to his three sons,
Alberto, Ricardo and Georgio.

317
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,760
No, no, no, don't pull it.

318
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,640
We still have to eat it.
This is dinner, amore.

319
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,840
He's filling his almond and
orange sponges with ricotta cheese

320
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,240
flavoured with
a potent orange blossom water.

321
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,160
Hopefully balanced enough
not to blow anybody's heads off.

322
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,960
But Jairzeno isn't holding back.

323
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,800
20 passion fruit to
make some passion fruit caramel.

324
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,040
Originally from Trinidad,
Jairzeno is a finance manager living

325
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,720
in south London with his partner
Graham and their greyhound Maxie.

326
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,080
Shall we find some squirrels?

327
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,760
His passion fruit caramel
buttercream will fill a lime

328
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,960
and chilli sponge.

329
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,120
How far do you think you can
go in the competition?

330
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,840
Would I like to go all the way? Yes.

331
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,840
You would? Yes.

332
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,200
That's what I wanna hear.
Yes. Don't you worry!

333
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,920
I'll take care of the rest. Oh, OK.

334
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,640
I'll take them out one by one, OK?

335
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,400
Who do you want to go first?

336
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,640
Freya? Well, that's harsh.
I wasn't expecting that.

337
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,680
No, no comment.

338
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
LAUGHTER

339
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,800
Bakers, you have had half an hour.

340
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,160
No, no, no.
They've got half an hour.

341
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh, you've got half an hour left.
That makes more sense.

342
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,320
Lovely, thank you very much.

343
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,200
Same difference, isn't it? No. Oh.

344
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,600
That's panicked me.
So I'm, like, miles behind.

345
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,120
I hope that these cool in time.

346
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,640
As George
and Lizzie finally begin cooling...

347
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,160
Come on, come on, come on. Ah!

348
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,440
For the rest of the bakers,
it's the moment of truth.

349
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,680
It is the orange buttercream.
I've hopefully cooled the sponges

350
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,800
enough so it won't melt.

351
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,040
The cherries go on the edge.

352
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,680
As a child, if in any of the cafes
this filling was missing

353
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,520
I was a very unhappy child.

354
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,200
That's a strong smell, Jurgen.

355
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,840
What is that? Kirsch syrup. Wow.

356
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
BLOWS AIR THROUGH LIPS

357
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,880
Compose myself.

358
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,240
Right, come on, just do it.

359
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,240
Cos they're mini, you've got to
get it really tight.

360
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,160
Paul and Prue have demanded
a perfectly defined swirl.

361
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,120
I try to roll them like sushi.

362
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,520
We often make sushi at home.

363
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,240
But if the sponge is even
a fraction overbaked...

364
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,360
Come on!

365
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,640
..it will split.

366
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,240
It can't crack, cos if it cracks

367
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,200
then you don't get your perfect
swirl.

368
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,280
Not perfect, but whatever.

369
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
SHE SIGHS

370
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,480
I'm trying to keep it
all in one piece.

371
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,320
Swirl is coming out nicely.

372
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,360
There's a swirl.
Stay, stay, stay, stay.

373
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,840
Oh, there is a crack.

374
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,680
I'm gonna hide that.
Quite a lot of cracking.

375
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,880
Which is why I'm covering
them in something to make them

376
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,320
a bit more attractive. This is the
fiddly bit cos I do not like

377
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,640
doing equal measurements on
anything. We need a ruler.

378
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,120
Anyone got a ruler? This is the best
tool of an engineer - a ruler.

379
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,760
They should be
exactly eight centimetres each.

380
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,520
How long have we got?

381
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,840
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes
until the end of this challenge. Ah!

382
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,480
We haven't got much time left.

383
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,280
It's a bit hotter than what
I would like

384
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,200
but I ain't got time to mess around.
There you go.

385
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,840
The sickness is setting in.

386
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,320
I feel like it's just hit me
like a slap in the face.

387
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,480
Oy, yai, yai. Come on!

388
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,200
Roll. Oh.

389
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,720
How are you? All over the place
at the moment. Are you?

390
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,920
When you have disasters at home,
it doesn't really matter.

391
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,920
But here, it's
just like pressure's on.

392
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,800
I'm gonna leave you
cos that looks really tricky.

393
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,040
Good luck, George, use the Force.
Yeah, I will.

394
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,400
The caramel's
probably gonna be running out.

395
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,520
The coffee cream's gonna melt.

396
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,080
Oh!

397
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,360
You've come right at the right
moment if you like chocolate.

398
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,640
I do like chocolate. Cos this is
about to go all over those.

399
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,800
All right, here we go. This is what
I call covering up the cracks.

400
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,000
They're not too bad.

401
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,720
Covering the cracks up with
chocolate

402
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,800
so they won't know any different.
I'm dipping one end.

403
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,440
I didn't want to coat it entirely
cos I like to see the swirl.

404
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,840
Oh, man. They taste wicked.

405
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,960
But they look like...

406
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,160
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

407
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,360
Perfect.

408
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,440
Should get there in five.

409
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,600
My soldiers are falling over.
Covering the cracks, round two.

410
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,680
What are you doing? Is this baking?
Yes. Stop it.

411
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,040
Of course it's baking.
Are you just making these hairy?

412
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,760
Please help me, someone.

413
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,920
More chocolate. A few minutes to go,
people are flapping

414
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,760
but you're cool as a cucumber.
What's cucumber in Italian?

415
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,360
Cetriolo. You're cool as a...

416
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,320
A cetriolo... cucumber.

417
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,680
Now, little angels. Ah!

418
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,600
This has lost its body.

419
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,760
My hands are too hot. Ah.

420
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,880
Oh, another broken angel.
Oh, no.

421
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,080
Well, you might just
have to have one angel.

422
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,120
There's caramel everywhere.

423
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,000
Stick some flowers on it
and hopefully cover up all my sins.

424
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,320
These are very, very drunk.

425
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,960
So the photos are me and me family

426
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,400
when we go to the zoo every
Christmas. I'm shaking, I'm shaking.

427
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,760
How many seconds?

428
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,440
Bakers, you have one minute left.

429
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,280
So this is my jaggery whipped cream.

430
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,240
This is me trying to be fancy.

431
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,840
Have some gooeyness.

432
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,240
Right, that will have to do.

433
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,560
Bakers, your time is up.

434
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,200
Ah! Can I walk out now?

435
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,280
Ah,
it's dripping on everyone's faces.

436
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,680
Oh, my white chocolate ganache is
dripping off my stool.

437
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
Ah!

438
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,520
That's cake carnage.

439
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,800
Oh, no, your floor,
the coconut on the floor.

440
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,480
My mum is gonna kill me.

441
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,160
She was like,
"Crystelle, please be neat."

442
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Oh, God.

443
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,120
Our 12 new bakers

444
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,480
and their mini rolls are
about to face Paul

445
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,800
and Prue for the very first time.

446
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,200
Hello, Maggie. Hello.
Still smiling I see.

447
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,480
One has to.

448
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,480
I wanted them all to have a little
angel on top,

449
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,400
but I'm afraid I must admit to
having the shakes

450
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,080
and they kept
losing their wings.

451
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,680
Well, one of them's got it.

452
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,920
The chocolate is a little bit rough
and ready.

453
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,480
You've got a nice little
swirl in there, actually.

454
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,640
I think your sponge is excellent.
Thank you so much.

455
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,000
Texture of it's lovely.
Great flavour.

456
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,040
You couldn't eat a lot of it,
because it is so rich.

457
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,800
The cocoa content's quite high.
Yes.

458
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,320
My husband would find this far
too much chocolate.

459
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,640
He'd like a milk chocolate.
Oh! Oh, for heaven's sake.

460
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,280
He likes adulterated chocolate.

461
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,520
This is pure... This is
chocolate! ..dark.

462
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,840
Loving listening to you
and Prue chat.

463
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,720
I've never felt more like a chimney
sweep in all my life.

464
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,120
Lawks! Come on, let's go, Paul,
let's go.

465
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,040
It's like a Dickens novel.

466
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,680
There's a sort of fold in there,

467
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,000
not a swirl.

468
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,800
The bitterness from the sugar
is perfect.

469
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,960
And the passion fruit is
absolutely delicious.

470
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,720
Is it so worth the calories.

471
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,160
That is wonderful.

472
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,040
They are a bit uneven.

473
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,360
I think they're a little bit drunk.

474
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,080
I don't think that's a swirl.
No. It's a blob.

475
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,280
Cherry's not strong enough,
cos it blended so much

476
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,800
with a little bit of coffee in
there.

477
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,000
Nice lot of booze,
though. I like the booze.

478
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,880
Not much of a mini roll.
You know, it's not at all bad,

479
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,200
because you have got
a bit of a swirl. Thank you.

480
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,560
The texture of the cake is lovely.
Thank you very much.

481
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
But you're not getting
enough of the cherry coming through.

482
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,640
They're pretty neat.
I think they look rather attractive.

483
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,960
Oh! Let's see what
they look like inside, shall we?

484
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,360
Don't want to look.

485
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,520
There's not much of a swirl
in there, is there?

486
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,600
There's like an abstract swirl.

487
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,920
I think maybe the cream
kind of hides the swirl.

488
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,600
I have to tell you it's delicious.

489
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,680
Oh! I think you've got a great
blend of the spices,

490
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,200
but more so the cardamom and
the coconut together

491
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,960
work beautifully well.

492
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,480
My only complaint is there's
a touch too much jaggery.

493
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,400
OK. It's too sweet.

494
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,480
That's absolutely fine.
I'll take that.

495
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,440
Too hot. Bad timing.

496
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,840
Rushing. Maybe a bit of panic,
as well.

497
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,120
Hm.

498
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,200
It's pudding.

499
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,360
It's not cake.
It's still warm.

500
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,960
And the whole thing's collapsed,
because you put a massive
amount of chocolate.

501
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,840
There's a famous saying in Cyprus
which you will probably be

502
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
more than aware of - siga, siga.
Yeah.

503
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,120
What does that mean?
Slowly, slowly.

504
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,280
Yeah. Slowly, slowly.

505
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,760
You've got a fairly good swirl.

506
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,840
I think the flavours are lovely.
It is a little stodgy.

507
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,680
Even with spelt in, you've
managed to over-mix it.

508
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,920
Oh, OK.
And so it's too rubbery.

509
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,320
There was a bit of a wind in the
forest. The forest suffered a storm.

510
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,440
The Black Forest is not entirely
healthy.

511
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,040
A nice bit of a swirl in there.

512
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,960
You haven't over-sweetened
the filling,

513
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,520
so you get that sour cherry.
You're from the Black Forest?

514
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
Yes.

515
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,680
Try some.

516
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,080
What do you think?
I would buy it. Why?

517
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,640
The balance between cream,
chocolate is right.

518
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,800
And you have enough sour cherry,
and not sweet.

519
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,640
I agree. I agree entirely.
Thank you.

520
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,840
Just needs to be neater.
Just judge your own cake.

521
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,680
It's very, very good.
Well done. Thank you very much.
Well done.

522
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,200
I'm going to eat a bit.

523
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,080
Black Forest from the Black Forest.

524
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Mmm.

525
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,400
I'm full of admiration for you,

526
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,040
because on the few occasions
that I've tried to use aquafaba

527
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,960
instead of egg whites, it takes
ages. Oh, yeah.

528
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,200
It is a bit of a faff, isn't it,
really?

529
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,760
I mean...

530
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,880
Well, let's see
if it is worth it, shall we?

531
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,600
I like the nice tart
flavour of the raspberries.

532
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,200
And you've got a little
hint of lemon in there, as well.

533
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,960
The cake is a little bit hefty.

534
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,440
That's got a lovely
swirl in that one. Thank you.

535
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,960
I like the fact that the sponge is
a little thicker because it

536
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,600
means it's risen more and the fresh
strawberries are just delicious.

537
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,640
They're giraffe-patterned,
giraffe-esque.

538
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,240
And, er, we could
even go as far to say

539
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,520
the caramel drips are, you know,
like the sea lion bit.

540
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,480
Water.

541
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,600
Not the best-looking
mini rolls I've seen.

542
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,680
There was obviously a rush.

543
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,320
The cream and the caramel's run out
because it's been warm

544
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,720
when you've done it. Then, your
flavours are all wrong.

545
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,000
It's down to the timing.

546
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,440
And I bet you did better
when you were practising.

547
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,920
Yeah, but tent pressure, isn't it?

548
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,640
Goodness, Giuseppe,
that looks as neat as a pin.

549
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,200
Absolutely beautiful.

550
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,640
You've come up with something
that's very elegant.

551
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,920
Cuts lovely.

552
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,920
Classic, lovely swirl inside there.

553
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,280
Perfect swirl.
That is a perfect swirl.

554
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,720
Classic almond cake with orange.

555
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,720
Yeah. Ah, it's my favourite kind
of cake. Oh, good.

556
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,840
It's delicate and it's so well
balanced that it grows on you.

557
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,560
With every mouthful, it's getting
better and better.

558
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,040
I think your flavours are beautiful.

559
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,400
The orange blossom comes through
and it's very delicate,

560
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,040
but it's enough there to create
a great flavour, because ricotta

561
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,640
carries a little bit of flavour,
so that between the two,

562
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,000
it's perfect. It's a triumph.
Well done.

563
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,160
Oh, good. Thank you,
Giuseppe. Thank you.

564
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,040
WHISPERS: Well done. Amazing. They
look fantastic.

565
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,440
Let me recap -

566
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,600
a triumph, neat as a pin.
Perfect.

567
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,000
The only problem there is, there is
only one way from here.

568
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,000
Paul made me eat my own cake
and judge it.

569
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,560
Uh, crazy, crazy.

570
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,040
They said they looked terrible.

571
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,840
Everyone knew that, anyway.

572
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,120
The seepage was massive.

573
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,760
Each week, the bakers'
second challenge will be a mystery

574
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,000
shrouded in gingham.

575
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,360
It's time for your first-ever
technical challenge,

576
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,480
which has been set for you
by the delightful Prue Leith.

577
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,600
Prue, any words of advice?

578
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,920
This is a really old-fashioned
recipe.

579
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,800
And those of you who are under 35
may never have heard of it.

580
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,240
Don't panic, just read the recipe.

581
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,560
As ever, this technical
challenge will be judged blind.

582
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,040
So we're going to have to ask these
two poppets to leave the tent.

583
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,200
Bye-bye.

584
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,680
So, for your first-ever technical
challenge, Prue would like you

585
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,920
to make that tea-time classic -
the malt loaf.

586
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,280
Served with home-made
butter on the side.

587
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,040
It should be rich and moist.
Like Paul Hollywood.

588
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,080
You have two hours, which doesn't
seem nearly enough, does it?

589
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,600
On your marks. Get set.

590
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,640
Bake!

591
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,240
Malt loaf is my absolute favourite.
Love it.

592
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,680
Never made it, though.

593
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,200
Damn! I wish I'd made it.

594
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,120
In the technical challenge,
the bakers are all given

595
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,280
identical ingredients
and the same pared-down recipe.

596
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,720
Because Prue said under-35s won't
know what it is,

597
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,160
but, of course, all the under-35s
said, "Do you know what it is,
Maggie?"

598
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,400
Of course. Yes, I do.
I'm over 35 -

599
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,440
well over 35, so, in theory,
I should know what this looks like.

600
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,360
In reality, I haven't got
the faintest clue.

601
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,560
I've never had... Er, what is it
called?

602
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,840
Mal.. Malt loaf.

603
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,720
So it's our first technical
challenge and you've set them

604
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,080
a malt loaf. It's sticky, rich.

605
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,680
Nobody doesn't like a malt loaf.

606
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,320
Where can they go wrong?

607
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,320
Because it's just a simple mix,
it's a little bit easy to undermix

608
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,200
and so just take trouble to make
sure that you haven't got any

609
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,880
lumps of flour left in there.

610
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,400
And under-bake it and it's likely
to sink in the middle.

611
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,000
And overbaked, it's just too hard
and dry.

612
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,360
That's perfect.

613
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,880
Nicely distributed fruit.

614
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,560
Beautiful dark colour.

615
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,120
We just need some butter on it.
Have you got enough there, Prue?

616
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,520
No.

617
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,120
It's gorgeous, isn't it?
It reminds me of my nan.

618
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,760
When I was a kid going round there,

619
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,200
given a little piece of malt loaf
with butter on it.

620
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,200
Oh! Judging them is going to be
hard, though.

621
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,120
I can't talk, I've got a mouth
full of malt loaf.

622
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,800
PRUE MUMBLES

623
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,160
Feeling quite excited.

624
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,840
My wife asked me
to make a tea loaf years ago,

625
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,120
and I never did.

626
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,560
So here I am.

627
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,120
"Tip the raisins and chopped
prunes into a microwave-safe bowl."

628
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,440
I'm just cutting the prunes now.
I hate prunes. Ugh.

629
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,600
If the bakers leave
the fruit in large chunks...

630
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,240
I think if these are the same size
as the raisins, it will probably

631
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,520
be quite good.

632
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,440
..it could sink to the
bottom of their malt loaf.

633
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,800
There's a bit of guesswork here.

634
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,880
Just re-chopping them, cos clearly

635
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,800
they're not finely done enough.

636
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,360
Are these the sort of ingredients
you would bake with in Italy?

637
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,920
Er, no.
I love prunes, but on their own.

638
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,320
I've never put them in a cake.

639
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,400
Well, they,
they keep you busy, you see.

640
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,240
It does, it does.

641
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,320
I don't think I've ever actually
seen malt extract before.

642
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,320
Black treacle, 40g.

643
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,440
Another ingredient I've never
used in my life.

644
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,560
Oh, it doesn't want to come off!

645
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,680
This is a joke.

646
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,840
Hey!

647
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,760
Malt loaf? Gross.

648
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,200
Don't like it? I just don't
really like any of the smells.

649
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,400
I think when you present it to Paul,

650
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,000
just hold his mouth open

651
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,640
and drop in chunks. Like you're
rearing a sort of small...

652
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,680
So you don't want me to...
..ostrich...

653
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,040
I don't like ostriches.
..that's fallen out of a nest.

654
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,960
You don't like ostriches? No.
Or malt loaf?

655
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,520
An ostrich ran away with me on it.
With you on it?

656
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,800
As a child. You got on an
ostrich? Yes.

657
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,520
So, we were in a ostrich farm. Was
there any? It had a bag on its head.

658
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,880
A bag? So it was clearly unhinged.
This is a dream surely.

659
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,040
An unhinged ostrich. There's an
ostrich with a bag on its head.

660
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,400
This ostrich went... waaagh!

661
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,840
Went crazy? Crazy.

662
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,680
Started to like run off.
And the ostrich is running round

663
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,000
the pen with me on it screaming.
Wow.

664
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,800
Horrendous. Traumatised.

665
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,240
This sounds like the best day ever.

666
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,440
Does it?

667
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,880
"Combine the remaining ingredients
to form the cake batter."

668
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,040
If the bakers under-mix the
batter...

669
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,520
Just going all in.
Give it a good stir.

670
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,600
..lumps of inedible flour will be
left after baking.

671
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,080
It's not overly mixed,
but it's a nice gooey texture.

672
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,560
Fingers crossed it'll come out OK.

673
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,120
But over-mixing will create gluten,

674
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,200
leading to a tough, chewy loaf.

675
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,320
This doesn't look very
promising now, does it?

676
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,800
How can this be baked into a cake?

677
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Pff.

678
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,320
You can live off malt loaf,
apparently. Can you really? Yes.

679
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,960
Don't look that up.

680
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,040
It's going in now.

681
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,600
Oh, that is a lot for this little
cake tin, isn't it?

682
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,080
I might actually take
a small amount out.

683
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,440
I hope I've made the right choice.

684
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
Wish me luck.

685
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,520
And they don't tell you how long
to cook things for. Cheeky.

686
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,240
I ain't got an idea how long
I've got to bake this for.

687
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,840
It's dark, so how would you know
if it's overbaked?

688
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,800
I suspect that it's quite
a long bake.

689
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,480
I'm putting it in for 45 minutes.

690
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,400
I was going to say 40 minutes,
but that maybe is a bit... No,

691
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,600
I don't think that's bold.

692
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,800
An hour to start with
and then check after an hour.

693
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,480
Well, let's see.

694
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,280
"Cut orange peel
and ginger into matchsticks."

695
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,800
"Add the sugar and water to the pan,
bring to a boil

696
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,280
"until the peel is translu...

697
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,720
"trans-ulent... tran-solent
and s... and soft."

698
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,120
Kind of like see-throughy.

699
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,240
I've got a question to ask you.
Go ahead.

700
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,600
Do people tell you that you
look like someone?

701
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,000
Um... Well, who do you think I look
like? Well, somebody...

702
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,120
I said a young Robert De Niro.

703
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,640
What?! I'll take that.

704
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,040
Someone else said a young
Andy Garcia. OK.

705
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,880
Someone else said a young
Peter Andre.

706
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,080
Nah, no way. Not that one. No? Not
taking that? Not taking that one.

707
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,280
No offence, Peter, by the way,
if you're watching.

708
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,960
He's not watching.
He's in the gym.

709
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,040
Bakers, you have four minutes plus
six minutes plus six minutes

710
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,200
plus four minutes plus four
minutes

711
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,520
plus six minutes. Lovely.
Clear as mud.

712
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,920
Oh, 30 minutes.

713
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,720
Still looks really wet in
the middle, but I think that's
the point.

714
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,960
I think that's cos it's
supposed to take ages.

715
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,040
No. Needs loads of time, still.

716
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,400
It's very gooey.

717
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,440
I'll give it more time.
Another 15.

718
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,400
And I want to get the butter going.

719
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,440
Instructions just says to
make the butter.

720
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,760
Because we make butter
all the time, don't we?

721
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,200
I'm weighing out my double cream,

722
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,040
so I'm going to chuck
that into a stand mixer,

723
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,640
whisk it up and, if you over-whisk
it,

724
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,680
it'll then eventually form butter.

725
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,800
Right, beat.

726
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,040
Oh, my God, that's going in my eye!

727
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,480
I've just got to, like, squeeze it.

728
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,000
Quite therapeutic, actually.

729
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,280
I'm just hoping, when I open this
muslin, that it resembles butter.

730
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,560
It looks like it.

731
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,000
It smells like it.

732
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,640
That's butter.
"Chill." Sounds good.

733
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,120
Bakers, you've got ten minutes left.
Ow, my ears, you've burst them.

734
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,920
SORRY! That's better.

735
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,400
See if it's ready.

736
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,080
I might just give it a few
more minutes.

737
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,560
This is nerve-racking, isn't it?

738
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,760
SHE SIGHS
I dunno. Painful.

739
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,560
TIMER BLEEPS
Right.

740
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,040
Looking all right?

741
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,040
Probably five more minutes.

742
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,400
SHE SIGHS

743
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,240
No, I'll maybe leave it
a little bit more.

744
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,720
Will I? Unsure.

745
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,640
Still got a real bad wobble.

746
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,360
I reckon that's done.

747
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,320
OK that's it. It's coming out.

748
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,240
The cake is on the move, people.

749
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,520
It looks fine.

750
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,240
Scrumptious!

751
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,120
So I think it's just right.

752
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,440
Either it's done or it'll
have to do.

753
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,920
Agh!

754
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,000
This is this really dense cake.

755
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,520
Come out totally clear.

756
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,080
Not totally clear.

757
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,320
Mine looks a bit doughy, innit?

758
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,120
Bakers, you have one minute left.

759
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,680
My God.

760
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,440
Just letting it glaze up.

761
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,000
Can't have a dry bottom.
Oh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

762
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,080
I've got to somehow get
attractive orange on top.

763
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,480
Just need to put the butter on.

764
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,800
What a shebang. Honestly.

765
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,840
This is a nightmare.

766
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,440
It's really quite pretty.

767
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,840
Bakers, your time is up.

768
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,000
If malt loaf is supposed to have a
split in it, then it's perfect.

769
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,760
I hope it's not raw in the middle.

770
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,120
Well, you know, I just don't know.

771
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,480
Who knows? And who knows?
Who knows? They could cut into it

772
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,800
and say that's overbaked.
It looks fantastic.

773
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,280
I hope it's worked out, this time.

774
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,960
Please bring your malt loafs
down to the gingham table

775
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,520
and place them behind
your photograph.

776
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,520
Off you go. I don't want
to crash into anybody.

777
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,240
I'm coming.

778
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,680
Where's my ugly mug?

779
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,360
Oh, I'm first. What a nightmare.

780
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,440
Oh, your peel looks really nice.

781
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,360
Look at mine, mine's still wet.

782
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,760
I need the toilet.

783
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,680
Prue and Paul are expecting
deliciously rich

784
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,600
and moist malt loafs, served
with freshly made salted butter -

785
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,840
and they'll have no idea
whose is whose.

786
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,480
Right, let's start.

787
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,560
The crystallisation on this
looks pretty good.

788
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,400
They're nice and even, aren't they?

789
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,560
Distribution's good.
Yeah, no, that looks lovely.

790
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,200
Yeah, feels good.

791
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,360
The butter's nice. There you go.
Yeah.

792
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,080
That's so delicious.

793
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,120
It's sticky and it's got that
characteristic chew.

794
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,680
Hmm. And it's well balanced
with the fruit, as well.

795
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,880
Now, this one looks very small.

796
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,240
Let's have a look inside.

797
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,000
It's probably going to be
a bit tough, I think.

798
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,240
The fruit distribution is there.

799
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,160
It's just a bit bread-like.
Hmm.

800
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,680
This one has beautiful
topping on it. Yeah.

801
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,800
It's not very evenly distributed,
is it? No, it's not.

802
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,080
It's in lumps.

803
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,200
There's almost too much fruit
and not too much of the malt loaf.

804
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,400
I quite like this.
I do, too.

805
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,560
That's got a nice
distribution inside.

806
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,720
Hmm, this butter's not too salty.

807
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,800
It's got a little bit of
a chew to that one.

808
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,400
That's lovely.

809
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,200
Moving on to number five.

810
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,720
It's got a good height.
It's not too domed.

811
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,280
That's got a good texture,

812
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,440
got that little bit of tension
in it, as well, which I like.

813
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,280
Moving on.
Quite a strong colour on there.

814
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,040
Lots of fruit. Yeah.

815
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,640
That's very short.

816
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,320
I think that's probably
been slightly over baked.

817
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,400
It's quite a pale colour.

818
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,320
But I think it's properly cooked.

819
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,840
There's a bit of flour not
quite distributed evenly. Hmm.

820
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,600
Got a nice chewy edge to it.

821
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,120
It's sort of there, it nearly is.

822
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,680
This has got a lot of candy peel
on the top. I like that.

823
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,360
I like that look. I like that, too.

824
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,800
Hmm, nice colour.

825
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,920
Nice bit of tension in that one.

826
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,360
That's excellent.

827
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,680
It's got lots of fruit,
it's got a malty taste,

828
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,000
it's got a lovely tension.
Very good.

829
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,960
Nice colour all the way round.

830
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,200
The flavour's good.

831
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,120
But on the second bite,
it feels quite bready again.

832
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,200
OK.

833
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,680
This looks a bit small.

834
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,560
And it's a little doughy there.

835
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,640
That's raw. You can tell by
the colour how light it is.

836
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,440
Hmm. I think it's
slightly underdone.

837
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,800
Definitely.

838
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,440
Quite pale, but decent.

839
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,040
I like that look.

840
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,680
Good blend of fruit.

841
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,960
Probably needed longer in the oven,

842
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,400
because it's sticking to
every bit of my mouth.

843
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,120
We'll have to take your teeth out
and clean them later.

844
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,520
God, she slapped him...

845
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,920
OK. It's quite a strong colour,
which I like.

846
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,360
Lots of little flour pockets.

847
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,800
Whoever did this,
you need to mix it more evenly.

848
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,960
Prue and Paul will now rank the malt
loafs from the worst to the best.

849
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,560
In 12th spot, we have...

850
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,120
..this one.

851
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,960
Amanda, there's loads and loads
of flour pockets in there.

852
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,280
In 11th place, we have this one.

853
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,600
Chigs, it was under baked
and squishy.

854
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,920
In tenth spot, we have this one.

855
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,360
Not sure, Giuseppe, what happened
with the fruit distribution,

856
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,960
but they're all in clumps.

857
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,560
Jairzeno is ninth, Crystelle eighth,

858
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,360
seventh Rochica, Jurgen is sixth,

859
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,680
Tom is fifth, Lizzie is fourth,

860
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,560
and George is third.

861
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,720
In second, we have...

862
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,240
..this one.

863
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,680
Me.

864
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,480
Freya, that's a nice loaf.

865
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,760
Ah, thank you. And the only
reason why you're not in first

866
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,280
is because number one was better.

867
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,920
And that means that this
is number one.

868
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,640
Yay! Woo!

869
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,800
Well done, Maggie.

870
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,480
It's a beautiful loaf.

871
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,840
I won't say you're anything
like as old as me,

872
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,600
but you're getting a little bit
older than some of these,

873
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,880
and you can make the perfect
malt loaf. Well done.

874
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,600
Thank you very much.

875
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,600
When they went down the numbers,

876
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,000
I kept thinking,
they've just missed me out.

877
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,560
And then it went down and down,
and then there I was!

878
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,320
You know what I'm going to do now...

879
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,640
So, yes, I'm terribly...
I'm terribly pleased.

880
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,960
Really pleased.

881
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,920
I thought it was quite ironic
that she was saying that

882
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,400
this is like a challenge for old
people, and I was the youngest,

883
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,120
so that was quite exciting.

884
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,840
Not great. I don't think that one
went that well.

885
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,800
I'm gonna throw all the flour
out of my house when I get home.

886
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,400
I'm never gonna bake
with flour again.

887
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,280
Just one challenge remains before
we crown this year's

888
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,720
first Star Baker and reveal who
will have to leave the tent.

889
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,400
Well, kids, another day,
another bubble.

890
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,520
Here we are.

891
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,000
We're back in the bubble.

892
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,880
I do think we've settled
in pretty easy.

893
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,120
Overall, I've been really
impressed with the bakers.

894
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,160
The only person that's in a little
bit of trouble would be Amanda.

895
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,760
She has to have a good day today.
Yeah.

896
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,480
Tom didn't have a good Signature.

897
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,960
George likewise,
a terrible Signature.

898
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,440
I think, up at the top, Giuseppe has
to be with that Signature

899
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,920
cos it was so good.
Jurgen's done really well.

900
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,040
And actually I think Maggie...
Sorry, Prue. Maggie.

901
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,120
Maggie slash Prue. Yeah.

902
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,840
Is this going to be a running
joke for ten weeks? Yes, yes, yes.

903
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,800
Absolutely.
Sorry Maggie. Prue.

904
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,480
I'm beginning to hope Maggie goes
out just to get rid of this joke.

905
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,880
Good luck, everybody.

906
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,960
Good morning, bakers.

907
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,320
Welcome back to the tent.

908
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,880
Are you excited for your
first-ever Showstopper?

909
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,680
ALL: Yes.

910
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,839
I can't hear you are you excited
for your first-ever Showstopper?

911
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,200
ALL: Yes.

912
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,600
No, I can't hear you,
I've got a inner ear infection.

913
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,560
It's actually quite painful.

914
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,880
Now, today, Prue and Paul would love
you to make an awe-inspiring

915
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,960
anti-gravity illusion cake.

916
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,480
Your vertically sculpted cakes

917
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,680
must appear to defy gravity

918
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,080
and should be decorated in a way

919
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,680
that represents a precious memory.

920
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,160
You've got four hours
to defy gravity.

921
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,720
On your marks. Get set.

922
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,520
Bake.

923
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,400
I've got something to prove
after the Signature yesterday.

924
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,960
And I really want this to go well.

925
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,720
I'm rocking and rolling.
There's no room for error today.

926
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,880
The whole point of an anti-gravity
cake is a top-heavy cake

927
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,000
that looks like it's falling or
cascading

928
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,400
so they've really got to
think of the framework

929
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,560
to build the anti-gravity
cake on to.

930
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,000
We want to look at these cakes
and think, "How did they do that?"

931
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,240
"How can that still be standing"

932
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,360
But as always, it has
to be a delicious cake.

933
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,000
And it mustn't be
style over substance

934
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,520
so, as usual, it's difficult.

935
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,680
Morning, Chigs. Morning.
Hello. How are you all?

936
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,880
Right, good. Tell us
all about your anti-gravity cake.

937
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,960
My anti-gravity cake is called
Where It All Began.

938
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,360
As you probably already know,

939
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,040
I've only been baking for a short
period of time. Check him out.

940
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,480
And he's on Bake Off already.

941
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,760
That just goes to show it's
not that difficult, kids. No.

942
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,720
Not that difficult.
Well, we'll see.

943
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,200
We'll see, yeah we'll see.

944
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,040
Chigs is attempting a baking scene

945
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,080
where a gravity-defying jug
will pour chocolate into a bowl

946
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,920
made from delicate chocolate
sponge with peanut butter

947
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,480
and chocolate buttercream.

948
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,560
The jug is actually
cake as well, isn't it?

949
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,680
It's got cake in it.

950
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,520
And how is it all
going to be, elevated?

951
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,600
Um...

952
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,480
With magic.

953
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,200
Also relying on a sprinkling
of magic is Giuseppe.

954
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,520
My anti-gravity cake is going to be
Jack and Beanstalk

955
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,560
cos it's a story that I
read to the kids at night.

956
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,160
A fondant beanstalk will hold his
cloud-shaped chocolate cake aloft

957
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,440
in a spectacular fairy tale scene
dedicated to his three young boys.

958
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,160
They don't know I'm here just
yet and I was practising

959
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,440
this last week. Oh, really?

960
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,240
Yeah, and my eldest went, "Papa,
this cake is really good you know."

961
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,640
It would look good even on
Bake Off and I'm like,

962
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,680
"Yeah, hold on to that thought."
Oh, I love it.

963
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,280
Oh, my God, that's amazing. Yeah.
When are you going to tell 'em?

964
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,640
Well, I'd like... I'd like...
Not at all? No, not at all.

965
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,000
And then just go, "Hey,
shall we watch this?"

966
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,520
Yeah, "Look, look what's on TV."

967
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,000
Oh, I want to be there
when that happens. Well, I...

968
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,440
That's the best thing ever.

969
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,960
Giuseppe's not the only baker

970
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,240
inspired by a little bedtime
reading.

971
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,080
I'm making a lamp and a book.

972
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,680
The first book I read in
English from cover to cover.

973
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,960
What book? Thomas More's Utopia.

974
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,840
Light reading.

975
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,880
Orange chiffon sponge,
a honey buttercream with rose

976
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,360
and a pistachio praline
will form his weighty tome

977
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,120
and his precisely engineered
childhood bedside lamp.

978
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,160
I'm using spanners, yes.

979
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,240
They have been
through the dishwasher.

980
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,880
I'm a bit of a DIY person.

981
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,840
Avoiding collapse won't be easy.

982
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,520
It is a very difficult one
cos you want a stable cake

983
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,120
but you want a tasty cake.

984
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,520
A delicate sponge could fall
apart as it tries to defy

985
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,880
the pull of gravity.

986
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,280
Hopefully the cake
will be like clouds.

987
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,440
But any denser
and it won't be pleasant to eat.

988
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,560
It's quite a thick batter
so there is some density to it.

989
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,200
Forgotten how many eggs I put in.

990
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,640
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

991
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,840
No. One, two...

992
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,320
I keep losing count.

993
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,200
If he can get his measurements
right,

994
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,680
George's sponges will become a
backgammon board

995
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,960
and suspended coffee
cup in mid-flow.

996
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,480
When I'm on holiday in Cyprus,

997
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,120
when you walk through the villages,

998
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,840
you see little Greek old
men playing backgammon.

999
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,960
How are you going to
hold up the coffee pot?

1000
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,560
Well, I've built a little platform

1001
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,760
where the coffee pot will sit
and then the coffee

1002
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,200
will pour down the threaded rod.
Yeah. I just hope it stands.

1003
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,560
Fingers crossed.
So, do we. So, do we.

1004
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,840
Rather than sunny Cyprus,

1005
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,080
Maggie is off on a staycation.

1006
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,320
I come from a beachy area and
I'm making an ice cream cornet.

1007
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,160
Oh, lovely. When you go to the
beach,

1008
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,160
what ice cream do you like best?

1009
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,200
A mint choc chip.
Are you doing mint choc chip?

1010
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,200
Oh, no. Oh, no. No?
No, no, no, no.

1011
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,960
Why would you eat toothpaste
in an ice cream?

1012
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,640
Oh, controversial!

1013
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,720
Maggie will recreate her favourite
raspberry ripple ice cream,

1014
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,280
complete with a suspended
bag of sprinkles

1015
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,360
which she hopes will
impress Paul and Prue.

1016
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,040
You've missed my ears.

1017
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,120
Hello, Prue, how you doing?
You all right?

1018
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,240
How are things going today,
Prue? Are you all right?

1019
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,400
Is it weird being here?

1020
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,880
Thank you, Maggie.

1021
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,840
That wasn't my idea.
Or yours I dare say.

1022
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,880
No, I know,
he's so naughty.

1023
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,200
Shoo.

1024
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,680
You're just trying to
make me squash my raspberries.

1025
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,040
Good luck in there.

1026
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,840
Unless they get their cakes
baked as soon as possible...

1027
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,400
Please be good to me.

1028
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,600
..the bakers won't have enough
time to pull off their

1029
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,680
gravity-defying constructions.

1030
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,600
And the more sponges
they need to stack and carve...

1031
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,520
Loads of cake. Loads of cake.

1032
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,400
..the more complicated
the engineering becomes.

1033
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,640
The lamp part, I've put
white fondant there

1034
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,400
and then I'll put this on top,

1035
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,760
and then I'll build the cake up.

1036
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,920
So it's going to be
six layers of cake,

1037
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,520
all stacked on top of each other

1038
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,600
and then sort of V-shaped bouquet
of flowers with all the stems.

1039
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,120
It's a bit of a monster.

1040
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,880
On top of moulded
puffed rice and marshmallow,

1041
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,360
Crystelle will stack cinnamon
sponges with Italian meringue,

1042
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,120
buttercream and roasted pecans.

1043
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,880
All decorated to look
like a bouquet of flowers.

1044
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,720
So I'm dedicating it to my auntie.

1045
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,640
She actually used to do a lot
of flower arranging back in the day.

1046
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,440
And also she used to bake a lot.

1047
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,200
So I thought, if I go out in week
one,

1048
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,400
I want to dedicate at least one
bake to her.

1049
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,800
So it's not an anti-gravity cake
it's auntie gravity cake.

1050
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,120
Oh, nice one. Clever.
See you later, guys.

1051
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,080
Flowers are, like, my favourite
thing. My mum loves flowers as well.

1052
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,480
So it's kind of just, like,
the perfect theme really.

1053
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,240
Freya's all-vegan floral scene

1054
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,720
will feature chocolate sponges

1055
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,320
filled with a kirsch cream

1056
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,080
and cherry jam

1057
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,920
all decorated with dozens of
hand-piped buttercream flowers.

1058
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,400
Honestly, when I first made
this chocolate cake,

1059
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,520
I thought it was the best
chocolate cake that I'd had.

1060
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,640
I don't think that you'd know it was
vegan.

1061
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,920
But I'd eat cake off the floor so...

1062
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,800
I feel I'm probably not
the best judge of that, really.

1063
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,600
Bakers, you are halfway through
your anti-gravity challenge.

1064
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,120
Ooh.

1065
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,600
Let's get this baby out.

1066
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,720
Yeah, they're done.
That's beautiful.

1067
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,600
All they have to do is cool down.

1068
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,440
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

1069
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,280
With the last of their
sponges out of the oven...

1070
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,720
Oh, that'll do.
That'll do. I'm happy with that.

1071
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,160
..the bakers need to use every
minute to perfect

1072
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,120
their decorative elements.

1073
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,600
I just want to let my cakes chill
for as long as possible,

1074
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,720
which is why I'm just doing
all my decoration now.

1075
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,440
So, this is my sweetie bag.

1076
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,480
Let's see if we can a dolphin.

1077
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,440
My cake is going to look
like a wave hitting a rock

1078
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,320
and I'm going to have a couple
of little dolphins coming out of it.

1079
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,240
Inspired by a trip to Florida,

1080
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,840
Amanda's dolphins will emerge
from a towering wave

1081
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,000
of lemon and elderflower sponge.

1082
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,720
You need a good day
today, don't you?

1083
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,320
I do need a good day today, yes.
Have you practised it?

1084
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,600
I've made about four of these.

1085
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,480
Course she has.
And they didn't collapse?

1086
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,600
Um, one of them did collapse.

1087
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,960
The next two were perfect.

1088
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,120
Never say that the practice went
weird to these two.

1089
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,760
The first one collapsed.
The others didn't collapse.

1090
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,040
I'm just going to start building.

1091
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,840
To defy gravity, most of the bakers
will have to carefully layer

1092
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,240
delicate sponge and filling

1093
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,240
onto precarious, custom-made
structures.

1094
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,800
This is all exciting now.

1095
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,240
I feel sick.

1096
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,720
But Jairzeno plans to
take an even bigger risk.

1097
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,040
I'm going to cut the sponge
and roll it up like a cylinder.

1098
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,960
He'll attempt to stack guava,
lime and chilli Swiss rolls

1099
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,360
with a suspended paint can

1100
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,560
pouring technicolour
shards of chocolate

1101
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,720
to celebrate his passion
for colourful bakes.

1102
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,200
It should be steady enough yes.

1103
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,360
And the buttercream will have, will
kind of reinforce it - like cement.

1104
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,720
It won't taste like cement.

1105
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,920
With every additional
layer of sponge and filling...

1106
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,120
I have to thread the screws
all the way down.

1107
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,960
..the Showstoppers get heavier...

1108
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,920
Oh. I just want to get as much
flavour in here as possible.

1109
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,280
..and defying gravity
gets harder and harder.

1110
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,360
But Jairzeno has
yet to leave the ground.

1111
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,880
I am struggling now.

1112
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,280
I think the buttercream
is a bit too soft.

1113
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,800
Right, this isn't quite...

1114
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,560
Oops.

1115
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,840
No, no, no, no, no.

1116
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,760
Oh. BLEEP.

1117
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,360
Bakers, you have one hour left
for your anti-gravity illusion cake.

1118
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,840
Jairzeno's showstopper doesn't look
like it'll defy gravity

1119
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,280
any time soon.

1120
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,760
Right.

1121
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,280
I'll put the thing in the fridge to
chill cos I'm trying to get

1122
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,760
the main cake to stand up.

1123
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,360
And he's not the only one
struggling.

1124
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,480
Oh, OK it's completely
split down the middle.

1125
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,440
And the bottom layer has broken.

1126
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,600
Rochica will have to repair a giant
apple made from a caramel

1127
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,880
and spiced apple sponge to be able
to hang it from a puffed rice

1128
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,840
and marshmallow tree,
inspired by her uncle's garden.

1129
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,320
It's really fragile
so I'm gonna ice it

1130
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,880
and then just get it in the freezer.

1131
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,040
Oh, I'm so stressed out.
It's all right.

1132
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,720
Just, you know...
Breathe. You'll be fine.

1133
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,360
My dad told me to... breathe in.
Ahh!

1134
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,360
Actually I feel a bit better,
breathing in and out.

1135
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,440
Did it feel better? Yeah.

1136
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,440
Your dad knows. He's got some
skills. My parents are so wisdomous.

1137
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,240
Wisdomous!

1138
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,920
Is that a word? That's a new word.
Wisdomous.

1139
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,520
Lizzie has also had
the benefit of some fatherly wisdom.

1140
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,480
What are you using to build it?

1141
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,920
Me Dad's gone a bit crazy with
the superglue and a chopping board.

1142
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,240
Her dad, Andy, had built the base
for a cake jug that will pour

1143
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,000
cream into a peach
and vanilla bowl-shaped cake

1144
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,680
in honour of their Nana's
tinned peaches and cream puddings.

1145
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,160
And have you practised it
with this armature? Yeah.

1146
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,360
And it worked?

1147
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,240
It was horrific!
THEY LAUGH

1148
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,520
So, you can tell it's, like,
leaning.

1149
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,360
You've really thrown your own dad
under the bus here.

1150
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,320
Well, I've got to throw someone
under -

1151
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,920
as long as it's not me, isn't it?

1152
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,960
This is the jug.

1153
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,360
Most of the bakers still have to
complete smaller, even more

1154
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,000
fragile cakes to suspend.

1155
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,120
The lamp is nearing completion.

1156
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,520
Stressful, man.

1157
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,120
This is gonna be a coffee
pot that will sit here.

1158
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,000
It's a hazardous process...

1159
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,960
It's like a jug pouring cake
batter into a big bowl,

1160
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,480
with splashes coming out of it.

1161
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,600
..that Tom has chosen to avoid.

1162
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,640
So, I'm actually just using
dowels for my cakes.

1163
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,720
You know we want an anti-gravity
cake? Yes.

1164
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,080
Do you think it qualifies?
I'm hoping it's enough.

1165
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,440
It does lean quite significantly.

1166
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,800
Tom plans to use lemon
and almond sponges to construct

1167
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,080
a teetering triple-tiered concert
hall, to celebrate his love

1168
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,720
of classical music, complete with
cannon for the 1812 Overture.

1169
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,640
We must look at it and think, "My
goodness! How does that stand up?

1170
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,200
OK, OK.

1171
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,560
I'll see what I can do. I mean it's
a bit late in the day, innit, now.

1172
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,600
That's the problem with that, isn't
it? I've designed it!

1173
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,680
Good luck, Tom.

1174
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,840
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

1175
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,000
Oh, my god.

1176
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,760
I don't think I'll be able to
decorate it.

1177
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,200
There won't be a paint pot at the
top with the colours falling out.

1178
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,440
no.

1179
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,840
Because it's not even standing up.

1180
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,040
Whilst Jairzeno has been forced to
abandon his plans...

1181
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,520
That's perfect.

1182
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,880
..the rest of the bakers face
the nerve-wracking task

1183
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,960
of seeing theirs through.

1184
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,160
Oh, this is a bit stressful,
isn't it?

1185
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,560
God, it is so silent in here.

1186
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,640
I do like painting.

1187
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,640
I'm not sure I like it
so much at the moment.

1188
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,600
I'm horrendous at doing any
finishes.

1189
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,760
Paul's gonna love you.

1190
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,760
Don't look into his eyes, right?

1191
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,080
I'm going to stare him down.

1192
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,600
Don't stare Paul down!

1193
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,480
You will not win that battle.

1194
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,400
If it falls, then it can be
a fallen apple.

1195
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,680
So now I'm going to put...

1196
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,480
..that there.

1197
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,520
Stay there.

1198
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,120
Slipping a bit.

1199
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,600
This looks as
though I'm doing nothing,

1200
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:18,280
but I'm waiting for the white
chocolate to set and I can't move.

1201
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,480
Oh, hell.

1202
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,320
Mine is wobbling so bad.

1203
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,520
I think this has taken, like,
a year off my life.

1204
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,000
So, this is just having
something to present.

1205
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,360
Hopefully it'll stand up.

1206
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,640
I'm so scared it's gonna fall.

1207
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,840
Ah. Ooh! Ha-ha!

1208
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,760
I think I'm done, you know.

1209
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,800
In the show? Yeah.

1210
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,120
My God, I can't breathe.

1211
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,040
Ooh.

1212
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,880
How much time do we have left?

1213
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,280
One minute left.

1214
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,720
Come on, man.

1215
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,720
Chigs, do you think you can help me
move it up onto there?

1216
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,000
The book needs pages.

1217
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,400
I don't know if it'll fall off, to
be honest. Don't say that.

1218
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,480
Dearie me.

1219
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,040
Wonder if I can spell
"Sorry" in cannonballs?

1220
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,320
Eh!

1221
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,880
Are we on?

1222
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,440
Let's put it flat and then slide.

1223
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,160
Slide. Oh, what a breeze.

1224
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,520
I usually quite like improvising.
Not so much today!

1225
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,960
Bakers, your time is up!

1226
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,600
Step away from your bakes.

1227
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,640
Gladly!

1228
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,680
Well done, Jurgen. Well done, my
friend. Thank you.

1229
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,960
George, how you feeling?

1230
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,920
I completely rushed it.

1231
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,120
Oh, have you seen some of mine?
Gorgeous.

1232
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,560
Giuseppe, it looks a ten out of ten.

1233
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,280
Giuseppe, you've got some
skill, dude man. Thank you.

1234
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,800
It's judgement time for the
anti-gravity illusion cakes.

1235
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,600
Chigs, would you like to
bring your cake up here?

1236
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,000
Matt, could you help me, please?

1237
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,560
Yeah, I'll give you a hand.
CHIGS LAUGHS

1238
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,200
Right, you ready? Yeah.

1239
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,000
To me. To you.

1240
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,800
To me. To you.
To me. To you.

1241
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,560
Just cupping the cup.

1242
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,280
There you go. It's going to break.

1243
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,360
It's going to break.

1244
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,120
Right, I'm going to step back now.

1245
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,480
GROANING

1246
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,640
Well, it was anti-gravity before
but I don't know what it is now!

1247
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,040
When I say anti-gravity...

1248
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,920
Well, it's not much any more.

1249
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,040
But I like the bowl.

1250
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,400
It's got a bit of movement in it,
which I quite like.

1251
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,920
So it's chocolate fudge? Yes.

1252
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,040
PRUE: The layers are good.

1253
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,240
It's got a chocolate and
peanut butter buttercream

1254
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,800
around it as well.

1255
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,200
PRUE: I think it's delicious.
Yes. I also like the texture.

1256
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,520
Beautifully moist.

1257
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,760
The sponge is delicious,

1258
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,880
and so is the peanut butter
buttercream as well.

1259
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,440
You're a very good baker.

1260
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:51,000
Maybe your engineering skills
need honing a little.

1261
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,440
PRUE: It could be neater.

1262
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,400
I agree. I'm sure you can paint
better than that.

1263
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,640
I can certainly paint better than
that, absolutely.

1264
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,080
PAUL: Let's have a look.

1265
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,520
I think you've got some nice
flavours.

1266
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,160
But you need to concentrate
more on the finesse.

1267
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,280
Yeah.

1268
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,880
I feel it looks more like a plant
pot than an ice cream.

1269
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,000
It's gone from a cornet to a tub.

1270
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,600
Your Victoria sandwich is delicious.

1271
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,080
Thank you. But there is not much
flavour in there.

1272
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,560
I was expecting something very
different to this.

1273
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,960
Yeah, I was expecting something
very different to that.

1274
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,400
It's quite mortifying, actually.

1275
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,320
I think the sponge is perfect.

1276
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,360
I love the flavour.

1277
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,360
It tastes like guava.
I love it.

1278
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,240
All the elements to it are there,
but there's nothing else.

1279
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,760
PRUE: Love the little dolphins,
and I think it's beautifully done.

1280
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,800
You've certainly got
the gravity-defying bit.

1281
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,480
I'm not totally convinced it does

1282
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,360
because that's just the Rice Krispie
bit, isn't it? Yeah.

1283
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,480
But I love the colour of it
and the concept of it.

1284
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,880
This is lemon drizzle?

1285
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,720
Yeah, lemon and elderflower.

1286
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,160
I think your sponges are slightly
overbaked.

1287
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,520
They're a little bit too dry.

1288
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,160
Did you use an extract with that
one?

1289
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,720
I used elderflower liqueur.
There's quite a lot in there.

1290
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,440
I think there's a touch too much.
It's quite...

1291
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,360
It burns, doesn't it? ..powerful.
Yeah.

1292
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,400
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1293
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,120
WHISPERS: Well done. Thank you.
It stayed up. It stayed up.

1294
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,760
Lizzie, would you like to bring
up your Showstopper, please?

1295
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,520
GASPS

1296
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,240
Oh, no!

1297
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,040
Whoops. Oh, my God.

1298
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,920
God! Sorry!

1299
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,960
NOEL: Paul's slowly sabotaged you.

1300
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,800
It's a bit simplistic.

1301
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,520
But it does defy gravity.

1302
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,240
But the side of it is a real mess,
isn't it?

1303
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,600
It may taste fantastic yet.

1304
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,960
Best hope so.

1305
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,200
I could happily eat a bowl of that.

1306
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,040
Cool.

1307
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,760
I think your flavour's nice -
just neaten up your work a little

1308
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,800
bit more.

1309
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,560
I think those flowers look
incredible.

1310
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,440
Thank you. You've spent some time on
that.

1311
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,400
It's chocolate sponge,
kirsch buttercream

1312
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,120
and then a little
bit of cherry jam as well.

1313
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,320
Hm. I think that's lovely.
Ah, awesome.

1314
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,400
It's very boozy.
PAUL: I think it's delicious.

1315
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,720
I think you have got a nice
chocolaty flavour there.

1316
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,280
Nice kick from the alcohol as well.

1317
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,720
You've got some beautiful textures
running through there.

1318
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,880
And it's vegan. Yeah.
I think you've done a great job.

1319
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,960
Oh, thank you so much.
A really, really good job.

1320
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,240
I really appreciate it.

1321
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,920
PAUL: It's very elegant.

1322
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,560
Think the pipework is beautifully
done. I think between you

1323
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,880
and Freya you've done an amazing
job with these flowers.

1324
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,840
PRUE: And you've certainly hit the
gravity-defying, because you cannot

1325
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,120
believe that such a heavy cake is
not going to fall over.

1326
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,320
And just remind us
about what the cake is.

1327
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,000
It's a cinnamon sponge with
a vanilla Italian meringue

1328
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,880
buttercream and roasted pecans.

1329
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,320
Hm. Looks good.

1330
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,720
PAUL CHUCKLES

1331
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,920
I got exactly that,
exactly as you said it. Oh!

1332
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,280
It's absolutely beautifully
flavoured. Lovely.

1333
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,200
The cinnamon hit is very powerful,
but it works

1334
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,680
because you've balanced that out
with the vanilla as well.

1335
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,280
And then the nuts just leave that
little bit of texture as well.

1336
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,320
So I think you've created something
that is actually quite remarkable.

1337
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:40,280
I absolutely agree. Thank you so
much. That was amazing. Well done.

1338
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,280
Well done.
It really is lovely.

1339
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,240
He doesn't say remarkable very
often,

1340
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,720
unless he's talking about himself.
LAUGHTER

1341
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,560
Aw, well done.

1342
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,600
Well done.

1343
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,240
You've definitely got
the excitement in there.

1344
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,280
You probably could've done with
a little bit more detail.

1345
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,200
Look at that -
apple and caramel, how lovely.

1346
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,800
Oh, your flavours are lovely.

1347
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,280
Thank you. The anti-gravity
is certainly there.

1348
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,560
It needs to be a little bit
more honed. Yeah.

1349
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,160
I have to say,

1350
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,520
I'm a bit disappointed about the
gravity-defying bit.

1351
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,160
It was a bit of a disaster
to be honest.

1352
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,440
It's a, uh, lemon and almond cake.

1353
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,600
It's rather more almond than lemon.
Yeah.

1354
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,360
And although there is a little
bit of a lean, there's no way

1355
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,640
that's defying gravity.

1356
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,680
Fair enough.

1357
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,800
It's simply beautiful.

1358
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:49,200
And it's certainly gravity-defying,
especially as you've got the cloud

1359
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,400
off-centre, so that really makes you
feel this should fall over.

1360
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,480
PAUL: It's a great kid's cake, that.

1361
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,680
Let's have a look, shall we?

1362
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,280
The inside of the cake
is XXX-inspired sponge

1363
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,160
with a raspberry jam
and cream cheese buttercream.

1364
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,520
The sponge is a little dry.

1365
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,840
OK.

1366
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,320
Good flavour, though - really good.

1367
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,600
Flavour's superb.

1368
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:16,480
Because of the size of the cake,
I would've put two layers in there.

1369
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,200
Right. OK. It's true. If you'd
had three layers of the sponge

1370
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,320
and a bit more filling, you wouldn't
have noticed the dryness so much.

1371
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:26,360
It's a pity, because you've
absolutely nailed the illusion bit.

1372
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,320
I think it's so elegant, don't you?
Yeah.

1373
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:44,200
It's so clean and simple
but beautifully done.

1374
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,920
Is there cake in this?
Yes.

1375
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,560
There is? So this has got a rod
support, and then you've... Yes.

1376
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,240
With the plinth,
and you've put the cake onto that.

1377
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,600
Uh, yes, and I've got two more
supporting discs inside.

1378
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,840
It's well-engineered.

1379
01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:00,160
The cake is an orange chiffon sponge
with honey buttercream with

1380
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,960
a hint of rose
and pistachio praline.

1381
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,800
I'm glad you said hint, because rose
can be so strong. Yes.

1382
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,720
You've got the rose
absolutely right.

1383
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,800
You can hardly taste it
but it's there. Yeah.

1384
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,800
It's beautiful because the chiffon's
quite a light sponge, then you've

1385
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,720
got texture coming from the nuts,
which gives you a beautiful flavour.

1386
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,800
And then the background, you've got
this rose sort of floating

1387
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,880
through, so technically the way
you've baked it is perfect.

1388
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,880
You could become the flavour king.

1389
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:34,480
Very, very good.
Thank you very much.

1390
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,880
Well done. Well done, yeah, so good.

1391
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,520
Smashed it. Smashed it.

1392
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,880
Phew.

1393
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,880
Still sinking in.

1394
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,120
I can't believe it.

1395
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,840
I'm a very happy Jurgen indeed.

1396
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,400
I really thought my cake was raw.

1397
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,360
And they cut it and I was like
"Oh, my God, it's raw."

1398
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,400
And it wasn't!

1399
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,520
Oh, blimey. I think it's the worst
bake I've ever done.

1400
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,720
That's pretty bad.

1401
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,720
To be honest, I expect to go home

1402
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,000
because it doesn't even have an
anti-gravity element.

1403
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,680
I just think week one's nerves have
just got the better of me.

1404
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:14,520
I hope I don't go, but I think
I might be, you know, going home.

1405
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:17,520
I absolutely want to stay -
of course I want to stay.

1406
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,160
What a great bunch of people.

1407
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,640
I've never been able to sit
and talk to

1408
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,280
someone in detail about a cake
and not bore the pants off them!

1409
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,800
Prue and Paul have
made their decision.

1410
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,280
I don't want to get emotional.

1411
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,640
No, come on.

1412
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,080
Well done, bakers.

1413
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:45,000
Luckily, I've got the amazing job
of announcing the first Star Baker.

1414
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,920
And the Star Baker this
week...

1415
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,320
..is...

1416
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,440
..Jurgen.

1417
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,840
Well, I have a job that no-one
wants, and it's a real shame because

1418
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:10,080
we've only just met and we're
already losing one of the gang.

1419
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:15,680
I'm sorry to say that the first
person to be leaving us is...

1420
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,520
..Tom.

1421
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,720
Absolutely, that's fair enough.

1422
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,360
Did not go to plan at all!

1423
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,360
Oh, dear.

1424
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,760
Hey. Thank you very much.

1425
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:43,520
I always have been harder on myself
than I really should be,

1426
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:46,960
but I definitely am proud of myself,
and I never say that.

1427
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
So that must mean quite a bit.

1428
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,600
But I'm mostly going to miss
spending time with all the lovely

1429
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:52,800
other bakers, to be honest.

1430
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,120
They're really talented
and absolutely lovely people,

1431
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,360
so I'm so going to miss hanging out
with them every day.

1432
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:01,800
You see, you can do it, can't you?
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1433
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,280
I was absolutely thinking
I was going to go first.

1434
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:07,360
But I'm really sad for Tom.
He's such a gentleman.

1435
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,680
I love him,
he's so... such a nice man.

1436
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,760
George, lift it up a bit.

1437
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,000
I'm in shock.

1438
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,480
I'm just so pleased that the judges
have seen something in my baking

1439
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,240
and I'm here for another week.

1440
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,040
Well done, Jurgen.
Well done, Jurgen.

1441
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,480
Fantastic. Thank you, thank you
very much. So good.

1442
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,560
Thank you. Really, really good.
Thank you.

1443
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,240
It is incredible.

1444
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,200
It is incredible. Uh,
before, I thought, "Star Baker, hm,

1445
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,880
"doesn't matter too much,"
but I feel so... Woo!

1446
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,840
Well done! I'm so excited, yes.

1447
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:48,000
LINE RINGS

1448
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,760
Nobody at home.

1449
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,880
Next time...

1450
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,520
Good luck, my little pretties.

1451
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,680
..it's biscuit week.

1452
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,160
I'm sure talking to them helps.

1453
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,800
With a delicate signature...
Oh!

1454
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,720
..that could see the bakers snap.

1455
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,200
This is killing me.

1456
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,240
A deliciously nostalgic Technical...

1457
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,520
Who makes biscuits that you can
buy in the shop?

1458
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,160
Why?!
Get a tub for 11p, can't you?

1459
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,000
..and show-stopping...
Oh, no.

1460
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,520
..interactive...

1461
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,560
ALL: Oh!
..all-biscuit toys.

1462
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,360
If it collapses, it collapses.

1463
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,680
Ah!

1464
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,840
Please don't fall.

1465
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,000
Oh!
Oh.

1466
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,040
Oh, no!

1467
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:52,880
