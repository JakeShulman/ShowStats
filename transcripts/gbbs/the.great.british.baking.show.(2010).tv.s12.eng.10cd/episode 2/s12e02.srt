[Matt] You excited for biscuit week?

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,180
Of course I'm excited.
I mean, I'm a biscuit. I'm over the moon.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,300
Mmm, yeah.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,060
Hey, who's that fella over there?
He looks familiar.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,660
-[Matt] Oh.
-[Noel] Off the telly.

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,660
Yeah, he's quite dishy in real life.

8
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,820
Lovely blue eyes.

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,900
Eh, what's he looking at us like that for?

10
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,420
-[Matt] Ooh.
-[Noel] All salivating.

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,100
He's getting a bit close, isn't he?

12
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,940
[Matt] Ooh, what's going on?

14
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,780
Oh, I suppose I'll have to introduce
the show on me own now.

[Lizzie] They're not bubbling

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,520
I'm never making brandy snaps again.

Oh, it collapsed.

37

Shoot 'em. [chuckles]

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,200
[Giuseppe] Week two, ready to go.

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,760
I'm feeling strangely confident today

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,360
{\an8}which could be a good signâ¦
[chuckling] or the beginning of the end.

43
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,800
{\an8}[Jairzeno] I'm not pleased
with how the first week went.

44
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,520
{\an8}It was just bad time management.

45
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,719
Hopefully, today it'll be nice and smooth.

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,280
-It'll be polished.
-[Rochica] Good luck, guys.

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,760
{\an8}Biscuit week.
It's exciting. It's also terrifying.

48
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,720
Biscuits are hard.
Sneaky little blighters.

49
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,520
[Amanda] I bake biscuits at home.
They normally take me three days,

50
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,720
{\an8}so not gonna
get away with that here. [chuckles]

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,400
Good morning, bakers.
Welcome back to the tent for biscuit week.

52
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,320
Oh, my God, I love biscuits.
I once ate 119 biscuits.

53
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,080
-What, in one sitting?
-No, sporadically over 14 years.

54
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,480
[all laughing]

55
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,320
[Matt] For your signature challenge,

56
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,840
the judges would like you
to bake a batch of 24 brandy snaps.

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,960
The judges are looking
for perfectly baked lace biscuits.

58
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,000
Have to be identical,
have to have a good snap.

59
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,400
Your snaps can be any shape
but should be coated, dipped or filled.

60
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,280
You have two hours.

61
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,480
On your marks.

62
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,200
-Get set.
-Bake.

63
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,120
Got me fast shoes on today,
so moving like the speed of light.

64
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,080
{\an8}I'm feeling calm.
Just anything can happen, right?

65
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,720
{\an8}Brandy snaps,
they're not the easiest thing to make.

66
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,480
[Maggie] Who can't make
a crispy identical lace biscuit?

67
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,680
{\an8}Yes, easy peasy.

68
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,280
[Prue] I make brandy snaps quite often,

69
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,560
but they never last in my house
because they are just so delicious.

70
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,840
What I'd like to see
is 24 identical, perfect brandy snaps.

71
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,080
But lots of things can go wrong.

72
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,440
This is all about batch baking.

73
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,920
The key thing
is to get your brandy snap quite lacy.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,280
You want those holes in there to create
that traditional brandy snap look.

75
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,040
It's all about textures for me.

76
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,080
It's about a crispy brandy snap
and a beautifully soft interior.

77
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,320
Whatever filling they choose,
there's going to be a danger

78
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,640
of the moisture in the filling
sogging up the biscuit.

79
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,200
It's not a brandy snap if it doesn't snap.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,520
-[Paul] Hello, Lizzie.
-Hello.

81
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,920
So, Lizzie, brandy snaps.
Tell us about them.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,560
So my brandy snaps are based on
my favourite fast food chain apple pie.

83
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,360
It's piping hot,
could burn your mouth, like, to the sun.

84
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,360
Has it been deep fried by any chance?

85
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
Yes, it has.

86
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,600
-Ermâ¦ [chuckles]
-We know what you mean.

87
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,480
And my dog likes a little, er, kids meal.

88
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,800
[Lizzie] Come on, Prue.

<i>caramelised in calvados.</i>

96
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,720
Yesterday,
were you in the tent practising these?

97
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,160
-Ermâ¦ [sighs]
-Oh.

98
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,320
-[Lizzie] I showed up to practise.
-Yeah.

99
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,000
And I put on
a famous film with a wizard in.

100
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,200
-Oh, let me guess. <i>Harry Potter?</i>
-Oh, yeah.

101
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,680
[Matt] So, you didn't do any baking?

102
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,320
No. Just watched <i>Harry Potter.</i>

103
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,160
-What a wonderful use of your time.
-[chuckles]

104
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,520
[Crystelle] Right, apples.

105
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,800
[Noel] <i>But Lizzie's snaps</i>
<i>face stiff competition.</i>

Battle of the apples.

107
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,400
[Crystelle] This is apple cider vinegar.

108
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,520
{\an8}It's quite sharp but I just think

109
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,520
{\an8}it just gives it a bit of that
kind of non-sweetness, which I want.

110
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,520
Erm, Prue said my mini rolls
were a bit sweet last week,

111
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,480
so I'm trying to take on her feedback

You a wrestler?

-Turns into a wrestling match.

-Basically. Ermâ¦
-You ever attacked them?

123

No, but once
we were playing the trust game

124
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,320
where you have to fall back.
And I said, "Guys catch me"

and they just both walked past and I fell.

126

-Awful, I know.
-Off a building.

Apple brandy, apple pie.
Makes sense, doesn't it? Logic.

[Maggie] I'm a very traditional baker.

135

So, my brandy snaps
are traditional brandy snaps.

136
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,560
I think sometimes things
get so over-sophisticated

137

that it's quite nice to see something

[Maggie] This is my brandy snap.

146
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,920
It's just important the sugar melts
really evenly and that it doesn't boil.

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,040
It's a matter of being patient.
Do not rush it at the end.

I'm gonna try and infuse
some of the cream with mastic.

152
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,840
Mastic is from a tree resin that grows
on the Greek island called Chios.

And Chios is where my mum's mum's from.

the stem ginger into the Chantilly cream.

295
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,880
<i>â¦but textures too.</i>

296
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,480
-[Amanda] And chopped-up ginger.
-[Jairzeno] This is ganache.

297
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,560
Put in more chocolate,
hopefully helps to thicken it up.

298
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,080
[Crystelle] This is my crumble.

299
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,240
It'll have the bite from the crumble,

300
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,880
and then the apples, I want them
to cook down to not like a mush.

301
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,920
Crystelle's got this lovely little
crumble texture going on.

302
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Whereas mine's soft baby mush.

303
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,600
Like one congealed mess.

304
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,080
[Rochica] I'm making
a chocolate Irish cream filling.

305
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,680
I've just added the Irish cream.
There is plenty in here.

306
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,640
I'm measuring out
the spices for my chai crÃ¨me pat.

307
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,360
{\an8}Erm, I did a few experiments

308
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,360
{\an8}to get chai flavour into crÃ¨me pat.

309
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,320
I'm using insane amounts.

310
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,080
About 50 grams of cinnamon.
Almost two jars.

311
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,800
[Noel] <i>JÃ¼rgen went</i>

314

<i>Last week's Star Baker,</i>

315

<i>JÃ¼rgen's chai spices,</i>
<i>cinnamon, cardamom and clove,</i>

316
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,400

<i>and crÃ¨me patisserie filling.</i>

317
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,200
[JÃ¼rgen] This is my crÃ¨me pat.
I've got starch.

318
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,400
Starch wraps around
protein strands of the egg yolk,

319
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,000
and, er, prevents it from curdling.

320
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,480
I'm a physicist by training.
The curious scientific mind is there.

321
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,040
Now I'm at the critical stage
where the crÃ¨me pat is thickening.

322
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,160
I have just added hazelnut butter
to chocolate crÃ¨me pat.

323
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,440
Hopefully, I got the ratio right.

324
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,840
These are gianduja snaps.

325
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,360
One of my favourite
ice cream flavours as a kid.

326
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,760
[Matt] <i>From a family</i>
<i>of professional chefs,</i>

327
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,440

<i>that Giuseppe discovered his love of food.</i>

328
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,400
[Giuseppe] Is it good?

329
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,400
[Matt] <i>A passion his children Alberto,</i>
<i>Ricardo and Georgio also share.</i>

330
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,720
Victory!

331
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,920
{\an8}[Matt] <i>Giuseppe will pipe</i>
<i>swirls of gianduja crÃ¨me pÃ¢tissiÃ¨re</i>

332
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,680
{\an8}<i>into brandy snap baskets</i>

333
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,280
{\an8}<i>which he'll also flavour</i>
<i>with chopped roasted hazelnuts.</i>

334
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,280
You've started your batches
of the brandy snaps already.

335
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,560
The crÃ¨me pat is cooling down.
It's done. Now I'm starting offâ¦

336
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,320
-[Prue] First batch of snaps.
-[Giuseppe] Exactly.

337
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,800
Can you get it all out in time,
cool and ready?

338
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,440
It's a very odd way
of starting with your crÃ¨me pat.

339
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,160
But I needed that to be the case

340
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,080
because if it doesn't
cool down sufficiently, it'll melt.

341
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,360
But you won't get the brandy snap
which is the key part.

342
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,480
[Giuseppe] Hopefully.

343
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,040
I don't think
we should stop you doing anything.

344
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,080
We should go away and let you get on.

345
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,800
-Thank you, guys.
-Thank you.

346
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,280
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

347
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,760
You've worked your timings out,
don't listen to those two.

348
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,680
Sure.

349
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,600
Yeah, it's risky, admittedly,
but this is the Bake Off after all.

350
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,400
Uh, it needs to be ambitious,
otherwise there would be no point.

351
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,400
Bakers, you haveâ¦
[sing-song] half an hour.

352
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,400
[both] <i>âª Half an hour, half an hour âª</i>

353
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,440
[sighs]

354
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,280
First batch in,
now we play the waiting game.

355
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,080
These are my last four.
I'm happy with how they look.

356
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,000
-Finally we've got some cones going on.
-These have just stuck.

357
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,560
Come on, little brandy snaps,
you can do this.

358
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,600
I had loads of oil and they came off
perfect the first time.

359
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,080
[JÃ¼rgen] Last batch,
I'm very happy with them.

360
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,200
They have the lacy appearance
like stained-glass windows.

361
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,600
[Jairzeno] Hopefully,
I get a nice tart shape.

362
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,120
It's quite fiddly,
'cause you need to use your hands a lot.

363
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,000
-That's okay, just keep going.
-[Giuseppe] Next in.

364
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,320
[gasps]

365
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,120
Shush!

366
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,040
These look like Paul Hollywood's fingers.

367
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,320
[both laugh]

368
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,960
That's why he doesn't make brandy snaps,
'cause when he picks them up,

369
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,880
he can't tell what's what.

370
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,920
-[Maggie] Hang on, look at these hands.
-[Noel] You've got baker's hands.

371
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,520
-I've got builder's hands. Yes.
-Builder'sâ¦ [laughs]

372
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,800
I'm dipping the ends into the chocolate.
Now I'm gonna fill 'em.

373
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,520
[Rochica] I might need to do this again.

374
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
I am just making my filling again.

375
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,280
I think I over-whipped the last one.
I need to just chill.

376
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,240
And stop rushing. Stressing.

377
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,280
[Matt] <i>Rochica's not the only one</i>
<i>starting from scratch.</i>

378
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,680
It's like butter. I don't wanna
use the cream I've made

379
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,000
'cause it's a bit over-whipped.
Time's against me.

380
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,039
I was hoping to be piping
everything by now.

381
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,640
[Giuseppe] I've got
my last batch in the oven.

382
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,880
If I make it, it's gonna be by a second.

383
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,200
-[Chigs] George!
-I ain't got enough time, man.

384
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,920
You have. You've got this, bruv.

385
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:42,240
-Bakers, you have 15 minutes.
-Do we? [guffaws]

386
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Brilliant.

387
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,519
[laughs] Gotta laugh, haven't you?

388
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,680
I'm never making brandy snaps again.

389
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,600
-This is looking a lot better.
-[Freya] This looks really nice.

390
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,400
The praline is exactly how I hoped.

391
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,760
Check this out, this gun here.
Is that purely from baking?

392
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,720
Well, what my colleague used to say,

393
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,360
I've got it not only here,
I've got it here as well.

394
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,720
[laughs boisterously]

395
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,240
[Maggie] Ooh, got the shakes.

396
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,680
This is just melted chocolate
and it's just to seal the bottom.

397
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,160
The moisture of the cream would melt
the sugar of the basket,

398
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,920
so the chocolate is there
mainly to prevent that.

399
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,520
With the added bonus
of an additional flavour.

400
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,800
I'm putting a layer of the ganache
into each tart case,

401
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,040
then I'll put a layer
of passion fruit curd.

402
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,320
Oh, no, this is disaster.
It's got a bit of ginger in there.

403
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,720
It's blocking the cream.

404
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,960
Oh, man, move it.

405
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,560
-Right, come on, come on, come on.
-How long do I have?

406
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,560
-Bakers, you have one minute left.
-[gasps]

407
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,880
-[George] Oh, get out of the way.
-Come on, George. You can do it.

408
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,480
Oh, sugar. This is terrible.

409
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,240
[JÃ¼rgen] Mango brings a freshness
balancing against the rich spices.

410
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,080
I weighed them all out
and they're still different sizes.

411
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,760
[Crystelle] I'm trying to do
the ugliest ones at the back.

412
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,160
I'm done.

413
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,640
[George] Oh, God,
this cream's going everywhere.

414
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,000
How many have I got now?

415
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,360
-[Giuseppe] There's one, two, threeâ¦
-[exhales]

416
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,600
Bakers, your time is up.

417
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,360
-Oh, done.
-Please step away from your bakes.

418
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,480
-[Chigs] Done it?
-Done it.

419
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,160
-[Freya] Do they look like a cappuccino?
-Yeah, lovely.

420
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,560
-I just hope it's tasty enough.
-Yeah.

421
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,720
-That's all it's all about.
-Yeah.

422
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,640
[Noel] <i>The bakers' brandy snaps</i>

423
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,220

<i>the judgement of Paul and Prue.</i>

424
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,540
-[Prue] Hello, Freya.
-Hi.

425
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,060
{\an8}I think they look absolutely scrumptious.

426
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,460
Oh, thank you.

427
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,780
[Paul] They do look quite dark.
Have you got coffee in the snaps?

428
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,260
Yeah, little bit of coffee liqueur.

429
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,060
-[Paul] Nice lace on it though.
-[Prue] A good snap on top.

430
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,740
Hmm, nice flavour.

431
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,140
Quite strong coffee,
maybe even a tiny bit too strong.

432
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,380
How many espressos did you put in there?

433
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,700
-Eight tablespoons.
-Sorry?

434
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,500
-Eight tablespoons?
-I like a lot of coffee.

435
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,500
You needed waking up.
You were steaming drunk last night.

436
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,500
It's not that bad. I love it.

437
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,380
For me, it's just
a little bit too much coffee,

438
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,420
but overall, I think
you've done a decent job.

439
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,540
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

440
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,900

with the cold method?

441
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,820
[Amanda] I did.

442
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,700
[Paul] They're very thin
so therefore they're very delicate.

443
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,060
The whole shape of it is falling apart.

444
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,780
But the flavour is absolutely delicious.

445
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,700
Thank you.

446
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,180
[Paul] Stem ginger with the sesame seedâ¦

447
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,580
-Mmm.
-[Prue] It's really lovely.

448
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,700
I would like to just squinch that up,
'cause it doesn't look very good,

449
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,100
and have it for pudding.

450
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,860
-You would, wouldn't you?
-Oh, I would.

451
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,140
Thank you.

452
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,900
Told you he liked ginger, didn't I?

453
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,140
-You did.
-[Matt] Yeah.

454
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,860
{\an8}[Paul] They're a little bit messy.

455
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,220
The laid-back thing, I'm beginning
to see this in some of your work.

456
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,980
[Jairzeno] There was a bit of rushing
in the last 15 minutes, soâ¦

457
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,740
-[Paul] We've had that before, haven't we?
-We have.

458
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,060
I didn't think the chocolate would go
with those fruit flavours, but it does.

459
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,540
I just think that
the flavours are too strong.

460
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,100
-Oh.
-I mean, I couldn't eat a whole one.

461
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,220
The idea was sound, but not well-executed.

462
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,140
Hmm.

463
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,500
{\an8}-[Paul] Massive variety in size.
-I did weigh them out so I'm not sure.

464
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,420
[Prue] Some of them
are longer than the others.

465
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,340
[Paul] You've got the Irish cream, coffee,
chocolate and hazelnut.

466
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,540
-I think it's delicious.
-[Prue] And some booze.

467
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,860
Yeah, I added an extra tablespoon.
Thought you might like that.

468
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,020
You're right. You've got me in one.
Well done, Rochica.

469
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,980
{\an8}-[Prue] Hello, George.
-Hello.

470
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,020
Bit irregular in size. Every one of them.

471
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,260
[crunching]

472
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,300
Mmm.

473
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,260
-That's mastika.
-[Paul] Orange blossom and mastika.

474
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,580
The flavours together work very well.

475
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,260
My issue is they just look a mess.

476
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,020
I'm a perfectionist,
and I really dislike serving that up.

477
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,140
-Wellâ¦
-Yeah.

478
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,740
You should take comfort in the fact
that they are original and sensational.

479
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,860
-[Paul] Thanks, George.
-Yeah, thank you.

480
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,740
-Sensational. Oh, God.
-[Matt] Yeah.

481
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,060
-There you go.
-I nearly fell over.

482
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,460
-[Matt] Well done.
-Cheers.

483
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,300
-[Prue] Hello, Crystelle.
-Hello.

484
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,740
I saw you saying a little prayer then.

485
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,740
Yeah, I was absolutely panicking. [laughs]

486
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,620
-Lovely snap.
-The flavour combination's beautiful.

487
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,100
That lovely crunch
from the crumble and the apples

488
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,380
with that little hint of cinnamon.

489
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,260
-You've done well with the flavours.
-[Prue] And the textures.

490
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,780
Thank you so much. Thanks.

491
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,060
{\an8}[Paul] What's that on the top?

492
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,340
{\an8}That's the fast food
clagginess that you get.

493
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,540
The congealed stuff.

494
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,620
Oh, delicious.

495
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,500
Well, I don't know
how to make it sound nice.

496
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,660
-Well, don't say "congealed."
-They're the words that come to me head.

497
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,220
-[Paul] There's very little lace in there.
-Yeah.

498
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,660
But it is delicious. That does
taste of apple. It tastes of brandy.

499
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,100
-[Paul] The crÃ¨me diplomat's nice.
-Altogether it's a lovely mouthful.

500
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,060
-[Paul] Thank you very much.
-Ta.

501
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,060
{\an8}[Prue] That's really pretty.

502
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,460
I think they look very elegant,
pretty uniform in colour,

503
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,980
nice lace as well in the brandy snap.

504
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,980
Let's see what it tastes like.

505
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,180
The brandy snap is delicious,
crisp, nicely flavoured.

506
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,380
[Paul] Chocolate doesn't
come through massively strong.

507
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,700
So what's happened is
it's sort of lost its way.

508
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,220
You do get this blast of hazelnut,
but otherwise, you've done very well.

509
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,500
-Cheers, guys.
-[Prue] Well done.

510
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,020
{\an8}[Prue] They're nice and lacy.

511
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,820
[Paul] The chocolate comes through,
the brandy snap's got a lovely snap.

512
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,620
Just the right amount of sweetness
in there as well.

513
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,900
The cream's okay, but you've lost
a little bit of the coffee flavour.

514
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,100
-It's just a little bit weak.
-Fair enough.

515
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,980
-Very good.
-Thank you very much.

516
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,700
{\an8}[Prue] They're very small

517
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,260
{\an8}and they could have had
a more colour on them.

518
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,460
I'm really quite disappointed.

519
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,300
[Prue] Because you've done a traditionalâ¦

520
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,860
-[Maggie] Yes.
-â¦filled brandy snap.

521
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,060
-The cream has sogged up the brandy snap.
-Yes.

522
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,540
Which weren't quite baked enough anyway
so they're really chewy.

523
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,780
-Right.
-But they are delicious.

524
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,060
[Paul] I love the tanginess
from the blackcurrant,

525
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,100
but, um, the practicalities really
haven't worked out very well.

526
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,980
No indeed,
and that's what's disappointing.

527
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,700
-Onwards and upwards.
-[laughs]

528
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,140
Thank you very much.

529
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,820
{\an8}[Paul] Overall, they look pretty good.

530
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,900
[Prue] Nice and even.
They are lovely and thin.

531
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,380
-[crunches]
-[Matt] I hear a crunch.

532
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,420
-[Prue] Mmm-hmm.
-I can.

533
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,620
The blend of the spices,

534
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,300
the cardamom and the cinnamon
work beautifully well.

535
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,820
It's so easy to get it wrong
by putting too much in,

536
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,620
it overwhelms either the brandy snap
or the cream.

537
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,780
But it just doesn't. I think
texture-wise, you've done well as well.

538
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,220
The crÃ¨me pat's perfect.
It's not too stodgy.

539
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,700
-I think you've done well on that. Yeah.
-[Prue] Mmm.

540
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,780
[Paul] Thank you, JÃ¼rgen.

541
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,380
-I'm just gonna try a bit myself.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Yes.

542
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,460
-It means nothing from me.
-It means a lot for me.

543
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,020
-Oh, you can come back. Thank you.
-Welcome.

544
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,660
[JÃ¼rgen] Couldn't have gone better.

545
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,100
It was definitely worth
developing the spice chai crÃ¨me pat.

546
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,580
Which took a lot of time, was amazing.

547
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,700
Flavour's good. They liked the clagginess,
which is what I was after.

548
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,340
Maybe I shouldâ¦ I need a vocabulary.

549
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,860
So I canâ¦ Is it, not a vocabularâ¦

550
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,500
What's a dictionâ¦ Like the dictionâ¦
Thesaurus, I need a thesaurus.

551
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,740
We won't just expand on baking,
we'll expand my mind.

552
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,820
[Giuseppe] The comments were very positive
and, uh, very constructive.

553
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,620
This is a good step
in the right direction.

554
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,100
Prue used the word "sensational."

555
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,060
In my head all I've got is,
uh, "they didn't look right."

556
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,420
But she really liked it.

557
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,580
[Jairzeno] The finish was rushed
because I was rushing at the end,

558
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,220
so if I was judging, I would agree
with them about the messiness.

559
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,900
Well, it was a bit of a disaster, really.

560
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,620
In the technical this afternoon.

561
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,300
I can only go up from here,
there is no going down.

562
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,940
[Matt] <i>Biscuit week isn't about to get</i>
<i>any easier for our 11 bakers</i>

563
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,900
<i>who now face a mystery</i>
<i>shrouded in gingham.</i>

564
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,820
Bakers, it's time
for your technical challenge

565
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,500
which today has been set by Paul.

566
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,700
-Paul, any words of advice?
-[all chuckle]

567
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,100
This is pretty straightforward,
but read your recipe.

568
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,620
We want perfection.

569
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,020
[Matt] As ever, this task is judged blind,

570
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,140
so we will ask Paul and Prue
to leave the tent.

571
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,580
[Noel] Bye-bye.

572
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,060
What I don't understand

573
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,660
is Paul's standing there,
scowling at everyone.

574
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,700
-Why doesn't he just tell 'em what to do?
-He's got a lot on his mind.

575
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,700
Like what?

576
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,500
He's deciding whether to watch
<i>Fast &amp; Furious 6</i> or <i>The Expendables 3.</i>

577
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
[all laugh]

578
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,740
Bakers, for your technical challenge,

579
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,300
Paul would like you
to make that childhood favourite,

580
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,900
the sandwiched jammy biscuit.

581
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,260
Made up of two perfectly-baked
short and tender biscuits,

582
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,900
perfectly set jam and smooth buttercream.

583
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,180
We would like you to make 12 biscuits.

584
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,460
You have one hour and 45 minutes.

585
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,700
-[Noel] On your marksâ¦
-Get setâ¦

586
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,020
[Noel] Bake.

587
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,020
[Chigs] I've had jam biscuits,
the sandwich ones.

588
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,500
I think I know what I'm doing.
Just need to make sure they're perfect.

589
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,260
[Rochica] I've never made jammy biscuits,
but I have eaten them.

590
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,580
I kind of know what I'm looking for.

591
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,860
[Amanda] Who makes biscuits
you can buy in the shop?

592
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,540
You can get a tub for 11p, can't you?

593
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,820
Paul, jammy biscuits, why?

594
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,380
I think jammy biscuits should
be a very familiar biscuit to the bakers

595
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,580
and I thought it'd be a great challenge.

596
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,340
The recipe is pretty straightforward,

597
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,780
but you gotta get
all the elements spot-on.

598
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,860
We've given the bakers stamps to get
that definition in those lines and swirls.

599
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,980
And how you get the definition
is chilling the biscuit dough down.

600
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,980
If it's soft when you press it,
you're going to lose that ridge.

601
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,620
And obviously we're looking
for the same thickness.

602
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,500
You don't want a thin top and a fat base.

603
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,620
And what about texture?
Is it a shortbread?

604
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,380
It is. When you bite in,
you have that gorgeous biscuit

605
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,220
that snaps in the mouth
and that buttery flavour inside.

606
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,420
See, the jam cuts the sweetness a bit.

607
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,020
That's really lovely.
I thought this was a simple biscuit.

608
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,020
It's deceptively difficult.
It's quite a warm day.

609
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,180
It's all to do
with the temperature of the dough.

610
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,140
-They've gotta use the fridge.
-It's not that hot.

611
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,500
Well, for you. You're South African.

612
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,540
Paul said,
"Read the recipe very carefully."

613
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,060
So I'm trying to ponder
on every single word.

614
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,460
I think he's taking the mickey when
he said read your instructions. That's it.

615
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,540
They want you to be in the know-know,
but you don't know.

616
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,500
The first thing to do is make
a smooth raspberry jam.

617
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,300
Put the jam, sugar in there,
and all the raspberries.

618
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,340
I'm not a jam maker. I'm a jam eater.
I don't even eat that much jam, either.

619
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,780
I'll leave that to heat up
and get all mushy.

620
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,220
So I'm now just on to me biscuits
while me jam heats up.

621
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,500
Next thing says, "Make the biscuit dough."

622
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,180
Easy peasy.

623
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,700
Given the order
the ingredients are listed,

624
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,780
I think the creaming method
will work best for this one.

625
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,580
[Freya] Ooh, bit fast.

626
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,260
And the creaming
of the butter incorporates air.

627
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,300
Soon as that's light and fluffy
I'm gonna add the egg vanilla extract

628
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,660
and then I'm gonna sift the cornflour

629
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,420
and the flour together
and then I'll put that in last.

630
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,420
What does a tender biscuit mean?
I've heard of a short biscuit.

631
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,660
But a tender biscuit?

632
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,620
Yeah, I don't know what he's on about.

633
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,820
-Sensitive biscuit. Sensitive, tenderâ¦
-Yeah. Yeah.

634
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,860
-Emotional.
-Bit like me.

635
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,740
I'm just concerned.
This batter's literally wet.

636
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,140
I want it to be a lot firmer.

637
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,020
Because it's hot in here
the butter's really soft.

638
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,220
I'm gonna chill it down for a bit.

639
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,780
You've got to rest it for a while
before it gets workable

640
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,100
to get the butter solid again.

641
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,020
It's in there.

642
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,220
Jam is almost at jam temperature.
I'm just gonna let that bubble.

643
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,340
The setting point is about
105 degrees Celsius.

644
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,700
So I reached that
and I did a setting test.

645
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,500
If you put a drop of jam
onto the bowl, you nudge the drop,

646
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,980
you get this kind of skin ripple,
that should be perfect.

647
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:20,060
[Rochica] Oh, no. I just burnt it.
I wasn't paying attention.

648
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,220
I can't use that.

649
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,700
I'm just gonna start again.
And hopefully I won't burn this one.

650
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,900
They want a smooth
raspberry jam, so no bits.

651
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,940
[JÃ¼rgen] The jam should set,
fingers crossed.

652
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,020
[Crystelle] That is the amount
of jam I have. What?

653
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,220
I cooked it to the jam temperature.
I think. Not very much, is it?

654
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,140
[Matt] Bakers, you are halfway through.

655
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,460
[Freya] It says roll out the doughâ¦
[Lizzie] Using the "flutteredâ¦"

656
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,860
I think that's how you pronounce it.

657
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,420
"Use the fluted cutter
to create 24 rounds."

658
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,220
Fluted. Oh, okay. Fluted cutter.

659
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,340
[George] Is that fluted?

660
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,580
That must be fluted,
'cause that's just round.

661
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,060
[Lizzie] Learn a new word every day.

662
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,100
I think I can just about
get 12 biscuits on one sheet.

663
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,540
[Crystelle] It's such a soft dough.

664
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,860
I have no idea
how I'm gonna cut out circles of this.

665
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,860
[Freya] It's so hot in here.
The butter's just completely melting.

666
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,900
I'm just gonna throw them
back in the freezer again.

667
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,820
I'm chilling the dough
to get it stiff enough to work with.

668
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,660
[Amanda] I'd like the dough to be harder.
It's still quite soft.

669
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,380
Just need to keep an eye on that jam
because I don't want to burn it again.

670
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,020
Gonna start rolling the dough out.

671
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,380
Okay, "Make the buttercream."
Lots of detail, as always.

672
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:39,060
He's emphasised in the recipe, "smooth."
He's in smooth mode.

673
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,900
[JÃ¼rgen] The longer you beat it,
the smoother it will become.

674
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,940
I'm gonna beat this
until the cows come home.

675
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,540
[Rochica gasps] Fluted. Oh, no.

676
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,700
I've cut them round and not fluted.

677
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,660
-Bakers, you have--
-Whoa, what are you doing?

678
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,340
I'm gonna tell 'em
how long they've got left.

679
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,940
No, don't do that.
No spoilers, I'm watching the show.

680
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,580
-[Noel] I've gotta tell--
-[Matt] No, don'tâ¦

681
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,860
Okay, cover your ears.

682
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,740
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

683
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,420
Yeah. No spoilers, please.

684
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,020
Okay. I've got to go back to the biscuits.

685
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,900
-[Amanda] It's quite cold.
-[Giuseppe] Set enough.

686
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,820
[JÃ¼rgen] "Using the biscuit stamp,
emboss the biscuits."

687
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,820
-Ah, yes.
-[Lizzie] It is quite cool, isn't it?

688
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,100
The biscuit dough was sticking
to the stamp, so I've floured it.

689
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,020
Why?

690
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,100
With a heart-shaped cutter,
stamp a single heart shape

691
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,140
out of the centre
of 12 of your stamped rounds.

692
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,980
They're so soft I can't get it out.
It's like mashed potato.

693
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,420
[Noel] <i>Turning out biscuits with</i>
<i>perfectly-defined hearts and swirlsâ¦</i>

694
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,460
[George] What is this? What is this?

695
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,900
.<i>..will be nigh on impossible.</i>

696
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,940
[Crystelle] It's very soft, but I should
get them in the oven.

697
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,740
[Noel] <i>Unless their dough is chilled</i>
<i>to a firm texture before it's baked.</i>

698
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,060
[Giuseppe]
There is so much butter in there.

699
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,500
If you put it straight in the oven
the whole dough will collapse.

700
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,060
I'll stick these in the freezer.

701
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,140
[Giuseppe] This is the trickiest part.
If I rush this, I will ruin it.

702
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,420
Although if I look around the room

703
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,620
I can see people
sticking stuff in the oven

704
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,220
and that's getting me anxious.

705
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,260
[George] I'm going in the oven.

706
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,780
[Maggie] I would like to have them
in the freezer before I cook them.

707
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,780
But I don't want to run out of time.

708
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,340
And I'm going to bake them
for six minutes.

709
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,660
I feel like these biscuits
can't catch any colour.

710
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,180
They're very pale, aren't they?
Anaemic biscuits?

711
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,580
I just have to wait. This is killing me.

712
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,340
[Freya] I'm doing the same as you--

713
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,460
Let's not open it,
let's wait for two minutes.

714
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,140
{\an8}[Noel] You've written
your own notes on Paul's recipe?

715
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,060
{\an8}-Are you just writing bottom?
-[Maggie] Went in at bottom at three.

716
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:30,060
Paul Hollywood's bottom.
I've seen it. It's like two beige moons.

717
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,660
Dancing in the sky.

718
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,300
Take this man away.

719
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,820
I'm far too old to cope with that.

720
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,460
-Although the thought is rather nice.
-[both laughing]

721
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,460
This biscuit dough is so soft. Oh, no.

722
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,900
I might have to try stamping them
afterwards and see what happens.

723
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,500
I need to cut a heart out.
This challenge is so deceitful.

724
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,220
It's nice and cold in that freezer.

725
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,460
[JÃ¼rgen] I'll put them in the oven.
It should keep definition.

726
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,540
I'm gonna have a go.

727
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,100
[JÃ¼rgen] It's 150 degrees
so it's not too hot.

728
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,860
I'll check in five minutes.

729
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,780
[timer beeping]

730
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,540
-You having a daydream then?
-No, I'm just waiting for the biscuits.

731
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,820
[Noel] I thought you were thinking,

732
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,100
"if I pull this tent down
and push Giuseppe over,

733
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:22,820
I'll go down in history
as the most disruptive baker."

734
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,140
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

735
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,620
[Lizzie] Oh, no.

736
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,900
I'm going in for eight minutes.
And I've bumped it up to 160.

737
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,980
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

738
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:41,619
-[Lizzie] This is awful, George.
-It's a horrible challenge.

739
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,420
-Matt, come here.
-[Matt] Yeah?

740
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,579
-Look how tidy this is.
-[Matt] Wow.

741
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,900
And look, shambles.

742
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,539
-It's a mess.
-[Crystelle] What are you saying about me?

743
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,380
That your whole work area
is an absolute shambles.

744
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,019
-It's devastating. Look at this bench.
-She's not allowed to look.

745
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:58,140
-Yeah, you're not allowed to look.
-[JÃ¼rgen] She's not allowed to look.

746
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,740
[Lizzie] Coming out,
they haven't really got a swirl.

747
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,500
They are coming out now
whether they like it or not.

748
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:06,500
I think they're done. [exclaims]

749
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:09,220
Oh, my God. What's wrong with you?
Don't panic.

750
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,260
-[Crystelle] I'm not panicking.
-[Noel] You only lost one.

751
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,700
[Crystelle] And I've got a few spares.

752
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,500
Yeah. They look all right.

753
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:18,099
They're a bit pale,
but if I wait any longer,

754
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,940
I probably won't be able to finish them.

755
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:21,860
[Chigs] I'm gonna have to
sacrifice the swirl.

756
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,540
[Maggie] They've just got to be cold.

757
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,340
If they're hot, the buttercream
is just gonna go bleurgh.

758
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,780
[Rochica] They're not baking that well.

759
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,260
-[JÃ¼rgen] Happy.
-[Giuseppe] That'll do.

760
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,500
[Amanda] They won't take long to cool,
they're really thin.

761
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,620
[Rochica] Hmm. Gonna cut it fine.

762
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,060
How long have we got left?

763
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,860
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

764
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,140
Yeah, I'm gonna go back in.
I'd rather have a baked biscuit.

765
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,180
"To serve, sandwich the biscuits

766
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,220
with a layer of buttercream
and a layer of jam."

767
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,900
Putting the buttercream on atom by atom.

768
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,300
Look at the colour of this jam.
It's beautiful.

769
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,700
[Crystelle] Man, I can't believe
this happened to my jam.

770
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,740
I've never handled jam like this
in my life.

771
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,100
Bakers, you have one minute left.

772
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,460
Dust with icing sugar,
leaving the heart visible.

773
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,740
-[Freya] I just need to dust.
-Come on, come on, come on.

774
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,100
[JÃ¼rgen] Yeah, good, I think.

775
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,780
These are so dodgy.
And I'm never, ever making these again.

776
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,380
[Rochica] Ah! Terrible.

777
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,780
Size is a bit different, but they're here.

778
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,020
[Rochica] Yeah,
they're still a bit doughy.

779
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:33,540
Bakers, your time is up.

780
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,020
Step away from your bakes.

781
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,300
-Cheers.
-[Crystelle] Cheers.

782
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,500
Oh. JÃ¼rgen's tucking in.

783
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,700
-[Noel] Good?
-They're awful, but they're done.

784
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,260
Please bring your biscuits
down to the gingham table.

785
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,660
-That be a lot of biscuits.
-[Noel] A lot of biscos.

786
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,100
[Matt] <i>Paul and Prue are expecting</i>
<i>12 uniform short jammy biscuits</i>

787
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,300
<i>with clearly-defined swirls and hearts,</i>

788
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,460
<i>deliciously tart raspberry jam</i>
<i>and ultra-smooth buttercream.</i>

789
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,580
<i>And they have no idea whose is whose.</i>

790
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,500
Right, shall we start over here?

791
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,180
-[Prue] They've lost a lot of definition.
-[Paul] And they're different sizes.

792
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:24,980
The top ones aren't so well baked
which is why the bottom ones are smaller.

793
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,900
The texture's there, it's crumbly.

794
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,140
And you have the set jam and buttercream.

795
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,020
It's just an issue with the look.

796
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,260
Okay, moving on to number two,
it's lost some of its shape.

797
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,460
Quite flat, aren't they? See the
difference with the top and the bottom?

798
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,940
-[Prue] That's been rolled too thinly.
-[Paul] Mmm-hmm. It's about consistency.

799
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,620
It's a little hard. It's not buttery.

800
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,500
-[Paul] But when you look at theseâ¦
-[Prue] Colour and definition are good.

801
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,580
[Paul] There's a couple where the top
is much smaller than the bottom.

802
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,180
-It's nice and delicate, crumbly.
-[Prue] Mmm.

803
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,980
-It's got a good flavour.
-It's a proper shortbread.

804
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,740
[Paul] Moving on, you want the icing sugar
to highlight stuff, not hide stuff.

805
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,940
We will find it.

806
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,540
[all chuckling]

807
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:10,100
-Thick at the bottom, thin at the top.
-They are slightly underbaked.

808
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,940
[Paul] Okay, moving on.

809
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,900
-[Prue] Very small.
-[Paul] Yeah, they are.

810
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,220
But they're pretty consistent
all the way down, yeah.

811
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,900
But there's no definition in there at all.

812
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,380
-Or underneath.
-[Prue] No.

813
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,060
Mmm.

814
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,180
But the biscuit is lovely.
As it should be.

815
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,140
[Paul] Yeah. Now these look good.

816
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,140
The hearts are quite defined.

817
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,660
There's a bit of definition
on there from the lines.

818
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,580
[Prue] Yeah.

819
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,260
Hmm.

820
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,220
-[Paul] It's got a good consistency.
-[Prue] They're very nice.

821
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,780
[Paul] There's a bit of definition
but there's inconsistencies.

822
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,620
It's quite thick, that buttercream.

823
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,100
I like the biscuit.
But it's a bit too much jam.

824
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,220
[Paul] It's too sweet.

825
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,060
Erm, moving on,
a lot of icing sugar again.

826
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,420
[Prue] This is very dark jam.

827
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,260
I reckon I could paste
a poster on the wall with that.

828
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,540
It's been over-boiled.

829
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,020
The jam ruins that
'cause it alters all the textures.

830
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,580
This has lost a lot of its shape.

831
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,060
[Prue] Those are very uneven.

832
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,980
[Paul] You've got to
cut and chill the biscuit.

833
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,340
That's how you get the definition
and stop it from shrinking in the oven.

834
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,780
The jam looks great,
but that buttercream, it's justâ¦

835
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,980
-[Prue] Hardly any.
-â¦a thin smear. Slightly underdone.

836
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,860
Talking of underdone.

837
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,340
[Prue] That's got
no stamp on it at all, has it?

838
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,140
-This is raw actually.
-Probably hasn't even hit the fridge.

839
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,900
Hasn't hit the oven either.
At least not for long enough.

840
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,980
[Paul] There's a bit of definition here.

841
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,660
-They're a bit thin.
-[Prue] I quite like them thin.

842
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,580
Cream's good, shape's good.

843
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,820
-I think the jam flavour is good.
-[Paul] Jam's good.

844
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,220
[Matt] <i>Paul and Prue will now rank</i>
<i>the jammy biscuits from worst to best.</i>

845
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,060
In 11th spot is this one.

846
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,780
-Rochica, did it actually go in the oven?
-It did.

847
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,700
It needed longer, there's no definition.

848
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,620
In tenth place, we have this one.
Jam ruined it, I'm afraid.

849
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,020
In ninth spot we have this one.

850
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,780
Very little definition, very, very thin.

851
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:59,780
[Matt] <i>George is eighth, Chigs seventh,</i>
<i>Lizzie sixth, Maggie fifth</i>

852
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,660

853
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,740
In third spot we have this one.

854
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,660
-Whose is this?
-That's me.

855
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,780
Freya, these weren't too bad.
You've lost a little bit of definition

856
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,260
but you were nearly there.
Little bit longer in the oven.

857
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,380
In second place, this one.

858
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,300
Giuseppe, I thought
these were absolutely lovely.

859
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,700
But you could've put
a bit more filling in them.

860
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,260
So in first spot we have this one.

861
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,700
-[cheering]
-Crazy.

862
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,980
You did have the definition
and the biscuit tasted lovely.

863
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,980
Thank you.

864
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,300
[JÃ¼rgen] It's almost unreal.

865
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,700
It's an unbelievable day
and I'm truly exhausted now.

866
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,060
JÃ¼rgen has been renamed
"The Baking Terminator."

867
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,380
Nothing stops him.

868
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,180
He doesn't have the Austrian accent,

869
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,340
but he's German,
so it's close enough. [laughs]

870
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,740
[Rochica] Definitely the hardest moment
in the tent for me. I'm still optimistic.

871
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,660
It all rests on tomorrow.

872
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,060
[Jairzeno] It could've gone better today.

873
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:54,220
Even though you plan so much,
the time just seems toâ¦ yeah.

874
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:59,860
A bad morning and I needed a little higher
to bring me out of the depths.

875
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,220
I feel I'm under
a lot of pressure tomorrow.

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,880
[Noel chuckles]

881
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,520
[Matt] For your Showstopper challenge,

882
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,360
Prue and Paul want you to make

883
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,840
a 3D biscuit replica
of your favourite childhood toy.

884
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,280
[Noel] Your biscuit toy
needs to be delicious,

885
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,680
but also there needs
to be an interactive element.

886
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,440
[Matt] It could be wheels
that turn on a car,

887
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,040
or lighting in a doll's house

888
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,440
or Internet in case they wanna get
some work emails out of the way

889
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,800
before the weekend or hop on a Zoom.

890
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,680
[Noel] I had a Zoom
with a doll the other week.

891
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,040
It was Chucky the killer doll.

892
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,640
Nice guy, actually, off camera.

893
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,000
[Matt] I actually facetimed Action Man
the other day.

894
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,840
Great body but, uh, took his trousers offâ¦
[whispering] nothing there.

895
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,640
-[Noel] You have four hours.
-[normally] On your marks.

896
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,600
-Get set.
-Bake.

897
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,400
[Rochica] I really need to do well today.

898
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,720
Just wanna keep a cool head.

899
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,600
[Maggie] I'm feeling
absolutely fine this morning.

900
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,120
There's only one place to go
today and that's up.

901
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,200
[Lizzie] This bake brings back
loads of kid memories.

902
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,640
Yeah, just fills me with joy
just looking at it.

903
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,840
[Prue] This week's Showstopper
is a childhood toy

904
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,760
and we want them to be interactive.

905
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,600
Children's toys are not much fun
if they don't do something,

906
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,880
but it's quite difficult
to do out of biscuit.

907
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,800
The bakers have to be
engineers as well as bakers,

908
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,680
because they need to think
about how they're gonna bring

909
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,640
this three-dimensional
biscuit scene together.

910
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,560
I think they're gonna use
something like a gingerbread,

911
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,520
because it's robust, it's strong.

912
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,840
If it's too soft it could just collapse.

913
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,880
-[Paul] Hi, George.
-Hi.

914
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,320
Tell us all about your toy biscuit design.

915
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,880
So I'm doing an aeroplane.

916
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,240
My aeroplane used to stick on my ceiling

917
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,560
and it had a propeller that turned.

918
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,960
You'd throw it and it'd go round the room.
I was fascinated by it.

919
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,800
[Matt] <i>Whizzing high</i>
<i>above Greek biscuit clouds,</i>

920
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,400
<i>George's gingerbread aeroplane</i>
<i>will be crafted from ten separate pieces</i>

921
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,040
<i>and has a special feature.</i>

922
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,360
It's got a motor
that takes the plane round.

923
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,640
-You've got a motor?
-Yes.

924
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,560
Wow.

925
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,520
Have you got enough time?

926
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,040
'Cause it sounds
like you'd need about two years.

927
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,120
I know. I've got an awful lot to do.

928
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,480
-Keep working.
-I will.

929
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,280
-Good luck, mate.
-Yeah. Thanks.

930
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,240
[Noel] <i>While George plays planes,</i>
<i>Lizzie's off on the road.</i>

931
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,760
[Lizzie] I am making a chocolate
and ginger toy truck.

932
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,880
I should know how to build cars.
I do work in a car factory.

933
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,880
[Noel] <i>Her chocolate gingerbread truck</i>
<i>will feature moving wheels</i>

934
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,240
{\an8}<i>and for extra interactive fun, she'll add</i>
<i>a paint palette so it can be coloured in.</i>

935
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,880
[Noel] Making a little Brum-Brum car.
Paul's favourite.

936
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,040
Your favourite, too.
There's an art palette.

937
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,840
I don't have anything to do
with the judging, you know that, right?

938
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,920
-You're bribing the wrong cat.
-That's fine. [laughs]

939
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,560
[Matt] <i>Jairzeno's hoping to bribe</i>
<i>the judges with a toy vehicle of his own.</i>

940
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,400
[Jairzeno] I'm making a sailing ship,

941
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,840
I've always been interested
in all those ships and all those sails.

942
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,720
{\an8}[Matt] <i>After capsizing in his signature,</i>
<i>today he needs to stay afloat.</i>

943
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,600
{\an8}<i>But the ship has a heavy load,</i>
<i>biscuit treasure, battery-powered lights,</i>

944
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,960
{\an8}<i>two masts and colossal rice paper sails.</i>

945
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,880
[Jairzeno] The sails are kind of big

946
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,120
so if my sailing ship could just stand up,
you know, I'll be happy.

947
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
[Noel]<i> Maggie's also off to sea.</i>

948
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,360
[Maggie] As a post-war child,
there weren't many toys around.

949
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,320
But we always went to the beach,
'cause it was a cheap day out.

950
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,440
We had access to people with beach huts.

951
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,440
So skim boards, bodyboards,
that kind of thing were part of our life.

952
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,080
[Noel]<i> With childhood toys</i>
<i>in short supply,</i>

{\an8}<i>featuring a gingerbread surfer</i>
<i>who can be pulled through the waves.</i>

955
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,040
I mean my first thought
was this is not a toy.

956
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,680
-[Maggie] No.
-[Prue] But you can play with models.

957
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,320
[Maggie] With all honesty,
I can't remember a favourite toy.

958
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,080
-Bucket and spade, that was a toy.
-Bucket and spade.

959
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,760
[Matt] <i>Toys were also a luxury</i>
<i>in JÃ¼rgen's childhood days.</i>

960
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,440
[JÃ¼rgen] My brother and myself
didn't have many toys

961
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,640
because we grew up very poor.

962
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,760
And so my grandpa made some windmills.

963
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,720
So we had a mini Dutch windmill
on a pole in the garden.

964
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,600
[Matt] <i>JÃ¼rgen's gingerbread windmill</i>
<i>is the tallest toy in the tent.</i>

965
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,680
<i>Engineered with a hidden wooden axle,</i>

966
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,360
<i>the top turns</i>
<i>and tuile biscuit sails spin.</i>

967
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,760
So that's the interactive bit.

968
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,800
-It actually moves.
-Clever.

969
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,920
-[JÃ¼rgen] I hope to have no breakages.
-[Paul] Good luck, JÃ¼rgen.

970
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
-Thank you very much.
-You don't need luck.

971
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,320
[Noel]<i> To help keep lady luck on side,</i>

972
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,280
<i>most of the bakers are working</i>
<i>with sturdy gingerbread.</i>

973
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,560
Very few biscuits are strong enough
to support a 3D structure,

974
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,000
other than ginger biscuits or gingerbread.

975
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,640
[Noel] <i>But just how stable</i>
<i>their 3D toys are</i>

976
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,240
<i>depends on how thin they roll.</i>

977
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,080
[Rochica] I've done it as thin as I could.

978
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,600
I don't want the biscuits to be too thin,
'cause then they won't hold up.

979
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,320
-[Noel] <i>And the bake.</i>
-Good luck, my little pretties.

980
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,080
Toy truck. Fifteen minutes.

981
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,320
[Noel] <i>Perfectly baked gingerbread</i>
<i>should be crisp on the outside</i>

982
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,000
<i>with a tender centre.</i>

983
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,000
<i>And while delicious to eat,</i>
<i>could be too weak to build with.</i>

984
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,600
It's all a balancing act,
because if you bake them nice and soft

985
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,440
it might fall under its own weight.

986
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,720
[Noel] <i>A risk Freya isn't willing to take.</i>

I think it's very ambitious.

I was gonna go for
the gingerbread as an easier option,

1008

00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,080
Oh, it collapsed.

1025
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,280
Quick. Repair, repair, repair.

1026
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,520
God.

1027
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,080
It's not good.

1028
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,240
Bakers, you are halfway "througe".

1029
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,440
-It's pronounced "through."
-Is it?

1030
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,400
Also you've been saying
her name wrong. It's Pruge, not Prue.

1031
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,440
-Oh.
-[Amanda] God.

1032
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,640
I've just glued it back together again
with some sugar. I'm panicking.

1033
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,360
[Noel] How are you?

1034
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,680
-I'm okay, thank you.
-Yeah?

1035
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,880
-Yeah.
-Really?

1036
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,480
You've done something wrong, haven't you?

1037
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,880
There was a tiny little breakage.
My horse is not rocking.

1038
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,440
[Noel] Bet you were naughty at school.

1039
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,000
-I was a bit naughty at school, yeah.
-How can I tell?

1040
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,440
-[Amanda] But I didn't smash stuff.
-[Noel] No.

1041
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,360
[Amanda] Oh, I did break a window.

1042
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,880
Well, look, don't break any windows,
tear any flaps.

1043
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,880
-[chuckles] Okay. I know what you mean.
-Tent. You know.

1044
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,320
Tent flaps. I got it, it's fine.

1045
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,800
This has gone somewhere.
I can't even pull this out of the gutter.

1046
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,720
[chuckling]

[Noel] <i>While Amanda worries</i>

1048

[Amanda] If I move it,
it'll probably break,

1049
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,440
but don't forget,
this rocking horse is really old.

1050

[Maggie laughs]

1053
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,200
I don't want them to say, "That's a mess."

1054
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,960
It's Paul and Prue airlines, man.

1055
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,280
[Chigs] I'm just trying to get my balls
prepped now, ready to go.

1056
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,160
Mine is gonna be a snooker table.

1057
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,400
Playing snooker
was a big part of my childhood.

1058
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,880
Brings back fond memories.

[Noel] <i>Games are proving</i>
<i>a popular toy in the tent.</i>

1067
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,920
So I'm making a game called reversi.

1068
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,480
I found out recently
that it's actually a very old game.

1069
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,240
It dates back from the 19th century.

1070

{\an8}<i>and 30 chocolate orange sable counters.</i>

1073
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,680
There are some engineering aspects
into doing this,

1074
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,160
especially for the assembly.

1075

[Matt] <i>Rochica also fancies a game.</i>

1076

[Rochica] I'm making

1077
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,560
[Matt] <i>And hers has even more complex</i>
<i>parts to engineer.</i>

1078
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,640
You'll be able to use the flickers
as well, to flick the ball.

1079
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,160
The ball rolls down the ramp, so yeah.

1080

-I didn't go to school. I'm a feral child.

1105

1108
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:12,320

fitting pieces of gingerbread together.

1109

[Rochica] I'm using isomalt,

I need to make sure I'm careful,
and I've got on my gloves as well.

1112
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,480
Hopefully, the whole thing
doesn't collapse under its weight.

Oh, dear.

00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,640
Yeah, I mean,
there's an element of movement.

1147
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,960
No, it should be moving.

1148

00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,480
[Freya] Right.

1172
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,640
[Maggie] It's not very neat.

1173
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,520
[Jairzeno] Scary putting this together.

1174
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,920
Nearly there, nearly there.

1175
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,920
[George] Candyfloss. Form the clouds.

1176
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,680
[Chigs] Making it look as good as I can.

1177
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,960
[motor whirring noisily]

1178
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,640
[Amanda] Just gonna go for it. [yelling]

1179
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,280
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1180
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,840
-Disaster strikes.
-[both chuckle]

1181
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,000
[Amanda] It's gone.

1182
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,280
Bakers, your time is up.

1183
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,680
Please step away from your biscuity bakes.

1184
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,440
[Jairzeno] Oh, no. It's more like
a shipwreck than a ship.

1185
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,080
[Maggie] It's just messy.

1186
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,200
-[Chigs] Come on, don't cry.
-I know.

1187
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,120
[Amanda yelling]

1188
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,040
Mine's just completely collapsed.

1189
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,440
-[Freya] No, no, no.
-[Amanda] The head's come off.

1190
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,480
[Chigs] Oh, babe.

1191
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,440
Disaster.

1192
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,160
That was so pretty though, Amanda.

1193
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,480
Yeah. Compared to my ship.

1194
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,040
What do you want, some buttercream?

1195
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,800
I need some comfort.

1196
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,720
Thank you.

1197
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:19,020
[Matt]<i> It's judgement time</i>
<i>for the bakers' interactive toys.</i>

1198
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,100
George, would you like to fly on down?

1199
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,620
-[motor whirring]
-[all cheering]

1200
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,100
That is really wonderful.

1201
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,660
That is definitely interactive.

1202
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:41,660
-That's amazing.
-Even sounds like a plane.

1203
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,300
It's a pretty basic plane,
but it does go round.

1204
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,100
The design on this is great.

1205
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,620
[Noel groans]

1206
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,540
-That can be repaired.
-[laughs]

1207
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:56,900
Nice wing.

1208
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,820
It's not too hard. But it's very crisp.

1209
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:03,660
-Shall we taste both?
-[Paul] They work well as a sort of cloud.

1210
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:04,900
[Prue] What are the flavours in there?

1211
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,460
-Pistachios, brandy.
-What's not to like?

1212
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,700
-Well done, George. Thank you.
-Thanks.

1213
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,660
That's so good. So good.

1214
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:21,420
{\an8}[Paul] Ingenious.
You have a lot of moving parts.

1215
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,100
You can play with it. Look.

1216
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,380
-[exclaims]
-Oh, no. [laughs]

1217
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,020
You've broken it on the first go.

1218
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,500
[Prue] I did. But we can do it like that.

1219
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,460
[Paul] Yes.

1220
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,300
It's so delicate, it's so thin.

1221
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,220
-The texture's spot-on.
-[Prue] Very good.

1222
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,780
{\an8}-Thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you, Rochica.

1223
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,620
Properly engineered.

1224
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:50,100
The way that the counters sit in
the little recess here. It looks amazing.

1225
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:56,900
It's a very classic ginger biscuit.
I quite like that.

1226
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,780
It's the cardamom
and the cloves coming through.

1227
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,220
-[Prue] Well done, Giuseppe.
-Thank you.

1228
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,100
-[all cheering]
-[Paul] Oh, nearly!

1229
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,380
That's very clever.

1230
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,540
-[Prue] Now it just has to taste wonderful
-I know.

1231
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,620
[Prue] And it's a little bit cakey.

1232
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,060
But I like that, especially if it's thick,
you don't want it to be too hard.

1233
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,020
[Paul] It's perfect.

1234
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,420
-But you're missing a row of red balls.
-[Chigs] I know.

1235
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,940
-Trust you to count them.
-[all laugh]

1236
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,420
{\an8}There's a show, "Paint Along with Prue."

1237
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,500
[Paul] Getting out of jail free
by adding that palette

1238
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,700
and saying "paint it yourself"
is interesting.

1239
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,300
The ginger and the chocolate together,
it is probably too strong.

1240
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,580
-Okay.
-[Prue] You know what?

1241
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:43,620
If you have it with a bit of icing,
it tones it down and it's delicious.

1242
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,860
-Well done.
-Ta.

1243
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,780
[Matt] Well done.

1244
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:49,780
With that painting skills, you could get
a job in our factory if this goes wrong.

1245
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,420
{\an8}Done.

1246
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,540
[Prue] Look at that.

1247
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,380
[Prue chuckles]

1248
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:03,140
You've created quite a high structure,

1249
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,140
but having said that, it is so thin.

1250
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,820
[Prue] Well I agree, it's <i>sehr gut.</i>

1251
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,940
-It really is.
<i>-Danke schÃ¶n.</i>

1252
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,060
It looks beautiful.

1253
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,860
[Paul grunts]

1254
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,140
It's not overly sweet at all.

1255
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:17,660
But it's got
a lovely flavour in the mouth.

1256
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,780
-[Prue] Very nice.
-[Paul] You've done a great job.

1257
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,060
Again. <i>Konditor meister.</i>

1258
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,660
-Thank you.
-[Matt] Well done.

1259
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:32,180
Oh, God. Gonna be sick. I can't do this.

1260
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,380
[Noel] Paul would look good with them on.

1261
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,620
[all laughing]

1262
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,460
No one's ever looked more like a pirate.

1263
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,540
[Prue] I'll taste the brush.

1264
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,140
Lovely. Lemon and poppy.

1265
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,220
Yeah.

1266
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,900
-[Prue] Beautiful.
-I think the design's very clever.

1267
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,140
And I think you've got
your flavours spot on too.

1268
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:02,980
-[sighs in relief]
-[Prue] Well done.

1269
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:10,620
I think that's beautiful.
And I love the painting.

1270
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,620
Do you think it could be a bit softer?

1271
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,060
I think it's okay, considering
what it's doing. It's not overly hard.

1272
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,940
Structurally she's pretty sound as well.

1273
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,620
Thank you so much.

1274
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:34,700
[Prue sighs]

1275
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,860
The saddle is beautiful,
the tail, the head.

1276
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,900
Must have been heartbreaking
to see the thing collapse.

1277
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,740
It was a little bit, yeah.

1278
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,340
[Prue] Let's see what it tastes like.

1279
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:48,300
It's a sugar biscuit
and that's, erm, honey buttercream.

1280
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,100
-It's brave not to do gingerbread.
-Thank you.

1281
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:54,300
I would never in a million years
have chosen that biscuit to build this.

1282
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,460
-It's so delicate.
-[Prue] Mmm.

1283
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:57,420
But you managed to--

1284
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,740
I've made it three times before
and it stayed up.

1285
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,300
[Paul] Just a shame
it looks the way it does.

1286
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,220
It would've been right up there.

1287
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,660
Would admit that's some of the best
biscuit things that we'd have ever had.

1288
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,620
Thank you.

1289
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,420
I'll get in the TARDIS
and we'll go back in time.

1290
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,980
-Yeah, I've flown it before.
-[mouthing]

1291
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,140
{\an8}[Paul] For me, it's a bit basic.

1292
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:22,740
I think, as a decoration,
it needs to be a lot more elaborate.

1293
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:26,140
[Prue] But I think we need
to taste the gingerbread.

1294
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:33,180
[Paul] I would've made that a little bit
thinner to allow a nice snap.

1295
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,500
-Yes.
-It's a little bit thick and heavy.

1296
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,860
I think if you were looking
at a traditional school report,

1297
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,900
it'd say, "Needs to try harder."

1298
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:44,140
-[Matt] Well done.
-[Noel] Well done, Maggie.

1299
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,140
Looks a bit rough and ready.

1300
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:57,300
The rough-and-ready look
of the painting was deliberate.

1301
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,100
And there were two sails.

1302
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:01,540
There was a tall sail at the back,
but the mast broke.

1303
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,580
-'Cause of the water, the waves.
-[Matt laughing]

1304
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:06,020
It's the way the cargo was loaded,
that was the problem.

1305
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,740
-And that too, yeah.
-[Prue chuckling]

1306
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,380
Don't give me that waffle.

1307
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,660
Let's have a go at the biscuit.

1308
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,700
Mmm, the cardamom
comes through well in that.

1309
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:17,940
It's a lovely blend.

1310
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:21,340
[Prue] It tastes delicious,
but it's a bit rough and ready.

1311
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,220
-[Paul] Thank you.
-[Matt] Well done.

1312
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,140
Well done.

1313
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:29,900
I still feel in danger, because they both
said it was rough and ready, the finish.

1314
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,180
Yes it was,
but it was finished nonetheless.

1315
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:33,980
[Amanda] It's a mess.

1316
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:36,580
Mine's the only one that's collapsed,

1317
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:41,300
so I think the chances
of staying are slim.

1318
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:44,260
[Maggie] I would give anything
to be here another week.

1319
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,780
It's quite silly, really,

1320
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:48,220
but when I've watched people
on <i>Bake Off</i> before, crying,

1321
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,580
I've thought, "For goodness sake.
[chuckling] You know, it's only cake."

1322
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,900
And suddenly it's all changed.

1323
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:57,220
[chuckling] But everybody's
so much more skilful.

1324
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,380
So, um, so we'll see, we'll see.

1325
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,460
[Matt]<i> It's decision time</i>
<i>for Prue and Paul.</i>

1326
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,820
<i>Who will be named Star Baker</i>

1327
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,180
<i>and whose time in the tent</i>
<i>will come to an end?</i>

1328
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:14,540
Week two, that was a pretty high
standard of Showstopper, wasn't it?

1329
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:15,860
-That was great.
-[Prue] It really was.

1330
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:17,460
I felt so sorry for Amanda.

1331
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,460
If that rocking horse had held together,

1332
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:22,500
it would've been right up there
because it tasted beautiful.

1333
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:23,660
It was so delicate.

1334
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:26,460
The one I'm most
worried about is Jairzeno.

1335
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:29,780
You were looking at that going,
"It's kind of a ship."

1336
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:34,020
Or a barge. He had a very leaky stern.

1337
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,180
All his bakes have been rough and ready.

1338
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:38,460
I think Jairzeno is in
a little bit of trouble, I agree.

1339
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:41,180
And I would even put Maggie down there.

1340
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:42,660
She struggled in the signature

1341
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:46,220
and I wasn't convinced that that beach hut
was strong enough.

1342
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,780
But I think, for me,
in line for Star Baker, JÃ¼rgen.

1343
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:51,780
-[Prue] Yes, certainly.
-[Paul] Giuseppe's up there as well.

1344
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,540
-[Prue] What about Chigs?
-I think Chigs has to be up there

1345
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,380
because that snooker table is fantastic.

1346
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:59,780
One of the names you didn't mention there
who did really well, I think, was George.

1347
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:01,820
[Paul] George, I think,
sort of jumped up a bit.

1348
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:05,180
[Prue] I love George
because I think he has real imagination,

1349
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,100
and his concepts are always great.

1350
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:09,380
-Yeah, they're really good.
-They're just sort ofâ¦

1351
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:12,100
-[Noel] He's not very neat.
-â¦tatty at the edges.

1352
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:14,220
I just had this thoughtâ¦

1353
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,820
I mean, George grew up in Cyprus.
You were in Cyprus for a while.

1354
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:21,020
You're probably, what, about 25 years
older than George?

1355
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:24,820
You like the ladies. Do you feel
a sort of paternal sense towards him?

1356
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:30,500
-Matt, this is going nowhere.
-Yeah. It's finished, don't worry.

1357
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:45,660
Well, bakers, it falls to me to announce
who is the smartest cookie.

1358
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,620
Do you see what I did there?
That was really good, wasn't it?

1359
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:51,420
This week's Star Baker isâ¦

1360
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:56,540
JÃ¼rgen.

1361
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:57,740
[all applauding]

1362
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:05,060
That means I've got the horrible job
of announcing who's going home.

1363
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:07,660
This only gets harder
as we get to know you all,

1364
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:12,020
but the person who's leaving us
this week isâ¦

1365
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,180
Jairzeno.

1366
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:21,700
Sorry, bro.

1367
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:28,260
-You don't deserve to go, oh, God.
-Thank you.

1368
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:31,780
-[Paul] Loved the idea, mate.
-Thank you.

1369
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,940
I was half-expecting that result

1370
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:38,380
because if you look at the Showstopper,
compared to everybody else's,

1371
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,980
mine was quite basic.

1372
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,060
-Oh, I'm so sad.
-[chuckles]

1373
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:44,060
[sighs] I'm really relieved,

1374
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,900
but I am absolutely gutted
that Jairzeno's gone.

1375
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:50,700
We sit and talk all the time.
He's so lovely. He's so laid-back.

1376
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,620
And his flavours are amazing.
I don't understand, wellâ¦

1377
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:55,900
Someone has to go.

1378
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:57,940
[Maggie] Amazing, I meanâ¦

1379
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,620
But I think, this afternoon,

1380
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:03,780
I learned the real meaning
of the little expression,

1381
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,780
"The skin of your teeth."

1382
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:08,460
[Prue] Well done, Giuseppe.
You really did good.

1383
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:09,460
Thank you very much.

1384
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:13,300
I've had a very, very good couple of days.
I'm very happy with how it went.

1385
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:16,660
JÃ¼rgen deserved it entirely.
It's very stiff competition.

1386
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:18,460
[Rochica] I'm so proud of you.

1387
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:20,260
[line ringing]

1388
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:25,740
I've got no plans
for stopping The Baking Terminator.

1389
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:26,900
[Giuseppe laughs]

1390
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:31,460
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hi, Benjamin. This is JÃ¼rgen.

1391
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:33,100
I'm Star Baker again.

1392
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:35,780
-[Benjamin laughs] <i>No way.</i>
-Yes.

1393
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,220
-[woman] <i>JÃ¼rgen.</i>
-[JÃ¼rgen] Yes.

1394
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,180
-[woman] <i>Is it true?</i>
-It is true.

1395
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:41,620
-[woman] <i>My goodness.</i>
-[chuckles]

1396
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,220
-[woman laughs]
-Yeah, crazy, isn't it?

1397
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,300
[closing theme playing]
