Explain it to me again?

-It's Free-From Week.
-What does that mean?

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,760
It means this week
we've got a vegan bake,

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,680
we've got a dairy-free bake
and a gluten-free bake.

-Like this stuff here.
-Has anyone told Paul yet?

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,240
I just told him a couple of minutes ago.

-Yeah, absolutely fine.

Week eight, quarter final.
Why am I still here? [laughs]

33
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,520
This Free-From Week,
I'm actually quite excited about it.

34
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,960
I never made anything dairy-free
or gluten-free or anything like that,

35
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,600
so I don't really know how it all tastes.

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,280
My objective
for this week is to survive. [laughs]

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,520
Just gotta keep everything
as Lizzie as possible.

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,080
I'm gonna prove a point
that free-from has as little finesse

39
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,120
as all me other food. [chuckles]

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,160
Good morning, bakers.

41
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,800
Welcome back to the tent
for the quarter final.

42
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,640
-Whoo!
-And a celebration of free-from baking.

43
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,240
[laughs] Free from baking, no baking.

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,800
We can just go lie down in hammocks
and eat some loganberry jam.

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,120
-Let's go. Oh.
-No, I think you've misunderstood.

46
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,440
-There's still baking? That's a shame.
-Yeah.

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,240
For your Signature Challenge,

48
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,680
the judges would like you each
to make a batch of eight

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,840
identical dairy-free ice cream sandwiches.

50
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,600
The ice cream must be beautifully made

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,040
and sandwiched between
two perfectly baked biscuits.

52
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,520
Any flavour you like.

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,880
Remember, kids, they must be dairy-free.

54
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,400
-You have three hours.
-On your marks.

55
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,080
-Get set.
-Bake.

56
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,160
I've had ice cream sandwiches.
I've never made them at home before.

57
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,720
I don't think anyone is doing
a dairy-free ice cream on a regular basis.

58
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,400
The aim is to get an ice cream

59
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,960
that sets, but is still creamy.
It's quite tricky.

60
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,600
[Paul] In this challenge,
we've asked them to be dairy-free.

61
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,400
They can use eggs, but obviously
the use of cream and butter is out.

62
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,200
I imagine we'll see a lot
of coconut milk and oat milk.

63
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,680
[JÃ¼rgen] This is coconut cream.
It's a bit thicker.

64
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,840
It has more fat than coconut milk.

65
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,120
We've asked for an ice cream sandwich
because we want a baked element.

66
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,680
[Paul] It's all about textures.

67
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,560
The silky smooth with the ice cream,
and the crispy biscuit.

68
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,840
How are they gonna do it?

69
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,280
We wanna see their characters coming out
but, above all, it must taste amazing.

70
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,220
-[Paul] Hey.
-[Lizzie] Hello!

71
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,140
Hello, Lizzie.

72
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,820
Tell us all about
your sandwich ice creams.

73
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,220
Erm, my dairy replacement
is oat milk and, like, fake cream.

74
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,580
And my sandwich ice creams are just
vanilla with, erm, some almond brittle in.

75
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,780
Because it's all about, like,
when I take my dog on a walk,

76
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,980
I see the Mr Whippy van after,
so she's allowed vanilla ice cream.

77
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,100

It's all dogs,
'cause it's about walking my dog.

83
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,700
Are you gonna get
a bit of finesse with the pattern?

84
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,700
-Yeah.
-How big are these gonna be, the biscuits?

85
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,940
Oh, this is my issue, isn't it?
So they are about, I'd say, that lid size.

[Chigs] When I did my research,

92
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,740
dairy-free ice cream sets
slightly harder than normal ice cream.

93
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,380
Just trying to get as close
to normal ice cream as possible.

94

[Matt] <i>The fat, sugar,</i>
<i>protein and water content</i>

<i>of their ice creams.</i>

97
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,020
Rather than using whole milk,

98
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,540
I've got a plant-based, erm,
kind of cream, and a cashew nut milk.

99
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,620
[Matt] <i>So it's crucial</i>
<i>they've researched how their alternatives</i>

100

<i>will impact the taste and texture.</i>

101
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,140
[Giuseppe] The hope is that
the tofu will give the creaminess.

102
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,460
[Matt] <i>And Giuseppe is taking</i>
<i>his dairy-free ice cream one step further.</i>

103
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,700
The dairy alternative
will be tofu and soymilk.

104
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,900
So, the ice cream itself
is vegan and virtually fat-free.

105
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,900
-Wow.
-Delicious.

No, actually, it does sound good.

110

One of the biggest challenges

111
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,180
has been to get the ice cream
to taste of orange enough.

112
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,020
So I'm using orange juice, orange zest

113
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,300
and candied orange peel to go into it.

114
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,260
I'm also adding a drop of orange essence,
and that should be enough.

128

-I left the freezer door open.

-So, they all melted in the freezer.

What this will do is keep churning
and bring down the temperature.

139

Because it's dairy-free, you ain't gonna
get that proper silky stuff.

You will get a slightly firmer ice cream,

00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,980
120-degree hot liquid into egg whites.

151
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,500
And then I need
to whisk it until it's cooled.

152
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,620
{\an8}[Matt] <i>JÃ¼rgen's macarons of egg whites</i>
<i>with ground pistachio and almond</i>

153
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,540
{\an8}<i>will sandwich his banana</i>

154
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,220
{\an8}<i>combining two of his</i>
<i>favourite childhood flavours.</i>

155
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,300
Over the years, when I was
testing ice cream parlours in Germany,

156
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,060
I developed
my test case for the parlours,

157
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,020
and that was a mix
of pistachio and banana ice cream.

158
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
You used to test the ice cream parlours?

159
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,580
-[JÃ¼rgen] Yes.
-I mean, is this an official job? Orâ¦

160
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,900
-[all laugh]
-Just my internal one.

161
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,900
-Right.
-[all laugh]

162
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,060
Can't have it too big, 'cause obviously
the rolling pin's not massive,

163
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,540
so you've got to do two at a time.

164
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,220
This dough is so wet and sticky.
I'm just gonna bake them like this

165
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,260
and then I will re-cut them out.

166
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,540
It's like a safety net.

167
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,460
[Noel] <i>And Crystelle has good reason</i>
<i>to be cautious about her biscuits.</i>

168
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,100
I have only done these once
because I changed my recipe last minute,

169
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:59,820
so I am quite panicky about them.

170
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,539
[Noel] <i>Crystelle is hoping</i>

171
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,460
{\an8}<i>the earthiness of her cashew milk</i>
<i>and coffee ice cream</i>

172
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:06,140

173

{\an8}<i>of her tahini and miso</i>
<i>replacement biscuits.</i>

174
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,220
I had a really nice cookie recipe

175
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,820
that was chewy,
but I just didn't think it froze well.

176
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,380
I've gone for one that you can take
a bite, the ice cream doesn't ooze out.

177
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,420
-Sounds good.
-What were you doing?

178
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,580
Miso and tahini frappuccino
ice cream sandwich.

179
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,740
-Yeah.
-[all laugh]

180
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,460
[hesitating] You know, very simple.

181
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,700
Bakers, you have
an amount of time remaining.

182
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,580
That wasn't very helpful.

183
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,460
Well, it's Free-From Week,
so I thought I would do a time call

184
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,700
that was free from
the relevant information.

185
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,540
Bakers, you're halfway through.

186
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,940
[Chigs] These are gonna
go in the oven now.

187
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,260
So, 12 minutes.
I'm gonna do six minutes on each side.

188
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,020
Fifteen minutes.

189
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,460
Then I'll swap them round
seven minutes in.

190
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,820
[Giuseppe] So, in we go.

191
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,980
[Noel] <i>While the other bakers' biscuits</i>
<i>begin to increase in temperatureâ¦</i>

192
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,260
It's still warm.

193
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,140
<i>â¦JÃ¼rgen's meringue mix</i>
<i>has the opposite problem.</i>

194
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,140
-Hello, JÃ¼rgenâ¦ [laughs]
-Hi, Noel.

195
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,300
-I've been there about half an hour.
-Ah, yes.

196
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,740
You look very interested
in what's going on in there.

197
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,020
[JÃ¼rgen] Yes,
I'm trying to cool this down.

198
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,180
I had some issues
with that in the practice tent.

199
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,860
-Oh, no.
-I don't want to repeat that here.

200
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,620
[Noel] You don't seem
to be under pressure, though.

201
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,500
How many Star Bakers have you won now?

202
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,660
-Three. Yes.
-Three?

203
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,140
Imagine if Crystelle
won three Star Bakers. [chuckles]

204
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,020
-Yeah, we would be deaf by now.
-[laughs]

205
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,260
They look okay.
The biscuits are looking good.

206
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,420
-Oh, there we go.
-[timer beeping]

207
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,460
Got a bit of colour round the edge,
which I'm happy with.

208
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,460
Oh, I forgot to sprinkle
sesame seeds on the top of these,

209
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,220
but it's fine
because these can go on the bottom.

210
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,820
There's some funky smells
coming from over here.

211
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,100
It's the dark cocoa.

212
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,700
-[Noel] What percentage is that?
-It's black. 100%.

213
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,020
-Hundred percent cocoa?
-Yeah.

214
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,620
Oh, my God. It's giving me a stitch.

215
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,660
-[coughs]
-Do you know what it reminds me of?

216
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,220
-When you--
-Inside of a coffin?

217
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,460
[both laugh]

218
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,860
No, I was gonna say Jaguar wee.

219
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,460
-Jaguar wee?
-Yeah.

220
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,660
Wow, you're weirder than me.
It's official. Jaguar wee. [laughs]

221
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,820
[JÃ¼rgen] Still doesn't
look like a meringue.

222
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,460
I'll give it a bit more.

223
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,980
But now the machine's blinking,
so the ice cream is essentially done.

224
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,420
At least I can start
shaping my sandwiches.

225
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,460
[Matt] <i>The ice cream needs to be set</i>
<i>for sandwiching in the uniform shapes</i>

226
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,100
<i>Paul and Prue will be expecting.</i>

227
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,140
[Lizzie] Oh, my God, that's so cold.

228
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,060
I use silicon moulds,
but the silicon moulds are a bit small,

229
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,860
so this is going to be
slightly interesting.

230
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,380
[Crystelle] So, I realise in practice
that my moulds are very thick,

231
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,060
so I'm only gonna fill them halfway.

232
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,340
And the best way to do that
is to use a piping bag.

233
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,580
[Matt] <i>While Crystelle and JÃ¼rgen</i>
<i>have changed moulding methodsâ¦</i>

234
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,260
I was gonna go for a rustic look.

235
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,740
[Matt] <i>â¦Giuseppe has decided</i>
<i>to break the mould completely.</i>

236
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,220
The ice cream is starting
to lose consistency,

237
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,700
so I'm going to have to be very quick.
Otherwise, I will lose this.

238
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,260
These are gonna go in the freezer.

239
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,740
[Matt] <i>With the sandwich centres freezing,</i>

240
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,220
<i>it's time for top deck decoration.</i>

241
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,620
[whispers] Disco time.

242
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,020
[JÃ¼rgen, normally]
I'll go for it now, I think.

243
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,020
[Matt] <i>But without anything baked yet,</i>

244
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,220
<i>there's no time for JÃ¼rgen</i>
<i>or his meringue to rest.</i>

245
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,060
In the practice, I didn't whisk
the Italian meringue long enough.

246
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,220
I was too impatient.

247
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,620
This has this nice, rough structure
that this mix should have.

248
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,580
[Giuseppe] I'm drizzling
my top biscuits with, uh,

249
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,780
tempered dairy-free white chocolate.

250
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,940
Then I'll add the candied orange peel
and crystallised ginger.

251
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,140
[Lizzie] On the wrong
Channel 4 programme here.

252
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,100
Should be on Grayson Perry's art show.

253
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,060
I'm going in.
I didn't dry them out in the practice

254
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,980
and they actually came out nice.

255
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,700
How much time do we have left?

256
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,340
-Bakers, you have 8,000 wobble mittensâ¦
-[snickers]

257

â¦in your tiger chop suey.

258
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,620
-What was that?
-That was free from logic.

259
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,260
[Matt] You have 15 minutes left.

260
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,180
Well, that just gives them
time to cool down, doesn't it? [chuckles]

261
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,980
[Lizzie] Paul doesn't like glitter.

262
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,140
Who cares what Paul thinks?

263
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,940
This one's tough, 'cause Paul's not
the biggest fan of free-from stuff, is he?

264
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,700
He's a proper pudding lad, innit?

265
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,180
[Crystelle] Sesame seeds for sprinkling

266
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,340
because I forgot
to sprinkle enough on them.

267
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,900
[Noel] How's it going? [chuckles]

268
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,860
-Oh, I don't know. I just--
-Yeah, whatever.

269
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,620
[laughs] I knew you didn't care.

270
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,060
[all chuckle]

271
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,700
[chuckling] Is it going all right?

272
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,100
-Oh, I don't know.
-[yawns]

273

-[both laughing]
-See you later.

274
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,460
I fall for this every single time.

275
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,660
[JÃ¼rgen] They're spreading
underneath and moving up.

276
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,300
Let's go for it.

277
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,820
Interesting shape, isn't it?

278
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,980
They shouldn't have this little fringe.

279
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,820
They will have enough time cool,
they cool very quickly.

280
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,580
You anxious?
I can see you're shaking your legs.

281
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,100
I got that weird feeling that I've got--
I've missed something.

282
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,140
-Well, the dairy.
-[laughs]

283
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,780
If that's the only thing I've missed,

284
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,220
-I'mâ¦ Yeah.
-You're all right.

285
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,820
How long do we have?

286
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,060
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

287
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,740
Now is the time to add
some dairy, I would say.

288
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,980
[chuckles]

289
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,020
I'm just breaking my freezer.

290
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,100
[indistinct chatter]

291
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,060
We have a few air pockets,
but it'll have to do.

292
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,020
Press it down, because why not?
I've touched it enough.

293
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,740
What I'm actually gonna do
just for ease of assembly is, base in.

294
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,940
Oh!

295
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,340
Oh, that's so cute.

296
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,340
[JÃ¼rgen] That's pretty awful.

297
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,460
[Chigs exclaims]

298
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,220
[JÃ¼rgen] And they don't hold together.

299
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,980
Oh. Bloody hell.

300
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,620
[JÃ¼rgen] And macarons are not right.

301
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,060
Bakers, you have one minute left.

302
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,980
[sighs]

303
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,180
Oh, bugger, am I breaking this biscuit?
Didn't think this through, did I?

304
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,460
[Giuseppe] I haven't moulded
the ice cream. In hindsight, I could've.

305
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,060
But I think that this suits
the whole shape better.

306
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,380
[Lizzie] It just looks like
I've been playing in the mud.

307
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,340
I have washed my nails, people of Britain.

308
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,340
I'm a bit annoyed about the air pockets,
but otherwise, yeah, happy.

309
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,420
-Happy, happy, happy.
-[Crystelle] Last bugger.

310
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,100
Bakers, your time is up.

311
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,700
Done. Done, done, done.

312
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,620
Please place your ice cream sandwiches
at the end of your workstations.

313
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,380
There is an element of, erm,
[chuckling] church decor in there.

314
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,060
Well, there's always another Technical
to redeem myself. [laughing]

315
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,180
[birds chirping]

316
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,580
[Noel] <i>It's judgment time</i>

317
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,740
<i>for the bakers'</i>
<i>dairy-free ice cream sandwiches.</i>

318
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,740
They're a little uneven. Rather huge.

319
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,020
[Paul] You've lost
a bit of the definition in the cuts.

320
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,820
[Prue] I think you could've forgotten
about telling us about the dogs

321
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,820
because they've disappeared.

322
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,780
Actually, I love the texture.

323
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,140
It's very dry and very crumbly.

324
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,780
I didn't think I was going to like it.
[snickers] I do.

325
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,860
There is a chocolatey hint to it,
which is slightly bitter,

326
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,460
which marries it beautifully
with the ice cream.

327
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,660
It's got a nice vanilla kick in it,
but you've got that praline as well.

328
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,380
I would've blitzed that really small
and folded that through

329
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,180
so you'd have ended up
with a bit more praline in your mouth.

330
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,580
What you do get is very good,
it's just messy.

331
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,940
-Which is normal for you, isn't it?
-Yeah.

332
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,020
[all chuckle]

333
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,140
But I think your flavours
and consistency are good.

334
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,020
-Ta.
-Thanks, Lizzie.

335
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,420
{\an8}Thanks, guys.

336
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,300
-They are beautiful, Chigs.
-Thank you.

337
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,420
[Prue] Really beautiful.

338
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,660
-Very professional looking.
-[Chigs] Thank you.

339
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,620
[Prue] Look at that. Neat as a pin.

340
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,740
-The mango. Needs lots more.
-[Chigs] Mmm-hmm?

341
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,980
I think canned mango pulp
would have been better.

342
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,340
Not a lot of flavour
coming from the biscuit.

343
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,780
-[Chigs] Okay.
-Ermâ¦

344
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,980
Great texture, though.

345
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,780
The ice cream,
you do get the mango very subtly.

346
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,860
You do get that coconut as well.

347
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,620
But it's not going to last long,
it is very sorbet-like.

348
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,020
But, over all, it is nice. The ice cream
just needs more of a punch.

349
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,300
Okay. Thank you, guys.

350
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,300
Did you rest them before you baked them?

351
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,780
I didn't, because the Italian meringue
took so long to cool down.

352
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,940
The whole thing about a macaron
is the resting that creates the skin

353
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,940
which creates the dome,
which you do not have.

354
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,780
-Therefore, you end up with that.
-Yes.

355
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,899
[Prue] But you might have invented
something which is very suitable.

356
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,619
This is very chewy.

357
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,300
I like it.

358
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:37,020
-Chewy and almondy.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Mmm-hmm.

359
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:40,540
The nuts, you do get beautifully,
but the ice cream's the star here.

360
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:42,020
-Thank you.
-It's fantastic.

361
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:44,220
-Intense flavour of bananas.
-[Prue] Mmm-hmm.

362
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,619
-I think that's lovely.
-Hmm.

363
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,180
-Really good, JÃ¼rgen.
-Thank you very much.

364
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:51,220
-[exhales]
-Well done.

365
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,660
[Prue] Delicious.

366
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,060
It's a nice-looking, very uniform set.

367
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,380
[Prue] I absolutely agree.
It looks tempting and I want one.

368
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,860
[Crystelle chuckles] Good.

369
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,140
I think the flavour is absolutely lovely.

370
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,300
The texture of the ice cream
is a bit light and wet.

371
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,140
-That--
-I actually really like it. Yeah.

372
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,940
I've never had anything like that before.

373
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,900
No, the tahini in the biscuit
is akin to a sort of shortbread.

374
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,260
And the sesame comes through quite nicely.

375
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,060
Coffee levels
are perfect in the ice cream.

376
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,620
It is very flavoursome
and it holds on the tongue as well

377
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,780
which blends quite well.

378
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,420
I think you've done a good job.

379
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,980
I think you've done a really nice job.

380
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,900
-Well done, Crystelle.
-[Paul] Hmm. Thank you.

381
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,940
What? [chuckles]

382
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,060
[Prue] I think they look lovely.
Very interesting. It's almost got a--

383
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,020
[Paul] Looks like a craquelin. Yeah.

384
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,780
I think you've managed
pretty consistent shapes.

385
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,780
Let's have a look.

386
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,580
You said this is made with tofu?

387
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,340
Yes, this is made with tofu and soymilk.

388
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,260
[Prue] It's definitely not
as creamy as I thought it would be.

389
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,460
But the flavour is lovely.

390
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,820
Mmm, texture's fantastic.

391
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,340
It's a very short crispy biscuit, which,
just on its own, would be delicious.

392
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,740
But the ice cream is great.

393
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,740
The orange comes through, cooked through.
You do get a hit of the ginger as well.

394
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,020
[Prue] Oh,
the whole thing is just delicious.

395
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,940
You've done a great job with that.

396
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,940
I would love that just bashed up
in a bowl with a spoon and eat the lot.

397
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,340
[Prue] It's lovely.

398
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,220
-[Paul] Very clever.
-Thank you.

399
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,060
I don't have any
past experience in free-from,

400
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,780
so, this is probably
the most pleased I've ever been.

401
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,780
[Lizzie] What's new?

402
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,980
It's too big, don't look neat,
but they liked the flavours.

403
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,340
I was very nervous about my macarons.

404
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,900
But Prue liked myâ¦ [chuckles] "invention."

405
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,180
[Chigs] I think the others got amazing
feedback on their flavours,

406
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,980
and I didn't, so I need to
come out swinging in the Technical.

407
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,460
[Matt] <i>The bakers were able</i>
<i>to practise their dairy-free Signature,</i>

408
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,020
<i>but they have no idea</i>
<i>what the Technical will be free from.</i>

409
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,060
You lucky things,
it's time for your Technical,

410
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,620
which today has been set by the Prue.

411
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,140
-The Prue, any words of advice?
-Yes.

412
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,660
Flavour always matters,
but in this recipe it's absolutely key.

413
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,660
Thank you. Well, as ever,
this task is judged blind,

414
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,580
so we ask the judges to leave the tent.

415
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,100
[Noel] Where do you think they've gone?

416
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,220
To the dogs, mate,
like the rest of this country.

417
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,700
It's got to the point you can't even
put meat in a vegan recipe.

418
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,140
Honestly, you couldn't make it up.

419
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,060
For your Technical Challenge,
Prue would love you to make

420
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,260
eight identical vegan sausage rolls.

421
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,340
[Matt] Your sausage rolls should comprise

422
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,820
of crisp, golden, vegan rough puff pastry,

423
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,420
surrounding a mushroom and walnut filling.

424
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,060
They should be accompanied by a sticky,
caramelised red onion chutney.

425
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,740
[Matt] You have two hours.

426
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,420
-On your marks.
-Get set.

427
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,180
-[Noel] Bake.
-[Crystelle] Oh, for God's sake.

428
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,860
[Lizzie] I've made vegan sausage rolls
but not with mushrooms and walnuts.

429
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,260
Who doesn't like a sausage roll?

430
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:11,140
Haven't made sausage rolls before.
I haven't made vegan rough puff pastry.

431
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,460
This is going to be really interesting.

432
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,140
And interesting in every bad
sense of the word.

433
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,060
So, Prue, tell us all about
your vegan sausage rolls.

434
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,700
We're looking for eight
perfectly identical vegan sausage rolls

435
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,500
with really well laminated, crisp
rough puff pastry.

436
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,740
What fat do you put in the pastry?
Because you can't use butter.

437
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,660
No, it's a vegan block.

438
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,060
It's got almond, coconut and rapeseed oil

439
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,980
and then you treat it just like butter
when you're making rough puff.

440
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,940
I'm really quite impressed because it
has made really nice little laminations.

441
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,860
[Paul] They'll struggle with this,

442
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,500
with the vegan block,
which tends to melt very quickly.

443
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,020
If they chill it enough,
they'll be all right.

444
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,980
You just have to keep chilling it.

445
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,540
Mmm! Together with the chutney,
it's delicious.

446
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,940
The pastry is beautifully light.

447
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,860
And it's really flaky.
You wouldn't know it was vegan pastry.

448
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,300
Well, it's the quarter finals.

449
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,460
And I think this is
a very challenging Challenge.

450
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,860
It's certainly more difficult than
a straightforward sausage roll.

451
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,540
So, "Number one:
Make the dough for the rough puff."

452
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,340
Uh, we got flour, vegan block,
salt and water.

453
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,660
I've never used vegan block before.

454
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,180
It's got a very odd appearance.

455
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,300
It's going to be interesting
to see what it looks like.

456
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,660
I'm worried about the puff pastry because
I can't remember the last time I made it.

457
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,220
I'm looking for
the whole thing to bind together.

458
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,140
There you go.

459
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,780
And you see now it's clumping up.
I don't want to overhydrate the flour

460
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,580
'cause it'll become too sticky
to work with.

461
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,580
[JÃ¼rgen] The dough needs to be firm

462
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,300
but a little bit pliable.

463
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,020
I feel like maybe I didn't put
enough water in my pastry.

464
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,500
Just gonna go with it
and hope that it works.

465
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,060
"Number two: Laminate the dough
using the frozen vegan block."

466
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,700
[Chigs] It looks like tofu, it's weird.

467
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,740
[Lizzie] It laminates,
so once you roll it out,

468
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,780
it creates layers, and then,
in the oven, the butter melts

469
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,460
and creates steam
which puffs the pastry up.

470
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,580
Do you like laminating?

471
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,420
-I like makin' a puff pastry. Yeah.
-Do ya?

472
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,620
-This is actually--
-That's why you're making me one?

473
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,940
[chuckling] Yeah.

474
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,580
"Complete four single turns."

475
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,420
[groaning] I have no idea what that means.

476
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,780
[Chigs] I'm gonna go
for a normal book fold.

477
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,380
A third of it over, another third over
and turn it. Gotta do that four times.

478
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,660
I don't know if it'll be the way they
want it to be, but it'll be laminated.

479
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,780
[Crystelle] That's fold number two.

480
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,300
Why is mine disgusting?

481
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,060
[Lizzie] Close the sides in
so nothing comes out.

482
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,740
Is this for the puff business?

483
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,660
This is for the puff business
and this is a bad thing here.

484
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,940
[Noel] Butter come through?

485
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,060
-[JÃ¼rgen] The butter leaked out.
-[Noel] Oh, no.

486
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,740
-What could that mean?
-Bad lamination.

487
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,460
[Noel] Bad lamination.

488
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,700
What could that mean?

489
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,380
-We want loose laminations.
-Eh, Star Baker?

490
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,580
What could that mean?

491
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,140
[chuckling] "Cross Paul." Paul be cross.

492
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,500
And now I'm going
to wrap this and chill it.

493
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,700
[Giuseppe] It needs to be
resting in between folding.

494
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,100
So I'm gonna be putting this
in the fridge for another ten minutes.

495
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,860
[Chigs] Let the butter solidify again.

496
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,700
If the butter melts,
it'll ooze out in the oven.

497
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,260
I wanna keep it chilled
so it stays in the pastry.

498
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,820
[Lizzie] What am I doing?

499
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,620
"Finely chop the mushrooms and walnuts,
fry the onions."

500
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,140
[sighs heavily]

501
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,220
I like a veggie sausage roll,
but I don't normally make the middle bit.

502
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,780
I get the veggie sausages
and smush them with a fork

503
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,220
and throw them in some puff pastry.

504
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,220
-Easier, isn't it, than all this faffing?
-Something savoury for a change.

505
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,500
-Yeah, exactly.
-[Noel] Paul loves savoury.

506
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,820
He won't be able to resist getting his
sausage roll fingers onto sausage rolls.

507
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,860
-[both chuckling]
-Onto the sausage rolls.

508
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,140
-That's how he measure out the sizes.
-[laughs]

509
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,820
He puts his index finger down.

510
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,420
[Giuseppe] I do a lot of cooking at home.

511
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,340
I usually do this at least once a week

512
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,900
'cause my son Georgio's favourite pizza
is mushroom pizza.

513
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,780
[Crystelle] Once I've got that in the pan,
I'll go back to my pastry.

514
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,340
"Four single turns."

515
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,380
I might be doing double turns.

516
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,540
I'm very confused with lamination.

517
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,100
[Chigs] That's it.

518
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,500
Turns done.

519
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,620
I will save this now until later.

520
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,580
Bakers, you are halfway through.

521
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,420
-What was that?
-That was free from comedy.

522
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,860
We're good at that.

523
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,980
Jeez, already?

524
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,420
"Number four: Add the lentils,
miso, flaxseed,

525
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,020
lemon juice, parsley, sage and thyme."

526
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,020
That's quite a complex recipe.

527
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,380
[Lizzie] Mmm! Tasty!

528
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,460
[Crystelle] Miso! Hello, old friend.

529
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,740
This is different from this morning's,

530
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,860
but I guess this is what
gives it the meaty flavour

531
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,660
that you miss from actual meat.

532
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,260
Parsley, sage and thyme.

533
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,300
Do they do sausage rolls much in Italy?

534
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,500
Ah, yes! They call them differently.
They're called rustici.

535
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,900
-Ruâ¦ rustici?
-Rustici.

536
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,780
-[Matt in Italian accent] Rustici.
-[Giuseppe] Rustici.

537
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,740
-Rustici.
-Good enough!

538
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,860
[operatically] Rustici! Rustici!

539
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,340
-Don't do the--
-Rustici!

540
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,780
-There you go.
-Rustici.

541
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,900
Everybody make your rustici!

542
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,620
Rustici!

543
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,980
[laughs] I love the voice.

544
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:19,020
That's my mixture done.
I'm happy with that.

545
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,380
Let's get this pastry out and rolled out.

546
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,460
We have to carve eight rectangles
10 centimetres by 15 out of this.

547
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,540
So it needs to be relatively thin.

548
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,820
Damn it! Is that not enough pastry?

549
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,380
[Lizzie] At this point, it's just getting
stuff done, isn't it?

550
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,180
It's dodgy as, but it's eight.

551
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,100
[Crystelle] I've got off-cuts.
See what I can do with this.

552
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,220
For God's sake, come on, Crystelle!

553
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,180
"Cut ten diagonal slits

554
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,740
through the top half
of the pastry rectangle."

555
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,620
[Chigs] Sixâ¦ sevenâ¦

556
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,260
[Lizzie] Eightâ¦ nineâ¦ ten.

557
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,460
[Chigs] I'm gonna start
makin' the sausage rolls now.

558
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,820
Gross.

559
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,860
I was gonna measure this out,
but I don't have time.

560
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,980
This is not gonna look neat.

561
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,180
It is very rushed.

562
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,860
[Crystelle] And seal. I mean,
this is shoddy, isn't it?

563
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,940
[Lizzie] Paul's going to be, like,
"The crimp on that is awful."

564
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,820
[Noel] Have you made
vegan sausage rolls before?

565
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,140
Yeah, me little sister
is, like, a veggie vegan.

566
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,700
-[Noel] Is she?
-Yeah, she's dead cool.

567
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,700
[Noel] All the dead-cool kids are vegan,
aren't they?

568
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,060
-Yeah.
-Are you vegan?

569
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,020
-No.
-[Noel] Okay.

570
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,460
-I'll leave it there.
-[chuckles]

571
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,300
All right, glaze.
One tablespoon of almond milk,

572
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,540
and one tablespoon of agave,

573
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,740
which I'm gonna eyeball. There.

574
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,020
[Crystelle] Why do I always
end up rushing in this?

575
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,140
[Giuseppe] Ahâ¦ Ooh!

576
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,340
Goin' in.

577
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,580
[Crystelle] They'll have to go in.

578
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,660
-I mean, they're disgustingly ugly.
-[oven beeps]

579
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,620
[oven beeping]

580
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,860
I'll check after 20.

581
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,140
Until they're brown.

582
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,820
That's a bit of a rush. [exhales]

583
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,860
You have half an hour left.

584
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,220
[Lizzie] Half an hour.
Let's go, go, go, go.

585
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,140
"Make the caramelised red onion chutney."

586
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,700
More choppin'.

587
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,940
-[Chigs] Sizzle.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Balsamic vinegar.

588
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,260
I haven't made a chutney.
Not so sure about the flavour.

589
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,340
-[Chigs] How much chilli does it say?
-[Crystelle] I did a whole chilli.

590
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,660
-One red chilli, finely chopped.
-I don't know how much to put in.

591
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,860
I'm gonna go with that much.

592
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,220
Oh! Ooh.

593
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,020
[clears throat] Spicy chutney.

594
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,940
It needs to get all gooey and sticky.
How long have we got?

595
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,940
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

596
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,500
[oven beeps]

597
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,220
They're rising. That's a good sign
you've done something right. [chuckles]

598
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,780
My pastry looks like short crust pastry.

599
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,580
And I laminated it.

600
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,500
Get more colour! Get more colour!

601
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,380
[JÃ¼rgen] I'm just turning the tray.

602
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,100
-[tray clatters]
-[gasps]

603
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,900
This is bad. [sighs]

604
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,300
You didn't see it. [laughs]

605
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,060
Bakers, you have one minute left.

606
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,540
That's it. Coming out.

607
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,980
I'm doing it!

608
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,740
Yeah, looks done to me.

609
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,820
[sarcastically] Oh, yummy! Don't these
look appetising? Oh, dear, oh, dear.

610
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,420
They're done. So, another try.

611
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,140
These ones look better.

612
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,620
[JÃ¼rgen] Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

613
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,060
[Giuseppe] It looks and tastes good.

614
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,140
I'd eat that.

615
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,460
Bakers, your time is up!

616
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,860
Nightmare.

617
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,860
Please bring your bakes to the table

618
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,100
and place them behind your photograph.

619
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,340
[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue are looking for</i>
<i>eight crisp and beautifully laminated</i>

620
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,100
<i>vegan sausage rolls.</i>

621
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,100
<i>Made with vegan rough puff pastry,</i>

622
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,740
<i>and served with caramelised onion chutney.</i>

623
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,900
-Bit of a mixed bag, isn't it?
-[Paul] Let's start with this one?

624
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,540
There should be a better glaze on the top.

625
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,860
[Paul] I'm happy with the colour.
It's very thin.

626
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,380
But they've sealed the edges
as well as the front.

627
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,420
-The flavour is okay. Good balance.
-[Prue] Mmm.

628
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,820
Actually, the um,
onion chutney is good as well.

629
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:15,060
I like the mixture inside because
it's crumbly and soft. Lovely!

630
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,540
[Paul] Okay, moving on to these pasties.

631
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,060
[Prue chuckles] I mean,
they're meant to look like sausage rolls.

632
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,140
[Paul] It's a bit rough and ready.

633
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,020
The flavour's not bad, actually.
Did get a mouthful of nuts.

634
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,540
The onion chutney looks good.

635
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,700
I think the vegan
shortening has run out of it.

636
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,380
So it's rather tough.

637
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,140
I know, there's a lot of
chilli in that. [chuckles]

638
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,380
[coughs]

639
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,300
[Prue] My nose is running
'cause of the chilli.

640
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,060
Wow! Milk, please!

641
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,700
You can have some oat milk.

642
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,940
[all laughing]

643
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,220
-Happy with the chilli.
-[both laugh]

644
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,740
[Prue] That's a lot of chilli. Right.

645
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,260
This one is a lot better looking.

646
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,860
I think these are flat,
but they all look pretty much the same.

647
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,020
[Paul] Problem is the seals are so big.

648
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,940
Good mushroom flavour.

649
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,060
[Paul] Mmm! Mushroom flavour is there.

650
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,940
I think they're a bit overbaked.

651
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,580
-[Paul] A bit dry.
-[Prue] Mmm.

652
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,420
[Paul] Moving on,
this one is definitely overbaked.

653
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,980
-[Prue] But the lamination is quite good.
-[Paul] Yeah, the lamination you can see.

654
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,300
It's definitely overbaked,
but the flakiness is excellent.

655
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,060
It's dried out the interior, so it's drawn
the moisture out from the mushroom.

656
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,180
On to the last one.

657
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,420
-[Prue] They're a bit big and clumsy.
-[Paul] They are.

658
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,620
-[Paul] The colour looks nice.
-[Prue] Mmm.

659
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,860
-[Paul] It's a bit dry.
-[Prue] I like the flavour.

660
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,900
-[Paul] It is okay.
-[Prue] It is herby, but I like it.

661
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,220
[Paul] Okay.

662
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,420
[speaking indistinctly]

663
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,260
[Matt] <i>Paul and Prue will now rank</i>
<i>the vegan sausage rolls</i>

664
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,100
<i>from worst to first.</i>

665
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,140
In fifth place, we have this one.

666
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,020
Crystelle, not good shape,
not good glaze, too much chilli.

667
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,660
-Crystelle, come here a minute.
-Oh, good God.

668
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,380
-You want me to try that chutney?
-[Prue] He'll give you a handful.

669
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,420
-I actually did, I--
-[Paul] Did you try it?

670
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,900
-I kept the seeds in.
-You want more than that.

671
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,740
-Oh.
-[all laughing]

672
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,860
I did try it.

673
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,620
I mean, I'm okay with spice but--
[clears throat]

674
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,580
[all laugh]

675
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,940
Oh, I wish I had your timing.

676
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,580
I apologise.

677
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,740
In fourth spot, we have this one.

678
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,100
It's a bit of a mess, JÃ¼rgen.

679
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,180
It's all over the place.
It's too thick and untidy.

680
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,980
Third place, we have this one.

681
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,540
Lizzie, they all look quite good.

682
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,340
But they are very overbaked.

683
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,700
Second, we've this one.

684
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,780
Giuseppe, it's not bad.

685
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,540
They're just too flat
and you've used too much seam.

686
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,660
It needs to be bolder and a thinner seam.

687
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,140
Which means,
this one is in the first place.

688
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,140
It looks good, it tastes good.

689
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,660
It's moist inside
and the chutney is lovely.

690
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,540
-[Crystelle] Bravo!
-[all applaud]

691
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,180
And the winner gets to eat
all of Crystelle's chilli.

692
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,620
[all laugh]

693
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,860
Oh, my God, first!
I feel like I've got a full house now.

694
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,340
I've got a handshake,
I've got a Star Baker,

695
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,660
first in the Technical.

696
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,100
I'm well happy.
I needed that after this morning.

697
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,220
[sighs] Not my finest hour.

698
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,860
I feel like I'm definitely in
the running to go home.

699
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,940
But I just hope and pray
tomorrow is a better day for me.

700
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,780
It's pretty level.
Even playing field, yet again.

701
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,780
So it all counts on tomorrow.

702
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,180
It's exciting, isn't it? [chuckles]

703
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,420
[Matt] That was a Technical

704
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,260
in which you weren't very happy
with anyone, were you?

705
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,340
This was the week we needed Freya, really.

706
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,700
She'd have loved doing that.

707
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,380
The Signature over all was good.
They all did well.

708
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,740
But, for me, at the front is,
of course, Giuseppe.

709
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,980
He's the one to beat.

710
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:54,020
I mean, the likes of Chigs, who did well
in the Technical, could catch up.

711
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,140
But Giuseppe, if he drops it,
they're all going to be on him.

712
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,020
The problem is, I can't see
Giuseppe taking his eye off the ball.

713
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Who's in trouble?

714
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,980
[Paul] Both Lizzie and Crystelle,
coming into the Showstopper,

715
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,460
are the ones down at the bottom.

716
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,940
Crystelle is just so erratic.

717
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:13,420
She could be a bit more consistent
instead of genius or terrible.

718
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,620
[Prue] But Lizzie
is almost determined to not be neat.

719
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,900
And I want to strangle her
because she's a good baker,

720
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,700
-she's great--
-Be good TV.

721
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,380
-You must stop killing people.
-[chuckling] Strangling the baker.

722
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,660
[Matt] We've talked about this.

723
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,380
Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.

724
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,820
It's time for your Showstopper Challenge.

725
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,459
For your Free-From Showstopper Challenge,

726
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,060
the judges would like you to create
a visually spectacular, gluten-free

727
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,580
celebration cake.

728
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,620
[Noel] It needs
to be beautifully decorated,

729
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,979
and your cake must have
at least two tiers.

730
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,300
[received pronunciation] Like the two
tears I shed for my gluten brothers

731
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,979
who've been cast aside
for the wants and vagaries of fashion.

732
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,979
You have four hours.

733
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,540
-On your marks.
-Get set.

734
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,100
Please do bake.

735
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,140
[Noel, normally] <i>The gluten-free</i>
<i>revolution began in the 1950s,</i>

736
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,780
<i>when it was linked to</i>
<i>a host of medical conditions.</i>

737
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,939
My sister-in-law,
she's intolerant to gluten,

738
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:18,100
so she avoids it as much as possible.

739
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,939
[Noel] <i>Gluten can be found in all flour</i>
<i>made with barley, rye and wheat.</i>

740
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:27,020
A sponge traditionally uses plain flour.
They haven't got that option,

741
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,540
so they've got to think,
"What flour am I going to use?"

742
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,220
[Prue] You can do all sorts of flours,

743
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,260
but because they don't have gluten,

744
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,700
they tend to make a cake
that easily breaks apart

745
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,380
and it's quite a good idea
to give it more solidity

746
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,940
by adding quite a lot of eggs and butter.

747
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,900
[Lizzie] There is a lot of eggs
on the go today.

748
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,340
Twenty-five? It's an omelette cake,
basically. [chuckling]

749
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,340
I expect the texture to be
the same as a traditional cake.

750
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,100
They really need to bring their A-game
to get through to that semi final

751
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,380
and get a chance
to get into the final this year.

752
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,000
-[Paul] Hi, Crystelle.
-Hi, good morning.

753
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,240
Tell us about your gluten-free
celebration cake.

754
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,680
It's dedicated to my grandma,

755
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,720
who's celebrating
a very big birthday this year.

756
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,160
Before my sister's engagement, she planned
out her dress for my sister's wedding,

757
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,160
and hanging on the back of her door.

758
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,440
So, I'm going to pipe
my grandma's cascading dress.

759
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,480
-Goodness.
-Wow.

760
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,360
Going all out, cause I'm on thin ice,

761
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,440
and I really want
to prove myself and stay.

762
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,960
[Matt] <i>As well as an ambitious</i>
<i>full-length gown piped in buttercream,</i>

763
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,320
<i>Crystelle is sandwiching Jaggery creme pat</i>
<i>between her gluten-free sponges,</i>

764
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,920
<i>flavoured with coconut,</i>
<i>walnut and cardamom.</i>

765
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,960
This is cardamom from home which has been
roasted and ground to a fine powder.

766
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,320
Here we've got rice flour.

767
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,160
I've found that rice flour,
funnily enough, works okay,

768
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,800
so I just went with rice flour in the end.

769
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,800
[Matt] <i>To make their sponges,</i>

770
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,640
<i>most of the bakers</i>
<i>are using a gluten-free alternative</i>

771
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,080
<i>to traditional flour.</i>

772
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,200
[Lizzie] Coconut flour
absorbs liquid like mental.

773
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,600
[Matt] <i>And for fluffiness,</i>
<i>are mixing in a key additive.</i>

774
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,560
[Crystelle] So this is Xanthum gum.

775
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,960
Clearly, I know loads about it.
I can't pronounce the stinking thing.

776
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,440
It's a natural product.

777
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,880
And it acts as a stabiliser and a binder.

778
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,800
Like gluten in wheat flour.

779
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,760
[Matt] <i>But for his gluten-free creationâ¦</i>

780
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,920
[Giuseppe] I've tried to stay away from
the additives and tricks you can use.

781
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,720
Mostly because I'm not familiar with them.

782
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,160
<i>â¦Giuseppe has</i>
<i>a different strategy altogether.</i>

783
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,560
I'm using a recipe
which is naturally gluten-free.

784
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,800
It doesn't include any flour.

785
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,840
But, by whipping the egg white separately,

786
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,680
I'm incorporating a bit more air
and giving it more fluffiness.

787
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,640
[Noel] <i>His plan to go</i>
<i>flour-free is a risk,</i>

788
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,320
{\an8}<i>but it's not just the sponge</i>
<i>that may fall flat</i>

789
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,440
<i>if he doesn't get the gluten-free version</i>
<i>of Black Forest Gateau just right.</i>

790
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,960
[Giuseppe] As far as I know,

791
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,600
the Black Forest is Paul's favourite cake
and Prue doesn't really like itâ¦

792
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,600
Oh.

793
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,840
â¦so I've put myself
in a very awkward position.

794
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,280
You've split the judges,
which is definitely the right thing to do.

795
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,320
-[both laughing]
-On week eight.

796
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,440
-Good luck.
-Wedge them out.

797
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,080
-Yikes.
-[both chuckle]

798
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,480
[Matt] <i>Like Giuseppeâ¦</i>

799
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,200
[Chigs] I'm going to add
the apple cider vinegar now.

800
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,880
You won't get the acidity of the vinegar,
you'll get a background of it.

801
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,280
Won't be like
your fish and chips. [chuckles]

802
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:19,240
<i>â¦Chigs is also pinning his hopes on a</i>
<i>gluten-free version of a popular classic.</i>

803
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,920
[Chigs] I'm making
a two-tiered red velvet cake.

804
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,280
So, my cousin is gluten-free.
He's been gluten-free for,

805
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,560
I think, about two years now.

806
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,560
So, he was my guinea pig for this cake.

807
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,480
I got a good review from him.

808
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,120
So, it's all riding on him
for this to turn out well.

809
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,480
[Noel] <i>Featuring an ornate</i>
<i>filigree chocolate collar,</i>

810
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,880
<i>his two-tier red velvet cake</i>
<i>will be filled with strawberry jam</i>

811
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,480
<i>and alternating layers of chocolate</i>
<i>and vanilla cream-cheese frosting.</i>

812
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,520
-[Matt] Are you fan of free-from baking?
-I don't know how I feel about it.

813
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,800
-Really?
-It's all right.

814
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,560
I'd rather have the full-fat stuff.

815
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,880
[Crystelle] So, I'm doing two tiers,

816
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,440
and each tier
I've got three layers of sponge.

817
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,280
So, six layers
of sponge in total.

818
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,000
[Matt] <i>With multiple spongesâ¦</i>

819
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,400
So, these are all going to go in.

820
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,440
<i>â¦each requiring a different bake timeâ¦</i>

821
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,160
These should be done within 30 minutes.

822
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,680
That's going to take another 15 minutes
on top cause it's a thicker cake.

823
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,560
<i>â¦anything less than total precision,</i>

824
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,000
<i>and they can kiss goodbye</i>
<i>to cakes with a uniform texture.</i>

825
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,040
[Chigs] So, they're going at 160,
for 25 minutes.

826
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,600
I'm gonna have to rotate them.

827
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,680
[Matt] <i>But for</i>
<i>his super-size Showstopperâ¦</i>

828
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,480
I'm going for the three tiers.

829
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,760
[Matt] <i>â¦it's even more</i>
<i>of a challenge for JÃ¼rgen.</i>

830
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,680
[JÃ¼rgen] So, white chocolate,
milk chocolate and dark chocolate.

831
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,680
That means three sponges
of each colour for each tier.

832
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,840
Means nine sponges.

833
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,800
I calculated for 80 people.

834
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,760
It's going to be really big.

835
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,680
[Noel] <i>To up the chocolate ante</i>
<i>even further,</i>

836
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,000
{\an8}<i>JÃ¼rgen will be separating his sponges</i>
<i>with chocolate buttercream</i>

837
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,880
{\an8}<i>and decorating with chocolate ombre,</i>
<i>and a chocolate ganache drip.</i>

838
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,320
[JÃ¼rgen] My inspiration is my wife.

839
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,200
She loves chocolate cakes and she's

840
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,760
always screaming for the perfect
chocolate cake for her birthday.

841
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,280
So, this is inspired by that.

842
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,880
[Noel] <i>While JÃ¼rgen's out to impress</i>
<i>his wife and the judges</i>

843

844

<i>Lizzie is taking</i>
<i>a more philosophical approach.</i>

845
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,120
I'm celebrating being different.
It'll be a representation of my brain.

846
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,080
Because I've got quite a few SEN issues.

847
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,720
SEN is special educational needs.

848
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,720
Dyslexic, dyspraxic, ADHD
and concentration disorder.

849
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,840
I think people who are
slightly different need to be celebrated,

850
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,520
and represented.

851
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,800
I just love the idea of it
all being your personality. It's great.

852
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,600
And the decorations also, you know,
like the '70s shag rugs that you get.

853
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,280
-Yeah.
-That's what it's going to look like.

I'm going to whisk up my third sponge,
which is my chocolate sponge.

884
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,040
[Crystelle] This is jaggery,
which is from my grandma.

It's almost like
a really dark brown sugar.

00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,480
[both laughing]

896
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,920
[Noel, mimicking] "Because I'm
an efficient, powerful scientific baker."

897
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,560
-[laughing]
-"Why are you here?"

898
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,560
And I'd go,
"Good point. I'd better get my coat."

899
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,080
[both laughing]

900
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,560
[Chigs] Right.
This is the last of my cakes now.

901
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,760
That's cooled.

902
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,720
Oh, so hot.

903
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,920
There's no more baking left to do.

904
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,760
So now it's all about stuff cooling down
and decorating.

905
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,880
[JÃ¼rgen] Last three.

906
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,520
It's about time.

907
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,360
Bakers, you have one hour left.

908
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,640
What's happening here?

909
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,320
Oh, we're free from the tent.

910
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,600
Oh.

911
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,400
-[Noel] It's nice out here. The nature.
-[Matt sighs happily]

912
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,360
Nice.

913
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,080
Shall we strip off?

914
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,960
[chuckles] Again?

915
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,120
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

916
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,040
[Chigs] All right,
I'm gonna start building now.

917
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,360
[Giuseppe] It looks baked.

918
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,120
It is, uh, chewy inside,
which is what it's supposed to be.

919
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,360
There's another plate spinning.
I'm coming out.

920
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,880
Cooling times are usually
the limiting times.

921
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,840
Oh, it's going to be tight.

922
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,920
[Lizzie] Okay. That is pineapples,
jam and lime.

923
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,880
[Chigs] It is the chocolate cream cheese

924
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,040
and it's not runny,
which I'm really cool about.

925
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,760
So these are amarena, black sour cherries.
They're very flavoursome and powerful,

926
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,120
so if you put too many,

927
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,240
you might end up pushing
the balance of flavour a bit too far.

928
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,640
[Crystelle] Cake number two.

929
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,400
[JÃ¼rgen] This is whiskey and apricot.

930
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,680
Look at you go!

931
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,560
Whoops. Sorry.

932
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,240
No, it's all right.
I'm-- It's very refreshing.

933
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,360
It's not the worst thing
to be sploshed on.

934
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,800
No. No, I can definitely
think of worse things.

935
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,200
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

936
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,640
[Crystelle] Right.
I need to decorate the hell out of it,

937
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,760
which is going to take me about ten years.

938
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,480
[Giuseppe] It's going to be all covered up
in mirror glaze.

939
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,200
[Lizzie] I want to see loads of colour.

940
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,640
And then, like, very textured.

941
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,720
I love a good rose.

942
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,240
[Giuseppe] This is going to be
a messy exercise.

943
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,080
[chuckles] It is very satisfying,
isn't it?

944
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,960
[Chigs] So, this is the ganache
for the chocolate drips

945
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,880
on the bottom layer.

946
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,040
[Lizzie] It's all the things
going on in me brain.

947
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,600
Some people think, ADHD,

948
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,120
you gotta be crazy,
you know, loads of energy,

949
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,880
but it's like you've got
too many thoughts in your head

950
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,760
and you don't actually know
what to think about.

951
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,520
So it's all about colour
and, you know, like brain fuzz.

952
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,440
[Noel] Looks like a tricky stage.

953
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,840
Better for my presence.

954
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,040
Absolutely.

955
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,560
You might not believe it,
but you are a calming influence.

956
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,000
That's never been said before.

957
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,400
[Lizzie] Oh, that's a bit wonky, isn't it?

958
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,840
-And this is the second tier.
-Oh, it's the second-- Wow.

959
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,200
How big is your cake?

960
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,680
-It's big.
-[Noel] Big.

961
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,000
You can get inside it?

962
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,080
-Ah, not quite.
-[Noel] You're gonna ride it in?

963
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,160
Oh, I'm not gonna talk now,

964
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,800
'cause I don't wanna get blamed
for that when that goesâ¦ [laughing]

965
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,120
This is stressful territory,
but I'm just gonnaâ¦ Oops.

966
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,520
â¦go on as quick as I can.

967
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,120
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

968
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,800
I feel like I need to hurry up a bit.

969
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,560
Wow. I'm feeling so nervous.

970
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,320
What's wrong with me? Stop it.

971
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,800
Pipe faster.

972
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,280
[Crystelle] Right.
So, that's the bodice.

973
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,320
[Chigs] This chocolate is for the colour.

974
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,320
That will get wrapped
around the top layer of the cake.

975
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,840
I have to tidy up the edges
with lots of Chantilly cream.

976
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,440
[JÃ¼rgen] You understand
why you see me move very fast?

977
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,880
Yeah? I'm on track.

978
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,200
[Crystelle] My grandma,

979
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,080
she hasn't had
many opportunities to wear a nice dress.

980
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,880
So I think this will be almost like
the dress that she never got to wear.

981
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,160
[Lizzie] Do you think
this counts as finesse?

982
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,800
[JÃ¼rgen] So, I need the ganache
to run down the sides of the cake.

983
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,080
[Chigs] Nerve-wracking bit now.

984
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,880
[Crystelle] Shall I just move it
from A to B? I'm gonna have to.

985
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,520
There's a breeze. I'll wait for it to go

986
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,800
because it's gonna
knock over my cake, I can just feel it.

987
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,880
[JÃ¼rgen] How much time left?

988
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,200
Bakers, you have one minute left.

989
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,320
[Chigs] Oh, come on.

990
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,880
-I've gotta peel this off now.
-[Crystelle] The breeze is still there.

991
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,400
Unfortunately, I can't move
until that breeze has gone.

992
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,080
Gotta put
the decorating strawberries on top.

993
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,720
Finished in a hurry, huh?

994
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,320
We are staying very still.

995
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,760
Bakers, your time is up.

996
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,560
Done. Drop mic.

997
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,400
Please step away from your bakes.

998
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,960
[sighs in relief]

999
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,320
I feel like I've done
a gymnastics routine.

1000
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,640
[Chigs] It looks unbelievable.
Look how neat that is.

1001
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,360
It's supposed to be my grandma's dress.

1002
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,520
What! Your grandma's
got a dress like that?

1003
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,160
-Well, not thatâ¦ [laughing]
-Go on, Gran.

1004
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,560
Well done, everybody.

1005
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,480
[Lizzie] Who thought I could decorate
a cake like that? [laughs]

1006
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,200
God, I'm getting emotional.
I'm so bloody proud of you.

1007
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,560
-[Lizzie] Don't start crying, I'll cry.
-[Crystelle] I'm not gonna cry.

1008
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,880
-I will cry. [sighs]
-[Chigs] Oh, bless you.

1009
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,520
[Noel] <i>After four hours</i>
<i>making gluten-free celebration cakes</i>

1010
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,080
<i>with a place in the semi finals at stake,</i>

1011
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,800
<i>the bakers now face the judgment</i>
<i>of Paul and Prue.</i>

1012
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,840
Crystelle, would you like to bring
your Showstopper up here?

1013
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,120
[murmuring nervously] Gotta go for it.

1014
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,720
Try not to walk like an idiot.

1015
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,200
[Paul] It's a great-looking cake.

1016
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,160
[Prue chuckles] It's quite witty, too.
I like the little bodice.

1017
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,880
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Shall we see inside?

1018
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,640
[Paul] Love the roses.

1019
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,560
-Think you've done a great job with that.
-Thank you.

1020
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,480
[Prue] Mmm. I love the texture.

1021
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,960
-It's quite nutty and moist.
-Mmm-hmm.

1022
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,080
[Paul] You wouldn't know
it's a gluten-free cake at all.

1023
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,040
[Prue] No. The bake is beautiful.

1024
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,400
It's the whole coating and the icing
go beautifully with the sponge.

1025
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,800
If I have one criticism,

1026
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,360
I think that it's very heavy
on the buttercream.

1027
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,280
[Paul] But you need that
against the cardamom.

1028
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,200
[Prue] If you get
a mouthful like thatâ¦ [chuckles]

1029
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,360
Oh, I don't know, I like that.

1030
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,440
-[all laughing]
-You'd be perfectly happy with it.

1031
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,800
[Paul] I think you've done a great job.

1032
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,000
{\an8}-Well done. Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

1033
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,560
[Prue] Very neat. Very beautiful.

1034
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,520
[whispering] I don't know.

1035
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,160
It's the top, it's just
a little bit awkward for me.

1036
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,320
It hides a lot when you pipe like this.

1037
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,360
Oh, okay.

1038
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,680
My cake is inspired to the flavours
of the Black Forest,

1039
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,960
that is, cherry, chocolate and, uh, cream.

1040
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,440
It's actually a bit gluey.

1041
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,240
Kirsch and the cherries are very strong.

1042
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,960
[Paul] The cherries are pretty sporadic.

1043
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,440
The sponge is quite stodgy.

1044
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,240
-Is this a Chantilly?
-[Giuseppe] Yes.

1045
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,600
I would have done an Italian meringue.
That would've worked beautifully well.

1046
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,800
Underwhelmed.

1047
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,080
-[Prue] Mmm.
-Mmm.

1048
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,160
I expected better from you.

1049
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,480
I do think it looks great.

1050
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,200
-Thank you.
-You got good drops

1051
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,800
on your naked cake down at the bottom.

1052
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,640
The colour's worked.
It's a nice job. It looks like a crown.

1053
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,080
There's a lot of detail in it.
It's really impressive, isn't it?

1054
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,200
[Paul] Let's see if we can chop
into this bad boy, shall we?

1055
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,960
[Prue] The layers are lovely and distinct.

1056
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,880
-I love it.
-[chuckles]

1057
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,480
It's spot-on.
It's a great chocolate sponge.

1058
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,560
And, actually, you've got
a lot of buttercream in there.

1059
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,640
-[Prue] Mmm.
-But it works.

1060
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,160
Cream-cheese frosting again,
that's, like, cooling on the tongue.

1061
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,320
That's a nice cake.

1062
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,160
I can't fault it. I think it's lovely.

1063
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,600
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Great job, Chigs.

1064
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,880
-Thank you very much.
-Well done.

1065
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,136
Who knew right at the beginning

1066
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:07,100
that you could produce that
in the quarter finals?

1067
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,640
I know. Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.

1068
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,640
I would have never known
that was a chocolate cake.

1069
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,960
[Prue laughs]

1070
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,400
I think it looks absolutely beautiful.

1071
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,560
[Paul] The whole effect
with the drips you've got

1072
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,520
are all perfect and so is the piping.

1073
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,120
-[Prue] Oh, that looks so beautiful.
-[Noel] Wow!

1074
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,800
That apricot with the chocolate sponges

1075
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,840
is beautiful. It's really nicely baked.

1076
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,800
-It's not dry at all.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Mmm-Hmm.

1077
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,080
I also think the buttercream
is beautifully light.

1078
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,880
-Thank you very much.
-[Paul] Well done.

1079
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,080
-[Matt] Well done.
-[Noel] Well done, JÃ¼rgs.

1080
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,200
-[Paul] Matches his T-shirt.
-[Prue] Yeah. [chuckling]

1081
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,440
-[laughing]
-[Prue] Ombre T-shirt.

1082
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,280
[sighs, whispering]
Well done. Really good.

1083
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,880
This is my celebration of being different.

1084
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,760
I mean, that is just amazing.

1085
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,840
And the rice paper offshoots
are just so beautifully done.

1086
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,280
Look at the tiny little
letters and numbers.

1087
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,160
I love it. It reminds me of something
from the cartoon <i>The Yellow Submarine.</i>

1088
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,200
I've never seen a cake like it.
I don't think any of us have.

1089
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:30,440
So, it's a lime Swiss meringue
and a coconut cake with pineapple jam.

1090
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,120
You really need to eat
the buttercream with it

1091
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,560
because the pineapple is very strong
and there's a lot of it.

1092
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,920
I do get a hint of the lime.
And you need that in there.

1093
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,920
You've got the coconut
in the sponge as well,

1094
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,840
which you can taste.

1095
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,680
-[Prue] Yes, the coconut's good.
-And you've got the pineapple.

1096
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,040
I'd have that on my 40th any day.

1097
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,800
When it eventually comes round.

1098
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,760
-[laughing]
-[Lizzie] Okay. [chuckles]

1099
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,320
-[Prue] I think it's wonderful.
-We asked for exquisite and finesse.

1100
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,280
And we got it.

1101
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,000
I knew you could do it.

1102
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,880
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Ta.

1103
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,160
[Matt] Well done.

1104
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,640
It's just fantastic.

1105
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,080
-[mouthing] Oh, my God!
-[mouthing] I know.

1106
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,920
Oh, my God. Finesse!

1107
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,800
I got finesse.

1108
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,400
I've won <i>Bake Off</i> in my mind.

1109
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,040
[Chigs] I don't know how I'm doing this.

1110
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,440
Paul's comment was
that he couldn't fault it.

1111
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,800
So, really overwhelming.

1112
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,440
Happy, really happy.

1113
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,920
Mine was a bit of a disaster. [chuckles]

1114
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,520
<i>I think that puts me,</i>
<i>you know, in an awkward position,</i>

1115
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,800
<i>despite having done quite well yesterday.</i>

1116
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,680
I'm not sure what to expect, to be honest.

1117
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,720
[Crystelle] I'm very happy that went well,
but I don't feel safe at all.

1118
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,080
I'll cross my fingers, my toes,
say a prayer.

1119
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,920
And, hopefully, my grandma,
who I dedicated my cake to,

1120
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,440
is saying a prayer for me, too.

1121
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,780
Wow. The world has turned upside down.

1122
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:00,460
Four extraordinary Showstoppers
and Giuseppe didn't really impress you.

1123
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,580
-The middle was no good at all.
-[Paul] It was stodgy.

1124
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,700
But I think, ultimately,
Giuseppe was in a strong position anyway.

1125
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,980
Giuseppe had done enough prior
to these two challenges to save himself.

1126
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,460
-Yeah. I think Giuseppe's safe.
-What about JÃ¼rgen?

1127
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,140
Those layers of the white,
milk and dark chocolate.

1128
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,420
-Clever.
-And they were beautifully done.

1129
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,020
-It was a delicious cake.
-So he's gotta be in line for Star Baker.

1130
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,460
Absolutely. And I think JÃ¼rgen stepped up,
but he's not the only one.

1131
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:26,820
Chigs. The cream cheese frosting,
the buttercream,

1132
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,420
the sponge itself.

1133
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,220
-Beautiful.
-[Prue] This was a faultless cake.

1134
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,060
Well, let's talk about Lizzie's.

1135
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,580
She made a cake and a pet
at the same time.

1136
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,220
The time she spent, you know,
creating that bear rug,

1137
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,460
we all knew she could come up
with something with finesse.

1138
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,580
-I think she's done it.
-It's a complete triumph.

1139
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,060
Now, Crystelle came into today in trouble.

1140
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,580
Did she do enough with her Showstopper?

1141
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,420
Problem is,
everybody else has done the same.

1142
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,780
They've all done really well.

1143
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,340
But Crystelle and Lizzie
are absolutely neck and neck.

1144
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,340
I think you've got to look at it,
generally, as bakers,

1145
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,460
which one deserves their place
in the semi final?

1146
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:12,500
Well, bakers, you have made the judges'
lives quite difficult this week

1147
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:16,340
because all five of you
are terrific bakers

1148
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:21,380
and all five of you have had moments
of real excellence in the tent this week.

1149
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,260
But we do have to separate you.

1150
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:28,460
And I'm lucky in that
I have the job of telling you

1151
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,020
which one of you
is going to be Star Baker.

1152
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:37,020
I'm delighted to say
that Star Baker this week isâ¦

1153
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:40,940
Chigs.

1154
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,380
-Well done.
-[Crystelle] Well done!

1155
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,180
I've got the horrible job of announcing
the person who's going home.

1156
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,580
And, as Matt said, it was so close.

1157
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,500
You've all been so fantastic.

1158
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:03,420
The person who's leaving us isâ¦

1159
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,380
Lizzie.

1160
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,900
[voice breaking] No. No. No. No.
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1161
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:12,980
[Crystelle sobbing]

1162
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:16,860
[both sobbing]

1163
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:23,580
I feel really proud of myself.
I'm really happy. Oh, God. [chuckles]

1164
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:29,260
I was so overwhelmed to even get here
and now I'm, like, a quarter finalist.

1165
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,580
And now I'm dead Scouse 'cause I'm crying.

1166
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,380
-[Crystelle] Bloody Technical Challenges.
-You were so good.

1167
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,820
Thanks. Oh, God. [chuckles]

1168
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,660
[Lizzie] It's such an amazing experience,

1169
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:45,620
oh, to, like, meet the people
that I've met and, like,

1170
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,500
learn everything.

1171
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,540
[sighs]

1172
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:52,140
[Paul] You did really well.

1173
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:55,180
It's really sad to see Lizzie go,
someone from my neck of the woods.

1174
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,340
She's been a bit up and down
over the weeks,

1175
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,820
but, actually, this week,
she did really well.

1176
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,620
The problem was she came up with an ace
when everybody else did as well.

1177
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,180
I am proud of myself.
It's, like, happy tears.

1178
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,620
I can't wait to go and walk my dog,
to be honest.

1179
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,340
[all laughing]

1180
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,700
[Chigs] I can't believe
I got a Star Baker.

1181
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:16,460
Getting one was brilliant,
but getting two? Wow!

1182
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,820
It feels good

1183
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,900
and I just get more
and more confident week on week.

1184
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,420
[Crystelle] <i>Semi final</i>
<i>of</i> The Great British Bake Off.

1185
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,580
I don't think
it's going to sink in for a while.

1186
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:27,540
[sighs]

1187
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,300
Semi finals! [laughing]

1188
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,020
[closing theme music playing]
