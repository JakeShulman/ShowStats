-Either's fine. I never knew myself.
-Hmm.

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,200
You come down for the show?

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,240
Yeah, yeah,
I come every year as it goes, yeah.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,720
It's nice being a ghost,

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,480
'cause you don't have to wait for it
to come on TV.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,080
You can be invisible, go in the tent
and watch it as it happens.

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,080
Exactly. And if you want to
get involved, just knock a cake over.

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,320
[chuckles] Bit of fun.

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,240
-You do that?
-Do you remember Sura?

13
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,400
-Oh, last year, with Dave?
-Yeah, that was me.

-Have I missed anything?
-[Noel] No, it's about to start.

17
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,800
Oh, hello, Buddy Holly.

I'm Prue Leith.

Oh, sorry, you look just like
my mate Buddy Holly.

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,480
Stop messing about, boys,
and start the show.

21
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,200
Sorry, Buddy. I mean, Prue.

Clearly, the least capable baker.

44
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,840
Most likely to go out this week,
patisserie's not really my thing.

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,080
But enough of the negativity.

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,400
I just need to enjoy it,
'cause the worst that could happen is

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,240
I go out as a semi-finalist
and that's not too shabby.

48
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,680
-It's nice and quiet.
-Yeah, I know. [chuckles]

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,880
Eerily quiet.

50
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,800
[Giuseppe] I'm not surprised
I'm standing here.

51
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,960
I'm shocked
that I'm standing here. [chuckles]

52
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,280
I had to buy new clothes

53
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,560
because I didn't expect
to make it this far.

54
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,200
Of course it would be extremely exciting
to be in the final.

55
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,640
Patisserie Week. The tasting grade
should play to my strengths.

56
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,680
The "looking" grade, that's where
I need to hone my skills.

57
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
[Chigs] This week,
I do feel a bit out my depth.

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,280
[exhales]

59
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,400
In the practice tent, I made the mistake
of looking at the others' bakes.

60
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,560
It was like,
"Oops, what have I got myself into?"

61
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,160
Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent,

62
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,880
and congratulations
for reaching the semi-final.

63
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,280
For your semi-final Signature Challenge,

64
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,240
the judges would like you to bake
eight patisserie-style layered slices.

65
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,080
Your layered slices need to be identical,

66
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
and, when cut into,
they should hold their form,

67
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,000
displaying those beautiful layers.

68
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,320
The judges will be looking for
technically flawless, high-end bakes.

69
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,160
Basically, you just have to make
Pat Isserie very proud.

70
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,400
[Matt] Who's Pat Isserie?

71
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,400
He's a plumber from Bolton.
He loves this show.

72
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,080
[Matt] Oh, that's nice!

73
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,840
Hi, Pat, if you're watching.

74
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,640
You have three hours.

75
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,040
-On your marks.
-Get set.

76
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,080
[sing-song] Bake!

77
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,240
[Giuseppe] The judges are expecting
flawless, patisserie-style slices.

78
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,400
They must have been looking for words
that would scare the hell out of us.

79
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,440
[Chigs] You can't afford to make
any mistakes in any part,

80
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,720
and I make a lot of mistakes. [chuckles]

81
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,680
[Prue] I love Patisserie Week

82
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,000
because it gives the bakers a chance
to show how skilful they can be.

83
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,320
[JÃ¼rgen] Going on for the semi-final.

84
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,520
Going to measure ingredients precisely
and not lose track of what I'm doing.

85
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,120
We're asking
for eight identical layered slices.

86
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,600
I think there's going
to be nine layers in total.

87
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,800
We want those lines to be visible,
clear and absolutely impeccable.

88
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,080
This is all about finesse.
Exquisite flavours.

89
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,120
[Crystelle] This is my yuzu curd.

90
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,840
It's a kind of cross between
a grapefruit and a lemon.

91
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,240
It is a bit of a risk.

92
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,319
[Paul] The four bakers,
they've all had a handshake,

93
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,960
and they've all been
Star Baker at least once.

94
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,640
So, we do have the best of the best
in the tent at the moment.

95
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,400
-[Paul] Hello, Crystelle.
-[Crystelle] Good morning.

96
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,320
Crystelle, tell us about
your Signature slices.

97
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,120
It's got coconut
and black sesame dacquoise,

98
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,240
a yuzu curd,
black sesame and almond Joconde,

99
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,000
and a white chocolate and coconut
Italian meringue buttercream,

100
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,320
and those layers are repeated.

101
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,800
Then a layer
of white chocolate ganache

102
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,120
piped with whipped cream.

103
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,920
-Very simple.
-Very, very simple. [chuckles]

104
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,680
[Matt] <i>Crystelle is going way beyond</i>
<i>the three layers demanded by the brief.</i>

105
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,160
<i>She'll use sesame to flavour</i>
<i>not just her four layers of sponge,</i>

106
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,440
<i>but a caramel brittle</i>
<i>that sits on piped Chantilly cream,</i>

107
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,880
<i>designed to help balance</i>
<i>the sharp yuzu curd.</i>

108
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,680
[Noel] You're one step from the final.

109
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,320
You have to think about that

110
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
but you have to put that
right out of your mind.

111
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,440
I don't want to feel pressure.
I want to bake and enjoy it.

112
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,920
What else do you want? World peace?

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,040
-And a full-body massage.
-World peace, er,

114
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,000
-an end to the pandemic.
-[laughs]

115
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,560
That's an absolute lie.

116
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,920
You want this so bad,
it's eating you up inside.

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,760
-Wellâ¦ [laughs]
-Anyway, good luck. Bye-bye.

118
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,640
[Matt] <i>All of the bakers are including</i>
<i>a whisked sponge called a Joconde.</i>

119
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,640
[Chigs] A Joconde is just
with egg whites and a bit of fat.

120
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,760
And some sort of nut put through it,
so you could have almond or pistachio.

121
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,680
[Crystelle] There is no leavening agent,

122
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,160
so you wanna make sure you put enough air
into both your whites and your yolks.

123
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,320
[Giuseppe] This looks perfect to me.

124
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,600
[Chigs] This now has
the flour and almonds.

125
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,200
You just want to be gentle, but quick.

126
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,520
If you're too rough, it won't rise,
'cause you knock all the air out.

127
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,400
This is going in the oven immediately.

128
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,400
[JÃ¼rgen] It's a very thin sponge,
so it cooks very quickly.

129
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,960
[oven beeps]

130
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,880
And in my notes it says, "Watch."

131
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,240
Big mistake! Big mistake!

132
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,840
Big mistake!

133
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,120
[utensil clattering]

134
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,720
-Giuseppe, good morning.
-Good morning, guys.

135
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,640
[Paul] What have you done here?

136
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,360
I just put my batter
into the oven for baking,

137
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,400
and realised the flour is here. [chuckles]

138
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,920
-[both chuckling]
-Well, at least you realised before.

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,720
-Phew!
-Tell us all about your layered slice.

140
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,040
My layered slice

141
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,880
is inspired to a quintessential
Italian cake which is tiramisu.

142
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,880
Bravo!

143

[Matt] <i>Crystelle</i>

<i>to her slices.</i>

154
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,280
Once I've got the baked elements
and the buttercreams and curds done,

155
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,040
it's then a case of assembly.

156
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,280
Now, I'm doing a billion things at once.

157
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,680
Happens to me all the time, man.

158

[JÃ¼rgen] You're coming out.

159
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,520
Good texture.

160
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,360
[Chigs] Five more minutes.
I'm gonna overbake it a bit

161
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,720
because I'm gonna soak it in syrup,
so it can hold its integrity.

162
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,000
I am making
a raspberry and chocolate slice.

163
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,760
I want to make sure the flavour
of the raspberry comes across

164
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,720
more than the chocolate,
'cause chocolate can be overpowering,

165
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,440
but I want that raspberry
to punch them round the face.

-This should play to your new strengths--
-Fingers crossed.

173
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,760
If you want to get through to the final,
only one person can do that.

174
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,800
Just me. I know.

175
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,880
-Good luck.
-Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.

176

-Good luck.
-Cheers, Matt.

177
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,960
That meant a lot, that they've
noticed my finishing is getting better.

178
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,720
But the pressure's there definitely now.

179

I can't get him saying that, and then me
make an absolute mess of this.

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,880
[JÃ¼rgen grunts] It's called
"Murder at the Opera."

181
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,560
A variation of the opera cake.

[JÃ¼rgen] My wife came up with the name.

184
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,680
She tasted the beetroot,

190

[JÃ¼rgen] I like the opera.
Probably my most favourite

191
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,200
is Alban Berg's <i>Wozzeck</i>
because it's multi-layered.

192
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,720
It has a lot of hidden things,
bit like my bakes. [laughs]

[Crystelle] Gonna take out these bad boys.

194
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,600
It's got a nice crust, which is good
because it will stop it from going soggy.

-Sure.
-Introducing Sharky Sharkerson.

You ready, Sharky?
This is your big moment.

[Matt mimicking Sharky] Hello, bakers.
You're halfway through the challenge.

202

By the way, I'd like to say,
sharks get a very bad rap.

203

[Noel] All right, that's enough.

204

Unbelievable. I told him to
stick to the script and project.

That's a good one, innit? [chuckles]

299
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,760
[Giuseppe] This should be fine.
I'm shaking.

300
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,000
You have one minute left!

301
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,960
[Chigs] I can't stop shaking.

302
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,000
It should go like that.

303
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,040
[Chigs exclaims]

304
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,960
[JÃ¼rgen] The buttercream
isn't as set as I wanted.

305
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,720
And they're not exactly the same size.

306
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,840
The more I look at them,
the more I'm not happy with them.

307
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,720
Neat enough, I think. [chuckles]

308
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,280
Bakers, your time is up!

309
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,920
Yeah, just a second.

310
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,320
Please place your slices
at the end of your stations.

311
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,640
-[exhales]
-[chuckling] You all right?

312
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,480
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

313
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,760

315
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,200
-Chigs.
-Hi.

316
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,480
{\an8}-[Prue] It looks good, Chigs.
-[Chigs] Thank you.

317
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,720
I like them a lot. You've managed
to create nice, sharp lines.

318
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,760
-Very Parisian.
-[Prue] Making my mouth water.

319
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,240
Erm, I like the sponge in there.
The sponge is good.

320
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,080
I think you've got just enough chocolate
there to marry it with the raspberry.

321
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,280
-Mmm.
-[Chigs] Are you serious?

322
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,640
-[Paul] Absolutely.
-[bakers clapping]

323
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,440
[Chigs] Thank you.

324
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,800
[Prue] I was a bit nervous
because that chocolate is quite strong.

325
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,040
Then I took it with the raspberry,
and it's perfect.

326
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,040
-[Paul] Yeah.
-So, that was all right, then.

327
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,440
-Well done.
-Thank you very much.

328
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,560
-Thank you, Chigs.
-Thank you, guys.

329
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,200
-[whispering] Not bad.
-[Chigs] Thank you.

330
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,280
{\an8}Very nice, JÃ¼rgen.
The layers look stark, sharp.

331
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,480
The daggers make it,

332
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,640
'cause it does look very different
from a traditional opera cake.

333
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,240
[Prue] Thank you.

334
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,360
I think that's sensational.

335
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
-Thank you.
-The textures are absolutely perfect.

336
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,320
I like it, but I don't love it.

337
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,040
The flavour I do get is coffee.
And a bit of chocolate.

338
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,080
I cannot taste anything else.

339
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Beetroot will bring colour and sweetness,
but it won't bring flavour.

340
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,320
Textures are spot-on, though,
I'll give you that.

341
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,800
Pity I'm not the one
who hands out handshakes.

342
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,000
-Thank you.
-I'll give you two.

343
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,800
{\an8}[Prue] They're very unusual.

344
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,480
Really striking.

345
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,000
-[Noel] Exotic caterpillar colours.
-That's exactly what I was going for.

346
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,040
-[chuckles]
-[Noel] I hope so.

347
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,840
It's quite an unusual texture
because the dacquoise is really chewy.

348
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,280
[Paul] Yuzu is such a beautiful flavour.

349
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,520
But then you're left with the sesame

350
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,720
and that gorgeous texture of the creams
and the sponges going through there.

351
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,400
Oh, my God. [exclaims]

352
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,960
-Well done.
-[bakers clapping]

353
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,680
[Prue] Crystelle, that's absolutely
deserved because it's very striking.

354
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,440
It's absolutely delicious.
It's a little bit of genius.

355
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,280
[Paul] I've never had
anything like that before.

356
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,320
-Well done.
-Thank you so much.

357
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,960
-Thank you.
-Well done.

358
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,920
-What's happening to my life?
-You haven't woken up yet.

359
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,120
-This is a dream.
-[Crystelle] Yeah. [sighs]

360
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,839
{\an8}It's really very elegant,
and looks very stylish.

361
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:35,559
Because the Joconde is soaked,
it's so soft.

362
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,319
-It's just delicious.
-It is.

363
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,680
[Prue laughing]

364
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,280
-How annoying is that?
-[contestants applaud]

365
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,640
The masala wine in there,

366
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,840
and the stewed sultanas
gives that little bit of body to it.

367
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,480
Sorry, I don't understand
anything you're saying.

368
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,000
-I'm just trying to fight backâ¦
-[all laughing]

369
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,320
I don't think I've ever had an afternoon
in the tent as satisfactory as this one.

370
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,480
-Wow.
-[Noel] Three handshakes!

371
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,000
-Excellent.
-You're gonna have to retire. [chuckles]

372
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,960
-Well done, mate. Amazing.
-Thank you.

373
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,840
-[Paul] Sorry, JÃ¼rgen.
-You got a handshake from me, all right?

374
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,120
I'd have given you one.

375
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,680
Okay.

376
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,280
[Giuseppe] Going from, "My slices
don't look as polished

377
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,760
as I would have liked them to be,"

378
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,800
to handshake, I was ecstatic.

379
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,280
[Crystelle]<i> Well,</i>
<i>when he took out his hand,</i>

380
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,680
I just thought of my family
jumping for joy

381
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,240
because I literally told them yesterday,
"This isn't going to be my week."

382
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,400
And they went, "Crystelle, be positive."

383
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,360
So I'm kind of being positive
for them, really.

384
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,960
And I'm really happy.
As a collective, we've done really well.

385
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,280
[Chigs]<i> Don't mean nothing today,</i>
<i>handshake don't mean anything.</i>

386
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,920
Just giving them out willy-nilly.

387
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,920
[JÃ¼rgen] There were three handshakes
in the tent. I didn't get one.

388
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,960
The judges were divided.

389
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,920
Bottom line, I'm in trouble now.

390
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,920
[Matt] <i>For the bakers, the pressure</i>
<i>of Patisserie Week is about to rise</i>

391
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,440
<i>as they face their toughest Technical yet.</i>

392
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,040
[Noel] Hello, bakers.
Welcome back to the tent.

393
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,040
It's time for your Technical Challenge,

394
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,560
which today has been set for you
by the adorable Prue.

395
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,600
-Prue, ay words of wisdom?
-Yes. Use your time wisely.

396
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,720
And remember that setting and chilling
are really important.

397
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,760
As ever, the Technical Challenge
will be judged blind.

398
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,880
So we're gonna have to ask
these two to leave the tent.

399
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
Bye-bye.

400
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,840
Where do you think they're going?

401
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,200
[Noel] Prue's taking Paul to a safari park

402
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,280
so he can be released
back in with the gorillas.

403
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,920
Oh. Yes, I heard about
the new silverback breeding programme.

404
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,240
That's great.

405
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,680
Now, for your Technical Challenge,

406
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,080
Prue would love you
to make a sablÃ© breton tart.

407
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,080
Your tart should consist
of a sablÃ© breton pastry

408
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,360
topped with raspberry confiture
and piped pistachio crÃ¨me mousseline.

409
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,640
It must be filled with fresh berries

410
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,960
and decorated with gilded meringue kisses
and chocolate curls.

411
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,400
[Matt] You have two hours and 45 minutes.

412
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,320
On your marks.

413
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,360
-Get set.
-Bake.

414
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,320
<i>Ay, caramba.</i> Look at all this stuff.

415
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,520
[JÃ¼rgen] I've heard of sablÃ© breton.

416
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,520
I think, essentially,
we know what we're doing.

417
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,000
I ain't got a clue what's going on.

418
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,240
I don't know anything they said
besides pistachio and fruit.

419
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,720
Semi finals, then, Prue,
and you've chosen a sablÃ© breton tart.

420
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,600
-It's quite complicated, isn't it?
-It is.

421
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,640
[Prue] They have to do
quite a lot of things.

422
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,800
They've got to make a sablÃ© breton bottom,

423
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,160
which is a very thick biscuit.

424
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,920
And then there's a thin layer
of raspberry confiture,

425
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,280
French for jam.

426
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,680
And then mousseline
flavoured with pistachio.

427
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,240
Then the raspberries and strawberries,

428
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,280
meringue kisses,
and curls of tempered chocolate.

429
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,080
So where could they go wrong with this?

430
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,200
They might not understand
that this thing doesn't have sides.

431
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,560
They just cut the pastry out,
plonk it in the tin to get that nice edge.

432
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,040
Right. That could catch them out.

433
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,480
And they have to watch
their setting and chilling.

434
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,120
That crÃ¨me mousseline
really has to be thick enough

435
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,280
not to run down the sides,
but soft enough to get the perfect shape.

436
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,040
It almost looks like a sponge.

437
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,200
[Paul] It does.

438
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,640
[Prue] It's buttery and light
like a shortbread.

439
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,440
-Not as sweet as a shortbread.
-No.

440
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,920
It's gorgeous.
The French know what they're doing.

441
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,880
-[Prue] I know.
-Aren't they annoying?

442
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,640
I do like the mousseline,
the texture's lovely, it's nice and light.

443
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,600
I'm not sure how the bakers
are going to deal with this.

444
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,440
From the sablÃ© to the mousseline,

445
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,840
will they be able
to get their timings right? I don't know.

446
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,320
But it is the semi final.
We know they're very good.

447
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,360
So, let's go and see.

448
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,560
So, I'm starting with the sablÃ© dough,
'cause that needs to chill.

449
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,560
The first step is,
"Whisk the egg yolks and caster sugar."

450
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,440
"Add softened butter,
and then the dry ingredients."

451
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,480
This is fancy butter,
it's Brittany butter.

452
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,880
I suppose that's what makes
this breton tart a breton tart.

453
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,840
I'm just adding the dry ingredients.

454
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,000
I think the key here
is just not to overwork the dough

455
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,280
like any shortcrust.

456
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,120
[JÃ¼rgen] I do it by hand
because I can be gentler than the machine.

457
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,800
I want to keep the dough very short.

458
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,280
[Chigs] That's the dough done, I think.

459
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,560
Now, it says "chill." I don't know
if I should freeze or fridge it.

460
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,240
I think I'm gonna put it in the fridge.
It says "chill," not freeze, soâ¦

461
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,680
-Okay. Oh.
-[tray clatters]

462
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,160
Right. That's step one done.

463
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,680
-[Noel] Hello.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Hi, Noel.

464
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,240
Well, I just thought that was wrong.

465
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,480
Everyone getting a handshake
except for JÃ¼rgy-pops.

466
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,440
But I feel like you're strong enoughâ¦

467
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,760
-I should be--
-â¦to rise from the ashes.

468
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,920
I should be able to.

469
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,800
[Noel] I just thought I'd check in,
see if you're all right.

470
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,720
You seem fine.

471
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,200
You're not going to get caught up
in all the hysteria, are you?

472
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,640
-[speaking indistinctly]
-It's not your style.

473
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,120
-You're the jazz baker.
-Hmm.

474
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,240
Just probably go back

475
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,280
and play some Miles Davis
on your trombone, right?

476
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,320
-Something like that.
-You, silhouetted against the moon--

477
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,600
-I'm gonna get some raspberries.
-Okay, bye-bye.

478
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,000
SablÃ© done. For meringue kisses,
make meringue.

479
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,560
Okay, so one medium egg white.

480
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,440
Probably should've used a smaller bowl.

481
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,760
[Crystelle chuckles]

482
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,600
How is this looking?

483
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,400
Still really runny.
I don't know if I'm doing this right.

484
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,600
[exclaims]

485
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,240
Looks done.

486
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,800
I might start again.

487
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,640
I just feel like that's not looking
like what a meringue should look like.

488
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,400
[Giuseppe] I'm making these very small,

489
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,120
'cause the smaller they are,
the quicker they will be to bake.

490
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,880
Is there a piping nozzle here?
Have they given us a nozzle?

491
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
Nope.

492
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,360
[Crystelle] This looks more like
the meringue we know and love.

493
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,240
[Chigs] Can't fit any more on.
Let's go.

494
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,320
These are gonna take about--

495
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,160
I don't know. I'll have to keep checking.

496
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,640
Okay, meringue kisses are done.
Right. Make the raspberry confiture.

497
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,120
Oh, it's a piping nozzle
to make the meringue kisses.

498
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,760
Now they're in the oven,
I can't do anything about it.

499
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,680
All right. Step number three,
we make the raspberry confiture.

500
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,120
Raspberry confiture.
Am I saying that right? "Confiture."

501
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,040
Raspberries, jam sugar and pectin.

502
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
That's just jam. Right?

503
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,960
Confiture is like a jam,
but it's got bits of fruit.

504
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,080
It's a bit more rustic.

505
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,240
Right, okay.
"Make pistachio paste and use--"

506
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,200
What?

507
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,600
"Use to make pistachio crÃ¨me mousseline."

508
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,880
CrÃ¨me mousselini. Right. Erm--

509
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,960
[JÃ¼rgen] CrÃ¨me mousseline is crÃ¨me pat,
with additional butter.

510
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,640
I've got my egg yolks,
flour and sugar here.

511
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,800
And I'm just tempering this
with vanilla-infused milk.

512
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,760
This is done.

513
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,440
While it's still warm,
I think I put the butter in.

514
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Just going to make sure
that butter all melts into there.

515
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,560
-Hey, Matt, how's it going? Good?
-Good, thanks.

516
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,400
-How's it going for you?
-Yeah, all right.

517
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,400
I'm making some sort of crÃ¨me mousseline.

518
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,400
Named after the, er,
Italian dictator Mussolini.

519
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,840
But that's what I thought,
it was called crÃ¨me Mussolini.

520
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,880
-They said, "No, Chigs, that's wrong."
-Yeah.

521
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,880
How'd you feel about the handshake?

522
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,240
Yeah, it was good. I was happy. And then--

523
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,000
-[Matt] Everyone else got one.
-[Chigs] Crystelle got one.

524
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,640
And then he got one.

525
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,720
That's extraordinary. I don't think
that's ever happened in the tent.

526
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,400
-Never?
-I don't think so.

527
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,240
-I don't watch this show.
-[laughs]

528
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,440
I watch the other side.

529
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,080
[Chigs laughing] Good.

530
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,440
I'm assuming that's the right stage
to add the pistachio paste.

531
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,480
Now, it doesn't say how much to put in.

532
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,000
[JÃ¼rgen] I added my pistachios
to the crÃ¨me mousseline.

533
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,760
-That is looking good.
-[Chigs] Whack it all in.

534
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,800
They want pistachio taste,
I'll give them pistachio.

535
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,000
[Giuseppe] Looks good to me.
Certainly green.

536
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,600
Mmm, oh! Tastes really pistachio-y.

537
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,920
[Chigs] Just needs to chill now.
I'll pop this in the fridge.

538
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,840
Bakers, you are halfway through.

539
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
Approaching one hour

540
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,240
that the meringue kisses
have been in the oven.

541
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
Gonna take them out.

542
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,560
I don't want them to brown.
Ah, there we go. They're done.

543
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,000
[Giuseppe] They're perfectly baked.

544
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,160
They, er, look good.

545
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,560
It's not really French patisserie, is it,
that colour?

546
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,720
They're not supposed to be
brown like that.

547
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,200
-Oh, my God, look at JÃ¼rgen's. Perfect.
-[JÃ¼rgen] I'm happy with them. Next step.

548
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,120
"Roll and cut the sablÃ© dough
to fit the tin."

549
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,280
[Chigs] I'm assuming this dough
is gonna have to be really thin.

550
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,200
Just trying to gauge
if the tart needs sides.

551
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,560
It just says, "Roll out the sablÃ© dough
and fit it in the tin."

552
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,720
I just don't know if
it's supposed to be a sideless pastry.

553
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,120
I just don't know.

554
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,600
Do you go up the sides?
Or just put it in the bottom?

555
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,000
SablÃ© breton is usually baked
as a thick layer,

556
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,400
as far as I remember.

557
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,160
I'm not gonna do the sides.

558
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,240
I'm gonna roll it out
so it just fits the circle.

559
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,280
Right.

560
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,160
This dough melts literally in your hands.

561
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,400
Right. We're in.

562
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,920
[JÃ¼rgen] I expect that
to bake for 25 minutes.

563
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,720
I'm gonna say, this thickness,
about 20 minutes.

564
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,560
So I'm gonna be heating this
at least 20 minutes.

565
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,840
Okay, I hope
that was the right thing to do.

566
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,680
-But it's in now.
-[Chigs] What was I gonna do now?

567
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,960
Er, chocolate.

568
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,440
"For chocolate decorations,
using the acetate rectangles,

569
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,480
the long edge of the chocolate cone,

570
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,040
and narrow glass to make chocolate curls."

571
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,440
Oh, tempering chocolate.
I can do that that.

572
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,560
Right. That needs to melt.

573
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,240
This is the bit. This is the magic.
Watch this.

574
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,120
Little prayer to the chocolate god.

575
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,240
Please!

576
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,800
-And I'm not gonna touch it.
-Please make me good.

577
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,600
I don't want the wrath of Paul Hollywood.

578
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,600
Look at that. Boom.

579
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,320
-Well for now, so good so far.
-[Noel smacks lips]

580
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,360
Give me a shout
when you're gonna put that in there

581
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,320
'cause I want to see that.

582
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,360
-[Chigs] Come on.
-[Crystelle] That looks okay, actually.

583
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,640
-[Noel] What the hell?
-[Giuseppe] Look at that.

584
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,560
You were supposed to call me back.
We had a deal, an agreement.

585
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,280
-Sorry. I'm multitasking already.
-You forgot me, didn't you?

586
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,320
-What do you think?
-Yeah, I liked it.

587
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,760
But I'd have liked it more
if you'd have let me watch.

588
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,200
It's had 20 minutes. Yeah.

589
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,080
[Crystelle groans] Oh, man.

590
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,480
The sides have collapsed in.

591
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,440
Quite frankly,
that is not patisserie standard.

592
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,360
[JÃ¼rgen] I think it's looking good.

593
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,600
It needs to be golden,
like a nice shortbread.

594
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,360
Right. Do I stick this in the freezer?
'Cause it needs to chill.

595
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,520
I want to cool this very quickly

596
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,880
so that I can put the fillings
and the decorations on it.

597
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,840
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

598
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,240
"To assemble, spread remaining
confiture over the sablÃ© baseâ¦"

599
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,920
"â¦leaving a one-centimetre pastry border."

600
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,840
[Giuseppe] This looks delicious.

601
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,960
[Chigs] Just a massive
Jammie Dodger, innit?

602
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,360
"Pipe the pistachio crÃ¨me mousseline
over the confiture and chill."

603
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,760
[Chigs] All right, I'm gonna wait
because this has not set yet.

604
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,960
[Giuseppe] Ooh. It's very thick.

605
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,240
[Crystelle] So I'm gonna do
just big fat stars.

606
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
[sighs]

607
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,560
[Giuseppe exclaims] Oh, careful.

608
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,160
Right. I need to chill this again.
How long do we have?

609
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,960
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

610
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,120
I don't think I have time.
I should just start assembling.

611
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,920
Now the question is,
should I go for a pattern?

612
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,440
I think it should be
a fairly random arrangement.

613
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,640
I'll go for a pattern.

614
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,760
My crÃ¨me pat's not setting.

615
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,280
I'll just put it on.
Nothing I can do about it.

616
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,400
[Chigs] Ah, I'm losing all the definition.
It's turning into liquid.

617
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,040
There you go. Now it's time to glaze this.

618
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,760
[Crystelle] Surely that's enough
strawberries for that tiny little tart.

619
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,560
Nah, it's just not set.

620
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,800
Everything's just oozing back out.
This needs to go in the fridge again.

621
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,760
[Giuseppe] Meringues. Let's get gilding.

622
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,720
[JÃ¼rgen] This is gold leaf.

623
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,800
[Chigs] Look, I'm shrinking.
Can you see I'm shrinking?

624
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,720
Oh, this is going from bad to worse.

625
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,720
Bakers, you have one minute left.

626
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,280
[Chigs laughing] It looks a mess.

627
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,280
I can do this. I can do this.

628
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,400
[Chigs] This doesn't
look like French patisserie.

629
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,400
Do I pipe more?
Maybe I'll just do a little.

630
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,400
Bakers, your time is up.

631
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,480
[sighs] That's it.

632
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,680
Oh, my God, I don't even think
my local corner shop would sell this.

633
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,280
Please bring your bakes to the table
and place them behind your photograph.

634
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,000
[Noel] <i>Prue and Paul</i>
<i>are looking for patisserie perfection.</i>

635
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,360
<i>Each sablÃ© breton should have</i>
<i>a thick, crumbly base</i>

636
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,520
<i>topped with raspberry confiture</i>

637
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,480
<i>and beautifully set</i>
<i>pistachio crÃ¨me mousseline,</i>

638
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,800
<i>elegantly decorated with fruit,</i>
<i>gilded meringue kisses</i>

639
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,320
<i>and chocolate curls.</i>

640
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,800
-They all look very different.
-Hmm.

641
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,160
This one looks pretty.

642
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,200
But the base is very, very thin.

643
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,800
-[Prue] Should be much thicker than that.
-Yeah.

644
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,760
[Prue] The baker's tried to make it
like a conventional tart.

645
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,640
-Not flat.
-Yeah.

646
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,000
Where's the rest of the
strawberries and raspberries?

647
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,440
It's a little bit dense on the biscuit,
but it does taste quite nice.

648
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,960
Moving on. From the mousseline upwards,
that looks good.

649
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,520
But that base is very, very thin.

650
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,240
[Prue] That looks a bit overbaked.

651
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,400
[Paul] Let's have a look.
I think it is slightly overbaked.

652
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,800
[Prue] Actually, it tastes quite good.

653
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,880
Everything else is good.
I'm just not happy with that biscuit.

654
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,960
The mousseline on this
is terrible on number three.

655
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,760
And those meringue kisses
are not well piped.

656
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,720
And that mousseline
has not set at all has it?

657
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,040
This is not a proper biscuit base,
it's a bit soft.

658
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,600
-Hmm. It's underbaked.
-Mmm.

659
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,240
[Prue] Not helped by very wet mousseline,
which will make it soggy anyway.

660
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,040
-[Paul] Hmm.
-[Prue] Okay.

661
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,960
This is very pretty.

662
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,440
And it has got small
little Italian kisses.

663
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,320
I'd like to see
more of a dome of the fruit.

664
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,360
And insideâ¦

665
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,800
very thin.

666
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,120
I think the baker's tried to make it
like a conventional flan.

667
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,720
-Flavour's good.
-[Paul] Hmm.

668
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,680
Okay.

669
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,720
[Matt] <i>Prue and Paul will now rank</i>
<i>the sablÃ© breton from worst to best.</i>

670
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,520
All right, in last place is this one.

671
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,440
Chigs, underbaked, mousseline is not set.

672
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,680
But besides that, it's fine.

673
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,040
Cheers.

674
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,600
In third place, we have this one.

675
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,160
Crystelle, the biscuit is a little thin,
but the flavour's nice.

676
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,400
In second, we have this one.

677
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,400
-Whose is this?
-That's me.

678
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,440
Giuseppe, the sablÃ© was far too thin,
but the overall appearance was quite nice.

679
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,360
Which means, JÃ¼rgen, the biscuit base
is a fraction overbaked,

680
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,560
-but otherwise it's a very good sablÃ©.
-[bakers clapping]

681
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,480
-Thank you.
-[Crystelle] Well done.

682
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,280
[JÃ¼rgen chuckling]

683
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,720
That went very well.

684
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,000
What a relief.

685
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,360
I certainly will sleep better tonight.

686
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,320
Second last is not great.

687
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,360
But I just didn't want to come last

688
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,000
because that would have put me
in a really scary position.

689
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,520
[Chigs] The Technical was a disaster.

690
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,280
That's probably my worst bake.

691
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,440
Out of the 26 bakes we've done,
that's my worst one.

692
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,080
Very, very happy.
Second position. Fantastic.

693
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,560
The first day was very positive,

694
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,600
which is a good position
to start the second day.

695
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,760
The Showstopper of patisserie
is very difficult.

696
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,440
Er, I expect a very tense day tomorrow.

697
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,640
[Chigs] I do better
with my back against the wall,

698
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,320
so I'll come out swinging tomorrow.

699
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,360
[Matt] <i>There's just</i>
<i>the Showstopper Challenge left</i>

700
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,080
<i>before Prue and Paul will decide</i>
<i>who will be crowned Star Baker</i>

701
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,400
<i>and who'll miss out</i>
<i>on a place in the final.</i>

702
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,200
[sighs] Okay.

703
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,640
Hello, bakers, welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your Showstopper Challenge.

704
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,440
Yes, the judges would like you to create
a spectacular themed banquet display,

705
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,120
comprising of at least
12 individual entremets desserts,

706
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,120
arranged around a beautifully
crafted edible centrepiece.

707
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,960
You have five hours
for your entremets desserts.

708
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,280
Minus the three and a half hours
that me and Matt come 'round

709
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,040
and witter in your ear
about any old nonsense.

710
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,200
-Yeah, sorry about that.
-[Noel] On your marks.

711
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,240
-Get set.
-Bake!

712
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,360
Getting into my zone.
Feeling confident to pull this off.

713
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,320
I'm ready to fight and do my best
and enjoy it, most importantly.

714
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,240
[Paul] It's Showstopper time,

715
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,360
and we've asked the bakers
to produce a themed entremet display.

716
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,760
Now, this is going to be

717
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,600
one of the most difficult challenges
they've ever done in the tent.

718
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,080
I didn't know
what a flipping entremet was.

719
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,720
[mumbles] entremet.
This is not normal stuff.

720
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,720
[Paul] An entremet is a delicate dessert.

721
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,440
It's layer upon layer
of beautiful textures and flavours.

722
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,040
What I'm looking for more than anything
is finesse.

723
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,679
When you cut into them, they must look
absolutely staggeringly pretty.

724
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,920
We're certainly stepping
outside of the home baking skills here.

725
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,880
It's very complex, gonna be a long day.

726
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,719
The bakers do have five hours,

727
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,639
but this is the semi finals
so we want to see what they can do.

728
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,320
The more skills they can show us
in this banquet display, the better.

729
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,440
Oh! Need to stop doing that to myself.

730
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,960
[Paul] There are a few bakers
fighting for their place in the final.

731
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,800
And I can't call who's gonna go through.

732
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,000
But it's gonna be interesting.

733
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,080
-[Paul] Giuseppe, hello.
-<i>Buongiorno.</i>

734
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:04,199
Tell us all about your entremet display.

735
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,280
So, my display's gonna be inspired

736
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,800
by a city that I've lived in
for about ten years in Tuscany.

737
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,760
That's Pisa.

738
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,480
So, the centrepiece is gonna be
a representation

739
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,720
that requires some imagination
of the Leaning Tower.

740
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,000
[Matt] <i>Giuseppe</i>
<i>will fashion his leaning tower</i>

741
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,880
<i>from puffed rice and marshmallow</i>

742
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,600
{\an8}<i>while his domed entremet will feature</i>
<i>a chocolate custard and cherry insert</i>

743
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,400

744
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,880
-That all sounds very Tuscan.
-It does. Sounds delicious.

745
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,920
-That was the plan.
-And have you practised this?

746
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,040
Er, if I'm honest, start to finish? No.

747
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,520
So if it comes out wonky,
I got a justification.

748
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,440
[all chuckling]

749
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,400
[JÃ¼rgen] Making a raspberry pulp.

750
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,720
This is the basis for my raspberry jelly
as well as the raspberry Bavarian.

751
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,320
[Noel] <i>JÃ¼rgen, too, has been inspired</i>
<i>by his love of architecture.</i>

752
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,240
My bake is the Torii gate in the sea.

753
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,280
It's a Japanese gate.

754
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,240
Typically, they are
at the entrance to Shinto temples.

755
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,880
And when I was young,
I got a children's, er, encyclopaedia.

756
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,720
One picture in there
that particularly fascinated me

757
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,280
was a picture
of this Japanese temple gate.

758
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,240
[Noel] <i>JÃ¼rgen will construct</i>
<i>his Torii gate from gingerbread</i>

759
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,840

<i>than three Bavarian creams,</i>

761

{\an8}<i>white chocolate, raspberry and matcha.</i>

762
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,160
I occasionally love matcha,
but mostly it's too strong for me.

763
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,160
It can be an acquired taste,

764
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,440
but I find when you activate the matcha,

765
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,200
you need to heat it to about
80 degrees in some liquid.

766
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,360
Does that make it milder?

767
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,320
It makes it milder.
It takes the grassy flavour away.

768
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,440
[Paul] Your flavour combinations
are normally very good.

769
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,400
It's a very original idea. Lovely.

770
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,000
-Thank you.
-Sounds amazing, good luck, JÃ¼rgen.

771
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,160
[Matt] <i>At five hours,</i>

772
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,640
<i>this is the longest challenge</i>
<i>the bakers have faced so far.</i>

773
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,600
I've got a lot to do today.

774
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,760
[Crystelle] Entremets are about
multitasking until you almost faint.

775
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,200
[JÃ¼rgen] I'm building
the Bavarian inserts.

776
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,920
The insert is the first thing
that I have to start making,

777
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,960
'cause that needs to freeze

778
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,880
before I can start
working on anything else around it.

779
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,000
-Next.
-Pine nut bavarois.

780
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,440
[Matt] <i>Not only</i>
<i>must every flavour pack a punchâ¦</i>

781
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,680
[Giuseppe] Roasting them
releases a lot of flavour.

782
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,240
This little bunch of pine nuts
is flavouring 12 entremets.

783
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,080
<i>â¦they must also work together</i>
<i>in perfect harmony.</i>

784
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,600
[JÃ¼rgen] This is matcha powder.

785
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,760
I need to make the matcha Bavarian.

786
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,720
Matcha flavour shouldn't be overly strong,

787
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,240
but it should balance
the tartness of the raspberries.

788
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,920
[Matt] <i>But that's not all.</i>

789
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,360
I've added four sheets of gelatin.

790
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,160
[Matt] <i>When it comes to textures,</i>
<i>patisserie demands perfection.</i>

791
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,080
[Giuseppe] The texture of Bavarois
is very difficult to get right

792
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,960
because it needs to be very soft.

793
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,480
But it's very easy
to overdo the gelatin element

794
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,680
and get it too thick and rubbery.

795
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,840
Okay.

796
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,160
[Matt] <i>And, with a place</i>
<i>in the final at stakeâ¦</i>

797
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,080
I am doing vanilla and coconut
cremeux centres.

798
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,480
<i>â¦Crystelle's taking no chances.</i>

799
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,000
When in practice I did them, they set,
but I was worried they set a bit too much.

800
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,640
I'm going to do
two almost-identical batches,

801
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,560
but one has just got
one less sheet of gelatin.

802
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,360
[Matt] <i>Crystelle's vanilla</i>
<i>and coconut cremeux centres</i>

807
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,760
-What are you making?
-This is a Swiss meringue.

808
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,280
I'm doing a little meringue flower arch.

809
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,360
-Real arch, can you get under it?
-Er, yeah.

810
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,120
-Can you limbo under it?
-If you limbo really far down.

811
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,160
You look like you're dressed to limbo.

812
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,240
Yeah, I actually once
won a limbo competition on holiday.

813
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,360
-I'm deadly serious. Of course I did.
-Of course you did.

814
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,160
I feel like I might have
limboed at a party

815
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,960
-and was quite good at it.
-Really?

816
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,560
We should do a limbo-off.

817
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,480
[chuckling] If you get-- If you get
to the final, we'll do a limbo-off.

818
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,440
Oh, well, that's not gonna happen.
I mean, yeah, yeah.

819
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,400
Deal.

820
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,480
-[Paul] Hi, Chigs.
-Hey, Paul. Hi.

My Showstopper is called, "The Apple
Doesn't Fall Far from the Tree."

824
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,800
It's based around an apple tree
my grandparents had in their garden.

825
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,080
We used to play around it as kids.

826
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,680
So my centrepiece
is going to be in the shape of a tree.

827
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,440
[Matt] <i>Nestled under</i>

{\an8}<i>caramel and white chocolate mousse,</i>

830
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,840
{\an8}<i>and coated in a dark chocolate shell</i>
<i>and shiny red mirror glaze.</i>

831
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,280
This has never worked for me in practice.

832
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,160
Don't say that in front of the judges.

833
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,960
Why would you do it then?

834
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,200
It hasn't worked because when I set
the chocolate around it,

835
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,480
I put a stick in it to dip it.

836
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,640
When I take
the stick out, it always cracks.

837
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,160
So, today, I've never tried it,
I'm gonna use toothpicks instead.

838
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,440
-Good luck, Chigs.

You have to!

842
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,240
I have practised it,
it's just something's always gone wrong.

843
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,240
Today is the day
I need to pull it out the bag.

844
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,000
Bakers, you are halfway through.

845
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,320
I feel like
my legs are getting longer, no?

846
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
No.

847
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
[Chigs] All the elements are done now.

848
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,720
I've gotta get
the entremets in the freezer,

849
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,560
setting for as long as they can

850
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,200
so they hold their shape
when I take them out of the moulds.

851
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,160
The Joconde sponge is ready.

852
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,760
[sighs] That was close.

853
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,000
Mango bavarois is here.
I'm gonna fill these.

854
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,960
Then put my cremeux inserts inside.

855
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,800
I put the apple pie insert in
and I'm topping up with some more mouse.

856
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,560
The cherry's a perfect colour for this.
It gives it a nice burst of flavour.

857
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,720
Just in the centre and it's very chewy.

858
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,200
The whole thing is very soft
so you need something with more bite.

859
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,800
[Crystelle] These seem
a little bit wobbly, but--

860
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,200
Oh! [gasps] They're set.

861
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,840
[JÃ¼rgen] This is genoise sponge.

862
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,520
I need to set the jelly
on top of this this sponge

863
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,680
before I can get the entremets built.

864
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,000
[Crystelle gasps] Freeze baby, freeze.

865
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,680
[JÃ¼rgen] Jelly's in.

866
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,040
-Right. Done.
-Biscuit.

Preparing the dough for my centrepiece.

868
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,520
It's gingerbread.
It is wonderful dough to work with.

869
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,320
[Chigs] This is a simple cinnamon biscuit.

870
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,440
I'm gonna bake it for a bit longer
so it's crispier and snappier as well.

871
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,880
I don't want it
to be like gingerbread, where it's soft.

I'm very slightly behind.

891
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,200
I need to get the entremets frozen,

892
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,960
otherwise they just stick
to the mould and crumble.

893
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,080
-What're you doing?
-Hello. I am smoothing down a candle.

894
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,520
So, how's your bake going?
Have these been baked yet?

895
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,440
They have been baked.

896
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:13,320
They're little doves which are going
to go on top of my entremets.

897
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,200
I'm just putting the candle in the hole.

898
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,640
-Ermâ¦
-So it's gone in the hole.

899
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,600
â¦and I'm just going to,
erm, smooth it down.

900
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,800
Oh, my Lord, I don't think
I can take much more of this.

901
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,680
Bakers, you have an hour left.

902
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,040
[Chigs] That's a good colour.
That's a great colour,

903
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,800
[JÃ¼rgen] Possibly a little bit overdone,
but better overdone in this one.

904
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,640
Nice and stable. That's the last lot.

905
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,760
Now I'm smoothing out the two logs.

906
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,080
This will be the main tower,
and that smaller one will be the top.

907
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,360
[Crystelle] This is Swiss meringue.

908
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,840
You put two different colours
in one piping bag

909
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,360
and out pops a little swirled beauty.

910
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,600
How are you, JÃ¼rgs? Nice colour.

911
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,360
-Wonderful, isn't it?
-[Noel] That is an intense red.

912
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,680
That's like hell.

913
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,960
Well, it's a gateway to something else.

914
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,320
-Gatewayâ¦
-[both] â¦to the final.

915
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,320
Is that what you're doing? Clever boy.

916
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,760
Might be. I don't want to put
the letters on the wall, so to speak.

917
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,880
I feel like you're building
your own metaphor.

918
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,880
[JÃ¼rgen] Indeed.

919
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,840
[Crystelle] If I overbake this,
this whole thing can crack.

920
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,960
So it's a very tricky thing
that I've decided to do for my structure.

921
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,560
[Chigs] We'll see how it fits.

922
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,200
Yeah, baby.

923
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,880
[screams] I hit it!

924
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,320
Don't worry, it's okay.
Just stick it together with icing.

925
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,320
I need to make sure the entremets set.
Need to take them out of the moulds.

926
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,040
They're completely frozen.
They're very well set, which is good.

927
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,680
They feel really soft,
and I don't know why,

928
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,800
but I'm just gonna have to go with it.
Oh, God.

929
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,520
Just stay calm Crystelle, stay calm.

930
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,800
[JÃ¼rgen] Okay.

931
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,760
Houston, we've got sails.

932
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,920
Assembly time, definitely.

933
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,120
This is isomalt.

934
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,800
I'm using it to stick
my Torii gate together.

935
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,920
[Crystelle] Doing a very abstract swirl.
Okay, I have to glaze my entremets.

936
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,440
[exhales] Breathe, woman. Okay.

937
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,880
Noel told me he thinks
you look like Robert De Niro.

938
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,480
-Can you do the impression?
-Which one?

939
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,280
[mimicking Robert De Niro]
You talking to me?

940
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,640
-Are you talking to me?
-Is that from <i>Taxi Driver?</i>

941
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,800
Yeah, that's <i>Taxi Driver.</i>

942
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,200
-Can you do that?
-I can't do the face.

943
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,720
-No.
-I can certainly do the--

944
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,120
-Yeah.
-Is it stuck?

945
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,720
Oh.

946
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,280
-Yeah. I'll go and getâ¦
-[Chigs] Get it sorted out.

947
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,120
-Cheers. Thank you.
-Good luck with your bake.

948
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,360
[Giuseppe] The thickness of the glaze
is just right to cover everything.

949
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,200
Now I'm gonna dunk.

950
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,720
It still ain't perfect,
but it's the best I've ever had it.

951
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,400
[JÃ¼rgen] Engineering begins.

952
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,560
[Giuseppe] Going over it more than once.

953
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,600
I'm ruining this, jeez.

954
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,120
This is not going well.

955
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,400
-JÃ¼rgen. You all good?
-[sighs]

956
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,640
One piece is missing.

957
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,880
I'm sure I cut it out.

958
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,400
[breathing heavily]
Without this piece, it won't go up.

959
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,200
How much time?

960
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,840
Bakers, you have
half of an entire hour left.

961
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,280
[JÃ¼rgen] Oh,
this is going to be super tight.

962
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,720
This is just madness.

963
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,880
Just suddenly realised I have a lot to do
and really not a lot of time.

964
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,720
-[JÃ¼rgen] Yes. I'm happy with those.
-I've gotta quickly make some apple stems.

965
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,840
[Crystelle] So I'm doing pine cones,
roses, leaves, made out of butter cream.

966
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,320
They're coming out.

967
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,480
[Noel] That is the missing bit
slotting right in now. Yeah?

968
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,440
-Yeah.
-Yes! JÃ¼rgen.

969
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,560
[Chigs] It's not red enough,
it's gonna be a Pink Lady.

970
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,280
[Crystelle] Breathe, breathe, breathe.

971
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,400
[Crystelle gasps] Oh, for God's sake, no.

972
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,120
[Chigs sighs in frustration]

973
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,160
[Crystelle]
This is gonna be so tight. [sighs]

974
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,600
[Giuseppe] Never underestimate
an Italian engineer.

975
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,680
When it comes to make wonky buildings,
we're always first in the game.

976
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,600
[gasps]

977
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,400
Oohâ¦

978
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,560
[JÃ¼rgen] Going in for the glaze.

979
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,480
[Crystelle] Please don't crack.

980
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,840
[JÃ¼rgen] Oh, come on.

981
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,280
[Crystelle] I don't think
that's gonna stay.

982
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,960
It's gonna have to stay.

983
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,720
[sighs] Oh, God, please don't fall,
please don't fall.

984
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,480
Bakers, you have one minute left.

985
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,720
[sing-song] This is getting tight.

986
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,800
[Crystelle] Come on.

987
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,040
[Chigs] Ah, it's breaking.

988
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,640
Weddings are goddamn stressful.
Maybe it's a sign I shouldn't get married.

989
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,400
[sighs] I'm proper shaking.

990
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,720
Bakers, your time is up.

991
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,160
Please step away from your bakes.

992
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,480
[JÃ¼rgen sighs]

993
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,800
[winces]

994
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,800
-Well done.
-[Noel] Well done, kids.

995
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,640
-[sighs]
-That was a monster challenge.

996
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,880
[Matt] That was epic.

997
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,040
Look at JÃ¼rgen's, it's unbelievable.

998
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,400
[Giuseppe] Does it surprise you?

999
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,400
That was the most intense thing.

1000
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,400
[JÃ¼rgen] I just want to say
well done to you all.

1001
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,480
Yeah, guys, well done.
Do you know what? I'm proud of us.

1002
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,200
[all chuckling]

1003
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,400
[Crystelle] Yeah.

1004
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,000
[Matt] <i>It's judgement time for the bakers'</i>
<i>showstopping entremets displays.</i>

1005
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,080
JÃ¼rgen, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

1006
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,680
Love the gate. It's very authentic.

1007
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,320
The colour of the entremets
don't really draw you in.

1008
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,960
It's a bit bland.

1009
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,040
[Prue] This shape is perfect
for those little Japanese boats,

1010
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,600
but if you'd had time, you could have
piped some detail on them

1011
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,160
or something to have
made them stand out a bit more.

1012
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,200
Hmm.

1013
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,400
That's very interesting.

1014
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,240
Different layers of taste,
one after another.

1015
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,160
[Paul] Your raspberry jelly's
got a nice kick to it.

1016
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,040
And that matcha
is hidden by the raspberry.

1017
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,080
There's still a hint,
but the raspberry comes through.

1018
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,160
You didn't want it the other way,
it would've been dry on the palate.

1019
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,560
-Thank you.
-Well done.

1020
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,760
Well done, JÃ¼rgen.

1021
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,680
Well done, JÃ¼rgen.

1022
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,400
[JÃ¼rgen] Thank you.

1023
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,160
Giuseppe, you said
you hadn't even practised this.

1024
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,960
It's just amazing. It's leaning
more than the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

1025
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,840
I think I made the leaning tower
wonkier than it is.

1026
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,720
These look fairly straightforward
on the outside.

1027
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,800
All the work, of course,
with an entremet, is on the inside.

1028
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,360
-Yeah.
-[Paul] Oh, lovely.

1029
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,600
-[Noel] Beautiful green.
-[Matt] Hmm.

1030
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,000
[Prue] The bavarois is very delicious,

1031
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,520
but the pine nut's
not coming through very well.

1032
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,880
Oh, okay.

1033
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,800
Without that cherry,
you really would be hunting for flavours.

1034
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,000
Having said that,
all your textures are spot-on.

1035
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:40,920
Thank you.

1036
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,520
[Matt] Well done.

1037
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,360
[Chigs] Well done, Giuseppe.

1038
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,520
-It's very impressive.
-Thank you.

1039
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,360
I'm knocked back by the purple colour.
They look more like a plums.

1040
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,040
I should've put
more red colouring in the glaze.

1041
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,240
-Pink ladies, that's what they are.
-Yeah, right.

1042
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,280
I love that they're sitting on a biscuit.

1043
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,360
And the biscuit looks well baked as well.

1044
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,720
Hmm.

1045
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,080
-It's exceptional.
-[chuckles nervously]

1046
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,600
Your apple
has got a little tartness to it.

1047
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,520
You can taste the caramel
in the bavarois as well.

1048
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,960
And you have that slight
bitterness from the chocolate.

1049
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,840
So you've got all the flavours
correctly balanced

1050
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,720
to create an apple scene with the tree.

1051
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,200
You've really been
on a journey, haven't you?

1052
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,880
You started baking last year.

1053
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,840
Look what you've done.
That is very, very, very good.

1054
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,760
-[Chigs] Thank you, Paul.
-[Prue] Thanks, Chigs.

1055
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,560
-Well done.
-Thank you very much.

1056
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,880
[Noel] Well done, Chigs.

1057
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,400
[Chigs exhales]

1058
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,400
[Giuseppe, whispering]
Come on, you smashed it.

1059
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,200
-That's stunning.
-[Prue] Love the colours.

1060
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,520
If it was in the middle
of a wedding table,

1061
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,440
all eyes would be upon it.

1062
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,800
[Paul] What I'm interested in
is those entremets,

1063
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,600
they look like works of arts.

1064
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,240
[Prue] Mmm.

1065
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,480
That, Crystelle, is flawless.

1066
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,440
-[Paul] I don't know what I can say.
-It's just beautiful.

1067
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,960
The passion fruit is really strong.
The mango much silkier. It is lovely.

1068
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,120
-Absolutely lovely.
-Thank you. Sorry.

1069
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,480
[Prue laughing]

1070
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,200
-Thank you, Crystelle.
-Thank you so much.

1071
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,400
[Matt] Well done.

1072
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,240
Thank you so much.

1073
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,560
[Crystelle] It's really emotional

1074
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,240
because it always means more
to, erm, get good comments

1075
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,080
on a bake that means a lot to you,
that's dedicated to someone. Erm,

1076
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,360
[voice breaking]
so I'm just really proud of myself.

1077
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,760
[sighs] I'm speechless at the moment

1078
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,280
and a little taken aback
by the comments they've given me.

1079
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,160
If I was to go out now,
I could walk out smiling.

1080
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,440
I don't know how they're going to call it.

1081
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,040
Yesterday, there were three handshakes
and I won the Technical.

1082
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,000
And, today, all these
very positive comments.

1083
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,960
There were four Star Bakers in there.

1084
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,000
Simple as that.

1085
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,840
[Giuseppe] We've become friends
over almost two months.

1086
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,320
We are very proud of each other.

1087
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,840
As a collective, we've done very well.

1088
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,880
I don't know what's gonna happen.
It's a very, very close call.

1089
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,720
[Matt] Wow. There are four really
impressive bakers in this tent.

1090
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,120
I do not envy you the task
of having to separate them.

1091
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,720
What's almost unique,
we're picking the worst of the best.

1092
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,480
It really is difficult
because all of them tasted fantastic.

1093
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,960
Crystelle.

1094
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,920
Look at the layers in that.
The coconut biscuit.

1095
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,320
-[Paul] The glaze is stunning.
-[Prue] Yes.

1096
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,040
And Chigs, look
at the amount of skill in that.

1097
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,760
There's a biscuit, a crumble.

1098
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,920
There's a wonderful chocolate case,
which is not easy to do.

1099
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,600
[Paul] JÃ¼rgen was clever
with the matcha and the raspberry.

1100
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:26,040
-A bit boring to look at.
-And then you come down to Giuseppe.

1101
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,320
My only complaint with this.

1102
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,040
-I love the beautiful colour.
-So neat.

1103
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,120
[Prue] And the cherry is fantastic.

1104
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,520
My only complaint?
I couldn't taste the pine nut.

1105
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,320
[Matt] So we're
in a very unusual position, where--

1106
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,000
You could argue for any one of these.

1107
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,680
This is the worst time to go home as well,
so it's horrible.

1108
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,760
Yes, it is. It's really hard.

1109
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,360
I don't know
how you're gonna make this decision.

1110
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,760
[Noel] Ah, bakers,

1111
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,400
this is such a precarious point
in the competition.

1112
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,720
Obviously,
everyone wants to get to the final

1113
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,600
and it's so close at this point,
it's just crazy.

1114
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,840
I've got the amazing job
of announcing Star Baker.

1115
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,760
The person who is Star Baker isâ¦

1116
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,240
Crystelle.

1117
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,680
[Crystelle gasps]

1118
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,800
-Oh, my God.
-[Chigs] Why are you surprised?

1119
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,480
Why are you so surprised?

1120
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,280
-Oh, my God.
-[Chigs] You just smashed it.

1121
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,360
[Matt] Okay.

1122
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,840
I'm afraid to say

1123
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,520
that the person who will not
be making it into the final,

1124
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,280
and who will be going home isâ¦

1125
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,880
JÃ¼rgen.

1126
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,440
No.

1127
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,080
[Crystelle] What?

1128
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,360
[Giuseppe] What?

1129
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,600
[Paul] Sorry, mate.

1130
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,600
[JÃ¼rgen] I feel kind of okay,

1131
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,120
Iâ¦ I kind of saw it coming.

1132
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,400
[laughs]

1133
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,240
I think the others
are more shocked than I am.

1134
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,560
[Crystelle] Oh, my gosh.

1135
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,840
JÃ¼rgen, you've been
an inspiration, really.

1136
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,200
-Like one of the mostâ¦
-Oh, JÃ¼rgen.

1137
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,080
â¦incredible bakers ever.

1138
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,600
You were amazing.

1139
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,400
[voice breaking] It's been incredible.

1140
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,720
It's been an absolute pleasure
to have you with us here.

1141
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,880
Really enjoyed being here.
I made friends for life.

1142
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,400
And I will be with themâ¦

1143
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,960
[chuckles] inâ¦ In spirit.

1144
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,680
-See you in the final.
-[Crystelle] Thank you so much, Paul.

1145
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,760
Ermâ¦

1146
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,080
shell-shocked is an understatement.

1147
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,360
Hi, Star Baker.

1148
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,120
It's just, I don't think
it's really hit me, really. It's mad.

1149
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,120
Star Baker in Patisserie Week.
I'm in the final.

1150
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,360
[voice breaking] Just a lot of things
that don't make sense.

1151
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,920
[Noel, whispering]
You're in the final. [laugh]

1152
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,040
I ain't got a clue what I'm doing here.
How has that happened?

1153
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,400
I'm so shocked. I don't know what to say.

1154
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,920
I am now cacking it. [laughs nervously]

1155
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,080
I am scared sockless.

1156
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,440
But I'm really, really--

1157
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,080
Happy's not the right word,
I'm over the moon.

1158
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:21,320
I just want to make the best out of it
and have a jolly good time next week.

1159
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,440
Hi, is everyone there?

1160
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,800
-[woman] <i>Yeah.</i>
-Erm, not good news.

1161
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,840
You're not gonna see me for
another week because I got Star Baker!

1162
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,600
-[laughs]
-[woman screaming]

1163
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,200
[screaming continues]

1164
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,120
[sniffling] I know, guys,
I'm in the final. [laughs]

1165
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,840
[closing theme music playing]
