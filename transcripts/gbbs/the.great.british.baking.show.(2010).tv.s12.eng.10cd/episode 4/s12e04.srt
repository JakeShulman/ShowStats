00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,720
Hello, comedian and artist Noel Fielding.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,680
Are you excited for Dessert Week?

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,680
Not especially.
I've never even had a dessert before.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,040
Eh? How come?

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,840
I can't eat. Tragically,
I was born without a mouth.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,160
-Really?
-Yeah. It's very sad.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,040
Well, what are you talking out of now?

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,120
This is my butt.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,360
Well, that explains a lot.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,280
[both] Welcome to
<i>The Great British Baking Show.</i>

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,080
[mimics passing wind] Sorry.

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,800
-[Matt] Ugh.
-Matthew.

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,080
Don't be like that. Matthew!

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,920
[Matt] No, you've let us both down.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,640
-You wrote this.
-[Matt] Yeah, well, you said it.

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,920
-[Noel] <i>Nowâ¦</i>
<i>-</i>[both exclaim]

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,200
<i>â¦the bakers indulge in Dessert Weekâ¦</i>

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,720
[both] Mmm!

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,040
<i>â¦with a cracking Signatureâ¦</i>

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,440
Come on, man. Don't do this to me.

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,640
<i>â¦and tricky toffee Technical.</i>

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,800
Mash it up!

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,960
[Noel] <i>But they must save room for</i>
<i>a spectacular, multilayered Showstopperâ¦</i>

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,920
Everybody's terrified
about collapsing cakes.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,560
<i>â¦which will leave the bakersâ¦</i>

26
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,920
[Maggie] This is gonna go splodge.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,920
<i>â¦ready to burst.</i>

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,200
Whoopsie-daisies.

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,520
[opening theme playing]

30
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,080
[Amanda] It's Dessert Week!

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,280
So excited.

32
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,600
Who wouldn't be?

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,720
[Chigs] First thing I look at
in a restaurant is the dessert menu.

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
I got proper sweetâ¦

35
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,520
I've got sweet <i>teeth,</i>
not a sweet tooth. [chuckles]

36
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,640
I am really nervous of a vegan
substitute for this week.

37
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,760
Definitely not as easy to use.

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,920
People were like,
"Why don't you just bail out?"

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,520
I was like,
"No, stick by your morals." [chuckles]

40
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,640
My friends will probably say,
"What does Maggie know about desserts?"

41
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,800
"She never eats them."

42
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,200
The truth of that
will be in the eating later on.

43
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,280
Good morning, bakers, and welcome back
to the tent for Dessert Week.

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,080
For your Signature challenge,
the judges would love you

45
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,440
to make a beautifully decorated pavlova.

46
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,440
[Matt] Your pavlova
can be any flavour you like,

47
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,440
but it should be perfectly baked
with a crisp outer shell

48
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,640
and have a soft, pillowy centre.

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,320
[both] Mmm!

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,680
You have two hours and 45 minutes.

51
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,320
-On your marks.
-Get set.

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,560
Bake!

53
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,680
[Lizzie] I don't really eat pavlovas.

54
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,440
Sticky toffee pudding I'm about.

55
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,240
You've got to feel
like you've ate something.

56
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,720
Egg whites, innit, and sugar? [laughs]

57
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
What can go wrong?

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,040
[Paul] What we're looking for
in a pavlova is a crispy exterior

59
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,760
and a little chewy
marshmallow texture inside,

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,400
filled with whatever they wish.

61
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,720
To get the texture right,
you need to bake it for an hour,

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,560
turn the oven off and leave it cooling
for as long as possible.

63
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,120
The hard part of this is getting
the bake right in the meringue.

64
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,440
They could crack, they could bead, melt,

65
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,040
allow water to come out
or, indeed, collapse.

66
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,360
The middle is always the most difficult.

67
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,880
The bottom needs to be firm enough
to support the fillings

68
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,480
without becoming squishy.

69
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,040
It's a pretty tricky challenge.

70
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,600
There's 101 different reasons
why meringues will fail.

71
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,680
And to do it in two hours 45
makes it even harder.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,520
-Hi, Giuseppe.
-[Giuseppe] Good morning.

73
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,200
Tell us about your pavlova.

74
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,120
It's called "Every Day at the Beach,"
inspired by one of my childhood memories.

75
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,760
So it's going to be peaches and coconut.

76
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,320
Peaches, what my mum used to bring

77
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,040
and coconut is what this guy
used to sell and still does nowadays

78
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,360
shouting, <i>"coco bello"</i>
around the beach every day.

79
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,400
-So delicious.
-I liked everything you said. [chuckles]

80
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,840
[Matt] <i>To bring those hazy days</i>
<i>on the beach to life,</i>

<i>peach crÃ©meux and coulis</i>
<i>encased in a piped French meringue.</i>

83
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,480
It's a basic meringue.

84
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,760
I had problems in the past. I was baking
it at too high temperature and it cracked.

85
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,920
So I'm going at 120 degrees
for 75 minutes first

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,640
and then at least half an hour
with the oven off.

87
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,000
-[Paul] Good luck. Thank you.
-Thank you.

88
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,560
-Cheers.
-Have a good one.

<i>peachy times with Mama,</i>

91
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:40,000
[Crystelle] My godmother Pamela,

92
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,360
we call her "Pamlova"
because she is amazing at pavlovas

93
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,480
and brings one to every family event.

94
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,800
But she didn't give me
the recipe. [laughs]

95
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,600
I'm still doing this in honour of her
even though I do slightly resent her.

96
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,720
[laughs]

97

{\an8}[Noel] <i>Pamela's secret might be safe,</i>
<i>but Crystelle has a plan</i>

98

{\an8}<i>involving coconut crumble,</i>
<i>lime curd and kiwi slices</i>

{\an8}<i>and a favourite of a certain</i>
<i>steely-eyed judge.</i>

101
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,440
Paul Hollywood loves key lime pie.

102
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,280
-Now I'm so panicked.
-[Matt] Why?

103
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,960
He's going to eat it and be like,
"This isn't a key lime pie."

104
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,680
I just find key lime,

105
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,880
the key is always a bit metallic.

106
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,760
-I'm a walking dad joke.
-[laughs]

107
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,960
[George] This is just a basic meringue.

108
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,240
So, it's just about whipping
the eggs and sugar together.

109
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,800
[Noel] <i>Producing stable,</i>
<i>perfectly pillowy meringue</i>

110
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,440
<i>is a delicate, time-consuming process.</i>

111
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,080
I'm adding in caster sugar
just one tablespoon at a time.

112
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,480
If you add lots, you then deflate
all the air you're trying to build up.

[Matt] <i>While some are enhancing</i>

<i>â¦Maggie's going back to basics.</i>

118
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,440
[Maggie] I'm making
quite a simple meringue.

119
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,880
There's nothing fancy at all.

120
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,800
But the problem with doing it like that
is the meringue has to be really good.

121

[Matt] <i>Her classic meringue,</i>

-So, pretty classic. Yeah.
-Very classic. Yes.

125

126

127
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,320
-[Paul] Well, good luck.
-[laughs]

128
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,200
Well, that was fun, wasn't it?

[both laugh]

130
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,880
Just making sure
the sugar's all dissolved.

131
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,080
It's ready. It's very stiff
and it's very glossy.

[Amanda] I'm gonna start shaping it.

133

My pavlova's called "Pav-love"

134
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,720
because I have a lovely,
heart-shaped chopping board.

135
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,000
It looks nice on there.

136

[Amanda] It's looking
quite stiff, isn't it?

141
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,320
And hopefully it will keep its shape.

142
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,280
Otherwise, it won't be a heart,
it will just be a splodge.

00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,760
[Freya] She's getting there.

154
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,120
<i>â¦it's even more of a challenge.</i>

155
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,880
This is using aquafaba
instead of the egg whites.

156
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,360
It's a bit less stable.

157
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,920
It doesn't hold at all.

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,440
That's going to be good
for this competition.

159
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,920
Yeah, that's going to be great,
in this heat as well, yeah.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,880
-This is a solid start.
-Yikes.

161
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,560
[Matt] <i>While Freya's hoping</i>
<i>her meringue stands up,</i>

162
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,440
{\an8}<i>she's adding orange blossom to make</i>
<i>her peach Melba flavours stand out.</i>

163
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,920
[Freya] I'm gonna caramelise these peaches

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,200
and they go all, like, toasted and golden.

165
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,960
So, at least if the pavlova collapses,
at least we'll have some nice peaches.

166
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,040
Piping skills are ridiculous.

167
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,800
-Ah, thank you.
-[Prue] You really know what you're doing.

168
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,880
-Thank you, Freya. Good luck.
-[Freya] Thank you so much.

169
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,760
She's going in.

170
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,160
[Matt] <i>When it comes to pavlovaâ¦</i>

171
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,400
Going in.

172
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,080
<i>â¦oven time is literally make-or-break.</i>

173
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,840
The secret to this
is to go slow and steady

174
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,600
at a much lower temperature
and a much longer bake.

175
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,720
[Matt] <i>Underbake and the inside will</i>
<i>end up sloppy or, worse still, collapse.</i>

176
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,040
Be good to me.

177
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,800
[Matt] <i>Overbake and the outside</i>
<i>could crack or break off completely.</i>

178
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,480
[Amanda] Right, I'm going to bake it
on 140 for 25 minutes,

179
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,160
and then I'm going to turn it down to 120,
leave it for about another 35 minutes.

180
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,080
[sighs]

181
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,480
Good luck, pav.

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,120
Dear sir, I'll wager a shepherd's guinea
that the good gentlemen of this tent

183
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,640
are halfway through
completion of the challenge.

184
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,360
What about the ladies?

185
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,520
Ladies must never appear in the kitchen

186
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,040
for fear of coarsening
their delicate fingers.

187
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,080
Exactly.

188
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,840
I'll just start on the fillings now.

189
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,800
[Noel] <i>The bakers must now perfect</i>
<i>fillings that elevate sugary meringuesâ¦</i>

190
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,160
[Crystelle] There are
15 nutritious pavlova.

191
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:58,480
<i>â¦to beautifully balanced pavlovas.</i>

192
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,920
[Chigs] Uglier they look, riper they are,
my gran used to tell me.

193
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,400
It needs to be a nice contrast
to the sweet meringue.

194
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,720
It should be a party on your tongue.

195
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,920
[Matt] <i>Guests at Chigs' tongue party</i>

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,560
<i>include a Chantilly cream,</i>
<i>chocolate shards,</i>

197
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,560
<i>fresh mango, passion fruit,</i>
<i>and a blast of tropical mango coulis.</i>

198
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,520
-[Noel] How's it going?
-[Chigs] Another day in the office.

199
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,280
-And you're enjoying it?
-Yeah. Loving it.

200
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,160
-You're just getting better and better.
-I think I'm just starting. Starting.

201
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,000
I know. You're like Luke Skywalker.

202
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,200
-Yeah.
-And I feel like Paul's Obi-Wan.

203
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,240
-[Chigs chuckles]
-He knows the Force is strong in you.

204
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,400
Does that make you Yoda?

205
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,320
-I'm Yoda, yeah. Thanks.
-[laughs]

206
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,520
-I'm probably Chewbacca.
-[both laugh]

207
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,120
Bakers, you have one hour left!

208
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,040
Sorry about that.

209
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,480
Two tiny cracks,
which I am not fussed about.

210
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,360
As long as they're not Grand Canyons,
you'll be all right.

211
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,200
[Giuseppe] I'm turning the oven off
and let it go for another half an hour.

212
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,920
I'll leave the pavlova in there
to cool down.

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,400
[Matt] <i>Take their meringues out</i>
<i>before they're coldâ¦</i>

214
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,400
So, I think I'm just gonna
pop this open now.

215
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,760
<i>â¦and all their hard work</i>
<i>could be for nothing.</i>

216
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,320
[Crystelle] If this warm pavlova
hits cold air,

217
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,000
the inside basically shrinks,
and then your meringue cracks.

218
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,720
So, this, in theory, should
gradually bring down the temperature

219
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,960
so you don't get that shock.

220
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,920
[Noel] <i>But with just one oven</i>
<i>and two bakes to completeâ¦</i>

221
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,200
[George] I need that oven
to bake biscuits.

222
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,000
<i>â¦it's a risk George is willing to take.</i>

223
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,760
I'm gonna transfer my meringue
over to my proving drawer

224
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,680
without dropping it. [exhales]

225
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,320
Hope it's worth it.
All right, these are going in, 12 minutes.

226
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,960
[Noel] <i>As well as spiced</i>
<i>speculoos biscuits</i>

<i>he's also incorporating</i>
<i>a potent citrus flavour.</i>

229
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,080
I'm just starting my lemon curd now.

230
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,400
I love raw lemon, lemon on everything,
like lemon overload.

231
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,560
I'm going for it.

232
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,760
[Noel] <i>Like George, JÃ¼rgen's recipe</i>
<i>also requires some extra baking.</i>

233
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,720
[JÃ¼rgen] For decoration,
I'm using matza, unleavened bread.

234
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,240
My wife is Jewish,

235
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,840
and we started to celebrate
the Jewish festivals along the year.

236
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,360
So, I'm making a pavlova
inspired by the flavours of Passover.

237
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,640
{\an8}[Noel] <i>As well as matza shards</i>
<i>coated in chocolate,</i>

238
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,640
{\an8}<i>JÃ¼rgen's pavlova will feature vanilla</i>
<i>cream and a symbolic charoset paste.</i>

239
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,240
[Prue] So, what's in there?

240
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,720
It's dates, it's a whole orange
with pith and peel,

241
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,600
a bit of cinnamon, bit of cardamom.

242
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,200
Dates are gonna be interesting in this.

243
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,720
Dates are so sweet
and meringue is very sweet.

244
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,160
It's the mortar used by the juice

245
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,160
to stick the pyramids
and the Pharaoh's cities together.

246
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,120
It's carrying a lot, this little pavlova.

247
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,880
-It is. It is.
-[Paul chuckles]

248
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,280
-You're an artist, JÃ¼rgen.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Thank you.

249
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,240
[Matt] <i>A religious holiday</i>
<i>has also inspired Lizzie's pavlova.</i>

250
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,480
-[Lizzie] It's an Easter pavlova.
-[Matt] What are the ingredients?

251
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,960
So, when you think Easter,
you think of baby lambs.

252
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,000
You put rosemary on lambs.

253
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,000
So, yeah, that's how I came up with it.

254
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,480
-So, will it taste of lamb?
-That's a bit too far, isn't it?

255
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,600
[Matt] <i>With a purple blueberry meringue,</i>

256

<i>doesn't pull any punches.</i>

258
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,680
As long as the rosemary
isn't too powerful.

259
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,480
Yeah, it is quite subtle.

260
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,040
[Noel] I love the way you say "subtle"

261
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,760

and your hair today.

262

-[Noel and Prue laugh]
-I'm so under the radar.

263
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,000
It's unbelievable.

264
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,120
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

265
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,800
[Crystelle] I think I might take it out.

266
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,520
There's a bit of crackage,
a bit of weeping.

267
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,920
That's the side to look at.
Ignore that side.

268
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,920
[gasps] Maggie's got hers out.

269

-Don't follow the pressure.

[hyperventilating]

271
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,480
Here we are. It's cracked around the top,
but I expected that.

272

[Chigs] That's nice and high.

273

'cause it's gonna crack a little bit.

283

Gonna have to be very careful.

284

Very slow and delicate.

[Crystelle] I'm trying to find a bit
that doesn't look fragile.

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,680
Bakers, you have ten minutes left!

300
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,920
If you're lucky.

301
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,520
Right, I need to get a move on.
I really need to get a move on.

302
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,560
[JÃ¼rgen] I'm going to cook
the matza for five minutes.

303
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,440
[Amanda] I've gotta get it decorated.

304
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,480
[Maggie] I made
some little meringue kisses.

305
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,520
It's not meant to be a candle. [laughs]

306
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,880
I'm putting charoset on.

307
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,520
[George] These are spice biscuits.

308
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,040
I'll blitz them up, whip up some cream,

309
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,840
fold it in and then pipe.

310
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,480
[Amanda] This is my chocolate mascarpone.

311
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,480
Raspberry coulis.

312
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,840
Hopefully it don't make it all mushy.

313
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,240
[George] I think Paul and Prue might have
something to say about this presentation.

314
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,920
Always going on about presentation,
aren't they?

315
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,760
I'd love it if one day you just wentâ¦

316
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,640
-Yeah.
-[both laugh]

317
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,240
And then walked out like that,
"See you later, guys."

318
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,240
[Lizzie] I think the colour's lovely,
I don't know if it's appetising.

319
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,040
Looks like some swamp creature.

320
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,760
Bakers, you have one minute left.

321
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,720
Ah!

322
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,800
[Chigs] Come on. Nearly there.

323
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,600
I'm just painting my matza.

324
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,200
[Maggie] I'm putting frozen fruit on top.
Hopefully, it won't leak out.

325
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,200
This here is the mango
and the blueberries.

326
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,960
[Freya] That's cute.

327
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,200
[gasps] Kiwis flying everywhere.

328
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,480
Bakers, your time is up.

329
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh, that's it.

330
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,600
[Noel] Please step away
from your pavlovas.

331
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,840
Actually, I believe
the plural is "pavlovi."

332
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,160
-[Matt] Happy?
-Yeah, chuffed to bits.

333
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,920
It sunk and there's some cracks.
It's a pavlova.

334
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,520
[Noel] <i>Nine Signature pavlovas</i>
<i>baked in just two hours 45 minutes</i>

335
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,400
<i>now face the judgment of Paul and Prue.</i>

336
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,920
-[Prue] Hi, Crystelle.
-Hello.

337
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,240
-Hi.
-Hi, Crystelle.

338
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,800
-[Paul] Looks great.
-Those little egg shapes are lovely.

339
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,520
So, I've got a coconut streusel base,
a lime curd, and then fresh Kiwis.

340
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,840
[Prue] Delicious.

341
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,320
Really strong lime
which goes beautifully with the meringue.

342
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,040
The sides are too thick.

343
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,440
You've got, like, an impenetrable wall
you've gotta get through.

344
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,920
-But flavours are great though.
-[sighs] I'll take that.

345
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,480
We have the pyramids in matza.

346
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,680
-So, just the basic pavlova, then.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Just the basic pavlova.

347
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,080
[Paul] The idea is very good.
It's a little untidy. It's cracked a bit.

348
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,800
[Prue] That is so unusual.

349
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,640
You get the dates first
and then the orange.

350
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,280
It's a great blend of flavours,
and it works in that pavlova.

351
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,960
I would have thought it wouldn't have
enough acidity, but it does.

352
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,400
JÃ¼rgen's back.

353
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,000
-Thank you.
-[Prue laughs]

354
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,120
Mazel tov.

355
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,440
[laughing] Thank you.

356
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,880
{\an8}[Paul] I mean, it's not the most
attractive looking pavlova.

357
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,160
-'Cause that green isâ¦ [laughs]
-[Prue] It looksâ¦

358
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,880
[Lizzie] It is blueberry, rosemary,
and lemon curd.

359
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,960
It's like something
out of a Willy Wonka Factory.

360
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,000
[Matt] Yeah.

361
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,200
I like the rosemary. Very good lemon curd.

362
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,360
The flavours are spot-on.
I just think it's a bit stodgy.

363
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,280
Love the appearance.
Has cracked a little bit.

364
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,960
I would have put more raspberry,
less chocolate.

365
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,280
-[Prue] The chocolate is so dominant.
-Okay.

366
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,240
-[Prue] George, I think it looks awful.
-Okay.

367
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,640
[Paul] The baking hasn't worked either.

368
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,520
That idea of putting it in the proving
drawer to get that sort of crack in there.

369
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,280
It's all marshmallow, isn't it?
You need to hollow it out more.

370
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,120
-The flavours are great.
-[George] Okay.

371
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,720
-The speculoos with the lemon.
-Absolutely delicious.

372
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,000
It's not all bad news. Thank you.

373
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,920
{\an8}-I think "informal" is a good word to use.
-Exactly.

374
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,280
[Prue] Higgledy-piggledy.

375
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,120
[Paul] Structurally, it's lost its way.

376
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,159
-It's collapsed a little bit on the side.
-[Maggie] Yes.

377
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,720
The flavours are lovely.
I think it does look a bit of a mess.

378
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,679
It looks really summery and delicious.

379
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,000
[Paul] I think you could've baked it
a little bit longer.

380
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,880
-Because of that.
-[Giuseppe] Yes.

381
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,080
[Paul] It's broken away.

382
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,439
Mmm. Flavours are so fresh and summery.

383
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,680
The peachy cream is just delicious.

384
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,520
-Yeah. Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done.

385
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,080
{\an8}-[Prue] Looks fantastic.
-Decoration looks very good.

386
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
-Butâ¦
-Oh, gosh.

387
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,920
The proof is literally in the pudding.

388
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,000
[Paul] Wow, it's like an Eton mess.

389
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,800
The aquafaba doesn't hold up well at all.

390
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,240
[Paul] They're not very strong flavours.

391
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
-They're not tangy or tart enough.
-[Freya] Okay.

392
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,640
If you get a slice
of the candied peach, it's good.

393
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,960
But the, sort of, sloppy bit
in the middle, that's not very nice.

394
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,560
-[Paul] That looks amazing.
-[Prue] I love the edge.

395
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,520
Just so casually, but elegantly swirled.

396
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,760
Beautiful. All right, let's have a look.

397
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,760
That just falls through.

398
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,160
-Are you excited?
-I am.

399
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
-That's for you.
-[Prue] Oh, look at that.

400
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,000
It's filled with Chantilly cream
and a mango and passion fruit coulis.

401
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,160
[Prue] It's lovely, soft,
but stable in the middle.

402
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,680
And crunchy outside.

403
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,360
I think it's wonderful.

404
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,840
The acidity and the cream is just lovely.

405
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,760
[Paul] There's a nice marshmallow
in there, its stable enough to hold it.

406
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,000
It's quite difficult to get that balance.

407
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,840
But the way you've done the top
and the chocolate, I can't, you knowâ¦

408
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
-[laughing]
-[Lizzie] Wow.

409
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,160
-[Paul] Well done.
-[Chigs] Thank you both. Thank you.

410
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,480
[Matt] Whoo!

411
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,600
-[exclaims]
-[Matt] Wow.

412
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,320
-Were you expecting that?
-No, no, not at all.

413
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,280
[Chigs] I can't believe it.
Hollywood handshake.

414
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,240
My work here is done now. [chuckles]

415
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,680
Paul said, "JÃ¼rgen is back,"
so I take that comment.

416
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,640
It's great.

417
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
I need to do well
in Technicals, definitely.

418
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,240
Going to go in with a positive attitude
and do my best.

419
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,360
All still to play for in Dessert Week.

420
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,760
[Noel] <i>The bakers</i>
<i>could practice their pavlovas,</i>

421
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,280
<i>but their next challenge</i>
<i>is a complete mystery.</i>

422
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,080
Bakers, welcome back to the tent
for your Technical challenge,

423
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,720
which, today, has been set
by the evil Prue-Ella De Vil.

424
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,560
This recipe requires
some serious multitasking,

425
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,120
so get organised.

426
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,600
[grunts] Shivers up my spine.

427
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,600
As ever, this task is judged blind,
so we ask the judges to leave the tent.

428
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,800
For your Technical challenge,
Evil Prue would like you each to make

429
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,040
four individual sticky toffee puddings.

430
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,680
Your sticky toffee puddings
need to be perfectly baked

431
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,480
and served with sticky toffee sauce.

432
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,000
-Would've thought that was obvious.
-You would've thought so.

433
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,840
Your sticky toffee pudding
should be decorated with tuile triangles

434
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,080
and served alongside
a smooth crÃ¨me anglaise.

435
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,400
[both] Mmmâ¦

436
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,600
[Matt] You have 90 minutes.

437
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,320
-[Noel] On your marksâ¦
-Get setâ¦

438
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
-Bake!
-[Crystelle sighs]

439
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,680
[chuckling] Why?

440
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,440
[exhales heavily]

441
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,040
I love sticky toffee pudding.
It's great, isn't it?

442
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
[Amanda] My husband makes
the sticky toffee pudding at home.

443
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,120
That's his thing.

444
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,960
So I never have to make it.
Now I wish I had.

445
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,720
I've never, ever made one. [chuckles]

446
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,320
We'll see how it goes.

447
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,440
This may beâ¦ I never have before,
maybe never, ever again.

448
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,840
-[Paul] So, sticky toffee pudding.
-Who doesn't like a sticky toffee pudding?

449
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,800
It's quite a complicated challenge.

450
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,840
They have to make the pudding,
they have to make caramel sauce,

451
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,400
the crÃ¨me anglaise
and they have to make tuile.

452
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,960
Of course, the sponge
is the most important thing.

453
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,160
The problem might be that they'll think
it's cooked when it's not.

454
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,360
So the danger is slightly undercooking.

455
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,880
Mmm, that is a lovely light sponge.

456
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,800
You can see it's baked all the way through
with that beautiful caramel on the top.

457
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,360
CrÃ¨me anglaise is beautifully smooth,
and it's that blend between the two.

458
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,000
The whole lot is lovely together.

459
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,160
I'm sure a couple of 'em
will get it spot-on.

460
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
I don't think we'll have any disasters.

461
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,360
This recipe
seems quite brief and complicated.

462
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,560
[Chigs] I'll make the tuile first,
which I've never done before.

463
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,560
I think it's a really thin,
skinny biscuit.

464
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,960
"Tuile"? Tuile? Tules?

465
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,720
"Cook the butter,
lemon juice and liquid glucoseâ¦"

466
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,320
"Remove from the heat
and stir in the dry ingredientsâ¦"

467
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,440
[George] Right. Hazelnuts,
sesame seeds, flour, butterâ¦

468
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,720
Is this right?

469
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,240
Okay.

470
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,400
I've got to let it rest.
I am now onâ¦ Make toffee sauce.

471
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,560
The sauce is the best part, hands down.

472
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,040
"Make a wet caramel,
then add the cream, butter and vanilla."

473
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,480
To make a wet caramelâ¦

474
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,200
Does that mean
that you put water in the caramel?

475
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,640
[nervously] I don't know.

476
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,920
[JÃ¼rgen] Hot water
speeds up absorption of liquid.

477
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,680
[Chigs] Gotta wait for this now
to go to a nice golden colour.

478
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,520
[JÃ¼rgen] It is starting to brown.

479
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,560
[Giuseppe] Now is the fun part,
pouring the cream.

480
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,800
It's coming, but there's some
lumps of crystals in there.

481
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,440
[George] This is gonna burn.

482
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,480
I need to add some vanilla
to take out the burning smell.

483
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,800
[Amanda] Doesn't look
very caramelly, does it?

484
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,800
[exclaiming] Ah! Oh, no.

485
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,640
[sighs]

486
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,200
[JÃ¼rgen] Should bake my tuile,

487
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,480
because I'll need
the oven for the pudding.

488
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,480
Spread the tuile mixture into a rectangle.

489
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,320
It's not really a rectangle, is it?

490
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,160
-[beeps]
-[JÃ¼rgen] Tuile is in.

491
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,800
There is no guidance whatsoever.
The point there is, "Bake."

492
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,840
Oh!

493
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,520
Oh, no, she died.
Do you think I can just use it?

494
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,280
It's fine. They won't know. [chuckles]

495
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,600
Oh, no. Today's just not my day.

496
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,440
Right.

497
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,400
Bakers, half of you are halfway through.

498
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,960
The other half have half a challenge left.

499
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,360
You're halfway through.

500
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,920
Well, this is coming out.

501
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,200
[Maggie] Come on.

502
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,240
So, we let this cool a little bit
and then I'll cut it.

503
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,680
And the next step
is to make the pudding batter.

504
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,720
I've got the chopped dates,
the self-raising flour,

505
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,280
butter, dark muscovado sugarâ¦

506
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,280
And butter. I said butter already.
And chopped dates.

507
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,080
I've got some butter and sugar in here.
I'm not sure if I need the flour.

508
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,880
I have my doubts, somehow.

509
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,360
I'll just read the recipe again.

510
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,880
-[Noel] Maggie.
-[Maggie] Hello.

511
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,200
[Noel] I'm gonna write number 11.

512
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,440
Anything will help.

513
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,040
-[laughs]
-"Push Paul into a ditch."

514
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,000
[both laughing]

515
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,280
Number 12,
"Maggie gets taken away by the police."

516
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,920
Now, when they ask you about the recipe,
go, "What are these?"

517
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,480
-[Maggie laughing]
-[George] What's next?

518
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,720
I've got butter on my face.

519
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,120
"Spoon some of the toffee sauce
into the pudding mould."

520
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,880
It's always gutting when you turn them out
and there's no sauce.

521
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,320
[Chigs] Divide the batter up
equally into the moulds.

522
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,080
[JÃ¼rgen] Looks good.

523
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,560
It's looking runny.
Let's stay with it, Mag.

524
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,520
Don't change anything now.

525
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,280
[JÃ¼rgen] Going in.
I'll check in 20 minutes.

526
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,360
I'll go for 15 minutes to start with,
and see how it goes.

527
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,480
[Chigs] Don't know how long for.

528
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,680
I'm going for 15 minutes initially
and see what happens.

529
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,880
[Matt] Now you got a handshake,

530
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,440
I was wondering if you would
get a tattoo to commemorateâ¦

531
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,240
[laughs] What would it look like?

532
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,880
A sort of greasy, chubby-fingered hand
on a part of your body.

533
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,200
Whereabouts?

534
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,440
-Well, I daren't sayâ¦
-[laughs]

535
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,840
Bakers, you have half an hour left.
What you doing with that?

536
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,320
I just get upset
when one of the bakers leaves,

537
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,000
so this week I'm gonna go instead.

538
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,280
Good idea.

539
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,320
I'm making the crÃ¨me anglaise.
It's just thin custard.

540
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,600
I've never made
a real custard with eggs before.

541
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,920
Not a good start. [chuckles]

542
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,320
[Chigs] I'm warming the milk,
cream and vanilla.

543
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,880
Then I'll start adding
a little milk at a time.

544
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,000
I can always do with a workout.

545
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,440
It's very fine balance
where it goes from custard to fried egg.

546
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,720
[Maggie] This is probably
the only thing that's right.

547
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,360
And if I burn this,
then I'm really stuffed.

548
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,560
[JÃ¼rgen] That's nice.

549
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,440
Oh, no! There's lumps in it.

550
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,520
Hot!

551
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,760
Feel like it definitely is scrambled.

552
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,000
Bakers, you have 15 minutes.

553
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,520
-[gasps]
-I was gonna say that.

554
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,960
The crÃ¨me anglaise is done.

555
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,560
All I have to wait
is for the puddings to cook.

556
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,680
-[JÃ¼rgen] They haven't collapsed.
-Nope.

557
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,680
Skewer's wet,
but that wet could be the caramel sauce.

558
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,200
I just don't want them to be raw.

559
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,120
[Amanda] They're rising.

560
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,080
I'll do them for two more minutes,
'cause they're soggy.

561
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,120
-You all right?
-[Maggie] I just looked in the oven.

562
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,440
I've got little splodgy messes
in the bottom of the pudding basins.

563
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,520
It's just sunken to a gluey mess.

564
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,000
I must have left something out.
But it's all ticked off.

565
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,280
-[Giuseppe] The other page is?
-[Maggie] No flour.

566
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,840
No, there is flour. There you go. Yeah.

567
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,560
Oh, right. That's what I didn't do.
I knew there was something.

568
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,560
-Bakers, you have five minutesâ¦
-[both] Left.

569
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,360
-Time to get them out.
-[timer beeps]

570
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,840
-Shaky.
-There's sticky toffee pudding. [chuckles]

571
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,720
I think I should turn them out
while they're still warm.

572
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,160
Are you doing a magic trick?

573
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,840
I will need three of those
and a little ball with that one.

574
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,960
-[Noel laughs]
-[Crystelle] How on earth?

575
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,240
Do I justâ¦ [gasps]

576
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,840
Come on.

577
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,920
I'll take that. Boom. [giggles]

578
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,920
[JÃ¼rgen] I think it looks puddingy.

579
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,760
[Amanda] Ah!
Oh, disaster. They're all raw.

580
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,280
[sighs] It's all over. [chuckles]

581
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,960
Let's go for it.

582
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,600
You've gotta laugh, I'll say.

583
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,320
Anybody watching
will feel very sorry for me. [chuckling]

584
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,960
Bakers, you have one minute left.

585
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,480
[Freya] <i>Ay caramba!</i>

586
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,360
Right. Best-looking tuiles.

587
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,080
They're breaking!
Should've done it while it was hot.

588
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,000
-How many have I done so far?
-I feel like this might be your third.

589
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,560
-I'll have to mash that back up.
-Mash it up.

590
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,160
[JÃ¼rgen] Either side.

591
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,680
[Amanda] Do you think they'll notice
if I squash them in?

592
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,280
The sauces go on the side.

593
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,920
-[Chigs] Toffee sauce, it's not the best.
-[Freya] True nightmare.

594
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,320
-I suppose that's it.
-[Maggie] <i>Et voilÃ .</i>

595
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,240
Bakers, your time is up.

596
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,480
Jeez, phew, that was close, eh?

597
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,760
Place your sticky toffee puddings
behind your photographs.

598
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,480
I didn't put the flour in. [laughs]

599
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,120
-It was just one lineâ¦
-[both] On the next page.

600
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,720
-Didn't see it.
-Didn't see it, did I?

601
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,280
[Matt] <i>Paul and Prue are looking</i>
<i>for four rich, sticky toffee puddings,</i>

602
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,000
<i>silky toffee sauce, smooth crÃ¨me anglaise</i>

603
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,440
<i>and eight perfectly crispy tuiles.</i>

604
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,200
<i>-And they'll have no idea whose is whose.</i>
-Nice.

605
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,560
-We got eight tuilesâ¦
-[Prue] Mmm-hmm.

606
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,800
â¦with a bit of a snap.

607
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,320
The pudding looks pretty solid.

608
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,560
-The crumb's good.
-The sauce is a little bit stiff.

609
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,400
Let's see what the anglaise is like.

610
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,760
[Prue] That's very good.

611
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,680
-[Paul] That's not bad, that.
-I must say, that is delicious.

612
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
[Paul] Okay, moving on.

613
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,240
We have eight tuiles, all pretty uniform.

614
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,800
[Prue] Really nice and thin.

615
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,520
-[Paul] This looks--
-[Prue] Stodgy.

616
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,720
[Paul] Quite raw.

617
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,240
-[Paul] Yeah.
-[Prue] It's very, very underbaked.

618
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,520
-[Paul] Eight nice tuiles.
-[Prue] Very nice tuile.

619
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,080
-[Paul] Nice shape.
-I'm impressed with the custards.

620
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,280
-Yeah.
-Perfect.

621
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,280
Looks a little stodgy and underbaked.

622
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,040
It's a pity, because I had a bit
of the cooked bit and it's delicious.

623
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
[Paul] Hmm.

624
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,160
-Few issues. Wow.
-[Prue] This looks like a disaster.

625
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,160
The sticky toffee puddings
obviously came out too early.

626
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,840
They've managed to bake on the outside,

627
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,360
-but the inside's just raw.
-[Prue] Yes.

628
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,880
[Paul] Not bad.
Just a little bit longer on the caramel.

629
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,880
-This is just on the turn.
-[Paul] Yeah, it's curdled.

630
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,600
We have eight fairly even tuiles.

631
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,600
[Prue] And rather nice-looking puddings.

632
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,640
[Paul] Oh, that's well-baked. It's nice.

633
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,440
-The anglaise is good.
-Mmm.

634
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,200
-[Paul] Neat tuiles.
-[Prue] Very nice.

635
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,080
[Paul] Sponge is good.
Overall, that's pretty decent actually.

636
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,520
Moving on.

637
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,840
-[Prue] Well, they're underdone.
-[Paul] A bit raw in the middle.

638
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,520
Let's have a look at the sauces.

639
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,920
They've gone slightly over the edge.
It's gone almost treacle.

640
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,600
-[Prue] Right.
-[Paul] Burnt tuiles.

641
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,520
-Burnt to a cinder--
-[Prue] Rather funny shape.

642
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,720
-[Paul] Scrambled eggs.
-[Prue] Scrambled.

643
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,600
And underdone caramel.

644
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,440
Oh, dear.

645
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,440
Mmm. And that is raw. That's a shame.

646
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,720
-[Prue] Oh, dear.
-[Paul chuckles] What is that?

647
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,560
[Prue] Those tuiles look really good.

648
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,920
-Don't they!
-[Prue chuckles]

649
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,400
It looks like caramelised onion chutney.

650
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,720
[Prue chuckles] That's exactly
what it looks like.

651
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,920
[Paul] Burnt to a cinder.

652
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,600
-[Noel] You're not gonna try?
-[Paul] I'll leave it. Thanks.

653
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,840
-Moving on.
-[Prue] Last one.

654
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,960
[Paul] These tuiles aren't too bad,
I like the colour.

655
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,200
-We have a baked sponge.
-[Prue] Hmm.

656
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,640
[Paul] Let's have a look at the caramel.

657
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,040
[all laughing]

658
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,720
-[Noel] We'll spill it out.
-[Paul] Come on.

659
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,920
-Do it like a bottle of ketchup, maybe.
-Come on.

660
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
[grunts]

661
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,920
[Paul] Ah! We have fully-fledged toffee.

662
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,640
-Wow.
-[Matt] Yeah, I'm in.

663
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,960
This is gonna be interesting.

664
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,720
[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue</i>

665
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,800

666
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,280
In ninth place, this one.

667
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,280
Oh, Maggie.
This was a fair old disaster, wasn't it?

668
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,560
I made for you a gluten-freeâ¦

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,560
-You forget to put the flour in?
-[Maggie] Yes.

671
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,680
[Prue] Oh, bad luck.

672
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,800
In eighth spot, we have this one.

673
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,040
Amanda. Raw, you burnt the tuiles,

674
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,800
you scrambled the crÃ¨me anglaise
and caramel's not caramelised enough.

675
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,680
-But besides that, brilliant.
-[all chuckle]

676
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,880
[mouthing] Thank you.

677
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,920
In seventh place, we have this one.

678
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,120
George. Very raw puddings, sadly.

679
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,680
[Matt] <i>Freya is sixth.</i>

680
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
<i>Crystelle is fifth.</i>

00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,520
<i>Giuseppe, fourth and Chigs, third.</i>

682
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,120

this one. Whose is this?

684
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,960
Lizzie.

685
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,360
Your sponge is pretty good,

686
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,680
crÃ¨me anglaise is good
and your caramel sauce is good. Well done.

687
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,680
[Prue] Which means we have JÃ¼rgen.

688
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,680
[all cheering]

689
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,600
Thank you.

690
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,360
Really nice sticky toffee puddings.

691
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,960
Very good tuile.

692
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,520
Excellent crÃ¨me anglaise.

693
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,680
Perfect sauce.

694
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,320
-Very good.
-Thank you.

695
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
[JÃ¼rgen] It's wonderful.

696
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,800
I hardly can believe it.
Winning the Technical in Dessert Week.

697
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,760
One I was afraid of,
but it seems I have to be afraid ofâ¦

698
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,840
[chuckles]

699
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,160
â¦to be on the spot and concentrated.

700
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,680
[Lizzie] Who knows what happened?

701
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,280
Came second, so thanks, everyone else,
for undercooking.

702
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,320
I will never, ever, ever, ever,
bake a sticky toffee pudding again.

703
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,160
My husband's the expert, I don't need to.

704
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,760
He's gotta be good at something.

705
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,560
I knew there had to be flour
and I just couldn't see it.

706
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,480
Nothing you can do
when you've made a very silly mistake.

707
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,200
I love making it really hard for myself.

708
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,480
So tomorrow I'll just
have to do amazingly. [chuckles]

709
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,060
[Noel] <i>Just one more challenge remains</i>

710
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,540
<i>before Prue and Paul decide</i>
<i>Dessert Week's Star Baker.</i>

711
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,820
<i>And who will be asked to leave the tent.</i>

712
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,300
Bakers, I hope you are rested and ready
for your Showstopper challenge.

713
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,980
[Noel] Today, Paul and Prue

714
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:06,940
would love you to make
a celebratory joconde imprime dessert.

715
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,060
An impressive, multi-layered dessert
wrapped in a joconde collar.

716
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,140
Now the collar is a key element
and must be highly decorative.

717
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,780
Classically, a joconde
is a whisked sponge with ground almonds.

718
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,180
You have four and a half hours.

719
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,580
Unfortunately, we've used four hours

720
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,980
explaining to you what this challenge is.
You got half an hour.

721
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,060
[Matt] Good luck.

722
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,780
-[Noel] On your marksâ¦
-[Matt] Get setâ¦

723
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,020
[Noel chuckles] Bake.

724
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,740
[Matt] <i>Taken from the French nickname</i>
<i>for the</i> Mona Lisa, <i>the "joconde,"</i>

725
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,820
<i>the judges are expecting</i>
<i>highly decorative designs</i>

726
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,660
<i>to be baked into the baker's own</i>
<i>joconde collared masterpieces.</i>

727
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,020
The idea is that our jocondes need to be
as decorative as the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

728
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,140
So, no pressure.

729
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,420
I've been to see the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>
I didn't really like it that much.

730
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,540
I was like, "Is this it?" [chuckles]

731
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,860
What we're asking for
is a collar made of joconde sponge,

732
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,180
which has been imprinted with a design.

733
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,180
They can do anything they like
by way of dessert

734
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,900
inside this imprime collar.

735
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,660
[Paul] Now, they could be mousse,

736
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,740
they could be bavarois,
they could be crÃ¨me pat,

737
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,420
they could be jelly dacquoise,
anything they want.

738
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,580
But it's about getting it all set.

739
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,340
Timing has to be right.

740
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,180
-We're over a third of the way through.
-[timer beeping]

741
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,820
[Paul] And we're left
with nine fantastic bakers.

742
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,740
So I'm expecting the best of the best.

743
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,300
-Hi, Lizzie.
-Hello.

744
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,220
-Hello, Lizzie.
-Hello.

745
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,420
Lizzie, we want to hear
about your joconde imprime.

746
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,020
It's a Liverpool version.

I think it's wonderfully ambitious.
All you have to do is produce it.

755

You have the people

[JÃ¼rgen] The piece of music
is called "Pastime With Good Company."

766
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,659
It has been composed by Henry VIII himself

767
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,659
as a love song to Catherine of Aragon
from the 16th century.

[Matt] So you're doing not a round collar?

988

A bit of tactics because the vegan sponge
is not very bendy.

00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,140
It's still quite liquid, but I'm gonna
go in. I can't wait any longer.

1041
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,620
[Freya] Is that just gonna fall apart?

1042
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,460
It's standing still, so I'm all right.

1043
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,180
There we go.
It looks like the jelly didn't leak.

1044
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,700
[Amanda gasps]

1045
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,780
Ah! It's all coming out!

1046
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,980
My thing's leaked a little bit.

1047
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,820
[breathing heavily]

1048
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,300
It's not set properly.

1049
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,540
I can't take the collar off
'cause it's going to completely collapse.

1050
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,260
[George] I think it's getting stuck
on the peanut layer.

1051
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,540
I'm a happy man now, yeah.

1052
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,140
Get in there.

1053
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,260
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1054
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:02,180
Shall we go for it now?
I can hold it till they say, "walk away."

1055
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,820
It's beastly unfair
that it hasn't behaved.

1056
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,100
[exhales deeply]

1057
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,940
[Crystelle] Shaking.

1058
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,220
Bakers, your time is up.

1059
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,540
[Noel] Please step away from your bakes.

1060
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,020
[Maggie chuckling] There we go.
The avalanche has started.

1061
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,020
We might as well go out with a bang.

1062
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:41,380
[Noel] <i>It's judgement time</i>
<i>for our bakers' joconde imprimes.</i>

1063
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,880
JÃ¼rgen, would you like to bring
your Showstopper up, please?

1064
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,040
Well, I think it looks absolutely amazing.

1065
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,000
[Paul] The wine jelly.
You've got a few little bubbles in there.

1066
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,960
But I like the way it's set.
That view looks lovely.

1067
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,600
That cut through beautifully.

1068
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,720
-Wow.
-[JÃ¼rgen] It's topped by wine jelly.

1069
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,800
Then white chocolate Bavarian
with black pepper.

1070
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,480
Then a genoise and then at the bottom
there's a hazelnut dacquoise.

1071
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,600
That is such a luxurious, creamy,
boozy mouthful.

1072
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,600
Your textures of everything are gorgeous.

1073
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,760
-I can't get the black pepper.
-No, I'm looking for the pepper.

1074
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,680
Usually it comes a bit later.

1075
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,080
-Okay, let's just wait for a minute.
-[all chuckling]

1076
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,640
[Paul] If you'd like to sing.

1077
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,360
[humming "Pastime With Good Company"]

1078
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,920
-[clapping]
-That's very familiar.

1079
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,120
-Got the pepper.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Got the pepper?

1080
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,480
[all laughing]

1081
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,880
Excellent.

1082
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,720
This is inspired
by a crime scene that I went to.

1083
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,480
[all laughing]

1084
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,280
When I was very young in service.

1085
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,800
So I think you struggled with the joconde.

1086
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,720
And the dam has broken
when it was still trying to set.

1087
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,600
[Amanda] It's genoise sponge
with Calvados Bavarian cream,

1088
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,120
with caramelised apple jelly.

1089
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,000
And the top is a maple syrup glaze.

1090
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,720
They look like very beautiful layers. Mmm.

1091
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,760
You know, it tastes absolutely delicious,
but it does not taste a lot of apple.

1092
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,800
You're getting more
of an alcoholic flavour.

1093
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,560
The texture of everything is great.

1094
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,800
But unfortunately you drowned
everything out with that Calvados.

1095
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,160
You've lost some of the definition,
but it's pretty.

1096
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,560
I think overall,
it's quite a professional-looking piece.

1097
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,680
Very, very elegant.

1098
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:44,080
The filling is two types of bavarois,
pistachio and raspberry and strawberry.

1099
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,240
[Paul] Mmm, great layers.

1100
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,560
Oh, look at that, soft as anything.

1101
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,280
-Beautiful.
-Oh.

1102
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,160
Great flavours. Great acidity.

1103
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,080
The genoise has been baked beautifully.
It's lovely and soft.

1104
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,120
I mean, you'd serve that
at a decent hotel.

1105
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,400
-How many stars?
-Oh, a good five.

1106
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,160
-[Prue] Excellent.
-Thank you very much.

1107
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,400
[Matt and Noel] Well done.

1108
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,160
The bin's for you.

1109
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,200
-"I'm wheelie born in Liverpool."
-[Paul] Oh, right, yeah.

1110
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,760
-[all laughing]
-I love it.

1111
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,760
You got the Liverpool skyline,
which is pretty cool.

1112
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,000
It's a bit rudimentary.

1113
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,240
[chuckling] Dacquoise is
a little bit tough.

1114
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,640
[Prue] It's hard work, Lizzie.

1115
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,720
[Paul] I think your texture's all wrong,
but your flavours are beautiful.

1116
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,560
-It's wheelie good.
-There you go.

1117
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,880
[all laughing]

1118
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,560
{\an8}[Paul] Well, I think it looks beautiful.
The pipework is particularly good.

1119
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,600
Simple, but effective. [clicks tongue]

1120
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,640
[Prue] Those layers are really lovely.

1121
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,080
They're very powerful flavours.

1122
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,760
The coconut and lime
is just beautiful. Mmm.

1123
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,320
The lime, it's so powerful.
I would've pulled that back a little bit.

1124
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,600
But everything else I'm happy with.
Thank you.

1125
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,960
[Prue] I like the flower patterns.

1126
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,680
But where the joins are,
it's a bit clumsy. It's sort of lopsided.

1127
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,080
-Well, what am I--
-The peanut layer.

1128
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,840
Oh, literally you've got
a layer of peanuts.

1129
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,120
[crunching]

1130
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,720
You certainly get the peanut flavour
and the peanut crunch.

1131
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,040
[Paul] That peanut layer is ridiculous.
Can't get through it.

1132
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,320
I think you've just gone overkill
with the peanuts.

1133
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,880
-I quite like peanuts.
-[all laughing]

1134
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,080
[Paul] It looks amazing.
The joconde's well done.

1135
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,600
-I mean, this was taken from a <i>tile.</i>
-[Chigs chuckles] Yeah.

1136
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,400
And it's so original
and it looks startling.

1137
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,080
-Thank you.
-[Paul] And two tiers.

1138
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,120
Looks like a delicious bathroom.

1139
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,120
[chuckles]

1140
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,320
The bavarois are perfection.
They are perfection.

1141
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,560
Your flavours
and your textures are superb.

1142
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,360
They're just firm enough to stay up.

1143
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,840
I mean, it's really clever.

1144
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,880
I don't even like Black Forest gateau
and I love that.

1145
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,200
Thank you.

1146
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,200
[Prue] You've lost some of the imprime.

1147
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,720
It's a bit messy,
but let's have a look inside, shall we?

1148
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,440
[Freya] The joconde is chocolate hazelnut.

1149
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,800
Then there's a hazelnut dacquoise

1150
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,920
and then a layer
of Italian meringue buttercream,

1151
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,840
then a chocolate orange mousse

1152
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,920
and then on top, it's orange jelly.

1153
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,560
[Paul] It's set quite hard.
It's more like a ganache.

1154
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,640
-Yeah, yeah.
-[Paul] The mousse.

1155
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,400
-I think the orange is too strong.
-[Paul] So strong.

1156
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,160
[Prue] But I actually think
your joconde is really good.

1157
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,480
Thank you.

1158
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:36,280
It needed a cream, it needed something
in there to hold everything together.

1159
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,200
I've had some beautiful vegan cakes.

1160
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,200
It's not one of the better ones.

1161
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,280
See the Dam Busters have been in.

1162
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,480
[laughing]

1163
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,920
Let's have a look at it.

1164
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,600
[Prue] Well, it's a very pretty colour.

1165
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,280
Mmm.

1166
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,400
Maggie, the flavour is lovely.
It's the essence of summer.

1167
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,120
The strawberries are just beautiful.

1168
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,000
[Paul] Where's your second
element in this?

1169
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,440
The bavarois and the coulis.

1170
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,800
[Paul] Ah, that's the second element.

1171
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,800
What have you been doing
for four and a half hours?

1172
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,200
-Doing it twice.
-[Paul] Ah, did you do it twice?

1173
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,360
-Flavours are lovely.
-[Prue] And the joconde is good.

1174
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,800
-Thank you so much.
-[Paul] Thank you.

1175
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,720
You've been more than kind.

1176
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,240
[Maggie chuckling] It was what it was.

1177
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,600
They did say it tasted lovely,
but I think they were just being kind.

1178
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,920
Really happy with what I delivered.

1179
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,120
Think I might be up for consideration
for Star Baker.

1180
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,680
But Giuseppe's and JÃ¼rgen's,
theirs is just another level.

1181
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,680
[Freya] I feel like
that was pretty brutal,

1182
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,040
to be honest with you.

1183
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,600
It's not that I don't agree.

1184
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,680
But, like, I kinda just don't agree.

1185
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,760
[laughs]

1186
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,560
Well, that Showstopper
ran the gamut, didn't it?

1187
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,240
[Paul] Giuseppe, JÃ¼rgen, Chigs.

1188
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,080
I think they've all done
quite well out of this.

1189
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,200
-JÃ¼rgen's was an amazing concept.
-I think JÃ¼rgen's was beautiful.

1190
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,640
But if you have another look
at Chigs', it's still holding well.

1191
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,000
All the layers were there.
The taste was delicious.

1192
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,720
-Fantastic flavour.
-[Paul] Some of them did collapse.

1193
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,000
There was a couple of people that messed
up a bit with textures and flavours.

1194
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,680
You look at Maggie, she classed the puree
on top as a second element.

1195
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,880
That's not the case.

1196
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,840
-You're not buying it.
-[Paul] I'm not buying it.

1197
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,560
It split as well.
I mean, it poured out all over the place.

1198
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,480
But also
I was really disappointed in Freya.

1199
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,360
Because although she did better
with the dacquoise in this,

1200
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,640
it was far too thick.

1201
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,880
[Paul] That was very dry.

1202
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,080
But then you look at Amanda's,

1203
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,320
the Calvados in that bavarois
was the only thing you could taste.

1204
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,520
-And it split.
-But it tasted nice.

1205
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,560
You gotta look back
on the two challenges as well.

1206
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,880
We'll have another cup of tea
and another slice of cake,

1207
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,120
-and then we'll make a decision.
-Slice of cake.

1208
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,800
[mimics Worzel Gummidge] Cup of tea
and a slice of cake, Aunt Sally.

1209
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,920
Well, bakers,
thank you for another great week.

1210
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,800
It falls to me to announce
who the Star Baker is.

1211
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,960
And that person isâ¦

1212
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,200
Chigs.

1213
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,760
-[Matt] Congratulations!
-[cheering]

1214
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,880
Okay, bakers, that means
that I've got the horrible job this week

1215
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,280
of announcing the person who's leaving us,

1216
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,760
and we're really gonna miss them.

1217
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,760
The person who's leaving us this week isâ¦

1218
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,560
Maggie.

1219
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,320
It's been such good fun.
[chuckling] It's been suchâ¦

1220
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,880
[Prue] Maggie, honestly,
you've done so well.

1221
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,880
[Maggie] The whole thing
has been such fun, really.

1222
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,320
And just to have been part of it
is just a complete joy.

1223
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,040
[Matt] We're going to miss you so much.

1224
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,360
To have stayed for four weeks.
I think it comes pretty high, really.

1225
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,280
On a personal level,
nothing can beat delivering a baby.

1226
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,320
And bringing a new life into the world.

1227
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,520
But it comes quite second.

1228
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,080
Just having a bad week.

1229
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,480
-You'll have a good week next week.
-Thank you, I will.

1230
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,160
Ah, God. Nightmare. [laughs]

1231
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,160
I feel like
I definitely scraped through that.

1232
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,480
Glad to be here,
but I'm really sad to see Maggie go.

1233
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,560
-[Paul] Well done, Chigs.
-Thank you very much, Paul.

1234
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,680
[sighs in relief]

1235
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,400
[Chigs] <i>What the hell just happened?</i>

1236
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,360
Thank you.

1237
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,720
Get a handshake
and Star Baker in the same week.

1238
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,800
[Crystelle] Oh, you bloody smashed it.

1239
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,480
Can't believe it. I'm honestlyâ¦
I am so speechless right now.

1240
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,280
It never happens. But I'm lost for words.

1241
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,360
[Paul] I think Chigs
smashed it out the park.

1242
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,400
I think all three challenges,
he was exceptionally good.

1243
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,240
I mean, for a guy who said
he'd been baking up to 12 months ago,

1244
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,840
he's done an amazing job.

1245
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,840
I got Star Baker, Mum.

1246
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,440
-[Chigs' mother] <i>Am I on TV?</i>
-Yeah!

1247
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,680
[Chigs' mother laughing]

1248
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,320
<i>-Congratulations, I'm so proud of you!</i>
<i>-</i>Thank you, Mum.

1249
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,720
<i>-So proud of you. I love you.</i>
-Thank you. I love you too!

1250
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,720
