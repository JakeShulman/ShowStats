1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
I'm so excited. It's caramel week.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,000
So too am I, Noel Fielding.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,040
And actually, here's a fun fact
about caramel week.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,000
Did you know that leathery screen star

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,960
Mel Gibson's original name
was Caramel Gibson?

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,960
[chuckles] I did know that, actually.
The <i>Lethal Weapon</i> films are my favourite.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,680
Particularly love the powerful acting
of Danny Oven-Glover.

8
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:20,800
[laughs]

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,160
-You ruined it.
-What?

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,880
I had a lovely joke there
about caramel week.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,800
All the boys and girls
who watch this show

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,640
would really enjoy that joke,
and you've absolutely ruined it.

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,880
[scoffs] I don't know
what his problem is, Danny.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,960
Fancy introducing the show with me?

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,080
Okay.

16
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,680
Welcome to the <i>Great British Baking Show.</i>

17

[Matt] <i>This time</i>
<i>the bakers must conquer caramelâ¦</i>

18
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,460

[opening theme music playing]

28
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,660
Caramel week, the week
where anything can go wrong. [laughs]

29
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,740
[unenthusiastically] Yayâ¦
Proper fake "Yay," that, isn't it?

30
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,740
[Lizzie] It's completely different
to every other week we've done.

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,620
-It's terrifying.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Caramel is heated sugar

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,300
that solidifies without crystallizing.

33
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,980
I'm dreading it. [laughs]

34
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,660
It's just sugar
and then suddenly, bam, it's caramel.

35
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,820
Then it burns, and you're like,
"My life's over."

36
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,380
Dare I say it,
I'm feeling fairly confident.

37
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,140
Bakers, welcome back
to the tent for caramel week.

38
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,220
[Noel] Today,
for your Signature challenge,

39
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,300
the judges would love you
to make a highly decorative,

40
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,540
sharing-sized caramel tart.

41
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,260
Now you can create
any style of tart you like,

42
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,580
with any flavours or additional elements.

43
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,580
But remember,
caramel must be the star of the show.

44
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,620
Oh, not again.

45
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,820
Years ago,
I auditioned for a part in <i>The Bill,</i>

46
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,660
lost out to an Italian meringue.

47
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,220
-What was the role?
-It was an Italian meringue.

48
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,180
I can kind of see it from both sides.

49
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,140
-You have two and a half hours.
-[Matt] On your marksâ¦

50
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,620
-[Noel, sing-song] Get setâ¦
-Bake!

51
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,660
It's a caramel tart,
and it's a highly decorative caramel tart

52
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,380
and one you've got to
put your own spin on.

53
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,100
-And not a lot of time to do it.
-It's caramel, innit?

54
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,380
You need to be patient.
'Cause when you rush it, things mess up.

55
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,260
And I don't wanna go home.

56
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,740
I can't be trusted with molten sugar.
It's just a terrifying week.

57
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,580
[Paul] What we're looking for

58
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,540
is a beautiful, thin base,
a beautifully set caramel,

59
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,860
flavours which enhance the caramel
with a gorgeous decoration on top.

60
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,300
Caramel has to be the star.

61
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,340
We don't want so much
that it's overbearingly sweet.

62
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,740
It mustn't be rock-hard, like a toffee.

63
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,660
And it mustn't be runny like a sauce.

64
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,420
[Crystelle] I'm just trying
to get my pastry done.

65
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,980
Get that chilled and then I can
focus on all the fillings and stuff.

66
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,140
It's so important that they get
the caramel base cold

67
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,820
before they decorate it.

68
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,300
If they don't cool, if you put anything
on the top, it will just melt.

69
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,300
[Prue] I think the bakers
will be nervous about caramel week.

70
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,540
They won't have worked
that much with it.

71
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,540
It's pure sugar.

72
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,540
It's not something you'd eat every day.

73
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,980
-Morning, George.
-Hello.

74
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,900
Morning. Hello.

75
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,140
What have you decided
to do for caramel tart?

76
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,260
A bit like a banoffee pie.

77
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,580
I've got a chocolate tart
and a caramel custard,

78
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,500
my bananas, and then I got a toffee sauce.

79
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,180
And then I'm going to try
and cut through all that sweetness

80
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,740
with double cream and crÃ¨me fraiche.

81
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,180
I love the way you went, "Use double cream
to cut through the sweetness."

82
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,180
[Matt] <i>George's classic flavour combos</i>

86
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,860
The fridge is my friend
in this challenge.

87
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,300
-Pray my custard doesn't curdle.
-Well, yeah.

[Noel] <i>Lizzie is also risking</i>
<i>cramming in a custard.</i>

I've made my pastry and that's going
in the freezer for 15 minutes.

105
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,980
Shortcrust pastry,
so cold butter is the key.

106
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,780
So when I roll it out,
it doesn't start shrinkin'.

I am doing an apple pecan

112
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,540
I want to taste the cinnamon apples.

113
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,340
But no sugar's going in because I really
don't want this to be sickly sweet.

114

[Matt] <i>Crystelle's tart</i>

Sugar-free apples

[Noel] How's caramel for you?

130
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,820
It doesn't like moisture,
it doesn't like too hot, or too cold.

131
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,220
Temperamental.

I'm using three different kinds of nuts,

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,420
I want to roll it very, very thin,
about two millimetres thick

152
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,980
to make it very, very crisp.

153
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,660
[Chigs] Need to make sure
I get all the grooves in the tart,

154
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,860
get a nice finish.

155
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,980
They'll look out for the little details.

156
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,380
[Matt] <i>Aiming for a finish with finesse,</i>

157
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,500
{\an8}<i>Chigs will top his tart</i>
<i>with fine sugar work.</i>

158
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,060
{\an8}<i>He's going big on flavour,</i>
<i>covering a ginger-laced caramel</i>

159
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,780
{\an8}<i>with a rich chocolate ganache.</i>

160
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,940
The chocolate was overpowering
when I was practising,

161
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,180
but I've changed it now,

162
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,660
I'm increasing the amount
of caramel in there.

163
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,700
"Blind-bake for 20 minutes."

164
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,860
Where's my balls?

165
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,180
[Matt] <i>Baking the pastry case</i>
<i>before the filling is addedâ¦</i>

166
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,660
Going in, then.

167
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,060
<i>â¦helps avoid</i>
<i>the dreaded soggy bottom.</i>

168
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,900
This will go in
for 18 minutes to start with.

169
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,980
I'll take off the baking beans
and then in for 15.

170
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,260
Be good to me, please.

171
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,940
[exaggerated]
Right, bakers, the Union have convened

172
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,500
and voted
that you are halfway through the task.

173
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,540
Anybody have any questions,

174
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,220
please direct them to the foreman.

175
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,420
[chuckles]

176
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,020
[Chigs] Start making the caramel.

177
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,740
[Noel] <i>The bakers must</i>
<i>now turn their attention</i>

178
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,980
<i>to the star of the show.</i>

179
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,700
It's fine to eat out of a jar,
but when you have to make it,

180
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,379
it's a nasty little thing,
caramel. [laughs]

181
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,340
Just wanna make sure the water
is mixed in with the sugar.

182
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,540
[Noel] <i>Whichever method</i>
<i>the bakers chooseâ¦</i>

183
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,060
I'm doing a wet caramel.

184
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:02,100
I think dry caramel's the easiest.
It's just sugar. A kid's dream.

185
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,980
<i>â¦they must be</i>
<i>incredibly preciseâ¦</i>

186
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,820
-Caramel is a very fussy baby.
-<i>â¦about temperature.</i>

187
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,820
Gotta wait for that to get to 117
to get to caramel stage.

188
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,060
I kind of sound like
I know what I'm talking about.

189
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,140
[Noel] <i>As creating the perfect colourâ¦</i>

190
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,380
I judge the correct browning by eyesight.

191
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,580
<i>â¦is the only way</i>
<i>to obtain the distinctive flavour.</i>

192
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,380
[Giuseppe] The trick with this,

193
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,460
is to take it out
when it's lightly golden.

194
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,980
Because it'll keep cooking.

195
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,380
[Noel] <i>Judging the exact moment</i>
<i>to turn off the heat is critical.</i>

196
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,100
So, this is looking amber, and
amber means, "Get ready to rumble

197
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,740
'cause caramel's coming." [chuckles]

198
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,860
[Noel] <i>Take things too farâ¦</i>

199
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,300
Literally, could be seconds.

200
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,100
<i>â¦and the caramel will be bitter.</i>

201
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,660
[Crystelle] You can really
taste a burnt caramel.

202
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,380
[Chigs] Worried my caramel's
gone too dark.

203
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,980
Let's just see what happens.
I don't want to do it again.

204
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,900
[JÃ¼rgen] I think we are pretty close.
I'll add the cream.

205
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,220
I'm going in.

206
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,620
[Crystelle] It's high fat, high sugar.
Oh, yeah.

207
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,900
[laughs]

208
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,020
[Noel] That caramel looks delish.

209
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,340
It has gone a bit dark.

210
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,380
Paul will match it
to the back of his hand.

211
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,060
-[both chuckle]
-It's the perfect colour.

212
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,900
-Perfect tan.
-That's how he tans himself with caramel.

213
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,980
[both laugh]

214
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,220
The wasps love him.

215
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,900
[Matt] <i>With plenty of butter addedâ¦</i>

216
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,740
Would you like to go for a swim in that?

217
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,900
<i>â¦it's now the baker's</i>
<i>flavours that come into play.</i>

218
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,340
The smell of the hazelnuts
is just phenomenal. I love it.

219
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,180
[Crystelle] This is miso paste.

220
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,700
It's like a fermented bean paste.

221
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,180
âª <i>Yummy, yummy</i> âª

222
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,380
Caramel custard, done.

223
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,820
Ready to go.

224
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,300
Right, let's get this tart out.

225
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,740
[JÃ¼rgen] It's very puffed up, but I think
it's just the top layer of the pastry.

226
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,820
[Matt] <i>Now the bakers</i>
<i>split into two different camps.</i>

227
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,420
[Crystelle] Yum, yum, yum.

228
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,620
[Matt] <i>Crystelle, Giuseppe and Chigs</i>
<i>are ready to layer and chill their tarts.</i>

229
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,620
Look at this.

230
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,820
This is a moment, a key moment.

231
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,340
This is my nemesis.

232
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,260
-Evil Caramel.
-Evil Caramel.

233
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,460
Wasn't there a villain
in <i>The Smurfs</i> called Caramel?

234
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,780
[Matt] <i>But Lizzie, George</i>
<i>and JÃ¼rgen still have elements</i>

235
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,180
<i>to bake inside their pastry cases.</i>

236
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,420
[JÃ¼rgen] The caramel needs
to bake for half an hour

237
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,700
so I need to get the tart
in as quickly as possible.

238
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,980
We're baking the custard
in the tart for 40 minutes,

239
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,420
which will leave me 20 minutes
to finish off and cool.

240
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,780
Which is a bit worrying.

241
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,580
[Crystelle] These are my
little decorations.

242
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,980
[Noel] <i>While some</i>
<i>have time to finesseâ¦</i>

243
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,660
I've never seen a man
cut liquid with scissors before.

244
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,780
There you go. There's always a first.

245
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,380
<i>â¦JÃ¼rgen, Lizzie and George</i>
<i>must juggle getting their tarts bakedâ¦</i>

246
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,500
[George] The custard
shouldn't be rock hard,

247
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,980
it needs to have a bit of wobble.

248
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,380
<i>â¦while still allowing</i>
<i>enough time to cool.</i>

249
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,620
Then it's got to set.

250
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,500
[Noel] <i>But there's a big worry</i>

251
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,300
<i>when it comes to baking</i>
<i>egg custard in a hurry.</i>

252
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,580
I hope it hasn't curdled.

253
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,300
[Noel] <i>The wrong oven temperatureâ¦</i>

254
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,860
Dropped the oven from 180 to 120.

255
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:06,140
<i>â¦risks the egg protein curdling</i>
<i>and ruining the desired silky texture.</i>

256
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,460
[Lizzie] Should've just done
the set custard.

257
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,740
How much time do we have left?

258
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,380
Bakers, you have 11 onions,
some butter and six loo rolls.

259
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,860
-Is that your shopping list?
-Oh, sorry.

260
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,700
Bakers, you have half an hour.

261
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,940
-What do you think of this jiggle?
-Coming out now.

262
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,420
-Yeah, that looks good.
-[Lizzie] Goin' out.

263
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,540
[Crystelle] Come on, hon,
you're gonna do it.

264
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,620
[George] It needs to cool.

265
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,700
It's probably 120, 130 degrees.

266
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,220
Everything now depends
on getting things cooled in time.

267
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,380
[Matt] <i>With half of the tent's tarts</i>
<i>only just going in to chillâ¦</i>

268
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,780
Oh, my God.

269
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,340
-<i>â¦the other group of bakersâ¦</i>
-[Chigs] It's set now.

270
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,580
<i>â¦are one step ahead.</i>

271
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,260
[Crystelle] I'm just doing stars
in different sizes and shapes.

272
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,100
How come she's piping already?

273
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,780
The cake is still in the freezer.

274
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,700
[George] If it doesn't cool in time,

275
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,460
the double cream's just
gonna melt like a puddle on top.

276
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,060
Bakers, you only have
five minutes remaining.

277
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,100
[George] Still hot.

278
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,460
Well, you have to bite the bullet.

279
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,820
It looks wonderful.
It is still quite warm.

280
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,060
[George] Bloody curdled.

281
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,060
It's never looked like this.

282
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,700
I can tell it's curdled.

283
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,300
[Lizzie] The cream is melting.

284
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,180
It is still quite hot.

285
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,260
[George] Come on,
this must have cooled down by now.

286
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,540
Bakers, you have one minute left.

287
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,420
[Lizzie] Oops. It's a lake of cream.

288
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,900
I think this was a bad idea.

289
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,460
[Chigs] Come on. There you go.

290
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,100
I just wanted it to be simple,
but effective.

291
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,860
Don't tell anyone,
this is our little secret.

292
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,620
I don't even know
if I've got enough cream left.

293
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,500
Come on.

294
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,180
[Noel] Bakers, your time is up.

295
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,860
Please place your caramel tart
at the end of your work station

296
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,900
and chill.

297
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,940
What, they should chill
or they should chill the tart?

298
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,340
Either. [laughs]

299
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,340
[George] I've got curdled custard,
melted cream.

300
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,820
[Lizzie] This is finesse.
Paul, eat your heart out. [chuckles]

301
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,500
Look, this is all nice and smooth.
Why did it curdle?

302
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,720
[Matt] <i>The bakers'</i>
<i>sharing caramel tarts</i>

303
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,600
<i>will now face the judgment</i>
<i>of Paul and Prue.</i>

304
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,300
-Hello, Lizzie.
-Hello!

305
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,220
Hey, Lizzie.

306
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,700
This is "My Tart Will Go On."

307
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,900
Erm, like <i>Titanic,</i>
it was a disaster movie.

308
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,860
The cream melted.

309
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,260
-[laughs]
-[Prue] It does look rough and ready.

310
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,060
It's the piping that you've lost.
Probably with the heat from underneath it.

311
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,060
-That's one crispy base.
-[cracking]

312
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,300
Mmm.

313
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,460
Well, you might not
have managed the finesse.

314
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,260
Flavour is delicious.
And it's definitely a caramel tart.

315
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,180
I think if you could have just had time

316
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,020
to finish it properly,
you'd have a little triumph here.

317
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,620
Thanks for the lifeboat anyway.

318
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,020
I'll throw a life jacket as well.

319
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,820
The caramel
is absolutely delicious with that base.

320
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,260
It's a shame it looks like that.

321
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,340
Still, I love it. Finesse, it's not.

322
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,780
I like the look of it.
The pipework's good.

323
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,860
And the sides look neat.
Good colour as well.

324
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,980
-So far, so good.
-[sighs] Good God.

325
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,820
[Prue] Mmm.

326
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,140
Quite treacly. The caramel.
So, it's slightly bitter.

327
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,340
But having said that,
because you've got the apple

328
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,740
and the nuts and the cream,
it balances it out.

329
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,900
-[Prue] I think it's lovely.
-[Paul] Good job.

330
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,420
-Looks lovely.
-It's very neat.

331
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,980
[Paul] Yeah,
it's good decoration on top of that.

332
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,580
[Prue] Thank you.

333
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,140
-Chigs, it's too strong for me.
-[Paul] Yeah.

334
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,620
Too heavy on the chocolate,
almost too much caramel.

335
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,620
-I know it's a caramel tart.
-[Chigs] Right.

336
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,660
-The caramel is too dark.
-[Chigs] Okay.

337
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,740
The ginger is coming through,
it's delicate,

338
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,340
the pastry's a little bit thick.

339
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,620
I think you've taken
the caramel a little too far.

340
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
Oh, fair enough.

341
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,500
[Paul] It's beautiful, very thin.
And I love the hazelnuts.

342
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,580
[Prue] That pastry is so crisp.
The caramel is a little liquid.

343
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,740
Funnily enough, though it's quite liquid,
the textures are wonderful.

344
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,900
-I think it's overall a little too sweet.
-Right.

345
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,180
We wanted caramel to be the hero flavour.
It's not. It's the hazelnut.

346
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,380
Okay.

347
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,420
There have been issues with cooling.

348
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,980
It's a pity, because we did ask
for a beautifully decorated tart.

349
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,820
Obviously, the first thing
you see about that is the split.

350
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,180
[Paul chuckles]

351
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,139
It's gonna rip
every tooth that was in my head.

352
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,940
What you made is nut toffee.

353
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,700
-It's too chewy.
-[Prue] Not your best, JÃ¼rgen.

354
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,339
-Great flavour.
-Thank you.

355
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,859
But not quite what we asked for.

356
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:40,020
Looks like global warming in the Arctic.

357
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:42,900
-[George] Cooling time didn't work out.
-[Prue chuckles]

358
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,180
That is very nice thin crust.

359
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,660
Custard looks
as if it's just curdled a little bit.

360
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,380
[Paul] The custard's definitely curdled,
and that caramel,

361
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,220
'cause it's on the warm custard,
it just remains liquid.

362
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,700
Not getting a huge amount of flavour,
which is annoying.

363
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,500
The glory of caramel custard
is the smoothness.

364
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,700
Once you curdle it, you've lost
the thing that it's famous for.

365
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,740
-I like the base.
-It's all about the base.

366
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,940
[Prue chuckles]

367
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,180
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thanks very much.

368
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,260
-I like it all. And I like you.
-Thanks, that means a lot.

369
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,820
[George] I knew the custard was curdled.
I could see it.

370
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,660
Couldn't really get the flavours as well.
So, not a good morning at all.

371
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,500
-[indistinct chattering]
-[Lizzie] No finesse, again.

372
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,660
Flavour, no finesse.

373
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,700
There is no doubt that the judges
have stepped up a gear.

374
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,260
It's a sign
that the competition is getting serious.

375
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,540
[thunder rumbling]

376
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,420
[Noel] <i>The bakers were able</i>
<i>to practise their caramel tarts,</i>

377
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:45,020
<i>but have no idea what caramel conundrum</i>
<i>awaits them in the Technical Challenge.</i>

378
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,820
Hello, bakers.

379
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,340
Today your Technical Challenge
has been set for you by Paul.

380
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,820
Paul, any words of advice?

381
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,220
[Paul] You'll recognise this recipe,
and it's pretty straightforward.

382
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,180
So, we expect perfection and not excuses.

383
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,540
Okay, as ever, the Technical Challenge
will be judged blind.

384
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,300
We're gonna have to ask
these two to skip out of the tent.

385
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,380
Off you pop.

386
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,460
They're actually going
bra shopping for Paul.

387
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,580
-That's nice they can do that together.
-It's nice, isn't it?

388
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,980
For your Technical Challenge today,
Paul would love you to make ten identical

389
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,700
caramel biscuit bars.

390
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,580
Each biscuit bar should consist
of a crumbly, buttery shortbread finger

391
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,020
topped with thick caramel
and coated with chocolate.

392
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,940
You have an hour and a half.
Doesn't sound long enough.

393
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,700
-On your marksâ¦
-Get setâ¦

394
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,740
Bake!

395
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,820
[Giuseppe] The recipe looks sparse.
This is all we have.

396
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,020
That's it.

397
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,740
I think we all know
what this is, secretly.

398
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,660
It's a family favourite,
but I don't do well with those.

399
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,420
I've never attempted
to make the recipe.

400
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,020
The shop-bought thing
is perfect as it can be.

401
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,220
[chuckling] So what's the use of it?

402
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,980
We're looking for ten identical
chocolate caramel shortbread biscuits.

403
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,140
You've got shortbread caramel on the top

404
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,340
-and you cover it in chocolate.
-Perfect.

405
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,460
Making a shortbread,
the clue is in the name: short.

406
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,180
So you've got to add everything together,
but not overmix it.

407
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,700
If you fold it that extra bit,
it goes like rubber.

408
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,180
The caramel has to be just on the top.
Not going down the sides.

409
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,620
[Paul] Traditionally, it's on top.

410
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,100
You've got to allow the caramel
to set to a point.

411
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,260
You go too high,

412
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,980
-it'll set like toffee.
-[Prue] Toffee.

413
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,580
[Paul] If you do too less,
it will just run off.

414
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,660
-Mmm.
-[Paul] It's delicious.

415
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,340
The caramel is soft but not hard.

416
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,260
It's got a bit of substance to it.

417
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,780
-Have you ever tried it in tea?
-[Prue] Not with chocolate on it.

418
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,500
Mmm.

419
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,420
The first line is,
"Make the shortbread dough."

420
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,460
That's it.

421
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,380
So I've got the caster sugar, butter.
I'm gonna put my egg in.

422
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,740
I'm just mixing my flour in by hand.

423
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,060
You want the shortbread
to be snappy, buttery and crumbly.

424
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,980
You get better control
if you do it by hand.

425
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,820
[exclaims] Right. Come on!

426
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,020
Do you eat biscuits
like the one you're making?

427
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,940
Sometimes. Yeah. If I want, like,
a sugary pick-me-up.

428
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,700
A sugary pick-me-up
would be a good slogan for this.

429
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,940
Should we do an advert?

430
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,140
When you want a sugary pick-me-up,

431
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,340
[hesitating] have one of these shortbread

432
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:24,740
crumbly fingers. With caramel
on top and chocolate coating

433
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,460
that we can't name,
but you know what they are.

434
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,420
You see them in shops
in golden wrappers.

435
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,340
[chuckling]

436
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,020
[JÃ¼rgen] That's should be good.

437
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,980
"Roll the dough into a rectangle
and place in the loaf tin."

438
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,940
The thickness of the dough
should be pretty consistent.

439
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,660
[Lizzie] It's a bit sticky actually.

440
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,860
If I just press it in
to make the tin shape.

441
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,300
And now, we're gonna put me dough
in the freezer to chill.

442
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,060
-[timer beeping]
-Gonna put it in for five minutes.

443
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,980
Let's see what happens.

444
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,580
We're just gonna sum up the bakers
in a very concise way.

445
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,660
Check this out.

00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,700
Princess Leia, dressed as
a children's bullfighter.

451
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,660
-[chuckles]
-Wow!

452
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,980
Never come here again.

453
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,700
-[Noel laughs]
-That's it.

454
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,020
-[Noel] That's it. My work's done.
-[laughs]

455
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,380
[Noel] They all hate me now.

456
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,020
[Lizzie] That's chilled
for about 15 minutes.

457
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Next step is bake.

458
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,500
I'm going in.
So I'll check after 15 minutes.

459
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,780
Right. I'm going to set it
for ten minutes, initially.

460
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,860
Twelve minutes to start off with.

461
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,420
[sighs]

462
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,900
[Noel] Hi, Giuseppe.
Me and Matt are a bit overworked.

463
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,660
-We're a bit tired today soâ¦
-Aww!

464
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,060
Maybe you could do the time?

465
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,260
-Can you do it in Italian?
-Yeah, which one?

466
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,460
That we're halfway through.

467
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,460
[speaking Italian]

468
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,580
[laughing]

469
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,900
I'm gonna move on, I think.
Make the caramel.

470
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,860
The dreaded caramel.

471
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,780
The hard stuff.

472
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,620
I'm looking for amber, but not too dark.

473
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,500
Not happy with that colour.

474
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,420
We're getting there.
I want it to be a full-bodied caramel.

475
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,660
Like a nice glass
of red wine. [laughs]

476
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,580
Now, what I'm gonna do is add the cream.

477
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,700
I'm gonna start doing some funny business,
fog up me glasses.

478
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,580
Thinking to add the butter now.
It needs to get harder.

479
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,140
[Crystelle] Lovely.
I'm going to take that off.

480
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,820
If it's too hot,
it then turns into toffee

481
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,220
and Paul's teeth will fall out
when he eats it.

482
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,580
[George] Just a bit worried
about my caramel.

483
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,180
Don't know if I've done the right thing.

484
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,140
[Chigs] Just checking it.

485
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,580
No, a couple more minutes. [grunts]

486
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,340
Two more minutes.
I don't want undercooked biscuits.

487
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,500
[timer beeping]

488
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,740
Think this is ready now.
It's getting a nice

489
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,860
golden colour.

490
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,860
This is definitely the colour
of shortbread.

491
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,380
[JÃ¼rgen] That should be it.

492
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,860
Starting to get a bit darker at the edges.

493
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,780
That looks good.

494
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,100
Just want it
to cool down a little so I can cut it.

495
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,340
[Giuseppe] If they want perfection,
they should be exactly the same size.

496
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,740
Which is not gonna be easy
'cause this is 18 centimetres.

497
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,500
So I have to cut them at
one point eight centimetres each.

498
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,780
I hope that just broke
in the right place.

499
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,460
[Giuseppe] One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

500
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,780
That did not break
in the right place. [sighs heavily]

501
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,420
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

502
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,700
I'm gonna have to just try
and pipe the caramel.

503
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,220
The caramel needs to be
liquid enough to be pipeable,

504
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
but stiff enough to stay up.

505
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,980
Just about the right consistency.

506
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,140
[George] Mine won't come through.

507
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,740
It's not pipeable.
I'm gonna try and soften it up again.

508
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,260
[Giuseppe] Oh, this is definitely
of pipeable consistency.

509
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,860
[Lizzie] No finesse again.
Just got to roll with it.

510
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,860
[George] Let's see if that works.

511
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,780
[Crystelle] I'm running out of caramel.

512
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,060
Oh, oh, just one more. One more push.

513
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,460
-Sounds like I'm a midwife. [laughing]
-[Noel] Yes.

514
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,020
It's hot.
No, why does this happen to me?

515
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,900
[sighs wearily]

516
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,260
This is a flipping nightmare.

517
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,500
Nightâ¦mare.

518
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,100
I would start melting the chocolate now.

519
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,300
I'm thinking about
how to do the coating.

520
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,740
I thought of dipping.

521
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,340
But the caramel layer
is too delicate for pour it over.

522
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,860
Mmm. Is it just the top that needs
to be coated? I don't know.

523
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,340
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

524
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,020
[Crystelle] Stress, stress, stress.

525
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,340
[Giuseppe] This is gonna get messy.

526
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,700
-Phew.
-[Chigs] I'm just gonna pour on top now.

527
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,900
[Crystelle] I feel
like it's all gonna just fall off.

528
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,020
[George] Awful challenge.

529
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,660
[Giuseppe] It's dripping everywhere.

530
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,940
Well, these are gonna be
the worst home-baked biscuits.

531
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,980
They're not even.

532
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,500
[George] We've lost some biscuit
in this one.

533
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,900
[gasps] I hate these.

534
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,060
Bakers, you have one minute left.

535
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,020
[screams]

536
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,340
Right, cardigan is coming off.

537
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,780
There needs to be a zig-zag, right?
I'm panicking.

538
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,660
-You can do this, kids.
-Can we really?

539
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,620
-[Lizzie] Not gonna get perfection again.
-[gasps]

540
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,220
Plating up.

541
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,420
Oh, oh, oh.

542
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,580
Oh, this caramel
has fallen off my biscuit.

543
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,900
Put that one at the end.

544
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,260
Bakers, your time is up.

545
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,660
[George] I'm screwed.

546
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,820
[Matt] <i>Paul and Prue are expecting</i>
<i>ten identical shortbread biscuit fingers,</i>

547
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,460
<i>topped with caramel</i>
<i>and coated in chocolate.</i>

548
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,820
<i>And they have no idea</i>
<i>whose bake is whose.</i>

549
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,220
We'll start with these.

550
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,620
They are quite neat
and they're all pretty uniform.

551
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,700
There's a little pattern
across the top.

552
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,380
-Nice and slim. I quite like it.
-[Paul] Yeah.

553
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,940
[Prue] The caramel is lovely.
But I think the biscuit is a little soggy.

554
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,540
But it's neat enough.
And the flavour's there.

555
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,620
Last-minute rush job. They're a mess.

556
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,060
[Prue] There's too much chocolate
in the middle, and not enough at the end.

557
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,540
[Paul] Biscuit's a bit soggy again.
Caramel's dropped down on one side.

558
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,500
[Prue] We wanted the caramel
just on the top.

559
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,060
[Paul] The flavour's there.

560
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,980
-[Prue] Right.
-[Paul] Moving on to this mess.

561
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,340
[Prue] This one is not finished at all.

562
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,540
Watch yourself, Prue.

563
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,420
[grunts]

564
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,300
That'll take your teeth out.

565
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,820
-[Paul chuckling]
-[Prue chuckling] So hard!

566
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,380
[Paul] That's basically toffee.

567
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,140
-Not a biscuit.
-Textures are all wrong.

568
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,780
Moving on.

569
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,380
-A bit messy.
-[Prue] Doesn't look great, does it?

570
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,620
[Paul] It cut quite well.

571
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,660
Very soft again.

572
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,580
-[Prue] It's too soft.
-[Paul] The flavours are good.

573
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,420
These are pretty uniform.
They have a pattern.

574
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,380
-Wow, there you go.
-[Prue] Mmm.

575
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,300
-That's quite a good biscuit.
-[Paul] Hmm. Got a nice caramel.

576
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,940
They got all the elements,
but it's just not neat.

577
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,860
Right. Okay.

578
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,660
[Prue chuckles]

579
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,380
-Good luck.
-[Paul] Ah, there's one.

580
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,740
-Soft biscuit.
-It's going to be a very soft biscuit.

581
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,580
[Paul] Caramel all around the edges.

582
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,660
It's gone quite rubbery, that biscuit.
And they look a bit of a mess.

583
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,740
Although there are some
decoration on the top.

584
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,620
Okay.

585
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,980
[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue will now</i>
<i>rank the caramel fingers</i>

586
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,700
<i>from worst to best.</i>

587
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,540
In sixth place

588
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,700
is this one. George.

589
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,900
You took your caramel
to a brick-hard toffee,

590
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,180
and you didn't really finish.

591
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,780
In fifth spot, we have this one. Lizzie.

592
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,740
Bit of a mess.

593
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,940
-And the shortbread was like bubble gum.
-Oh, yeah.

594
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,260
[Noel] <i>Crystelle is fourth,</i>
<i>and Chigs is third.</i>

595
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,940
And in second placeâ¦

596
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,900
And we have this one.
Who's that? JÃ¼rgen? That was you.

597
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,100
They look very good.
And the biscuit's nice.

598
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,660
Just not perfect.

599
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,780
-So in first place.
-[Crystelle] Yay.

600
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,820
-I wouldn't clap.
-[all laughing]

601
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,780
[Paul] Erm, the overall look
was pretty good.

602
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,140
The biscuit is a bit soft,
but overall, yours ticked the most boxes.

603
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,740
-I'll take that.
-Yeah, well done.

604
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,580
That was another surprise.

605
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,340
Certainly, getting first is a boost.

606
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,580
However, Paul did say,
"I wouldn't clap." [laughs]

607
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,140
They looked a bit uneven
and that got me second place.

608
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,980
But I'm happy with that.
It feels better than this morning.

609
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,540
I don't think
that could have gone any worse.

610
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,140
I've had a terrible day.

611
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,300
I just want to produce
a good Showstopper,

612
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,100
and just show that I can produce
something that's not toffee.

613
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,460
Gonna do my best.

614
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,300
[Matt] <i>The bakers now have</i>

-Good luck, everyone.

616
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,820
<i>â¦in which to impress the judges.</i>

617
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,660
Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your Showstopper challenge.

618
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,980
The judges would like you to create

619
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,140
a visually spectacular
caramel-flavoured dessert,

620
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,460
complete with an exquisite
sugar-work dome or sphere.

621
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,460
[Noel] The style of dessert
is entirely up to you,

622
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:14,140
but it must have at least one baked
element and two caramel components.

623
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,940
You have four and a half hours.

624
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,820
Enough time to attract every donkey,
fly and wasp in the vicinity.

625
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,100
-[Matt] On your marksâ¦
-[Noel] Get setâ¦

626
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,340
Bake!

627
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,940
Here we go. Here we go.

628
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,060
The sugar dome is going to be
the headache of the whole thing.

629
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,660
Head down, happy thoughts, good vibes.

630
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,140
Highly decorated Showstoppers
for me are the best thing,

631
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,380
and the fact
that it's married up with caramel,

632
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,540
this should taste and look amazing.

633
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,020
Just to make it more difficult,
we've asked them to encase the whole thing

634
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,460
in a dome of sugar.

635
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,420
Who would ever, in their spare time,
make a sugar dome?

636
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,220
It's a specialist skill which you don't
really expect most bakers to have.

637
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,300
But of course, these are great bakers.

638
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,380
We do expect them
to be able to work with sugar.

639
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,860
Sticky, sticky.

640
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,660
Traditionally, it'd be made
with caramelised sugar,

641
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,980
but they can use isomalt
which is actually more stable.

642
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,020
[Prue] The most important thing
is you should be able to see through it.

643
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,620
Thinner and the clearer, the better.

644
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,940
I'm not expecting failures.

645
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,820
Like hell I'm not.

646
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,900
-[Paul] Hi, Chigs.
-Hi, Paul. Hi, Prue.

647
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,620
What are you doing
for your caramel dessert?

648
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,900
Mine is called "The Caramel Mistake,"
because every time I made it,

649
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,380
-I can't stop making mistakes.
-Right, okay. Good start.

650
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,980
So, my sugar dome, I went through
two kilos of sugar at home

651
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,100
-and I couldn't get one out.
-How many times did you do it?

652
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,980
I think it was sixteen times in total.

653
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,300
And then I learned
about this lovely stuff.

654
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,540
-[Noel] Is that isomalt?
-It's isomalt, worked first time.

655
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,900
[Noel] <i>Chigs' dome will showcase</i>

658

The first time I did it,
it didn't set properly.

659
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,980
I added an extra sheet of gelatin

660
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,940
to make sure it sets.

661
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,260
-You started last year?
-Yeah.

662
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,540
-So you're learning on the job?
-[Chigs] Yeah, like an apprenticeship.

663
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,820
-[Paul] Well, good luck, Chigs.
-Thank you, guys.

In practice, it has turned out very hazy.

669
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,580
I've got a couple of tricks
to make it more transparent.

670
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,860
I'm not sure if they will work.
I'll do my best.

One element is a caramel.
Another element is a hazelnut praline.

692

And then I've got a caramel bavarois.

693

I've got a shortcrust bottom.

748
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:17,140
So, er, I'm doing a bowl
and then I'm filling everything inside.

749
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,580
[Paul] This sounds like a trifle.

750
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,860
-It's a hodgepodge of desserts.
-It is, yeah.

751
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,900
It's called
"Roses Really Smell Like Caramel."

752
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,100
-And people get flowers all the time.
-[all chuckle]

753
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,460
-And I'd rather get cake.

[Matt] <i>Whilst Lizzie needs to refine</i>

[Crystelle] My late granddad, Greg,

765
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,100
the day before
he suddenly passed away,

766
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,980
he randomly bought a cactus
and he left in the porch of our house,

767
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,860
and then he passed away,
sadly, the following day.

768
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,420
But that cactus is still in our house,
and it is humongous.

You're not going anywhere, mate.

784

-they are halfway through.
-[Noel] You're halfway through.

786
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,940
Noel, you have told the Bakers
they were halfway through.

787
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,220
Thank you, Matthew.

788
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,380
I'm starting to build my cake.

789
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,700
I'm setting things, then I put
more things together, then I set things.

790
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,340
[Matt] <i>With so many elements to makeâ¦</i>

791
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,740
This is my second batch of caramel.
Ready for the mousse.

792
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,900
<i>â¦the bakers need their layers</i>
<i>to set quickly.</i>

793
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,940
Adding the gelatin now.

794
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,820
[Matt] <i>And so most are opting</i>
<i>for that notoriously tricky ingredient.</i>

795
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,700
These are gelatin sheets
for the coffee mascarpone cream,

796
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,780
so it sets properly.

797
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,540
[Matt] <i>But gelatin</i>
<i>can go spectacularly wrong.</i>

798
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,940
It's quite tricky because you don't
want to have a layer of jelly,

799
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,420
'cause that's kind of gross.

800
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,580
[Matt] <i>Add too much,</i>

801
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,940
<i>and meticulously-made elements</i>
<i>can turn to glue.</i>

802
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,420
I'm settling somewhere in the middle,
hopefully that'll be okay.

803
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,620
I'm adding
the Bavarian layer to my charlotte.

804
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,940
It is already quite set.

805
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,020
There ya go.

806
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,180
[Crystelle] That is now gonna
chillax a little bit.

807
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,820
[Noel] <i>As well as perfectly-set dessertâ¦</i>

808
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,380
[Giuseppe] Okay, another thing done.

809
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:20,060
<i>â¦the bakers require an exquisite finish</i>
<i>to take their bakes from the everydayâ¦</i>

810
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,980
So this is what you call a mud pieâ¦

811
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,980
<i>â¦into the extraordinary.</i>

812
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,220
â¦but I'm going to turn this now
into a mirror glaze

813
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,820
with the addition of cream and sugar.

814
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,700
[Noel] <i>But a set glaze</i>
<i>means reaching for the gelatin once more.</i>

815
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,500
[Chigs] Ugh! This didn't happen
in the practice.

816
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,900
Thisâ¦ This jellyness.

817
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,780
Gonna pour it in
and see what happens.

818
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,580
This doesn't look good.
Put the gelatin in too quick.

819
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,540
Didn't read my instructions, did I?

820
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,980
This isn't right.

821
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,020
[motor struggling]

822
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,020
I flippin' hate caramel.
I'm gonna start again.

823
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,540
You here for the money shot, Noel?

824
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,900
Desperately trying
not to make a weird joke about that.

825
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,060
-[laughs] Yeah.
-[Noel laughs]

826
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,340
It's like molasses, it's so deep.

827
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,580
Gonna be able
to see your face in that?

828
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,820
-[Crystelle] Can you see yourself?
-Yeah. High-five!

829
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,540
-Yeah, man. Thanks.
-Good luck.

830
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,300
-[Giuseppe] Very sticky.
-[Chigs] Let's do round two.

831
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,940
Now do you know why
I call this the "Caramel Mistake"?

832
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,020
-[Matt] Hello, JÃ¼rgs!
-Hi, Matt.

833
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,340
JÃ¼rgs? What do people call you?
Do you have a nickname?

834
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,220
-No.
-JÃ¼rgchon.

835
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,820
-No.
-Erm, JÃ¼rg-ella? JÃ¼rgie?

836
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,460
Endless variations.

837
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,220
No one even calls you JÃ¼rgs?

838
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,540
As a German,
I don't understand this English thing

839
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,660
of putting an "s" at the end of a name.

840
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,460
Like, er, Matts.

841
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,820
Yeah, "Matts" doesn't really work. Matts.

842
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,340
[Chigs] That's more like it.

843
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,140
[Crystelle] Now it all comes to life
without a dome.

844
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,660
Can you tell them roughly
how long they've got?

845
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,860
Bakers you've got half an hour.

846
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,660
-I said "roughly."
-Oh, sorry.

847
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,740
[hoarsely] Bakers, you got half an hour.

848
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,780
Ah!

849
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,380
-[Chigs] George, you good?
-I think so, man. Sugar dome.

850
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,020
This is the scary bit.

851
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,980
I'm doing the stinking sugar dome.

852
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,220
[Matt] <i>Domes are created</i>
<i>by pouring isomalt or sugar</i>

853
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,620
<i>over moulds of various kinds.</i>

854
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,620
Weirdest thing I've ever done ever.
Dry a balloon.

855
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,020
I'm using the technique
with cling film over bowl.

856
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,620
[Matt] <i>Most of the bakers</i>
<i>have chosen the more stable isomalt.</i>

857
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,260
It just needs to be something
below 130.

858
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,260
[Matt] <i>But in hope of a clearer domeâ¦</i>

859
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,900
You think I'll get any points
for using sugar as opposed to isomalt?

860
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:43,020
<i>â¦George has taken</i>
<i>the risky decision to use pure sugar.</i>

861
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,300
I'm gonna keep my cool.

862
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,820
I'm gonna pour this into my dome
which I've lined with cling film.

863
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:54,780
[Matt] <i>Paul and Prue will be looking</i>
<i>for a flawlessly transparent dome.</i>

864
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:58,740
It's probably gonna be an imperfect dome,
but aren't we all imperfect?

865
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,660
And that's what I'm gonna tell
Paul Hollywood.

866
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,540
[Matt] <i>The thinner the sugar,</i>
<i>the clearer the dome.</i>

867
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,420
[Chigs] Double-dip
to make it a bit thicker.

868
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,940
It's like a crystal ball.
See the future, wow!

869
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,860
-You get through to next week.
-Whoa! [chuckles]

870
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,340
[Noel] <i>But this brittle substance</i>
<i>is fickle.</i>

871
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,260
Now I need to hold this for ten minutes.

-[groans]

873

<i>â¦and the slightest pressure</i>
<i>will cause it to crack.</i>

874
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,820
Very hit-and-miss in practice.

875
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,340
[Noel] <i>But pouring the dome</i>
<i>is only the beginning.</i>

there's a lot of cracking going on.

881
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,340
[JÃ¼rgen] I think the sugar is set.

882

Oh.

883
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,660
[Lizzie] Let's pop the balloon, then.

884
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,140
Let's hope it doesn't shatter
when I take it out.

885
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,300
Good God.

886
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,380

Beauty. Get in there.

891
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,140
Look, it's not not usable.

892
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,980
[Lizzie] I didn't like the drips of that.

893
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,140
How much time do we have?

894
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,780
Bakers, you have 15 minutes remaining.

895
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,620
-I'm gonna do it again.
-I'm gonna do another balloon.

896
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,580
Because the drips aren't even enough
and he's gonna be like, "No finesse."

897
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,780
I'm pretty pleased with it.

898
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,420
My dome is very hazy now.

899
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,180
If you warm it with a blowtorch,
it can get more transparent.

900
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,340
[JÃ¼rgen] Actually, it's perfect.

901
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,220
[Chigs] Could have been clearer,
but it's done.

902
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,940
-[laughs]
-Right. Dome number two.

903
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,220
[Lizzie] Gonna get "finesse"
tattooed on me.

904
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,780
Next is the final decoration.

905
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,780
-[JÃ¼rgen] Put my mango flower on.
-[Crystelle] Oh, there's a crack.

906
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,300
I think it's gonna break again.

907
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,220
Think I'm gonna have to start again.

908
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,740
Stressy, stress, stress.

909
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,700
[Lizzie] That looks well better.

910
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,500
-[Crystelle gasps] Yes! You did it.
-[exclaiming softly]

911
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,660
-How's yours going, Crystelle?
-I'm on my third one.

912
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,460
-Third?
-I'm gonna go for more isomalt.

913
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,580
[Noel] Come on, Crystelle,
you can do this.

914
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,780
Well, that'sâ¦ Yeah, that hasn't worked.

915
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,020
[hoarsely] Bakers, ten minutes left.

916
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,180
[Crystelle] Lizzie, how hard
is the balloon technique?

917
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,060
-[Lizzie] Start melting your isomalt.
-Yeah.

918
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,060
Crystelle, dome number seven.

919
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,340
[laughs]

920
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,420
So I'm gonna try the balloon technique
which I've never done in my life.

921
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,100
I'm gonna make it really thick.

922
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,900
-[Lizzie] Roses are a bit burnt.
-Five minutes until this is set

923
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,580
and I've got eight minutes
left of the challenge.

924
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,540
Ugh, I'm gonna be sick. [chuckles]

925
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,180
-[Giuseppe] Putting the dome in place.
-[George] Please don't break.

926
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,180
Bakers, you have five minutes remaining.

927
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,300
I think we're gonna
have to just pop it, aren't we?

928
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,060
[Lizzie] Just cut the bottom.
Can't get water on the thing.

929
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,420
[muttering indistinctly]

930
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,140
[Giuseppe] Final finishing touch.

931
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,700
[Chigs] Caramel layer
beginning to ooze out.

932
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,980
[Lizzie] Here you go, you peel it off now.

933
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,220
That's fine. You know what? That's okay.

934
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,260
Lizzie, you're the best person
in the world.

935
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,980
-Oh, my God!
-You've got to put it on the cake.

936
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,060
I have to do it now? I'll do it now.

937
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,540
Oh, my God, no.
No, no, no, no. [laughs]

938
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,500
[Noel chuckling] Is it stuck?

939
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,660
Oh, my God. No, no, no.

940
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,220
-Why did I do this?
-[Lizzie] Yeah, I can't.

941
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,700
That was like watching Charlie Chaplin.

942
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,700
"I've done it. I've made it.
I'll just put it in this sticky bowl."

943
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,540
Justâ¦ Okay.

944
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,460
Bakers, you will be relieved
to know your time is up.

945
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,900
You've gotta leave itâ¦ You've gotta do.

946
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,580
[Noel] Hands up, who's having
a heart attack on behalf of Crystelle?

947
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,940
[laughs]

948
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,140
Group heart attacks, everyone?

949
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,300
Oh.

950
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,240
[Matt] <i>It's judgment time</i>

951
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,880
<i>for the bakers'</i>
<i>show-stopping caramel desserts.</i>

952
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,160
Crystelle, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

953
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,200
What happened to the bowl?

954
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,160
It was a bit of
a last-minute rush at the end.

955
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,040
I ended up going with the balloon method

956
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,800
so I did it while it was quite warm.
It was gonna be bigger.

957
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,920
I like the look of the chocolate.
You got a lovely glaze on that chocolate.

958
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,040
-That looks lovely.
-[Prue] That's very beautiful.

959
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,560
I love the flavour.

960
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,280
-Sort of salted caramel chew.
-The biscuit layer is okay.

961
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,520
The chocolate layer on the top's
just too thick.

962
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,520
And your mousse is quite dry.

963
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,960
A mousse should be
like bubbles on the mouth.

964
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,760
-It's quite stodgy. Gelatin?
-Yeah.

965
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,680
-[Paul] Too much.
-It's a bit too much. Look, it's gluey.

966
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,480
So overall, I quite like the flavour,
even though it is rich.

967
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,840
You couldn't eat a lot of that,
but it looks lovely.

968
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,240
Thank you. I'll take that.

969
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,080
JÃ¼rgen, I think it looks
most spectacular.

970
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,200
I love the sponge fingers.

971
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,680
The isomalt looks really thick.

972
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,360
You've got quite a heavy collar here,
but the dome itself looks beautiful

973
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,200
'cause it's absolutely crystal-clear.

974
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,760
-Love the flower in the front.
-[Prue] Looks really good.

975
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,400
[Noel] Oh!

976
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,640
Oh, you are a piece of work.

977
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,800
-[Paul] Cut into it.
-[Matt] Oh, look at that.

978
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,640
[Prue] Gosh, that looks beautiful.

979
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,760
-Wow.
-[Matt] Wow!

980
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,120
[Prue] That looks so lovely

981
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,480
because the bavarois
are the same thickness.

982
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,360
The caramel at the bottom
and the pastry is really thin.

983
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,480
That's delicious.

984
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,640
Absolutely. Every layer
from the shortbread to the bavarois,

985
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,040
all the way to the top.

986
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,040
The passion fruit.

987
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,880
The praline, the lady's fingers.
The whole thing's beautiful.

988
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,240
-It's nice to have you back in the tent.
-Thank you very much.

989
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,680
-JÃ¼rgen, it's an absolute triumph.
-Thank you.

990
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,640
-Can't resist another.
-[Paul] Well done, thank you very much.

991
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,800
-[Matt] Well done.
-Smashed it.

992
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,520
-Lovely shaped dome. Very misty.
-Yeah.

993
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,360
[Paul] Looks like
a greenhouse in the winter.

994
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,560
[laughing]

995
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,960
Apart from that,
it's very elegant and neat.

996
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,920
[Noel] Oh, come on.

997
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,680
[all exclaiming]

998
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,640
-There's so much caramel.
-[Prue] Certainly tastes of caramel.

999
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,400
Actually, it's not too much.

1000
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,120
Something's slightly wrong
about the textures.

1001
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,960
The glueiness of the glaze
is a little unpleasant.

1002
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,640
[Paul] Your mousse is all wrong,
it's like a wallpaper paste.

1003
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,200
And it's heavy and stodgy and dry.
The glaze is too gluey.

1004
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,760
-Put gelatin in there?
-I did. Yes.

1005
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,160
[Paul] Probably a bit too much.

1006
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,160
However, it does taste lovely.

1007
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,400
-Looks a mess, doesn't it?
-[Chigs] Yeah.

1008
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,400
[Paul] You've had a bit of leakage
and nothing's set.

1009
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,080
-Doesn't look the right colour.
-[Chigs] No.

1010
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,120
[Paul] It's too light.
The isomalt's too misty.

1011
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,720
It's a shame 'cause you can't see
the chocolate work inside.

1012
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,040
Let's take it off.

1013
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,360
-I mean, that looks a lot better already.
-[all chuckle]

1014
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,480
-[Paul] Ooh, look at that.
-[Prue] Thank you.

1015
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,360
I love the even layers. Really nice.

1016
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,360
The caramel wasn't taken
as far as it could've been,

1017
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,200
which is why it's poured out.
Your dacquoise is nice.

1018
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,400
It works with the coffee flavour.

1019
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,960
I think the flavour
is absolutely delicious, Chigs.

1020
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:39,000
Definite caramel, chocolate is just there.
The praline is delicious.

1021
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,760
It's just all a bit liquid.

1022
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,920
It's such a pity
'cause it's so nearly perfect.

1023
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,800
-Yeah.
-Thank you, Chigs.

1024
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,280
[Chigs] Cheers, guys, thank you.

1025
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,280
Well, straight off the cuff
it looks amazing.

1026
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:08,440
I like what you've done with that dome,
considering it's made from sugar.

1027
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,520
That's difficult.
It's a nice-looking cake.

1028
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,000
-George, I think it's beautiful.
-Thank you.

1029
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,480
[Paul] This is gonna be
difficult in sugar.

1030
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,200
-Oh, perfect.
-[Prue] Perfect.

1031
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,760
Boom.

1032
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,680
-[groans]
-[Prue chuckles]

1033
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,360
-[Matt] Wow!
-[Noel] Mmm-hmm.

1034
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,200
-I could eat a lot of that, George.
-[sighs]

1035
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,200
It's a little too dry for me.

1036
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,320
You've got dry chocolate ganache,
dry dacquoise,

1037
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,240
then you got a little thin layer
of buttercream,

1038
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,760
and then you have dacquoise again.

1039
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,880
It needed a mousse or a bavarois
rather than just buttercream.

1040
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,200
The taste is nice, but the textures,
for me, are too dry on the mouth.

1041
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,000
[Prue] I know what you mean,

1042
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:53,120
but I actually think that if you get
a mouthful of everything, it's delicious.

1043
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,200
And I think you've done a really good job.

1044
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,400
-Thank you very much, George.
-Thank you.

1045
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,440
[whispering] Well done, George.

1046
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,920
Well, it looks amazing.

1047
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,720
As always with your bakes,
it's surprising and witty.

1048
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,520
-I like it.
-We asked for finesse.

1049
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,840
I think we've got it.

1050
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,800
You've done an upside down dome,
which is unusual and brave.

1051
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,600
Let's have a look, shall we?

1052
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,440
[sighs] How am I gonna do this?

1053
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,760
-I think I'm gonna need a spoon.
-[laughs]

1054
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,720
I have never had sage caramel before.

1055
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,160
-What do you think?
-The flavour's very strong.

1056
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,320
To be very honest, Lizzie,
it doesn't look great inside there.

1057
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,440
-It's a bit rough and ready.
-[Paul] It's just like a trifle.

1058
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,920
You've got literally just a mess
of everything going on.

1059
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,440
You've mashed it with the flowers.

1060
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,000
[Prue] Funnily enough,
Paul says it's like a trifle.

1061
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,200
It would be better
if it had a ton of custard in it,

1062
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,920
because it's quite stodgy.

1063
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,080
The roses are not great to eat,
and it's very sweet.

1064
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,080
I've never had anything like it before.

1065
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,600
-[Prue] I think it's very brave.
-Yeah, very brave.

1066
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,400
-Thanks, Lizzie.
-Ta.

1067
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,320
-Finesse.
-Finesse.

1068
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,720
The tables have turned,
so now I'm all style and no substance.

1069
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,880
He likes the flavours.
He loved the way it looked.

1070
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,880
He just thought it was a bit dry.

1071
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,560
Whether it's enough, I don't know.

1072
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,680
I don't know who's gonna go home,
or who's gonna get Star Baker.

1073
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,200
You know, I think we're
all pretty on edge, actually.

1074
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,560
Definitely think
this is the tightest week. 100%.

1075
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,720
Well, I think that the bakers will be glad
to see the back of caramel week.

1076
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,040
-It's been really good in parts.
-Nice to see JÃ¼rgen come back.

1077
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,640
I think the one that deserves a little pat
on the back was George for using sugar.

1078
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,720
[Matt] He could've come in today
and said, "I'm beaten,"

1079
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,000
but he came in
and really did himself proud.

1080
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,440
Is it enough to save him?

1081
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,840
And Lizzie, I have to say,
has not done herself proud.

1082
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,560
The whole thing was sort of inedible.

1083
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,400
Does this mean Lizzie
is near the bottom now?

1084
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,400
It's her or George isn't it?

1085
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,240
George has been struggling over the first
two challenges. He's built himself up.

1086
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,920
And Lizzie's sort of dropped down.
Don't think he's on his own anymore.

1087
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,280
I was a little bit upset
about Giuseppe's as well.

1088
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,440
That was really gelatinous.

1089
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,160
He's still got a good chance
of being Star Baker

1090
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,920
'cause he did do so well
in the other two.

1091
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,600
I think Crystelle is in line
for Star Baker

1092
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,760
'cause she had not had a bad week.

1093
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,160
JÃ¼rgen's had a pretty good week.

1094
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:35,040
He did come second in the Technical,
and I think he's done really well today.

1095
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,840
[Matt] So let's talk about Chigs.

1096
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,600
I thought he did very well
in his Chignature.

1097
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,480
Chigs got better every challenge
from Signature through to Showstopper.

1098
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,680
At the end of the day,
I think you've got two people in trouble

1099
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,800
and the other four in line for Star Baker.

1100
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,200
Well done, bakers.
That was a tricky week. Caramel.

1101
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,760
And I've got the amazing job of announcing
who is Star Baker this week.

1102
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,280
And the person
who's Star Baker this week isâ¦

1103
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,560
JÃ¼rgen.

1104
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,760
[all clapping]

1105
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,320
You're back, JÃ¼rgy-pops,
you're back.

1106
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,040
-JÃ¼rgy-Popsy back.
-[all laugh]

1107
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,840
And I have the unenviable task
of telling you who's going home

1108
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,760
and what I will say is that
it was really close this week.

1109
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,320
Could have been one of two people.

1110
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,560
The person who's going is someone
we've all grown very close to

1111
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,880
and we're all gonna miss a lot.

1112
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,280
I'm afraid that the person
going home this week isâ¦

1113
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,440
George.

1114
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,960
-[Crystelle murmurs]
-It's all right, guys.

1115
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,080
There is bittersweet to it.

1116
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,080
My Showstopper, I was proud of.

1117
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,760
-[Paul] I just think you ran out of steam.
-Yeah, I know.

1118
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,480
It is very sad to see George go.

1119
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,960
But, unfortunately, George
made more mistakes than Lizzie did.

1120
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,600
Speaking to my family,
they're just so proud

1121
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,360
that I've managed to kind of
even get in the tent.

1122
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,680
So, yeah, week seven. I'm fine with that.

1123
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,520
Well done, JÃ¼rgen. Well done.

1124
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,160
I thought actually JÃ¼rgen did enough
to win Star Baker today.

1125
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,080
[Prue] JÃ¼rgen was back
to his old self, wasn't he?

1126
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,960
It was honestly one of the best desserts
I've ever tasted and I want the recipe.

1127
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,800
-[Lizzie] How many is that now?
-[Crystelle] How many Star Bakers?

1128
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,520
-[JÃ¼rgen] Three Star Bakers.
-[Crystelle] Good God!

1129
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,880
-[woman] <i>Hello darling. How are you?</i>
-Hello.

1130
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,760
Yes, Star Baker again.

1131
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,440
<i>-No way!</i>
-[JÃ¼rgen] Yes.

1132
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,520
<i>-Oh, amazing.</i>
-Yeah.

1133
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,800
[Crystelle] Caramel!

1134
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,640
We've got five of the strongest
bakers this year going through.

1135
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,160
Quarter final? What the hell?

1136
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,040
Yeah, it does feel all of a sudden
like we are in a serious competition now.

1137
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:59,080
[Paul] <i>Going into next week</i>
<i>is going to be a little bit different</i>

1138
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,960
and, I think, very difficult.

1139
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,960
[closing theme music playing]
