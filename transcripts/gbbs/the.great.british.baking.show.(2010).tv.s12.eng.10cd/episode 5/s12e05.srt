We're just here for the ride. [chuckles]

37

<i>-Viel GlÃ¼ck.</i>

39
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,240
But on a show like this you would say,

40
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,520
<i>Hals- und Beinbruch,</i> which means
"break a leg and break your neck."

-Oh, good God!
-That's brutal. [chuckling]

[all laughing]

43
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,480
There's certainly a bit of pressure
being here in German week as a German.

44
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,040
You might argue JÃ¼rgen is in a favourable
position because of his heritage,

45
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,120
but it's a competition
at the end of the day,

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,960
so I'll give it my best shot.

47
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,240
German week,
I don't usually bake German stuff

48
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,640
but we'll see how it goes.

49
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,200
If it goes like my GCSE in German
then I'm out of here.

50
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,080
Good morning, bakers!
Welcome back to the tent.

51
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,360
Now, this week is a first.

52
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,880
It is German week.

53
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,880
And we can reveal
the Star Baker is JÃ¼rgen!

[Crystelle laughing]

55

It is German week,
and it's your Signature Challenge

56
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,440
and the judges would love you to make
two batches of 12 German biscuits.

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,240
Your two batches
should be exquisitely finished

58
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,920
and dipped, coated or decorated.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,440
You have two hours, 15 minutes.

60
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,280
-On your marks!
-[sing-song] Get set!

<i>Backen.</i>

62
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,160
[Chigs] All right, let's go.

63
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,960
Doing 24 biscuits in just over two hours
is quite difficult.

64
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,440
I don't know what I'm doing.

65
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,040
I'm just baking a biscuit
I think is relatively German.

66
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,920
[chuckles] But we'll see.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,880
One of the most important things
about German biscuits

68
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,080
is that they're
usually produced for Christmas.

69
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,880
So people take a lot of trouble
about the decoration,

70
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,440
so they are intricately iced.

71
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,000
What we want
are two different types of biscuit,

72
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,320
one with butter, shortbread type biscuits
which are very crumbly.

73
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,760
And one with ground almonds
that creates a macaron-style biscuit

74
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,800
which is crispy on the outside
and slightly chewy on the inside.

75
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,920
I wouldn't like them to step
too far away from the original.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,200
They might change the flavour,
they might change the icing,

77
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,720
but they should still be recognisable
as German biscuits.

78
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,640
I think a lot of bakers are going to be
watching JÃ¼rgen to see what he does.

79
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,280
But I think they need
to concentrate on their own game.

80
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,760
[birds chirping]

81
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,880
It's time to get fingers dirty. [chuckles]

82
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,280
[Noel] <i>For their first batch,</i>

83
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,240
<i>most of the bakers have chosen</i>
<i>a shortbread-style biscuit.</i>

84
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,800
Shortbread should be quite crumbly.

85
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,720
Erm, I think the key
is not to overwork it.

86
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,960
If you overwork the dough, the biscuit
becomes really tough and not short.

87
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,839
[Noel] <i>And whilst</i>
<i>the technique may be familiar,</i>

88
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,760

There is a bonus to him being here.

96

Apart from the fact
he's going to get Star Baker.

97
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,240
Star Baker already

You would think biscuits
are relatively easy,

129
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,160
but we got two batches to make,
they have to be highly decorated,

130
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,560
so time, as usual,
is not working in our favour.

133
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,680
I'm just weighing them out
so they're sort of somewhat the same.

134
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,040
To be honest, I am just winging this.

135
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,600
[Lizzie] It's quite a sticky dough,

136

so I just find it easier
to use a cheesecake thing.

00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,280
[Lizzie] I don't know whether
to pipe on eyelashes and lips.

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,800
Or if that's going to be too wacky.

152
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,960
They don't seem
to like my colourful wackiness. [laughs]

153
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,440
[exhales] It's getting hot in here.

154
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,440
[Noel] <i>Working with a butter-rich</i>
<i>shortbread dough in a hot tentâ¦</i>

155
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,160
The fact that I'm shaking doesn't help.

156
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,000
<i>â¦means the bakers will need</i>
<i>extra resting time before baking.</i>

157
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,680
[gasping]

158
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,520
[Amanda] If you put it in the oven
at room temperature,

159
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
it will just spread out,

160
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,480
so if you put it in the freezer,
get it really cold, it'll hold its shape.

161
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,960
[Noel] <i>But Crystelle</i>
<i>has a different strategy</i>

162
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,200
<i>for ensuring her biscuits</i>
<i>will retain their shape in the oven.</i>

163
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,560
[Crystelle] So these are brown butter
shortbread, that'll chill for 15 minutes

164
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,400
and then I'm gonna bake them
like this and cut out rounds,

165
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,240
I find it's the best way
to get them uniform.

166
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,840
How do you ensure
that it's all equal in there?

167
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,680
In height. You're gonna
get a thick biscuit and a thin biscuit.

168
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,520
Erm, I'm using a little cake scraper
just to kind of scrape that across.

169
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,480
And I'll say a little prayer
and hope they're all the same height.

170
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,640
[Matt] <i>Crystelle is aiming for</i>
<i>12 perfectly round shortbreads</i>

171
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,360
{\an8}<i>which she's flavouring</i>
<i>with cardamom and pistachio</i>

172
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,520
{\an8}<i>and decorating with spun white chocolate.</i>

173
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,800
Small state of panic now,
because there isn't a lot of time

174
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,360
and these should be
in the freezer already.

175
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,080
[Matt] <i>And Crystelle isn't the only one</i>
<i>racing to rest their biscuits.</i>

176
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,480
[George] I've got to get my skates on.

177
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,120
[Matt] <i>George's biscuits have</i>
<i>an intricate embossed design,</i>

178
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,720
<i>which could lose definition in the oven</i>
<i>if not chilled for long enough.</i>

179
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,000
Really, you need to let them
rest for like ages, like 24 hours.

180
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,600
I don't have that time.

181
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,360
[Matt] <i>Not only do George's</i>
<i>embossed aniseed biscuits</i>

182
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,919
{\an8}<i>require a lot of resting time, once baked,</i>
<i>they're traditionally left to mature</i>

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,679
{\an8}<i>to achieve their characteristic</i>
<i>honeycomb texture.</i>

184
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,880
So it might be a bit softer
than it would be in two days' time.

185
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,800
Maybe not the best biscuit choice
in the tent, but I like 'em.

186
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,200
-We'll see. Thanks.
-[George] All right.

187
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,320
Thanks, guys!

188
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,720
-You can speak German?
-Yeah!

189
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,360
-Why don't you do the time call--
-Okay, all right, I will. Here we go!

190
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,360
[in German accent]
Bakers, you're halfway through!

191
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,240
-And that's German, is it?
-[normally] Yeah.

192
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,560
[Noel] <i>The first set of biscuits</i>
<i>might be restingâ¦</i>

193
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,760
Right. Next.

194
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,280
<i>â¦but there's no respite for the bakers.</i>

195
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,120
When one biscuit dough's chilling,
you move onto your other biscuit dough,

196
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,160
and while that's baking,
you do something else, and it's nonstop.

197
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,480
Need to keep moving.

198
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,120
[Matt] <i>For their second batch, the bakers</i>
<i>have all chosen almond-based biscuits.</i>

199
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,320
[JÃ¼rgen] This is actually
very simple to make

200
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,160
because it's just
a paste of almond, sugar and egg white.

201
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,320
It's grim, innit? It's sticky dough.

202
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,040
[Chigs] This one's pure marzipan.
They're called almond horns.

203
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,720
I'm going to infuse this with orange.

204
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,480
I'm always told
they can't taste my flavours.

205
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,560
I'm gonna ramp it up a little bit more.

206
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,920
[Matt] <i>With the zest of three oranges,</i>

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,800
{\an8}<i>Chigs is hoping to pack a punch</i>
<i>with his Marzipan horns,</i>

208
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,760
{\an8}<i>which he'll decorate with spun chocolate</i>
<i>and flaked almonds.</i>

209
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,600
So I've never ever
tried these biscuits before.

210
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,880
It's supposed to be crunchy outside
with a very chewy interior.

211
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,360
I want to make sure
you can taste the orange.

212
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,080
With the amount of zest you put in there,
no doubt we will.

213
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,040
[laughs]

214
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,720
[Matt] <i>Also giving her</i>
<i>almond biscuits a fruity twist is Freya.</i>

215
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,840
I've added in some glace cherries.
A bit like a cherry Bakewell.

216
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,760
So it's kind of like a British version.

217

{\an8}[Matt] <i>Inspired by</i>
<i>the Christmas classic cinnamon stars,</i>

<i>of intricately decorated vegan meringue.</i>

220
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,920
These are going in for 15 minutes.

221
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,880
[Chigs] Right. Let's go!

222
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
[Matt] <i>With such a short bake timeâ¦</i>

223
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,280
I'm putting 'em on for ten minutes.
To start with. That should be okay.

224
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,520
<i>â¦the bakers have a small window</i>

225

226
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,880
What are you doing now?

227
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,200
I'm going to measure out some jam
and mix it with the marzipan.

228
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,160
-That sounds like baking to me.
-Yeah.

229
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,040
-That sounds like German baking.
-Proper German baking.

230
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,160
-[Noel] Come on.
-Yeah.

231
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,920
You've got this.
Not as much as JÃ¼rgen, but you got it!

232
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,120
[Amanda] That's going to be
the mulled wine jam.

233
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,280
Mulled wine is my favourite drink
when I go skiing.

234
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,800
And that sounds like I'm really good,
but I'm the worst skier on the planet.

235
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,440
So I normally drown my sorrows
with a couple of glasses of GlÃ¼hwein.

236
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,080
{\an8}[Noel] <i>Amanda's aprÃ¨s ski-inspired jam</i>

239
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,800
It is delicious.
If nothing else, you'll like the jam.

240
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,680
No, we're planning
on liking everything, Amanda.

241

Hopefully, they'll come out okay.

244
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,920
In fact, I hope they come out perfect.

Are you excited for German week?

250
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,080
Nope. Why would you
be excited for German week?

251
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,880
I'd be excited for German week
because I was raised by a German family.

252
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,840
-Was you?
-[Noel] Yeah.

253
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,520
-In a forest in Munich.
-In a forest?

254
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,960
I say family. It was a family of wolves.

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,400
[Freya] I'll just put the icing
on the burned bits, that's fine.

295
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,160
How long have we got now?

296
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,760
Bakers, you have one minute left.

297
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,880
Oh, God.

298
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
[exhales]

299
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,480
[Amanda] Ugh! Gosh.

300
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,560
I can hear the <i>Bake-Off</i>
"rushing" music in my head.

301
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,560
[JÃ¼rgen] Wonderful.

302
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,640
[Lizzie] They're cheeky and they've
just been found out doing something.

303
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,560
[Giuseppe] It is Christmas. It's snowing.

304
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,280
[JÃ¼rgen] Messy. Messy, messy.

305
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,200
Bakers, your time is up.

306
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,000
[exhales]

307
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,440
[JÃ¼rgen] Chocolate isn't setting.
But it was not a surprise in this heat.

308
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,280
[George] Don't worry about that.

309
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,320
[Amanda] Oh, I've got one missing.

310
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,900
[Noel] <i>The bakers' two batches</i>
<i>of German biscuits</i>

311
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,020
<i>now face the judgment of Paul and Prue.</i>

312
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,740
{\an8}[Prue] They all look lovely.

313
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,780
[Paul] Let's start with
the orange and strawberry, shall we?

314
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,060
[Prue] That is beautifully done.
Really beautiful.

315
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,940
[Paul] The orange
in the shortbread is delicious.

316
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,820
Blends beautifully with the strawberry.

317
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,300
And the spice that you've got in there,
it's just perfect. Right.

318
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,660
Coffee and pecan, eh?

319
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,220
They're going to be lovely, I'm sure.

320
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,180
Unusual and delicious.

321
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,660
And the pecan, that nuttiness
that it brings to the coffee is perfect.

322
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,340
-Really lovely.
-Thank you.

323
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,500
Thank you.

324
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,180
{\an8}[Paul] They look very nice.

325
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,660
[Prue] Let's see if they taste
half as good as they look.

326
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,820
[Crystelle] I have done
brown butter shortbread

327
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,500
with pistachios and cardamom.

328
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,460
I love the flavour.
It's quite unusual, too.

329
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,940
The second biscuits
are hazelnuts and orange zest

330
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,740
with a chocolate hazelnut filling.

331
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,140
So delicate, the orange. It's just right.

332
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,740
The amount of chocolate is perfect.
You've got that chew in the middle.

333
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,260
They're really interesting.
Beautifully made.

334
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,740
-Think they're a triumph. Well done.
-Thank you. [sighs in relief]

335
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,780
[Chigs] So that's a vanilla shortbread

336
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,260
with raspberry jam and a disk of marzipan.

337
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,580
And the bottom ones are purely marzipan
with some orange.

338
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,900
[Paul] Your textures are beautiful.

339
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,140
-The marzipan you get, but can't taste.
-[Chigs] Okay.

340
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,740
[Prue] This one is nice and chewy
in the middle, crisp on the outside.

341
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,580
-Very good orange.
-[Paul] Your flavours are good,

342
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,860
but it's a shame
we didn't get marzipan coming through.

343
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,780
-But good job.
-Thank you.

344
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,780
{\an8}[Prue] I just love your cheeky girls.

345
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,860
I mean, their little astonished mouths

346
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,780
and eyelashes going out the side
is just beautiful.

347
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,820
[Paul] It needed
slightly longer in the oven,

348
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,740
because it looks like raw paste.

349
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,300
The flavour with the cinnamon,
with the apple, is delicious.

350
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,060
The jam is spectacular.

351
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,020
I like the colour of these,
but they're all over the place.

352
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,580
I think they're a bit too big.

353
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,060
For me, there's too much chocolate.

354
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,700
If you manage to avoid the chocolate,
the almond flavour is delicious.

355
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,380
[Paul] If you'd made them half-size,
bake them properly,

356
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,660
you'd have been getting a handshake.

357
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,300
So if I'd just done it
completely different.

358
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,860
-[Paul] Yeah.
-[all laughing]

359
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:28,419
{\an8}I think the mulled wine biscuits are nice,
all 11 of them.

360
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,139
The orange and chocolate one,
it's lost its definition.

361
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:40,340
The biscuit tastes beautiful.
It's such a delicate, buttery biscuit.

362
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:42,860
-Let's have a look at these.
-[Noel] These are called hearts, Paul.

363
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,379
-Most normal people have them.
-[Prue chuckles]

364
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,620
-Never seen one before.
-[Noel chuckles]

365
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,860
-This is an astonishingly good biscuit.
-[Amanda] Thank you.

366
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,500
Biscuit is very short and buttery
and delicious.

367
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,180
The jam is sensational.

368
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,380
I mean, it really is worth every calorie.

369
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,660
-Thank you so much.
-[Paul] Thank you very much.

370
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,580
{\an8}[Prue] I think that's lovely.

371
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,820
What's so good is that the kirsch
and the cherry acidity

372
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,420
makes the whole thing lighter.

373
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,180
And these ones should be quite crisp.
Is that right?

374
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,220
[George] They should be
crispy on the outside.

375
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,180
As they age,
they get crispy on the inside too.

376
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,260
-I mean, it's tough.
-[George] Yeah.

377
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,260
It's so tough,
it's offering me out for a fight.

378
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,300
But I love the flavours of both.
You've done really well.

379
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,540
I question whether that was
the right choice to use on this challenge.

380
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,740
I completely agree.

381
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,740
-[Prue chuckles]
-[Paul] But well done.

382
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,780
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

383
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,980
It's not supposed to be like that.
The bottom of the biscuits stuck.

384
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Well, they're certainly chewy, Freya.
And they're delicious.

385
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,860
[Paul] Let's try this Christmas pud,
shall we?

386
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,820
I love the flavours.
But it is certainly overbaked.

387
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,980
-Yeah, yeah.
-[Prue] It is overbaked.

388
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,940
Fruit has got a bit burnt.

389
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,380
But the flavour's lovely.
Especially the lemon.

390
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,900
I think they look lovely.

391
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,180
You've got some uniformity here,
which I like to see.

392
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,900
I think they do look very nice.

393
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,180
I can't add anything to that.
I think they look absolutely perfect.

394
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,300
-Let's try the star one first.
-[JÃ¼rgen] Yep.

395
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,740
-I flavoured them with Earl Grey tea.
-[Prue] Tea?

396
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,940
-It really comes through nice and strong.
-[Paul] Mmm. Yeah.

397
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,140
Really like it. Right.

398
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,460
[Prue] The horns. Shall we do the horns?

399
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,300
The coffeeâ¦
You can smell the coffee, can't you?

400
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,540
That is the crumbliest,
buttery-est biscuit

401
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,940
I think I've ever eaten,
it is just perfect.

402
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,220
Thank you.

403
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,380
That's delicious.
I think you've done well there, JÃ¼rgen.

404
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,940
[contestants applauding]

405
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,260
[JÃ¼rgen] Thank you.

406
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,420
-[Paul] Good job.
-Wow. [laughs]

407
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,020
It was pretty overwhelming,
judging and a handshake.

408
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,100
I nearly started to cry right there.

409
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,220
Underbaked. I don't know.

410
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,220
Should I really trust Paul?

411
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,460
Because I done them
for 15 minutes yesterday

412
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,380
and JÃ¼rgen said they were overbaked.

413
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,300
So I done them for 12 minutes today,
and Paul's saying they're underbaked.

414
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,700
I think JÃ¼rgen's right. Just saying.

415
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,460
[Matt] <i>While the bakers</i>
<i>could practise their Signature bakes,</i>

416
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,300

417

418
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,620
Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.

419
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,380
It's time for your Technical Challenge,

420
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,940
which today has been set for you
by the lovely Prue.

421
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,460
Any words of wisdom?

422
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,580
Don't panic and try to be methodical.

423
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,900
As ever, the technical challenge
will be judged blind,

424
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,820
so we're gonna have to ask these two
to sling their hooks. Off you pop.

425
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,460
[in cockney accent]
Yeah, go and put your feet up.

426
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,620
Don't worry about us.

427
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Oh, you must be exhausted
coming here for 30 seconds,

428
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,020
eating a load of biscuits.
I don't know how you do it.

429
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,980
[Noel laughs]

430
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,380
Now, for your Technical Challenge,

431
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,260
Prue would love you
to make Prinzregententorte.

432
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,260
Which is basically Prince Regent cake.

433
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,060
[normally] Your cake should be comprised
of eight thin layers

434
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,740
of light German genoises.

435
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,460
Sandwiched with a smooth chocolate cream

436
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,620
and coated with a shiny chocolate ganache.

437
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,780
Your torte should be regally decorated

438
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,580
with rosettes
and tempered chocolate crowns.

439
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,700
[Noel] Very regal.
Have you met anyone from the royal family?

440
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,220
-Yeah. Ralf Little.
-[all laugh]

441
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,700
You have two hours, 45 minutes.

442
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,580
-On your marks.
-Get set.

443
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,020
Bake.

444
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,420
I ain't got a Scooby Doo.
I've never heard of this cake before.

445
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,620
I'm making something
that I can't even pronounce. [chuckles]

446
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,820
Prinz-regen-ten-torte.

447
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,180
[mumbles]

448
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,180
Ask JÃ¼rgen.

449
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,900
Prinzregententorte.

450
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,060
So, Prue. Prinzregententorte.

451
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,700
Basically, it's eight layers of genoises

452
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,020
sandwiched together
with a chocolate custard,

453
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,540
covered with really smooth, shiny ganache.

454
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,300
Well, I think it looks great.
It's highly effective.

455
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,420
And I think the temperatureâ¦
I think today being quite warm

456
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,140
will only be really affecting
the tempered chocolate.

457
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,940
Should be all right as long
as they chill things down in stages.

458
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,420
[Prue] They ought to be able to get it
perfectly straight on the sides

459
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,500
because they're putting it into a tin
to layer it up.

460
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,940
-[Paul] Let's have a look inside.
-[Prue] Yeah. Let's have a look.

461
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,820
I always love these layered cakes 'cause
they're so exciting when you see inside.

462
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,060
[Paul] The layers
look beautiful and stark,

463
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,740
and you can see the chocolate custard
in there all the way through.

464
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,940
[Prue] And it's the right proportion
of custard to cake, isn't it?

465
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,100
-They're about equal.
-[Paul] Let's see how it tastes.

466
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,140
It's delicious. Almost melts on the mouth.

467
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,580
But then you get that
light chocolate come from the inside

468
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,380
and that little bit
of dark chocolate ganache on the outside.

469
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,020
I think it's a great cake
to make on German week.

470
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,100
And I can't wait to see
how JÃ¼rgen deals with this.

471
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,700
[Matt] Hello, JÃ¼rgen!

472
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:01,460
So I'm assuming that you're
the only person to have made this before.

473
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,020
I haven't made one, I haven't eaten one.

474
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,700
-I can loosely remember how it looks like.
-Oh, you haven't even eaten one?

475
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,180
That's a waste of being German.

476
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,460
[JÃ¼rgen] Yeah, it's terrible.

477
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,780
[Noel] <i>The first step in Prue's recipe</i>
<i>is to make the genoise sponge batter.</i>

478
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,660
We have to make a meringue first, it says.

479
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,980
[Freya] I don't want the egg whites
to be like overly whipped.

480
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,580
I'm thinking sort of, like,
soft, stiff peaks.

481
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,340
I'm folding the meringue
into the egg yolk mixture.

482
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,620
You got to be gentle when folding,

483
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,740
because if you knock all the air out,
sponge is not gonna rise when you bake it.

484
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,580
I sound like I know
what I'm talking about, don't I?

485
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,220
"Spoon the batter into circles
on prepared baking sheets."

486
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,580
[Matt] <i>If the bakers are to achieve</i>

487
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,820
<i>the consistent thin layers</i>
<i>of sponge that Prue is expectingâ¦</i>

488
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,340
[groaning] Don't do that, Freya.

489
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,180
<i>â¦then the batter must</i>
<i>be portioned out with precision.</i>

490
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,500
[Giuseppe] Want to have all
the eight sheets in front of me.

491
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,140
Give it a bit of consistency so
the layers are all the same height.

492
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,100
I want it to be not thicker
than five millimetres.

493
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,540
'Cause if there's eightâ¦ Gonna be
about a centimetre thick each?

494
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,860
Probably shouldn't have been
wasting precious mixture

495
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,300
to glue my things down.

496
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,500
Butâ¦ I think it'll be all right.

497
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,820
Batch-bake until you have eight sponges.

498
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,140
There were three shelves in the oven.
So we can bake three layers at a time.

499
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,420
Up here for thinking,
down there for dancing.

500
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,140
[George] Great!

501
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,340
Go! Where's the timer? Quick!

502
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,940
There's no timing in there or anything.
I'm gonna go in for 10 to 15 minutes.

503
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,420
Seven minutes
and I'll swap the top and bottom

504
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,100
and another three minutes after that.

505
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,260
[Crystelle] I'm gonna bake one
to gauge the time.

506
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,300
I don't know if that's right,
but I'm going with it.

507
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,460
There's a look of Frank Zappa about you.

508
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,300
Yeah, Frank Zappa/Einstein?

509
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,860
I can see the sort of
Einstein thing, definitely.

510
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,420
-Fair enough.
-Yeah!

511
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,340
-[Matt] Yeah, there you go!
-[laughing]

512
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,180
-You've been a bit of an Einstein here.
-Have I?

513
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,060
That was a beautiful segue, come on!

514
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,420
-I hope you're applauding at home.
-[chuckles]

515
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,260
[Noel] <i>With such thin layers</i>
<i>of delicate genoise spongeâ¦</i>

516
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,260
Er, no, not yet.

517
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,980
<i>â¦a perfect bake</i>
<i>demands absolute precision.</i>

518
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,660
[Freya] I'm just popping a skewer in
to see if it comes out clean.

519
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,260
[Matt] <i>Underbake even slightly,</i>

520
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,700
<i>and the sponges won't hold</i>
<i>their shape when assembled.</i>

521
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,580
Let's take out this bad boy
and see how he's doing.

522
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,100
He kinda looks like a pancake.

523
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,300
[Matt] <i>But overbake</i>
<i>and they'll be dry and brittle.</i>

524
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,180
Give it one more minute.

525
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,540
I think I'm ready to take these out.

526
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,020
Let's take that one out.

527
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,100
[Amanda] My first three are
coming out now. It's a little bit rubbery.

528
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,900
It might be okay.

529
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,140
[Noel] <i>With two more</i>
<i>batches to bake and coolâ¦</i>

530
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,060
Second batch. In.

<i>â¦the genoise production line</i>
<i>continues in earnest.</i>

532
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,260
Oh! Golly gosh!
That's not what we want to see, is it?

533
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,300
Three sponges have come out
and three sponges have gone in.

534
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,060
Ermâ¦ Two more to spread out.

535
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,940
[George] I'm a little bit short on batter.

536
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,060
I'm still hopefully gonna
have enough to make do.

537
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,580
Maybe someone on the radio can tell me
how long the bakers have got left.

538
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,460

-[radio static crackling]

544
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,660
[Matt in woman's voice] <i>I was watching</i>

<i>-Noel Fielding is an absolute--</i>
-That's enough of that.

546
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,420
[Crystelle] I'll take
my last two sponges out.

547
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,340
Sponges done.

548
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,940
Look at that! It's so thin it could almost
pass for a poppadum.

549
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,100
-There's a bit of a variation here.
-Oh!

550
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,100
I take it back.

551
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,300
[George] I used more mix initially
and then I ran out.

552
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,300
-That's a happy accident, then.
-Yeah.

553
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,980
Now I need to make
the chocolate cream filling.

554
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,100
"For the chocolate cream,
make a chocolate custard."

555
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,660
Ay! Lots of detail in there.

556
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,260
I can pretty much make a custard, sort of.

557
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,940
[JÃ¼rgen] Same thing as vanilla custard,
just add a bit of cocoa.

558
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,220
[Crystelle] It's a bit dark but it's fine.
It's thick.

559
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,340
That's done.

560
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,100
Bakers, you have one hour remaining.
One hour!

561
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,780
These are relatively cool now.

562
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,780
Think we're going
to sort of start assembling, maybe.

563
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,700
[Matt] <i>The cooler their sponges,</i>
<i>the more chance they'll hold when stacked.</i>

564
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,380
[Crystelle] I thought my layers
would have cooled by now.

565
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,380
[Matt] <i>But the longer the bakers wait,</i>

566
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,300
<i>the less time they'll have to achieve</i>
<i>a flawless decorative finish.</i>

567
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,500
I started a bit slower to make sure one
was baked well before I did the rest.

568
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,620
I'm just going to hope for the best.
I don't think I've got time.

569
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,220
So, have I made these small enough?

570
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:35,620
I'm picking a better cooked one
for the bottom so it doesn't stick.

571
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,300
Sponge, cream, sponge, cream.

572
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,140
[Amanda] It should be a silky,
smooth filling.

573
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,740
It's not anywhere near it.

574
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,500
[sighs in exasperation]

575
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,260
It's hard to spread this flat

576
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,620
because there is a dome forming,
which isn't ideal.

577
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,900
Sponge, cream, sponge, cream.

578
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,620
Keep it equal all the way.

579
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,620
This is the last layer now.

580
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,100
And chill.

581
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,300
[Chigs] I'm gonna put it in
as long as I can.

582
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,700
We're now onto the decoration
which is the scariest part for me.

583
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,020
"Part 12: Chocolate crown shapes."

584
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,780
[Crystelle] It's the little crosses
that are so hard to pipe.

585
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,660
Giuseppe, how wide
is your stance right now?

586
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,580
-That's what giraffes do, isn't it?
-[Giuseppe chuckling]

587
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,060
When they bake.

588
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,340
Right. Ganache, ganache, ganache.

589
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,340
Does it just say
to make the ganache? Of course.

590
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,060
I know you're not supposed to, but do you
ever cast your eyes around the tent?

591
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,460
Yeah. I do like to
because sometimes Chigs is very irrational

592
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,340
and starts jumping around like a maniac.

593
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,460
Crystelle starts to talk to herself.

594
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,140
Wait, am I doing this right?

595
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,660
There's no point looking
over at JÃ¼rgen becauseâ¦

596
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,060
He's just cool as a cucumber.

597
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,380
-An average day for him, isn't it?
-Yeah.

598
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,420
[JÃ¼rgen] That looks like ganache.

599
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,860
[Chigs] That is a good ganache.

600
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,620
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left!

601
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,700
It's turning out.

602
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,660
[Lizzie] Oh, God!

603
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,300
It's just getting stressful. I'm sweating.

604
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,860
[Crystelle] Oh, why is it so wonky?

605
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,780
[JÃ¼rgen] The ganache
will cover the whole cake.

606
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,100
It's like pouring a mirror glaze.

607
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,180
I might do the edges first.

608
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,980
[Chigs] It's not bad at all.

609
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,980
[JÃ¼rgen] It's just a bit bubbly,
not perfect.

610
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,860
[George] Oh, this is so messy.
My wife would kill me if I was at home.

611
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,860
Bakers, you only have five minutes left.

612
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,780
"Using the remaining chocolate cream,
pipe 12 rosettes."

613
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,020
I overwhipped it.
I can't pipe that on there.

614
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,580
How many are we at? 12!

615
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,260
[Lizzie] Cream.

616
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,660
I'm just whipping out some plain cream
so I've got something to put on top.

617
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,860
[Crystelle] I'm gonna have to do thisâ¦
No! [chuckles]

618
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,740
What the hell? How long do I have? Oh, no!

619
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,860
Bakers, you have one minute left.

620
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,060
-[yelling quietly]
-[exhales]

621
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,460
Oh, my God! They're all going.

622
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,020
[Amanda] At least I've got something
to put the crowns into.

623
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,020
The chocolate is melting
at the speed of light.

624
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,500
[groans]

625
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,140
The crowns have melted.

626
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,540
[Crystelle, sing-song] The chocolate
is melting in my hand.

627
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,580
Well, I've done what I can.

628
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,340
Bakers, your time is up.

629
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,060
Very naughty of Prue, that was.

630
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,940
Please place your Prince Regent cake

631
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,700
behind your photograph
on the gingham table.

632
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,500
Why have we all put different cream
on top of our cakes?

633
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,220
It's supposed to be white cream.
You've all done it wrong.

634
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:40,340
[Matt] <i>Prue and Paul are looking</i>
<i>for majestic prinzregententorte</i>

635
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,620
<i>with even layers of German genoise</i>
<i>and chocolate cream,</i>

636
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,860
<i>shiny ganache and perfectly piped rosettes</i>
<i>and chocolate crowns.</i>

637
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,060
Okay. Shall we start over here?

638
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,780
[Prue] Rosettes look as if
they've melted,

639
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,260
but it's a lovely shiny ganache.

640
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,740
[Paul] Let's have a look.

641
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,300
[Prue] The layers look thicker
in the middle.

642
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,140
They're certainly a bit compressed
towards the edge.

643
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,060
-It's domed rather than flat.
-[Prue] Yeah.

644
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,220
-It does taste good, doesn't it?
-It does.

645
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,020
Erm, this is more like it, actually.

646
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,540
-[Prue] It's also flat on top.
-[Paul] Nice sides.

647
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,340
-It's got a nice chocolate flavour.
-Excellent.

648
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,420
[Paul] I like this, it's quite neat.

649
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,540
The effect is quite nice, but you could
just run a palette knife around there

650
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,660
and just straighten that off a little bit.

651
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,540
Let's have a look inside, shall we?

652
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,900
That's very nice
and mousse-y, the chocolate filling.

653
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,860
Nice texture to that sponge.
Chocolate comes through well.

654
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,900
-Ganache is lovely.
-Mmm.

655
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,740
Moving on to number four.

656
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,420
You have a nice shine on this.
Nice straight sides.

657
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,060
Although, what happened to the rosettes?

658
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,060
-It's a nice sponge.
-[Prue] Mmm-hmm.

659
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,300
-[Paul] It's well-baked.
-[Prue] It's nice and fluffy.

660
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,020
But it's got a bit of bite to it.

661
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,780
[Paul] Okay, moving on again.

662
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,060
-Quite small, this one.
-[Prue] Yeah.

663
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,180
It's either very compressed
or the layers were very thin.

664
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,220
You have a hugely thick layer,
very thin. Thin, thin, thin.

665
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,540
Big and erratic on the chocolate.

666
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,420
Tastes great though.

667
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,100
It just doesn't look as consistent
as some of the others.

668
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,500
Why is there cream on the top?

669
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,820
And there's something really
seriously wrong with theâ¦

670
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,220
ganache. It's not quite smooth.

671
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,380
[Paul] All the filling is split.

672
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,820
-Oh, yeah.
-Probably why there's cream on top.

673
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,780
-It's a bit tough as well.
-Very tough.

674
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,260
[Prue] This one's a bit wobbly.

675
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,300
[Paul] Instead of straight sides,
it is domed, isn't it?

676
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,740
[Prue] It's domed
and the outside is a bit uneven.

677
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,140
[Paul] Yep.

678
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,420
Mmm. Nice flavour.

679
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,100
[Paul] It's a shame
it looks the way it does.

680
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,340
-[Prue] Yeah.
-[Paul] Finally, the last one.

681
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,300
-[Prue] Ganache is a bit bubbly.
-[Paul] But the sides are quite neat.

682
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,140
And we're missing a few, erm, crowns.

683
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,820
-[Paul] Very equal sponge.
-[Prue] Yeah, nice sponge.

684
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,220
-That's delicious. Beautiful.
-[Paul] Mmm.

685
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,140
Ah! Interesting. Okay!

686
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,860
[Noel] <i>Prue and Paul will now rank</i>
<i>the Prinzregententorte from worst to best.</i>

687
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,420
Okay, in eighth spot we have this one.

688
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,340
Whose is this? Amanda?

689
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:23,460
You had a lot of bubbles on the top.
The inside was all split.

690
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,220
-And cream?
-Sorry.

691
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,060
In seventh spot, we have this one.

692
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,780
Crystelle, the top has melted a little bit
and it's pretty messy.

693
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,260
[Matt] <i>George is sixth, Freya fifth.</i>

694
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,380
<i>JÃ¼rgen's fourth and Lizzie comes third.</i>

695
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,500
In second spot, we have this one.
Whose is this?

696
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,900
Pretty good, Chigs.
The layers are beautifully soft.

697
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,620
-I think it looks pretty good.
-Thank you.

698
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,740
Which meansâ¦

699
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,780
[contestants clapping]

700
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,780
[Prue] Giuseppe.

701
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:56,220
The ganache is absolutely beautiful,
the sponge is lovely.

702
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,340
The layers are absolutely even.
Takes an Italian to make a German cake.

703
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,340
[all chuckling]

704
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,740
[laughs]

705
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,820
I was really, really surprised.
I was not expecting that.

706
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,180
The first placeâ¦

707
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,020
I'm not so much into chocolate cakes.

708
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,060
When I go to German cafes,

709
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,500
I usually have cream cakes
or black forest.

710
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,420
Because everyone's Signature
was so good this morning,

711
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,780
I feel like I'm treading on
thin ice now, which is quite scary.

712
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,380
There's still tomorrow.

713
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:28,380
Hopefully I'll pull it out of the bag
on the day, and everything will be okay.

714
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,760
[Matt] <i>One challenge remains.</i>

715
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,560
<i>One last chance</i>
<i>to secure a place in the tent.</i>

716
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:44,800
Hello, bakers.

717
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,640
Welcome back to the tent
for your Showstopper Challenge.

718
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:53,080
Today, the judges would love you
to make a spectacular yeast-leavened cake.

719
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,000
[Matt] Now, your cake
should be a minimum of two tiers,

720
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,480
and should be inspired
by one of the many yeasted cakes

721
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,359
that are so popular in Germany.

722
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:03,760
-Ever been to Germany, Noel?
-I have, actually.

723
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,439
Lots of times. I'm actually German.

724
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,000
-Really?
-Yeah. My dad invented the Kinder Egg.

725
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,200
-Did he?
-No, of course he didn't.

726
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,640
If he did, I wouldn't be here.

727
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,600
I would be on my luxury private yacht
as we speak.

728
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,520
[Matt] You'd have to build it yourself
first, wouldn't you?

729
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,680
Get all the pieces
and put the stickers on.

730
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,920
-[Noel] You have four and a half hours.
-[Matt] On your marks.

731
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,840
-Get set.
-Bake!

732
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,720
This is a first for me.
I've never done a yeast-leavened cake.

733
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,320
I genuinely don't know
what it's supposed to be like.

734
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,600
It's a bit like bread.
It's all about rising times.

735
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,520
-And proving.
-It's a bit of a faff, isn't it?

736
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,800
If you want to make a Victoria's sponge,
an hour, it's done.

737
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,760
This could take all day.
Or four and a half hours.

738
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,520
Traditionally, cakes as we think of them
are raised with baking powder.

739
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,880
Now, in Germany,
you do make cakes using yeast.

740
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,520
[Prue] The perfect yeasted cake
has the stretchiness of bread,

741
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,840
but it's still rich and cake-like.
It's quite difficult to get.

742
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,640
They've got four and a half hours.

743
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,080
A lot of that will be
down to proving the dough.

744
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,800
It's not a cake where you just produce it,

745
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,360
put it in the oven, bake it up.

746
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,720
But they've got to allow time
to produce a highly decorative cake.

747
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,680
What we're asking them to do
is to zizz it up,

748
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,720
make it something really festive or funny,

749
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,840
just generally over-the-top.
We want something amazing.

750
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,320
-[Paul] Morning, JÃ¼rgen.
-Morning, Paul.

751
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,800
-Hello, JÃ¼rgen.
-Morning, Prue.

752
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,120
JÃ¼rgen, will you tell us
about your yeast cake, please?

753
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:31,000
Yes. So, in Germany,
you wouldn't do a tiered yeasted cake.

754
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,680
No, we've anglicised it.

755
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,680
-[JÃ¼rgen] Yes. Yes.
-Which I apologise for.

756
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,840
It's like being asked to make
a three-tier apple crumbleâ¦

757
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,320

and it tends to slow it up a bit.

762
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,080
How are you combating that?

763
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,200
I didn't have a problem with that.

764
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,400
-No.
-Hopefully, it'll pack a punch.

-Look forward to it.
-Thank you.

He's such a liar.

794
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,760
[JÃ¼rgen] It's going to get noisy.

795
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,120
I have quite a powerful kneading method,
which is called the French Slap.

796
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,320
[Amanda] I think I'm going to take
a victim statement from that dough.

797

Violent.

798
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,480
[Matt] <i>However vigorously</i>
<i>the bakers choose to handle their dough,</i>

799
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,240
<i>kneading it is crucial.</i>

800
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,240
I want it to be, like, tacky
and, like, relatively sort of smooth.

801
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,040
[Matt] <i>But it's a tricky balance.</i>

802
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,840
[George] Doughy goodness.

803
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,240
[Matt] <i>Knead too forcefully,</i>

804
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,840
<i>and they risk a texture</i>
<i>that's more bread-like than cake.</i>

805
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,040
If you do this reasonably,
it helps creating the structure

806
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,520
within the dough that holds the air.

807
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,840
[Matt] <i>But too delicate,</i>

808
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,160
<i>and their dough will collapse</i>
<i>as it proves.</i>

809
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,440
[Crystelle] Mine is kind of
like a brioche dough.

810
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,360
I don't really over-knead it
because it ends up being really sticky.

811
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,600
But again, I just don't know
what the texture's supposed to be like.

812
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,360
So maybe I should be working a bit more.

It's the bread we're judging
and I do think brioche is the best bread.

816
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,240
It is a hybrid between bread and cake.

817
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,400
It's very difficult
and I've never had one before,

818
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,200
so I don't know
if it's just a dry cake or a weird bread,

-but hopefully you'll like it.

884
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,240
So this will go on top, we'll have
a soft, pillowy dough in the middle.

885
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,320
-Filled with fruit.
-Mmm.

886
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,880
-Soft, pillowy dough.
-Yes.

887
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,520
-You're talking like this show talks.
-[laughs]

888
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,160
"We would like a soft, pillowy dough."

889
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,600
Really? Do you really
want it to taste of pillows?

890
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,120
-Ermâ¦
-"Quite dry, quite clothy."

891
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,160
-I won't be trying your bake.
-Ermâ¦ Okay. sorry.

892

[Noel] <i>Chigs might be planning</i>

893
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,680
<i>but Freya's gambling</i>
<i>with an intentional soggy bottom.</i>

894
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,120
I'm kind of making it
like an upside down plum cake.

895
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,600
So I'm pouring the red wine in the bottom.

896
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,240
Not a wine connoisseur,
to be honest with you,

897
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,600
but 'cause it's German red wine,

898
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,040
I feel like
that probably means it's fancy.

899

[Matt] <i>The three tiers</i>

901
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,480
[Freya] The goal is
kind of to, like, stretch it out

902
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,120
on top of the red wine,
so it should soak it up perfectly.

903
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,400
Otherwise, it could
all just run everywhere.

904
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,200
All right, that's all ready.

905
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,520

908
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,680
I'm going to be more than
halfway through the challenge,

909
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,360
and I haven't even started baking yet.

910
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,440
[Freya] Right,
they're going in for half an hour.

911
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,440
[Noel] <i>While the dough rests,</i>

914
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,480
I'm doing pineapple flowers,
put the pineapples on,

915
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,720
and then heat them low,
and they should turn into flowers.

916
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,040
Well, I've never made flowers in my life.
It's a little bit fiddly for me.

917
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,920
[Freya] Oh, I absolutely love doing this.

918
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,560
[chuckling] To be honest,
I make it up as I go.

919
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,040
You know, we're nearly halfway
through this competition.

920
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,640
-I know! How crazy is that?
-[Noel] And you're still here.

921
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,800
I said that to my mum
and she was like, "Don't worry, Freya,

922
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,600
your dad can come and get you on Tuesday."

923
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,240
[both chuckling]

924
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,080
I've never heard a cuter sentence.

925
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,280
[slurred] Bakers,
you've got one hour left.

926
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,760
[Noel laughing]

927
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,400
Ay, and we have dough.

928
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,800
So my dough has risen, which is great.

929
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,760
Just arranging my caramelised plums.

930
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,760
Gonna sprinkle some more sugar
and cinnamon on top

931
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,240
so it caramelises
a little bit in the oven.

932
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,320
All that needs to be done is egg washing
before it goes in the oven.

933
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,560
[Matt] <i>Multiple cakes of varying sizes</i>

934
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,400
<i>means managing</i>
<i>individual bake times is tricky.</i>

935
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,760
[George] This is going to overflow.

936
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,800
<i>And requires precision planning.</i>

937
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,320
I'll take the first one out
after 20 minutes, the smallest one.

938
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,520
And the next one I'll leave
for a further five minutes.

939
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,160
The other one I'll leave
for another five minutes.

940
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,200
[Matt] <i>But Freya's got other ideas.</i>

941
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,160
[Freya] There we go.

942
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,960
To be honest with you,
they do actually bake like pretty similar

943
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,400
because the little one is so small,
but it's a bit deeper.

944
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,280
So, yeah,
they're not that much different at all.

945
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,280
Just a nice little break, isn't it?

946
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,240
Yeah, the very first we had in this tent.

947
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:44,200
Yeah, this bit's kind of, like,
chilled at the moment, but we'll see.

948
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,640
Listen, I think the secret to
a good yeasted cake is being patient.

949
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,160
I'm just saying that
to make myself feel better.

950
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,480
[Noel] What did you just say to me?

951
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,440
"Don't bring
your erratic behaviour in here."

952
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,280
-Yeah. Over here.
-In this zone.

953
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,560
-Created a little calm zone.
-Yeah, I'm quite chilled.

954
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,640
I can be calm.

955
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,200
-Can you?
-Yeah.

956
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,760
I feel like your mum and dad
used to play that competition a lot,

957
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,840
like, "Who can be
the quietest the longest?"

958
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,280
"Let's go."

959
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,440
You'd just be sat there shaking,
bottling it up.

960
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,920
[laughing]

961
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,440
How very dare you!

962
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,880
I'm just checking on it.
It should be coming out in two minutes.

963
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,720
[Matt] <i>While most of the bakers</i>
<i>are managing to hold their nerveâ¦</i>

[Chigs] Are they baked?

966
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,720
[George] I don't know.
But I need to start decorating.

967
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,160
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

968
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,680
[Chigs] I'm gonna give it
another couple minutes.

969
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:45,320
[Giuseppe] In 40 seconds,
I'm going to be taking the large one out.

970
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,520
I keep questioning this big one
because it's so big.

971
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,960
The last thing you want
is him saying, "It's raw."

972
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,640
They look fine on top. Gotta make sure
they're done all the way through.

973
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,840
[Lizzie] Paul said, "Show finesse."

974
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,560
Oh, no!

975
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,120
"Finesse."

976
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,280
Can you have much finesse
with a broken cake?

977
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,920
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

978
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,880
Amanda, you've got nine.

979
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:17,000
Wonder if I overdid the wine.
As long as the middle is cooked.

980
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,360
I think we're gonna try and assemble this.

981
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,960
Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it.

982
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,040
Needs more time.
I'll give it another five.

983
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,040
[Chigs] So this is gonna be
the chocolate honeycomb.

984
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,760
Melted already, I can feel it.

985
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,200
Done.

986
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,160
Right! It's too hot
to put the butter icing on.

987
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,680
[Giuseppe]
This is the cream in the middle.

988
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,160
[George] Come on, come on. I'm shaking.

989
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,960
[Amanda] It's too hot.

990
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,960
-[Lizzie] My pineapple flowers.
-[Crystelle] Okay, roses, roses, roses.

991
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,360
Done!

992
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,920
[Amanda] I thought for once,
I'd have a tidy bench.

993
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,560
[groaning] Why is it falling?

994
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,440
Oh, my gosh!

995
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,880
Bakers, your time is up.

996
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,360
Please step away from your bakes.

997
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,720
[Freya] Oh, look at that. Wow!

998
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,720
I think I wentâ¦ You know
when we were like, "Oh, do more wine"?

999
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,120
-Yeah.
-You should see it.

1000
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,800
It's dripping in wine.
I think that's better.

1001
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:36,060
[Matt] <i>The bakers' yeast-leavened cakes</i>
<i>now face the judgment of Paul and Prue.</i>

1002
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,660
Okay, bakers, Noel is feeling
a little under the weather.

1003
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:43,140
But we're going to carry on
and invite Lizzie up to the front.

1004
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,820
With your Showstopper, please.

1005
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,700
{\an8}[Paul] I like it.
I think you've made a real attempt

1006
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,740
{\an8}to create that finesse
that we're looking for. All right.

1007
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,900
[Prue] Let's have a look.

1008
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,820
[Paul] You ended up
with something very, very nice.

1009
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,660
So you don't get that chew.
You get a cake-like quality.

1010
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:12,620
I think it needs a little more sweetness,
either in a glaze or an icing.

1011
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,020
But it's very nice and very pleasant.

1012
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,140
-Well done.
-[Paul] Thank you, Lizzie.

1013
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,460
{\an8}I like the look of that.
The roses coming all the way down.

1014
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:29,780
I like the uniformity of it.
As a package, it works together.

1015
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,980
[Prue] This is the apple one?

1016
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,900
[Crystelle] Yeah.
The cinnamon apples are in the centre

1017
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,540
and the cream is piped 'round the outside.

1018
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,780
[Prue] This is about as fattening
a mouthful as you could get.

1019
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,100
The cream, the apple and cinnamon
work beautifully together.

1020
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:46,020
I love the structure as well,
because it's quite light on the mouth.

1021
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,020
Delicious.

1022
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:48,860
Good job, Crystelle.

1023
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,860
[Prue] Very good job.

1024
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,260
{\an8}[Paul] It's quite pretty.
It's a bit dark. It's been overbaked.

1025
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,300
Okay.

1026
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:03,500
You can see how dark that is in places.
But I like the design though, it's clever.

1027
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:07,020
[Prue] I like the crystallized candy peel,
it's really good.

1028
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,500
But it's quite a tough eat, isn't it?

1029
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,780
It's dry. Flavours are good, idea's good.

1030
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,660
It's the overbaking that's done it for me.

1031
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,420
-Thank you, Chigs.
-Thank you, guys. Thank you very much.

1032
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,940
{\an8}It's quite effective.
Not very neat down at the bottom.

1033
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,060
But you can cover up a world of problems
with almonds on the outside.

1034
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,500
But its dependent on the flavour.

1035
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,460
[Prue] That's a lot of fruit.

1036
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,100
-Flavour's fantastic.
-That's beautiful.

1037
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,740
The structure is perfect.
The bite is perfect.

1038
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,740
The bake is spot-on.

1039
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,540
I've never had anything
quite like that before.

1040
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:46,820
Thank you.

1041
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,220
[Paul] It's not
the best-looking thing I've seen.

1042
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,420
But it's one of the best-tasting things
I've had for a long time.

1043
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,940
Thank you so much.

1044
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,180
{\an8}[Paul] There's so much bleeding
coming from the plums.

1045
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,140
[Prue] It is a bit messy-looking.

1046
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,460
[Paul] If you had water icing
around the outside of each one,

1047
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,540
it'd look neater.

1048
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,740
[Prue] Should we taste it?

1049
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,020
[Paul] Let's have a look.

1050
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:18,740
The syrupy topping
is delicious, unusual and lovely.

1051
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,780
But there's an awful lot
of dough to topping.

1052
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:25,380
And I think it could have done
with a little more baking.

1053
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,860
-[Paul] Yeah, it's too doughy.
-Yeah, it is underbaked.

1054
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,300
-Yeah, it is.
-Got it.

1055
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,660
-Thank you
-Thank you.

1056
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,300
[Matt] Well done.

1057
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,340
{\an8}[Prue] I think it's very pretty.

1058
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:43,300
{\an8}It does look like an anniversary cake.

1059
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,220
-[Paul] You need a stronger colour there.
-[George] Yeah.

1060
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,260
See the colour you managed
to achieve down here?

1061
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,420
You want the same up there.
You can see how light that is.

1062
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,540
It's almost been treated like a soft roll.

1063
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,100
-[George] Yeah.
-[Paul] All right.

1064
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,340
[Prue] Let's have a look.

1065
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,580
I love the flavour.
Chocolate-tahini balance is perfect.

1066
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,380
[Paul] That's, ermâ¦ That's a raw dough.

1067
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,740
-Oh, is it?
-[Prue] The middle is raw.

1068
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,700
I think it's a bit clumsy,
it's been rushed.

1069
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,260
-Thank you.
-Thank you

1070
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,580
{\an8}[Prue] I think it looks absolutely lovely.
I really do.

1071
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,180
And it's holding very well.
It doesn't seem to be squashing.

1072
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,500
[Paul] I wanna go
straight down to the bottom.

1073
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,180
-[all exclaiming]
-Well held.

1074
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,300
[Giuseppe] Thank you.

1075
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:30,980
Well, I ain't letting no cake go to waste.
Not on my watch.

1076
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,980
[all laughing]

1077
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,340
[Prue] That looks really lovely.
Light, it's almost like a panettone.

1078
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,180
It's better than a panettone, that.

1079
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,860
It's almost like a whisked sponge.
The cherries are delicious.

1080
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:45,180
Nice and tart, but they're sweet
at the same time.

1081
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,060
It's delicious. I think you've
done an amazing job.

1082
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,660
-[Prue] Well done, Giuseppe.
-[Paul] Thank you, Giuseppe.

1083
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,660
{\an8}[Prue] I must say,
I think it looks really beautiful.

1084
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,340
{\an8}It's a lovely colour.

1085
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,540
[Paul] I can't wait to see
what it looks like inside.

1086
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,580
It's quite a breakfasty bake.

1087
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,700
You think it's too bready?

1088
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,380
It is very bready.
It's a little bit dry.

1089
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,980
You have to be really delicate with this
sort of thing to get the air in it.

1090
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:16,900
That could have opened up
considerably more to make it much lighter.

1091
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,660
But the flavour is good.
Overall, I like it.

1092
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:23,300
But I don't love it, which is a shame.

1093
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,060
It probably could have been lighter.

1094
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:30,860
It could have been in the oven less,
but I feel proud of what I've produced.

1095
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:31,820
[Freya] I just loved it.

1096
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:35,460
To be totally flat-out honest,
that's what I hoped it'd look like.

1097
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,180
In fact, I wouldn't have
wanted it to look any different

1098
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,980
[George] I'm gutted. I'm really gutted.

1099
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:44,260
Definitely feel I'm in danger.
Like, more than ever.

1100
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,580
Yeah, I feel a bit sick.

1101
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,340
Let's talk about
who's in line for Star Baker.

1102
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,740
Giuseppe's done really well.

1103
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,340
I mean, he's really beginning
to get into his stride now.

1104
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,580
Could be one to watch.

1105
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:05,220
I think overall JÃ¼rgenâ¦
JÃ¼rgen's done all right, actually.

1106
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,380
-He had a handshake yesterday.
-He did.

1107
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,540
I was a little bit disappointed
with his Showstopper.

1108
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:15,940
But it looked so beautiful.
Because we think JÃ¼rgen is so good,

1109
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:19,580
when he doesn't do something perfectly,
we bang on about it.

1110
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,780
-That's still a very good yeasted cake.
-Yeah.

1111
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,620
[Paul] I was a little bit
upset with George.

1112
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,500
You know, they were doughy.
I think Freya's down there as well,

1113
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:32,220
because Freya's Showstopper
wasn't as good as I was expecting.

1114
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,060
[Prue] It was such a pity because
the actual syrup was delicious.

1115
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:40,060
But it was that much cake
and a tiny bit of topping.

1116
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,500
[Paul] In Star Baker position,
you've got Giuseppe, JÃ¼rgen,

1117
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,380
and George and Freya down at the bottom.

1118
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,300
Well, bakers,
thank you so much for joining us

1119
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,740
for two gruelling days in this hot tent.

1120
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,540
Now the Star Baker this week isâ¦

1121
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,500
-Is Giuseppe, congratulations.
-[all clapping]

1122
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,740
[murmurs indistinctly]

1123
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,820
And now we have to lose someone.

1124
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,780
This gets harder and harder.

1125
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:23,300
And the person
that we are losing this week

1126
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:26,380
is someone who's brought
their own ideas into the tent.

1127
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,100
And we're very, very sorry to see them go.

1128
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,900
I'm afraid the person
who is leaving us this week isâ¦

1129
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,740
Is Freya.

1130
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,460
-Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
-[sobbing]

1131
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,260
I'm really sad Freya's going.
My God, she is so talented.

1132
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,420
You are literally
the most put-together 19-year-old

1133
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,820
I've ever met in my entire life.

1134
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,020
That wait was agonising.

1135
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,180
I thought, "I'm waiting
for my name to be called,

1136
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:59,780
I'm waiting for my name,"
and then, you know, poor Freya.

1137
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,180
<i>Really gutted for her.</i>

1138
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,540
[Paul] It's very sad that Freya had to go.
She's done an amazing job.

1139
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:08,020
She's 19 years old, vegan baking,
and she came halfway.

1140
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,860
There you go. That's how good she is.

1141
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,220
Should be really proud of yourself.

1142
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,140
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Really proud of yourself.

1143
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,380
Genuinely, I think it's the best
experience of my life.

1144
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,340
[Prue] You know, you've done so well.

1145
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,260
I was feeling
the lack of experience quite a lot.

1146
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,140
<i>So, you know, I am 19.</i>

1147
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,860
<i>So I do feel really proud</i>
<i>to have even just been able to keep up.</i>

1148
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,460
So, like, to get to week five
and do it vegan,

1149
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:34,180
erm, I just feel like I really have
done what I wanted to do being here.

1150
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,300
[all] It's only vegan chocolate cake!

1151
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,820
Giuseppe, he's done it again.

1152
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,260
Giuseppe absolutely deserved
Star Baker. Yes. [chuckles]

1153
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,540
Second Star Baker.

1154
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,700
I can'tâ¦ [clicks tongue]
I can't believe that.

1155
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,220
<i>I want to think only of the next step,</i>

1156
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,540
so next week, it's gonna put me under
a lot of pressure to perform well,

1157
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,860
and that's, ermâ¦

1158
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,460
A difficult position to start in.
