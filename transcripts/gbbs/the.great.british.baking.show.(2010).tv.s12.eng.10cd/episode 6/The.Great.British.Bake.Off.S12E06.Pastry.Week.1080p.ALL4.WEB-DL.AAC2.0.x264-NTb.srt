00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Hello, Matthew Lucas.
It's Pastry Week!

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,880
Are you excited? Yes, I am excited.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,960
For I have here a shoe pastry.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,600
But I very much hope I don't
get the laces stuck in my teeth.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,240
Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,080
Mmm, nice.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,960
Last time...
Why is it falling?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,760
..the bakers battled
Bavarian delicacies.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,280
Oh, no!

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,120
While Jurgen got off to
a strong start...

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,600
You've done well there, Jurgen.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,320
..it was Giuseppe
who claimed the German crown.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,640
It's delicious. I think
you've done an amazing job.

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
And with a soggy Showstopper...
Wonder if I overdid the wine.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,360
..Freya became the latest baker
to leave the tent.

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,680
It's only vegan chocolate cake!

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,400
Now...
Just wanna give it a little love.

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,400
..the bakers tackle pastry.

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,440
Can I just say I think you've
invented like a new dance move here?

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,520
Do you think?
..as it's fried...

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,920
I feel like I'm having
heart palpitations.

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,720
..folded... Filo pastry.
Never made it in my life.

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,640
..and filled.
Can't tell what's sausage

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,120
and what's hands,
to be honest with you.

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,760
Who will perfect pastry?

26
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,040
Oh, it collapsed.

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,480
I can't watch.
I know. it's too stressful.

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,160
And who has baked their last?

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,400
Have you seen this here?

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,280
This is week six.
The second half of the journey.

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,080
I'm performing much better
than I expected.

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,400
In fact,
I have to keep buying shirts

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,600
cos I didn't bring enough
with me.

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,480
I've managed to worm my way through
cos there's been loads of people,

35
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,040
but now it's getting less,
it's harder.

36
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,960
I spoke to Lizzie and I was like,
"Come on, Lizzie, we cannot back
down.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,176
"We've got to do it for Freya,

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
"like, come on, like,
the women have got to do it."

39
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,376
I think Amanda might be able
to pull it out of the bag.

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,680
I think pastry week's her week.

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,440
No-one's given up in there.
I'm certainly not giving up.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,280
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

43
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,600
It's Pastry Week.

44
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,760
It's time for your
Signature Challenge.

45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,240
Paul and Prue
would like you each to make

46
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,520
two batches of decorated chouxnuts.

47
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,400
Did you know that
Paul Hollywood invented

48
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,080
the chouxnut pouch?

49
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,680
He had some spare leather
and nowhere to put his nuts.

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,040
No, you're thinking of
the jock strap, Noel. Oh, yeah.

51
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,000
Now, your chouxnuts
need to be perfectly fried.

52
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,080
Six filled, six not filled.

53
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,360
And either glazed or iced.

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,760
You have two hours.

55
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,080
On your marks.
Get set.

56
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,520
Uh, uh, uh, wait, Chigs.
Cos I haven't said it yet.

57
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,280
LAUGHTER

58
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,040
Not my time you're wasting.

59
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,400
Bake!

60
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,560
A chouxnut is much lighter
than a doughnut.

61
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,800
It's almost like a fried eclair.

62
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,400
I actually prefer the chouxnut
to doughnuts.

63
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,840
Yeah. I like eating them.

64
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,360
I'm not a choux-nutter, at all.

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,000
I mean, if I went to hell, I feel
like this is what my hell would be.

66
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,240
If you've never heard of
a chouxnut before,

67
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,800
basically it's choux pastry
piped into a doughnut shape,

68
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,600
deep-fried.
We want two batches.

69
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,880
One of them has
to have filling inside

70
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,640
and one of them has to have

71
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,240
a really interesting icing
or glaze.

72
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,920
The chouxnuts themselves
are quite aerated.

73
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,080
You want that beautiful aeration
inside the chouxnut.

74
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,600
Choux has to be exactly
the right consistency.

75
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,520
So getting the paste right
is most important.

76
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,120
If it's too wet,
it's going to sink.

77
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,080
Morning, Lizzie. Morning.

78
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,440
Right, Lizzie, chouxnuts.
Chouxnuts.

79
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,080
Oh, the devil's doughnuts.

80
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,600
They have me shook already.
I'm like shaken.

81
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,880
What she's saying is
she's quite upset about it.

82
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,280
LAUGHTER

83
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,080
So tell us about your flavours.

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,240
So I'm doing raspberry liqueur
and hibiscus

85
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,680
for the filled one.

86
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,240
OK. Oh, lovely. OK. That sounds
absolutely delicious.

87
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,080
Lizzie's raspberry liqueur
and hibiscus-filled chouxnuts

88
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,560
will be paired with
a caramel-glazed unfilled batch.

89
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,160
But she's more confident with
her flavours than with the fryer.

90
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,600
So why have you found this
to be a problem?

91
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,600
I just hate choux pastry
and I just feel like

92
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,600
the fryer's gonna like hit me
and I'm gonna burn.

93
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,840
Feels like you're in a chippy,
doesn't it? God, yeah.

94
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,640
The pressure is just unbelievable.
Even my elbows are sweating.

95
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,600
Your elbows are sweating? Yeah.

96
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,200
Never heard about sweaty elbows.

97
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,040
Good name for a punk band,
that, the Sweaty Elbows.

98
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,960
It's going to be fine.
Oh, hopefully.

99
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,280
Lizzie might be dreading
the fryer,

100
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,680
but one baker
couldn't be more excited.

101
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,760
Gorgeous. Can you smell
that frying oil?

102
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Can't wait to make this. Yummy.

103
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,080
OK, so one I'm doing
a classic sticky toffee.

104
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,600
I'm making a really easy toffee

105
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,520
just because of
the time pressure in here.

106
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,920
And it's also all about
my pastry today.

107
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,440
George is keeping
his flavours simple

108
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,080
with one toffee-glazed choux batch

109
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,880
and another filled with
jam and cream.

110
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,720
Today he's focusing on his flavours
to impress Paul and Prue.

111
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,040
Tell us about the pastry.

112
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,880
Um, I, I just wanted to get
a nice airy dough.

113
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,040
Poker face.

114
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,640
Look at George's
questioning eyes,

115
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,080
"Is that OK?" Getting nothing.

116
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,600
You're not doing this to me,
Paul.

117
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Perfect choux is light and airy,

118
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,360
characterised by large holes
on the inside.

119
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,560
We fold air in and then just
give it a really good mix.

120
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,240
Egg is vital
to bind the ingredients,

121
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,080
helping it to puff up when fried.

122
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,160
This is the bit that
can go wrong the most

123
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,840
out of the whole process
cos if you add too many eggs,

124
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,880
the batter becomes runny and you
will not be able to shape it.

125
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,600
It's a fine line.
More egg means more liquid

126
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,000
which could lead to chouxnuts
that are as flat as a pancake.

127
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,160
You kind of have to do this by eye.

128
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,240
Um, and obviously baking
is all about precision.

129
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,960
You should be able to pick it up
and it drips into a V.

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,600
Yeah. Done.

131
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,480
But Chigs' dough isn't done.

132
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,960
I'm making a chocolate dough.

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,920
That one will be a little bit
tougher because of the cocoa powder.

134
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,160
So I will add a bit more egg in.
I just need to be careful with it.

135
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,120
His chocolate pastry
will form his unfilled chouxnut,

136
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,880
topped with a lime glaze.

137
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,000
But Chigs is the only baker
braving two different pastries.

138
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,880
His plain batch will be filled
with hazelnut praline,

139
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,320
evoking the French classic
the Paris-Brest.

140
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,080
Right, I'm gonna start making pastry
for the Paris-Brest flavour.

141
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,240
The what, sorry? Paris-Brest.

142
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,520
Parry Brea... what?
Yes, that's right.

143
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,280
It's got breasts in it?
Too much for my head.

144
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,320
Bakers, you are halfway through.

145
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,720
EXHALES

146
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,200
Look at Jurgen's stance.

147
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,480
Yes, action stance.

148
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,920
There's a lot to do.
Come on, come on.

149
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,800
While Chigs races to finish
his second batch of pastry,

150
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,960
the rest of the bakers
have bagged theirs up...

151
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,360
Done. Right, I'm just gonna make
my glaze.

152
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,160
..and are pushing on with
their toppings and fillings.

153
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Time for Italian alcohol.

154
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,760
Er, I thought it would have been
unacceptable

155
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,600
for an Italian
to come on Bake Off

156
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,240
and not use limoncello somewhere,
and this seemed to be

157
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,960
the right excuse to get some in
the ingredients list.

158
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,360
Giuseppe's bringing the taste of
Italy to his chouxnuts

159
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,920
with a filled batch packed
with limoncello liqueur

160
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,040
and the other topped
with almond nougatine.

161
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,760
I'm making both batches
with standard flavours

162
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,400
I'm most familiar with, you know,
to play it safe and to do,

163
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,440
to go with something
that I knew already.

164
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,440
But one baker who isn't
playing it safe is Crystelle.

165
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,400
I wanted something
completely different

166
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,920
so I've gone for miso caramel,
salty sweet chouxnut.

167
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,520
Hopefully it works.

168
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,440
Er, it shouldn't taste
of miso soup, I hope.

169
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,960
A passion fruit
and mango-filled choux

170
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,240
will sit alongside another
glazed in a novel miso caramel.

171
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,800
Tell me about the miso.

172
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,480
I feel like miso caramel's
kind of like just a step up

173
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,800
from salted caramel.
So miso's quite umami.

174
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,560
You kind of get this salty
umami undertone.

175
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,640
"Lovely umami undertone."

176
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,000
LAUGHTER

177
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,520
No more middle class-sentence
has ever been uttered.

178
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,680
That's not something
you'd hear every day.

179
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,280
Right, thanks, Noel.

180
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,120
But Crystelle isn't the only baker
riding the sweet and savoury trend.

181
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,680
This one's going to be glazed
with maple syrup

182
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,720
with some bacon on the top.
It's delicious.

183
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,040
Amanda's planning to pair
her maple and bacon glazed chouxnut

184
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,760
with another batch
filled with pistachio and rose.

185
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,320
What sweet and savoury mixes
could we invent?

186
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,880
Jam and sausage?
Jam sausage?

187
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,880
What about chocolate onion?

188
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Probably not. No, I'm not liking
the sound of that one.

189
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,000
No. Sweet and savoury's a terrible
idea. Yeah, whose idea was that?

190
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,640
When it comes to
weird and wonderful flavours,

191
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,200
Jurgen's pushing the boat out
even further.

192
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,160
This is ube extract
from a purple Filipine yam

193
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,320
which has a vanilla-y,
quite unique flavour.

194
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,560
Also the colour
should be stunning.

195
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,680
He's making a yuzu
and sake glazed choux

196
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,360
to pair with his ube-filled batch,

197
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,600
the bright colours
mimicking pastries

198
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,200
he ate as a child in the '70s.

199
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,640
Well, that's an amazing colour.

200
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,320
On top of the purple colour

201
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,600
the glaze will be orange
as well.

202
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,040
LAUGHTER All right, Jurgen,

203
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,880
we'll look forward to
your '70s psychedelic dyes.

204
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,760
You've already won for me.
That colour's so strong.

205
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,640
Right, I'm just trying to completely
make sure they're fried.

206
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,000
Do you fry a lot?

207
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,520
No, no. No.
I don't own one of them at home.

208
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,680
No, I don't. I own two.

209
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,960
Ha-ha.

210
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,440
Bakers, you have half an hour.

211
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,440
No pressure.

212
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm sure it'll be fine.

213
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,560
Just piping my choux dough
nicely and gently.

214
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,360
Paul and Prue are expecting
uniform chouxnuts...

215
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,240
I'm making sure the shape
is as consistent as possible.

216
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,840
..fried to perfection.

217
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Fryers scare me.
I'm literally shaking.

218
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,080
Lizzie? Yeah.
Don't worry. Have confidence.

219
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,560
Let's go, let's go.

220
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,320
Each fried chouxnut needs to be
crunchy on the outside,

221
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,800
light and fluffy in the middle.

222
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,680
You don't know
when chouxnuts are done.

223
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,200
No-one knows.

224
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm sure one of these knows.

225
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,960
They need at least five minutes

226
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,280
otherwise they will then
collapse afterwards.

227
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Not only is the frying time
critical,

228
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,560
the oil temperature
must also be correct.

229
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,840
I'm aiming for 175.
Nice and hot.

230
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,840
Just want a little bit of brown
on the edge.

231
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,280
Achieving the perfect chouxnut
is no mean feat

232
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,680
when the bakers still have
toppings to prepare.

233
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,400
Ridiculous - still making the glaze
for the chocolate ones.

234
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,840
So many elements.

235
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,400
I feel like I'm having
heart palpitations.

236
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,480
Multi-tasking is a bit of
a challenge. Right...

237
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,240
Oh, see, look, I didn't start
the bloody timer.

238
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,280
My last... It's fine, it's fine.

239
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,400
I'll, I'll just hope and pray.
Maybe I'll do two minutes.

240
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,360
These tongs are hot.

241
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,120
Ooh!

242
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,480
How do you open this thing?

243
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,680
Hmm?

244
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,560
Push it in.

245
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
OK.

246
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,520
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

247
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,840
Come on.

248
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,320
That's exactly what I wanted
to get.

249
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,600
Seems to be a good golden colour.

250
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,840
Shame about the light colour.

251
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,280
But never mind.

252
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,640
I can't even look at you,
you're making me sweat more.

253
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,360
What, in the elbows?

254
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,600
Yeah. Maybe I've got issues.

255
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,520
Right, filling.
♪ You've got to pump it up... ♪

256
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,200
The filled chouxnuts
must be crammed full of cream.

257
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,480
Crucial moment.

258
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,360
But the more they inject,
the more chance of an explosion.

259
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Oh, my God, it's all coming out.
What?

260
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,080
Jeez.

261
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,640
So this is the last
filled chouxnut.

262
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,400
Why is so much coming out?
Oops.

263
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,720
OK, passion juice
in the crinkly ball.

264
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,760
The crinkly ball, the passion juice
comes out. Yeah, it's quite nice.

265
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,720
I like that. It is nice.

266
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,680
Limoncello. This is gonna be
a very, very close call.

267
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,320
How long we got left now?

268
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,880
One minute left.

269
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,680
Oh, no, oh, no.
Rush at the end.

270
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,160
They're nearly done.

271
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,120
Come on. There's no time
to waste!

272
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,640
Bakers, your time is up.

273
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,320
Can you stop touching your nuts,
please?

274
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,480
George! I'm eating it.

275
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,560
Don't touch any of your nuts.
I'm not touching.

276
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,440
Lizzie, will you try
any of your nuts?

277
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,240
Absolutely not.

278
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,160
They are horrible.

279
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,080
I think they're a bit soggy.
They're just underfried.

280
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,040
A rookie error in this competition,
just not setting the timer.

281
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,400
The bakers' chouxnuts will now face
the judgment of Paul and Prue.

282
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,320
Hello, George.
Hello, George. Hi, hiya.

283
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,040
You've got a
nice robust mixture there

284
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,560
which has given you that pop.

285
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,640
This is a toffee and hazelnut
chouxnut. These are not filled.

286
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Mm.

287
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,880
Toffee-ish, really nutty.

288
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,720
Goes nicely with the soft choux.
Delicious. Lovely.

289
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,920
Let's have a
look at your filled one.

290
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,880
It's got a Chantilly cream with
raspberry jam rippled through.

291
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,120
You've given me an empty bit.

292
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,680
It's important you get the filling
right the way round. Yeah.

293
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,920
Quite often I need two holes
so that I can squirt.

294
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,640
You squeeze the bag. Yeah.

295
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,240
When you meet that
little bit of resistance,

296
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,920
it usually means it's full.

297
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,240
STIFLED LAUGHTER

298
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,520
Why are you laughing?

299
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,400
We're just children.

300
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,200
You're grown up.

301
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,640
Sorry, Dame Prue.
Exactly. Stop this nonsense.

302
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,840
Tell him it's lovely.

303
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,680
I think when you do... Sorry.

304
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,960
I think when you do get the cream
filling and the jam, it's delicious.

305
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,280
Thank you.

306
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,160
The filled ones
have an ube creme pat.

307
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,600
That ube colour is just
extraordinary, isn't it?

308
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,800
That slightly vanillary ube
taste is... unusual,

309
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,480
but sort of vaguely familiar.

310
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,960
I think the, the structure on that
is very good.

311
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,960
It's nice and open. It's very light.
It's so delicate it's lovely. OK.

312
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,840
These are the unfilled ones.
They have a yuzu and sake glaze.

313
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,600
It has that little bit of acidity
which yuzu gives it.

314
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,760
They're both delicious. Thank you.

315
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,480
The filled ones,
they are Paris-Brest inspired.

316
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,240
I've got a praline
cream in the middle.

317
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,640
Can't really see the structure,
cos there's so much of the filling!

318
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,760
I think Paris-Brest should have
lots of filling.

319
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,400
That's delicious. Mm.

320
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,360
This is my chocolate lime chouxnut.

321
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,920
The cocoa, that's just enough
to marry with the lime. Yeah.

322
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,320
It's unusual, but it does work.

323
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,240
It's a nice chouxnut, that one.
Thank you.

324
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,720
It's delicate.

325
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,720
So, those are the empty chouxnuts
with an almond praline.

326
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,080
Good frying.

327
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,480
Colour's nice, isn't it?

328
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,840
The contrast of the praline crunch

329
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,640
and the softness of the choux
is just lovely.

330
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,440
OK. Let's have a look at your filled
one. Creme pat and limoncello.

331
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,040
It's definitely creme pat
with limoncello!

332
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,200
There is too much limoncello -
and I can't resist another mouthful.

333
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,880
Aha! Mm.

334
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,480
This is the miso... caramel.
And white chocolate, yeah.

335
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,160
It is exactly how you said.
It's umami.

336
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,800
It's got... you know it has got
that bitterness to it. Mm-hm.

337
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,880
And the tropical passion fruit
choux is just beautiful.

338
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,280
But the choux itself... Mm.
..is very tight.

339
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,480
Yeah. It's not open enough.

340
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,160
It should be, "pff".
You've lost a lot of the definition.

341
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,880
Do you think you lost some of the
definition in the frying? Yeah.

342
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,120
You need to give it a bit of a...
Yeah... hit.

343
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,080
The choux's let you down
a little bit. OK, thank you.

344
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,800
OK. The maple bacon.

345
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,800
It needs the bacon.
Could've done with a tiny bit more.

346
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,240
Yeah - that's a shame,
cos I had so much left over. Yeah.

347
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,080
Well, let's have a
look at your filled one.

348
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,360
It's pistachio creme pat
with a rose glaze.

349
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:03,080
The, uh, rose, it's like, artificial
cordial. Too rosy and too sweet. OK.

350
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,440
Quite attractive.

351
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,040
The frying colour looks good.

352
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,520
Mm.

353
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,240
Hibiscus and what?

354
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,520
Raspberry liqueur.

355
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,040
The hibiscus flavour's quite nice
and so's the raspberry.

356
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,400
Overall it's got a nice
structure to it.

357
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,760
It's delicate, and the
toffee is delicious, as well.

358
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,040
I would buy these in a shop.
That's for sure.

359
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,120
Thank you, I've been in panic.

360
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,080
You're ruining my lifetime's theory

361
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,240
that you cannot cook
if you don't love it.

362
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,440
Well done. Thank you. Anyway,
well done. Ta. Well done. Ta.

363
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,160
Feel so sick.

364
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,160
Great stuff, well done.

365
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,480
That was my best Signature feedback.

366
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,176
I thought I was gonna, like, pass
out when they were speaking to me.

367
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,080
I just couldn't believe what
they were saying.

368
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,680
I don't think they were overly
enamoured with the rose flavour,

369
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,880
but that's OK.

370
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,040
Gotta try these things, haven't you?

371
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,800
My choux pastry wasn't up to
scratch, and it's Pastry Week -

372
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,536
but I'm gonna have to try and pull
it out of the bag in the Technical.

373
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,280
I just need to tell myself I have a
functioning brain

374
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,920
and hopefully my brain'll function

375
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,200
and I will do a Technical Challenge
successfully.

376
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,160
The bakers were able to
practise their chouxnuts,

377
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,720
but have no idea what awaits them
in the Technical Challenge.

378
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,080
Bakers, welcome back to the tent
for your Technical Challenge,

379
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,520
which today has been
set by Holly Paulwood.

380
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,280
Holly, any words of advice?

381
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,440
This particular recipe
will push you to your limits.

382
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,360
Don't waste any time.

383
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,080
Thank you, Holly, and may I say
you're looking gorgeous tonight?!

384
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,000
Now, as ever, the Technical
Challenge will be judged blind,

385
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,600
so we're gonna have to ask Holly
and Prue to leave the tent.

386
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,040
Off you pop.

387
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,560
The judges would love you to make
a large baklava with filo pastry.

388
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,040
Oh, no! Oh, man.

389
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,240
Your filo pastry should be made

390
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,080
using a traditional
laminating technique

391
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,280
layered with a pistachio
and walnut filling

392
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,680
and cut into a star design.

393
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,320
You have 2 hours and 45 minutes.
On your marks. Get set. Bake!

394
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,680
Oh, Jesus.

395
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,240
Filo pastry is
notoriously complicated.

396
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,080
Filo pastry?
Never made it in my life.

397
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,400
Who makes their own filo pastry?

398
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,680
No-one.

399
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,520
This is the first time ever the
bakers have been asked to make it

400
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,800
for a Technical Challenge.

401
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,920
I've never attempted filo.
Or baklava.

402
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,720
I really wish that
I had spent more time in the kitchen

403
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,680
with my Greek grandmother.

404
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,520
Let's just be confident
that it's in my DNA.

405
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,440
You thought, you've got two Greeks
in the tent,

406
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,960
they're bound to know
how to make it.

407
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,960
Paul, I think this must be the most
difficult Technical I've ever seen.

408
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,600
Yeah. Baklava.
The hardest part is the lamination.

409
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,360
Above all you've gotta get
that flake.

410
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,480
There's three layers
and then you have the nut layer

411
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,720
and then three layers again.

412
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,920
You've gotta make your dough
and divide it into six.

413
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,640
Three for the bottom,
three for the top.

414
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
Then fold it, fold it,
fold it, fold it.

415
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,640
You've gotta do that six times.
Times six.

416
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,240
So, there's a lot of layers
by the time we've finished. Yeah.

417
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,080
If they haven't laminated it, you're
gonna get a solid piece of dough.

418
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,760
You're not gonna get that
beautiful filo pastry. Layered.

419
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,560
Which is what we're gonna be
looking for. OK, let's cut a slice.

420
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,120
Well, that looks beautiful,
thank you.

421
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,240
Who is really gonna come up
trumps in the tent?

422
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,640
I have no idea,
cos this is complicated.

423
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,760
I'm gonna tell myself I can do it,
because I have to,

424
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,160
because otherwise I'm going home -
and I refuse to go home.

425
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,400
First step is for the filo pastry.

426
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,280
Put the dry ingredients into a bowl,
then combine with wet ingredients.

427
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,080
Two eggs, vegetable oil, some butter
and some white wine vinegar.

428
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,720
Full fat Greek yoghurt, as well.

429
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,360
Greek yoghurt.

430
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,960
There you go.

431
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,600
I suppose the yoghurt is in there
because it's a Greek recipe!

432
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,800
Hello. Hey, Matt.
So, have you made baklava before?

433
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,680
I've never made baklava before.
I've never made filo pastry before.

434
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,560
You haven't? It's a massive hassle.
Why would you? Just buy it.

435
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,280
It's a what? A massive...? Hassle.
Oh, "hass". Hassle. Hassle. Hassle.

436
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,280
Oh, my word! I genuinely thought you
said something else there.

437
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:19,040
A massive hassle. Please don't
write in to complain. Hassle.

438
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,200
Right, let's get my hands in there.

439
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,480
Right, gonna knead the hell
out of this.

440
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,160
I don't want to have too
much gluten in here.

441
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,160
Just enough that it holds together.

442
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,640
And now I'm out of breath.

443
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,320
I think you've invented, like,
a new dance move here. Do you think?

444
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,760
Any other moves? So there's this
one which is kind of. Yeah.

445
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,160
It's called the side shuffle. OK.

446
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,920
And then you've got, like,
the little...

447
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,320
The slam. The slam. Yeah.

448
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,440
I've got a good one, which is...
Go on... the taste.

449
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,600
Where you go like this.

450
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,920
It's underproved.

451
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,800
I'm just doing it
cos other people are doing it!

452
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,080
Don't know what it does.

453
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,160
Right, it's gotta go six
equal balls now.

454
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,440
Dough feels very soft.
It's pretty good.

455
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,200
Roll out the balls of dough to a
square approximately 30 centimetres.

456
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,480
The key part of baklava

457
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,160
is having the layers,
really thin, crispy pastry.

458
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,280
Fold the top and bottom into the
centre creating a rough square.

459
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Take each corner and fold into
the middle. Dust with cornflour.

460
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,760
This is laminating to create
layers in filo.

461
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,040
To create the multi layers of flaky
pastry baklava is famous for...

462
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,880
Corner to corner.

463
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,600
..the bakers must intricately fold
and roll the dough

464
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,280
in a process called lamination.

465
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,920
So I'm taking the edges
to the centre.

466
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,600
Usually you create layers using fat

467
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,600
but in this instance
we're using cornflour.

468
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,480
Hmm, I don't know if this is right.
Like that?

469
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,200
Great, I've gotta do that
six times now.

470
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,160
One, two, three, four.

471
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,840
Folding the edges. Dust.
Now we're talking!

472
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
Last one.

473
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,360
Cover and rest,
so I'm covering it and resting it.

474
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,520
I'm measuring out
my pistachio kernels.

475
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,640
The filling needs to provide
that crunchy texture.

476
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,400
I might give them a haircut.

477
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,480
Are you gonna mess this one up like
you did this morning?

478
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,960
I... What? Ohh!

479
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,840
Oh-ee! You're so bloody rude.

480
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,480
Hello, this is the talking cupcake

481
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,480
saying you are halfway
through the challenge.

482
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,960
I glued that there while
you were asleep. Oh, no. Did you?

483
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,120
To assemble, roll the dough
into six 30 centimetre circles,

484
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,880
stack in the tin.

485
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,360
Rolling it back out. Again.

486
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,880
Right that's layer one.

487
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,400
Right, two of six.

488
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,520
This is a bit of a dodgy layer.

489
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,200
Next is the filling.

490
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,896
You want a fair bit of filling -
don't want a stingy baklava, do you?

491
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,520
Now I'm gonna be rolling out
the other three discs.

492
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,680
Cover it up and then proceed
with the next steps.

493
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,920
Don't panic, and follow the recipe.

494
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,480
That's done, everything's done.

495
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,440
Using the diagram provided,
cut the pastry into a star design.

496
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,080
Of course the diagram is smaller.

497
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,840
How are you meant to do this?

498
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,200
There must be an easier way
than this.

499
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,360
Pretty clear, isn't it?

500
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,440
It's actually scaled up.
This one is 20 centimetres wide.

501
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,360
This is 30 centimetres wide.
Oh, he's just showing off.

502
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,120
Do I cut all the way through
or do I just put it on the top?

503
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,640
Who are you talking to?
Are you talking to me? I'm...

504
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,560
You're talking to God!
Noel, do you think I...

505
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,136
Do I cut all the way through it?
Do I cut this all the way through?

506
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm gonna cut all the way through.

507
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,960
Go through the worktop into hell
where Paul Hollywood lives.

508
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,000
Me pattern's gone mental.
Don't know what I'm doing any more.

509
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,680
It's hurting my eyes to look at it
so I'm just free styling.

510
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,440
What is that? There's too many
lines for me.

511
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,000
Right, have I done it?
Yeah, I've done it.

512
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,880
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

513
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,440
Ugh, I'll have to eyeball it, innit?

514
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,080
I don't know how long pastry takes.

515
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,760
40 minutes baking.

516
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,400
This train is due to arrive at the
end of the challenge in 30 minutes.

517
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,160
I think I'm just
going to rotate this.

518
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,720
Bit more butter.

519
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,480
It looks like it's drying out
a little bit.

520
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,840
Just wanna give it a little love.

521
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,960
Oh, come on.

522
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,416
I don't suppose this is one of those

523
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,160
that you can test
with a toothpick, is it?

524
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,520
I think me timer
was set for, like...

525
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,960
Oh, my God.

526
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,400
I didn't put the timer on.

527
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,680
Can't remember how long
it's been in the oven.

528
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,400
How long have we got left?

529
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,280
You have ten minutes left.

530
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,480
It looks done to me.

531
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,360
Ah. What do I do?

532
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,760
I'm gonna go for it now.

533
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,760
I'm taking it out, I'm taking
it out, I'm taking it out.

534
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,040
Agh.

535
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,960
It's a little bit anaemic.

536
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,520
It has pretty much the right colour.

537
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,120
Right, baklava is soaked in syrup.

538
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,160
Syrupy. There we go.

539
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,080
Syrup's gone on. Yum!

540
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,120
Ground pistachios.

541
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,360
So, there's a diamond.

542
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,960
I'm gonna freehand it.

543
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,640
Oh, I'm not sure about this.

544
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,520
The patterns are not
making sense to me.

545
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,320
It's just too much for my mind to
think of a template, to be honest.

546
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,400
Bakers, you have one minute left.

547
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Come on!

548
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
It's not coming off.

549
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,960
Ooh.

550
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,680
Last little bit, rose petals.

551
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,600
Shaking like there was no tomorrow.

552
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,040
Come on.

553
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,520
Come on!

554
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,400
Oh, it's so hot.

555
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,800
Almost.

556
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840
Bakers, your time is up.

557
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,560
That was not pleasant.

558
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,760
That seems really soggy.

559
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,360
Terrified.

560
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,520
Paul and Prue are looking
for seven beautiful baklava

561
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,200
with striking layers of laminated
filo pastry -

562
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,240
but they have no idea
whose is whose.

563
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,120
Shall we start over here,
then, Prue?

564
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,360
The colour's quite nice.

565
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,240
I quite like the colour.
The colour's lovely.

566
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,520
Let's see what it's like.

567
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,040
It's not that bad.

568
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,280
You can see a bit of lamination
there. Yeah. A little bit there.

569
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,320
Mm, really nice -

570
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,160
and if you saw that in a pastry shop
you'd buy a bit, wouldn't you? Mm.

571
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Moving on.

572
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,520
Quite a lot of...
Bit too much pistachio... pistachio.

573
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,360
Little bit too much.
Very clumsy at the edge.

574
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,936
It is - you want it to be
more delicate.

575
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,200
It's sort of, yeah, oh, that'll do.

576
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,440
You can see the lamination
on the top. Yeah.

577
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,080
But you want it a little
darker in colour.

578
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,680
It needed longer in the oven.

579
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,080
Mm, that's lovely flavour.

580
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,280
OK. This is nice and shiny.

581
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,320
I do like the colour of this one.

582
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,920
And the cut is nice.

583
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,960
You have lamination there, see.

584
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,120
Yeah, it's nice and crisp on the
bottom. Mm. The flavour's good.

585
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,080
Moving on. The design's quite
nice on this. Yeah. Neat.

586
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,920
But it's a little undercooked.
It needs longer.

587
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,880
And it's such a pity, cos there's
lots and lots of layers in there.

588
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,600
Yeah, OK.

589
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,280
You can't really see the diamonds.

590
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,120
You've lost all the shape
and all the cut.

591
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,680
It's mess, the top of that's a mess.

592
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,080
This is deliberately to... Mask it.

593
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,640
..to mask the fact that the pattern
has been lost.

594
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,400
The syrup's nice.

595
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,640
There is lamination, it's just
quite doughy. Needed longer.

596
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,960
Moving on.

597
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,440
This is beautiful.
It's a nice design. Very nice.

598
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,840
All the way around.

599
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,560
Yeah, it's got good
lamination there.

600
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,320
It's got a nice colour. Yeah,
it's got good lamination on the top.

601
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,120
Mm, that is lovely crisp,
really good. Mm.

602
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,560
Last. A little bit
higgledy-piggledy, these.

603
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,160
It is a bit all over the place,
innit?

604
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Where are the nuts?

605
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,960
Ah, I had to cut in
to see where they were.

606
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,640
The layers are quite thick.

607
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,560
But the flavour's nice. Delicious.

608
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,560
OK, this is gonna be very
difficult judging.

609
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,320
Paul and Prue will now rank the
baklava from last to first place.

610
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
In seventh spot we have this one.

611
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,280
Lizzie, comes down to that little
bit of finesse that you need.

612
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
I just haven't got finesse.
You have.

613
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,720
PRUE CHUCKLES

614
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,880
In sixth spot we have this one.

615
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,400
George, just a little bit clumsy.

616
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,680
Amanda is fifth,
Giuseppe fourth, and Chigs is third.

617
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,400
In second place... we have this one.

618
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,880
Oh, my God!

619
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,920
Well, it looks absolutely beautiful.
Well done.

620
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,960
In first we have...

621
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
APPLAUSE

622
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,520
Can't believe it!

623
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,560
The diamond pattern
on the top is very good.

624
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,560
You've got a beautiful colour all
the way through. Well done, Jurgen.

625
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,520
Thank you. Smashed it again, mate.
Well done.

626
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,200
What a day. Incredible.

627
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,200
Jurgenator seems to be back!

628
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,080
Oh, my God!

629
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,720
I'm in so much shock -
and do you know what?

630
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,200
I really needed that today.

631
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,720
I've never been up there in
the Technical, so, feels quite wild.

632
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,240
I could've done a lot better
but I had a pretty good Signature -

633
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,760
but I'm not gonna kind of write
myself off just yet.

634
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,080
This rain pretty much symbolises
how my Technical went.

635
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,360
It was a disaster.

636
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,520
Tomorrow I've just got to
do the best I can.

637
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,160
Just one challenge remains
in pastry week.

638
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,080
It's quite wet out there.

639
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,680
The rain is pretty deafening
but we're going to carry on.

640
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,560
Of course. So far,
they're pretty good, actually.

641
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,880
You got Chigs, Giuseppe, you got
Jurgen and you got Crystelle,

642
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,200
you know in the sort of top four
of this week overall.

643
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,040
I think when it comes to the people
that have struggled over

644
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,440
the two challenges, Amanda
and Lizzie, those two...

645
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,000
Where's George, is he in the middle?

646
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,400
I think he's in the middle again,
yeah. A remake of

647
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,960
Malcolm In The Middle over here...
You know what, though?

648
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,160
It's not a bad place to be. But I've
been on Bake Off five years now

649
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,840
and occasionally someone does
something and you almost cry

650
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,160
because it's overwhelmingly good.
You're almost moved. Yes.

651
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,120
Yeah, OK, we want one of those,
guys. We want one of those today.
That's what we're after.

652
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,080
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

653
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,160
It's time for your
Showstopper Challenge.

654
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:05,080
Today the judges would love you
to make an intricate terrine pie.

655
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,240
In the grand old tradition
of French pate en croute,

656
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,440
the judges would like your
showstopping terrine pies

657
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,960
to have an ornate pastry
decoration on the outside.

658
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,040
And to reveal a neat pattern
or design when the pie is cut open.

659
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,120
The fillings and flavours
are up to you.

660
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,080
Noel, what flavours would you use?

661
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,400
I think I'd make a hip-hop
terrine pie.

662
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,440
It'd probably be Flava Flav flavour.

663
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,040
I've just seen Flava Flav's
big clock, actually,

664
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,640
and it seems you've got
four and a half hours

665
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,760
to complete your
Showstopper Challenge.

666
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,320
On your marks. Get set.

667
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,920
♪ Don't believe the hype! ♪

668
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,200
And bake.

669
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,520
The terrine pie originated in France

670
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,880
and is typically packed
with a meat pate.

671
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,920
This is the perfect weather
for a warm pie.

672
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,280
All we need now is a nice glass
of port and a fireplace.

673
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,320
I think this is one of my favourite
challenges because I get to cook.

674
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm excited to make it.
I have got thyme on my hands.

675
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,640
We're looking for a highly
decorative terrine.

676
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,080
Now, we're looking for
a decoration on the top

677
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,080
and a beautiful pattern inside.

678
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,400
And I've a little pattern.
Do need finesse today.

679
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,120
The most obvious thing that could go
wrong is they run out of time.

680
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,760
Cos when you bake it, you then need
a decent length of time

681
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,600
to cool it enough to cut it.

682
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,720
This is going to be a very, very
close call

683
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,560
to get it cooled down and set.

684
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,160
Leaking and collapsing
are my biggest fears.

685
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,600
You've got to set everything.

686
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,200
If it's cooler, whatever filling
they've got in will tend to congeal

687
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,600
and solidify and allow that slice
to fall without falling to pieces.

688
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,680
Hi, Jurgen. What are you doing
for your terrine?

689
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,560
Uh, I'm making Lunch in Freiburg.
Freiburg, my hometown,

690
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,960
has a famous dish which it's topside
of beef with horseradish

691
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,400
and sauerkraut. Oh, lovely. Wow, OK.
And all of that goes into my pie.

692
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,840
You can't go wrong with horseradish
and a bit of beef. No.

693
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,960
Jurgen's transforming Freiburg's
famous beef dish

694
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,520
into an ornate pie,

695
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,080
featuring a colourful square
running through the centre

696
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,080
and a border of plaited pastry.

697
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,920
I must say, it sounds absolutely
delicious. Does sound good.

698
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,520
Can you get some German beer ready
for me as well, please?

699
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,840
Ah, unfortunately,
I didn't bring any.

700
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,880
THEY LAUGH

701
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,840
Starting to make my hot water crust.
It's a lot of lard.

702
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,640
No lard before Marbs.

703
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,600
Hot water crust is a go-to pastry
when making savoury pies.

704
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,480
You add hot water into the fat
and flour to gelatinize it.

705
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,720
The addition of hot water
gives the dough elasticity.

706
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,080
There's no danger of it...
I don't really want to say this.

707
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,640
..of it cracking.
But speed is of the essence.

708
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,080
You have to work
with it while it's warm.

709
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,600
So it's kind of race against time.

710
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,360
The faster they work,
the more pliable the pastry.

711
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,320
Need to do this quick enough
to help it stay like Play-Doh

712
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,480
so I don't tear it. And if they can
rush out the rip-free shell...

713
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,960
Fridge... they'll have more time
to work on the filling.

714
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,640
And George isn't wasting any time
cracking on with his.

715
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,000
This is pretty much like
a Christmas dinner in a pie.

716
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,680
We've got sausage meat,
need to roll it bacon,

717
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,800
and then I've got to do...
I've got a lot to do.

718
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,440
We should stop talking. One second.

719
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,880
He's going all out
with his Christmas dinner pie.

720
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,840
The exterior will feature
a decorative pastry print,

721
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,000
the interior a duck
and turkey stuffing

722
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,440
and a giant bacon
and carrot wrapped sausage.

723
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,640
All right, getting there,
getting there.

724
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,920
This is my big massive sausage.

725
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,960
Can't tell what's sausage and what's
hands, to be honest with you.

726
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,160
HE LAUGHS

727
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,520
That's why I love you.
You're out of order.

728
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,680
Amanda's also shaping a sausage.

729
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,480
I do love to make my food with love.

730
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:49,000
So my sausage is beautifully
presented with bacon,

731
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,560
cherries and pistachios.

732
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,200
She aims to showcase her love
of gourmet food

733
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,840
with a pretty pate pie,

734
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,680
featuring her striking
chicken pate sausage,

735
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,040
a floral decoration and pork pigs.

736
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,120
My sausage is done

737
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,720
so I'm making my little piggies.

738
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,920
There's one.

739
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,960
Lizzie's also aiming
to serve a feast for the eyes.

740
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,440
I am making potato fishes.
It's gonna be unusual.

741
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,280
I want to be the Heston Blumenthal
of the tent.

742
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,480
She hopes to banish the memory
of her messy Technical

743
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,680
with a jaw-dropping Neptune Pie.

744
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,440
The top features a flamboyant
mermaid tail

745
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,040
and the centre,
her novel potato fish.

746
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,240
You're not panicking today?
You seem a bit calmer.

747
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,240
No, I'm a lot calmer today.
Like, I've practised this a couple
of times. It was quite funny

748
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,360
at home. It was like Where's Wally
but with the fish. Everyone was
like, "Have I found the fish yet?"

749
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,680
And I was like, you're just meant
to be able to see it!

750
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,000
THEY LAUGH

751
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,840
Animal designs are proving
a popular choice in the tent.

752
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,360
I've decided to decorate it as
an owl cos it's my wife's
favourite animal.

753
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,720
Um, and she's been incredibly
supportive in all of this.

754
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,000
And she's a much better baker
than I am.

755
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,160
Giuseppe hopes his wife
Laura love both the owl

756
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,280
and the interior which will include
three colourful fillings -

757
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,360
a circle of beef, spinach
and smoked mozzarella.

758
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,920
Lovely finger action you've got.

759
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,560
I know.

760
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,680
Do you think this is good enough for
my wife? Yeah, perfect. Thank you.

761
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,920
Giuseppe might want to wow his wife

762
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,760
but Crystelle's out to impress
her entire family.

763
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,880
Today's bake is dedicated
to my late, great grandmother

764
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,120
called Lila Nana. It's a curry. I
learnt how to make it from my mum.

765
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,440
Do you know what? This is, for me,
I think, my most sentimental bake.

766
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,040
Um, it's a family thing so, for me,

767
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,560
it's just... I really want to do
my family proud with this recipe.

768
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,840
An ode to her late,
great grandmother,

769
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,400
the pie will be shaped to mimic
Lily Nana's Kenyan cottage

770
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,800
and layered with two
of her home recipes -

771
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,960
potato curry and a Goan chicken
pickle curry.

772
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,120
But with a high liquid content,
Crystelle's risking a runny pie.

773
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,880
Getting a curry which is
usually just dumped on a plate

774
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,600
in a rectangular pie was tricky.
Is it going to remain fairly stable?

775
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,680
We don't want to cut in
and it just floods out.

776
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,080
But if it's a really good curry,
as it cools it'll get solid.

777
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,040
It should set slightly.
Exactly that.

778
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,320
Well, good luck,
this sounds amazing. Oh, thank you.

779
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,720
I'd quite like to move in.

780
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,800
Yeah, I would, yeah,
I'd move straight into that.

781
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,560
I hope it turns out OK. Thank you.

782
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,840
Don't want chicken curry
splashing all over you.

783
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,360
Crystelle might be concerned
her curry's too moist...

784
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,960
Oh, BLEEP.

785
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,600
Why's it so stiff?

786
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,360
..but George's giant sausage
is rock hard. Guys.

787
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:37,520
It's a bit frozen. Put it in
the freezer, I forgot about it.

788
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,200
God, I can't give Prue and Paul
food poisoning.

789
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,640
Bakers, you have three hours left!
You know when I said,
quick, let's do a time call?

790
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,280
I didn't mean let's do a time call
really quickly. But I liked it.

791
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,120
Feeling a bit overwhelmed. I think
I'm going to leave it five minutes.

792
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,280
While George worries about his
sausage, the rest of the bakers

793
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,120
can begin the build.

794
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,120
The last thing you want is
a soggy bottom so I'm using ham.

795
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,720
To stop any liquid.

796
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,400
Stopping a soggy bottom
is just the start.

797
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,240
Paul and Prue are expecting
a beautiful interior...

798
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,120
OK. Potato fishes.

799
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,120
So the fish is going to be, like,
floating in the pattern.

800
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,920
..each slice crammed with
mouthwatering ingredients.

801
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,600
Right, do it for Lily Nana.
Goan cuisine is going in.

802
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,320
Lots of different flavours.

803
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,720
But Chigs has just
one thing on his mind.

804
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,160
Me, I've got some pork
shoulder, pork neck.

805
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,760
This is a pork fest.
Chigs' Leicester Pork Pie.

806
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,440
HE LAUGHS

807
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,960
He's honouring his home county
Leicestershire,

808
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,400
famed for the Melton Mowbray
pork pie.

809
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,800
The centre will be enhanced
with a smattering of colour,

810
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,920
the top a lattice decoration.

811
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,320
Leicestershire is renowned for pork
pies so I hope I do 'em proud.

812
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,880
OK, decoration. This is the fastest
I'm ever going to work.

813
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,560
I'm hoping to bake soon.

814
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,000
I've made chimneys for the steam.
Now crucial moment.

815
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,360
OK. Come on, Crystelle.

816
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,160
Please work.

817
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,440
Trying to figure out how long
to bake cos got to give enough time

818
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,960
to basically cool it down as well.

819
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,880
Now timing is critical.

820
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,200
On top of baking, the bakers must
factor in chilling.

821
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,440
It's all a balancing act because
I want the whole thing fully cooked.

822
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,000
Also I'm going to need a long
cooling time after the baking

823
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,080
because I need to make sure
that the inside is set and
it doesn't collapse.

824
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,280
A good bake will count for nothing
if the pie falls apart.

825
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,040
I've got two hours left.

826
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,280
I need 40 minutes
to whack it in the fridge

827
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,840
so hopefully it'll be done
in 80 minutes.

828
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,920
Oh, fingers crossed.

829
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,560
But George needs more than luck
to fix his time keeping.

830
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,760
The sausage is in but I'm late.

831
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,960
Just rolling decorations on top.

832
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,040
Come on, come on, come on.
Freaking out.

833
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,080
And he isn't the only baker
who's fallen behind.

834
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,240
I've probably spent a bit more time
on decorating than I do normally.

835
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,960
It's my favourite bit, decorating.

836
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,480
I like to make things look nice.

837
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,200
Do you know what? My husband
gets a bit impatient

838
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,600
because I want to decorate 'em.
He just wants to eat the pie.

839
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,480
Just says,
"Get the pie in the oven."

840
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,840
Jesus, now what have I done?

841
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,680
Think I was a bit heavy
with the egg wash.

842
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,960
Don't have time for this.
I need to move now.

843
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,520
Done.

844
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,040
Why is it already leaking?
It hasn't even gone in the oven.

845
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,760
Leaking or not...

846
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,280
Just making all my decoration.
I am worried about the pie, though.

847
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,840
..all the bakers can do now is wait.

848
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,160
Yours is leaking.

849
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,480
Your dough's not leaking.
It is leaking. Can't you smell it?

850
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,200
This is getting stressful.
I should've brought a book.

851
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,000
George, what do you normally do

852
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,400
while you're waiting for something
to bake? What about your dancing?

853
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,640
What dancing? Tell Matt.

854
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,560
Oh, do you do Greek dancing?

855
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,840
No. Amanda.

856
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,520
We'll do it with you. I'm not doing
it. Quick, quick, quick.

857
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,600
Just a bit worried about my pie.
Come on, George.

858
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,920
She's the teacher. She knows it.
Well, go on, what is it? Go on,
then, Amanda. Right, teach Matt.

859
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,400
Left first. So we... Yeah.

860
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,400
THEY HUM

861
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,560
Stop. I'm going to do a wee in a
minute. Flipping heck. It's broke.

862
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,760
It's because I was a bit heavy with
the egg wash and it's just kind of
weighed it down.

863
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,040
George now has a huge decision
to make.

864
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,840
Should I fix the pie?
What the hell do I do?

865
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,200
Shut the door, shut the door,
shut the door, shut the door.

866
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,600
If he leaves his pie in the oven,
the top could fall apart.

867
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,360
But if he takes it out to repair it,
he'll lose vital baking time.

868
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,440
What... to... do.

869
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,320
Right, taking it out.

870
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,480
Feeling out of my depth.

871
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,360
This is pressure, man.
Come on, George.

872
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,640
Come on, man. Come on.

873
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,680
Need some leafage,

874
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,120
cover up the areas
that look messed up.

875
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,440
While George's pie heads back
into the oven, the others...

876
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,560
Come on, come on, come on.
..are coming out.

877
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,160
Go, go, go.

878
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,000
But the wait to unmould
isn't over just yet.

879
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,840
The pies must head to the freezer
to cool down.

880
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,000
Done. Now the filling needs to set
to avoid collapse.

881
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,440
It needs to chill
very, very quickly.

882
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,760
Now I'm nervous.
HE LAUGHS

883
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,440
George and Amanda have
a lot more to worry about.

884
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Mine's got ages. Never going to get
that cool enough to turn out.

885
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,960
They will have no choice
but to unmould molten pies

886
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,040
at risk of a full scale collapse.

887
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,200
Do you know what I wanna do?
I'm going to do this. That's better.

888
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,840
Is that so they can't film it?
No, it's so I can't see it. Oh.

889
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,280
Do you know what? Once I take it out
the tin

890
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,720
I'm sure it'll be a leaking mess
in there.

891
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,960
Quick announcement from
Paul Hollywood in balloon form.

892
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,840
Bakers, you've got half hour left.

893
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,720
Getting it out.

894
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,560
Good god, why is this
so bloody tense?

895
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,280
The cooled pies are finally
ready to unmould.

896
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,600
Let's go, let's go.
Let's get it done.

897
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,840
But for George and Amanda,
the agonising wait continues.

898
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,560
I think I'm going to give it
a little bit longer.
Couple more minutes.

899
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,160
Right, demoulding it.
Hopefully, no soggy bottoms.

900
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,920
And hopefully no collapsing
terrines, either.

901
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,720
Crunch time.

902
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,480
Yes. Phew!

903
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,920
Good. Amazing.

904
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,360
SHE SIGHS Come on.

905
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,040
Oh, no, no, no.

906
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,280
There is a bit of a crack
on the back.

907
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,080
Mine's cracked as well.
There's cracking everywhere.

908
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,760
Oh, look, it's leaked.
That's some serious leakage.

909
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,480
Right, taking it out.

910
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,160
Come on, George. I'm getting it
straight in that freezer.

911
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,120
Amanda, mine's leaking a hell of a
lot. Look. It's fine. What's wrong

912
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,280
with you? It looks perfect.
Yeah, but look at the leak. So?

913
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,440
Bakers, ten minutes left.

914
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,840
Monumental leak there, man.
This needs a bloody dam.

915
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,880
Because the juice is still very hot,
it might just all pour out.

916
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,360
I feel like everybody's waiting
for my pie to fall apart.

917
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,040
How do you get this thing off?
It's still hot. This is dangerous.

918
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,160
Jesus. Leaking.

919
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,000
Soggy bottom.

920
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,920
Praying it's OK.

921
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,440
Fingers crossed.

922
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,400
No pressure.

923
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,800
Oh, it collapsed. Oh, no.

924
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,000
Oh, no. Want a hand, Amanda?

925
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,640
Yes, please. It's gone.

926
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,280
It's come off. Oh!

927
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,120
It's not good.
The pie's stuck on the top.

928
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,680
Oh, mate.
Tell me what you want me to do.

929
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,760
Uh, push that back in.

930
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,360
Just stick the knife under there
so I can get the thing back on.

931
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,360
This is hot, Amanda. Sorry.

932
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,920
Go on, there you go.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

933
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,920
They can fix that. I can't watch.
I know. It's too stressful.

934
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,880
Quick. Don't move it, don't move it,
don't move it, don't move it.
You're going to tear it all up.

935
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,920
Do it slowly. That's it,
that's it, that's it.

936
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,640
Hold fire.

937
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,840
All right, I'm not going to attempt
to take it out of the bottom tray.

938
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,880
Risking the whole thing to collapse.

939
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,600
Do you know what? That's better.

940
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,880
It's all kind of breaking apart,
which is really sad.

941
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,720
Um, but I'm just hoping
if I could just cover all

942
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,800
the cracks I might be safe.
I'm going to lift it.

943
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,640
Ah. Ouch, ouch, ouch.

944
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,040
Slide it underneath. One, two.

945
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,040
Oh. It's collapsing.

946
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,640
Got to get this off.

947
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:20,200
Oh, no. No, it's proper broken.
Panicking now. It's a mess.

948
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,240
I can't watch.

949
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,800
All right, let's lift it off
the bottom tin. Quick.

950
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,880
Oh, no, no, there's a lip there,
babe, you're going to tear it.
Guys, be careful. I've left mine on.

951
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,840
You've left it on? Yeah. I don't
think it makes any difference now.

952
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,560
Ahhh!

953
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,320
Juice everywhere, isn't there?

954
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,240
Bakers, you have one minute left.

955
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,760
Oh, got a minute.
Repair, repair, repair.

956
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,080
It's like watching
open heart surgery. It is.

957
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,640
Which side shall I put the pigs on?
LAUGHING: This side!

958
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,560
This side, the good side.

959
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,760
Quick, quick, pigs,
pigs, pigs, pigs.

960
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,640
It's gonna hold my pie.

961
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,600
Bakers, your time is up.

962
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,240
Oh. Well done.

963
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,200
Well done for getting it out.
What a disaster.

964
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,320
Sorry, babe. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
It's OK.

965
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,480
I couldn't do anything else.
It's fine, it's not your fault.

966
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,320
I feel your pain, Amanda.
This is messed up.

967
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,840
It's judgement time for
the decorative terrine pies.

968
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,960
Lizzie, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper?

969
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,160
Well, it's certainly
unusual-looking.

970
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,320
It's very bold. I love the design.

971
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,640
I like the fish.
I think the scales look great.

972
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,960
Let's have a look inside, shall we?

973
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,200
Held together nicely and the
fish going through there. Yeah.

974
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,240
Little fish.

975
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,640
You've nearly got that spot on,
Lizzie. I love that.

976
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,400
Your pastry's too thick.
But I quite like the flavour.

977
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,840
I think it's remarkable.

978
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,840
The spinach and the fish,
they're not overcooked

979
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,920
because they've been in there
quite a long time. Thanks.

980
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,720
It's a really perfect owl,
isn't it?

981
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,560
"Ow, don't hurt me."

982
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,920
The design is fantastic.

983
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,000
Good pastry. It's firm enough,
but it's crumblier.

984
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,280
The cheese and all the flavours
blends well with the beef.

985
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,200
It looks very professional.
It's very Giuseppe.

986
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,200
It's excellent, Giuseppe.

987
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,840
I think the pastry,
you've sort of cracked it slightly

988
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,360
handling it out of the tin.
Juice was leaking out of there.

989
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,920
It looks lovely.

990
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,520
You get apricot, you get gherkin.
I think all the flavours work well.

991
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,200
But the design
is pretty uninspiring.

992
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,520
That was a big deal for me,
that was!

993
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,760
I love the vine leaves. Oh, look
at that. I think that's beautiful.

994
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,760
Really beautifully done.

995
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,400
I think the pastry tastes delicious.
But the beef has gone very, very

996
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,160
dry. It is a bit too dry,
but I do think you get away with it,

997
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,720
because you've got the horseradish.
Thank you, Jurgen.

998
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,880
What happened? I should have really
got it in the oven earlier

999
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,240
so it had time to cool down.

1000
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,960
But when I took it, the side of it,
one side came away. Ah, right, OK.

1001
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,920
It's very good-looking.

1002
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,720
It's very pretty.

1003
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,920
It's bone-dry. I think
your seasoning is pretty strong,

1004
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,680
cos there's so many things going on
in your mouth. And you try to

1005
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,400
identify it, but there's just
a mix of a lot of different things.

1006
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,680
But I do like the pate. For me,
the pate is the one thing that is

1007
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,360
a bit too strong.

1008
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,160
Thank you, Amanda.

1009
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:54,440
It's quite dramatic.
I like the two-tone pastry.

1010
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,440
But it's underbaked,
and it's collapsed down. Yeah, yeah.

1011
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,160
I got it in the oven late,
which was unfortunate.

1012
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,480
My tray's under there, Paul.
It was too hot to handle!

1013
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,000
Nice interior.

1014
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,280
Mm.

1015
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,800
Mm!

1016
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,320
That sausage meat...

1017
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,960
..I question whether it's cooked.
I probed it three times, Paul.

1018
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,400
You did? 92 in the centre.
Right, OK.

1019
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,080
It is a bit mushy.
It's very mushy, yeah.

1020
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,840
It's a pity, because the bacon,
that is delicious.

1021
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,560
That's a shame, that,
George. Thank you.

1022
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,320
Such a beautiful cottage.

1023
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,760
And I love all the little flowers

1024
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,280
and the way you've decorated them

1025
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,760
and had time to paint them.
Oh, look at that.

1026
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,200
Wow! That's SO cool!
The colour layers are lovely.

1027
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,640
And you've separated them
with sweet potato. Yeah.

1028
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,920
Have you seen this here?

1029
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,800
No...

1030
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,800
Well done.

1031
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:24,600
That curry, the way you've broken it
down into sections, and each one,

1032
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,280
for me - the spice blend, the hot
water crust pastry, the design...

1033
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,200
I absolutely agree, Crystelle.
It's brave to make curry pie.

1034
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,600
It's witty, it's charming.
And often, things that are witty

1035
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,440
and charming are not also
absolutely delicious.

1036
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,760
And you've got the pastry perfectly.
Spot-on. Really, really good.

1037
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,760
Well done.
Thank you so much!

1038
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,240
A handshake on the Showstopper,
that's very rare!

1039
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,160
I'm just in so much shock. I was
like, "Something's gone wrong."

1040
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,680
And then out came his hand,
and I just died. I literally died.

1041
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,680
So maybe I'm a ghost.
Maybe that's why I feel weird.

1042
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,320
They complimented the design,
which was good.

1043
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,360
So I'm tying to focus
on the positive,

1044
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,080
but, yeah, I do feel like I'm in
danger. It is what it is, isn't it?

1045
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,760
Someone has to go home,
and if it's my time to go,

1046
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,040
then it's my time to go.

1047
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,440
We should pay tribute
to these bakers,

1048
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,880
because the standard has been
so good this week.

1049
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,960
I think, coming into today, we were
talking about Amanda in a little bit

1050
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,520
of trouble, we were talking about
Lizzie being in trouble.

1051
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,200
But the person who did well
out of this was Lizzie,

1052
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,720
because I think she saved herself,
to the detriment of George.

1053
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,040
I think George and Amanda
are in a little bit of trouble.

1054
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:54,600
George today, I wasn't happy at all
with that. So, Star Baker is...?

1055
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,400
I think Star Baker is
either Giuseppe or Crystelle.

1056
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,800
She really smashed it.
You gave her a handshake.

1057
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,560
I know. I don't like
giving handshakes.

1058
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,360
It hurts you, doesn't it?
It does, yeah!

1059
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,280
But I think, ultimately,
that deserved it.

1060
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,360
It was a bit of magic, that one.
It was. Very clever.

1061
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,080
But I think Giuseppe's done really
well, as well. It looked amazing.

1062
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,360
I loved his meat, though.

1063
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,680
Are you talking about
Giuseppe's meat? I looked down at it

1064
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,240
just as I said it. That's what it
was. We're all friends here. I know.

1065
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:41,600
Well done, bakers, on another week.
It's not easy to find a Star Baker,

1066
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,200
but the judges have done it.
This week's Star Baker is...

1067
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,800
..Crystelle!
APPLAUSE

1068
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,360
Thank you. God!

1069
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,720
Oh, that means I've got the horrible
job of announcing the person

1070
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,840
who's leaving us. This gets tougher.

1071
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,480
It does get tougher every week,
and this has been an amazing week.

1072
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:13,560
But the person who is leaving us
this week is...

1073
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,960
..Amanda.

1074
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,720
Thank you.

1075
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,080
It's OK. I'm all right.

1076
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,320
Is it all right? I knew it
cos you kept looking at me.

1077
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,080
I mean, you've got to go
sometime, haven't you?

1078
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,840
I didn't think when I got here
I'd get that far after seeing all

1079
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,800
the other bakers,
but I've had such a good time.

1080
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,000
Going to miss you.
You'll be all right, guys.

1081
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,200
I'll see you in a few weeks.

1082
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,600
Do you know what? I came here
to have a good time.

1083
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,120
It's a little bit stressful here,
but it's a kind of fun stress.

1084
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,800
Perhaps if I didn't talk so much,
I might have got a bit further.

1085
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,160
But I enjoyed it,
so I'm glad I did what I did.

1086
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,680
Oh, God!

1087
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,280
I mean, that's a shock. My name
was going over and over in my head.

1088
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,640
I was preparing myself. I was just
saying, "George. George. George."

1089
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,720
And then they called Amanda,
and I could not believe it.

1090
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,840
This has given me a big push
to fight for my place.

1091
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,360
That pie!

1092
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,920
I don't often give out handshakes
in Showstoppers,

1093
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,280
but Crystelle deserved it.
It was perfection, in my eyes.

1094
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:32,320
ON PHONE: Hello? Hi. Is everyone
there? Yeah. I got Star Baker!

1095
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,320
SHRIEKING ON PHONE

1096
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,440
And, guys?

1097
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,320
Guys, guys, Paul gave me a handshake
in the Showstopper.

1098
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,520
SHRIEKING

1099
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,720
Oh, God! And people
wonder why I'm loud!

1100
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,120
Next time: It's like a little
science experiment, isn't it?

1101
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,520
..caramel week...
Nasty little thing, caramel.

1102
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:11,080
..sees the bakers in sticky
situations with the Signature...

1103
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:14,520
This isn't right... take on
a ten-fingered Technical...

1104
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,040
Paul is demanding perfection.

1105
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:21,320
..and struggle with an architectural
sugar Showstopper.

1106
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:25,200
There's a crack. Who will
make it to the quarterfinal?

1107
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,240
Hands up who's having
a heart attack.

1108
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,600
And who... Where's me balls?
..will come unstuck?

1109
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,680
Group heart attacks, everyone?

1110
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,440
