it takes a couple of days,

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,640
[chuckling] whereas doing it in a couple
of hours is very challenging.

36

Bakers, welcome back to the tent
for Bread Week.

37
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,040
Yeah, it's bread week. I'm so excited.
Do you know who else is excited?

38
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,160
Paul Hollywood.

[Noel] For your Signature challenge,

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,760
the judges would like you to make
a perfectly baked focaccia.

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,080
You can make your focaccia in any style
you like or any flavour you like.

47
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,760
It needs to have a crispy crust and also
an open, irregular crumb structure.

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,960
-You have no idea what that means, do you?
-[laughs] Not at all.

49
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,800
You just say what they tell you
to say, don't you?

50
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,720
Yeah.

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,120
-[Matt] You have two hours and 45 minutes.
-On your marksâ¦

52
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,600
-Get setâ¦
-Dance!

53
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,160
{\an8}We're making Italian bread.
It doesn't get more Italian than focaccia.

54
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,120
{\an8}That's why I feel a lot of pressure on me.

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,560
{\an8}[George] Hopefully, it all comes together.

56
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,440
{\an8}Or it might be a disaster,
but let's hope that it's not.

57
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,720
[Paul] It's Bread Week,
and for the Signature bake,

58
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,520
we've challenged the bakers
to make a beautiful focaccia.

59
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,720
[Prue] The outside must be crusty,

60
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,480
and the inside has to be soft
with an open crumb

61
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,400
but rather irregular sort of big
and little holes, but quite loose.

62
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,880
The bakers should understand that you need
a lot of water in a focaccia.

63
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,480
If they don't put a lot of water in,
it will be very cake-y.

64
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
Done, done, done.

65
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,400
After its second rise,
you have to poke little dimples in it.

66
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,760
And that's where
they can introduce flavours.

67
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,240
Whether it's tomatoes, olives, rosemary,
garlic, it's entirely up to them.

68
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,120
{\an8}Keep it simple. Stick to what you know
when you don't know nothing. [laughs]

69
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,800
Morning, Giuseppe.

70
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,640
-Good morning. Good morning.
-Hello, Giuseppe.

71
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,160
Tell us all about your focaccia.

72
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,960
My focaccia is called Breakfast in Gaeta

73
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,360
because it reminds me of the breakfast
I used to have in Gaeta, my hometown,

74
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,480
with my grandmother.

75
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,360
These olives have been
flown back from Gaeta,

76
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,560
so they are the ones
that are harvested in my hometown.

77
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,000
And the oil has been made
by my father-in-law.

78
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,160
Sounds lovely.

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,160
{\an8}[Matt] <i>Alongside</i>
<i>his imported olives and olive oil,</i>

80
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,600
{\an8}<i>Giuseppe's focaccia will include</i>
<i>one other unique ingredient.</i>

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,040
In terms of liquid,
I've got a mix of water and milk.

82
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,040
Milk in focaccia.
Is that what your grandmother did?

83
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,479
No, not at all.
My grandmother used to buy her bread.

84
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
-[laughter]
-Rather than making it.

85
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,039
[Noel] <i>Another baker sticking</i>
<i>with Italian flavoursâ¦</i>

86

<i>-â¦is Maggie.</i>

88

{\an8}A traditional flavour's traditional
because it was good in the first place.

89
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,360
So I'm staying
with traditional taste throughout this.

90
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,800
[Noel] <i>Sun-dried and cherry tomatoes,</i>
<i>basil, and garlic</i>

<i>thyme-flavoured focaccia.</i>

92
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,520
I'm using a strong bread flour
with a bit of yeast, a little bit of salt,

93
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
{\an8}and flavouring with a little bit of thyme.

94
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,800
{\an8}And that's it, really.

95

[Noel] <i>While Maggie's</i>

100
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,760
uh, me and me family

101

and just eat a lot of carbs.

102
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,760
So it's truffle and garlic confit.

103
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,240

peasant bread for a prince.

<i>â¦and the toppings</i>
<i>won't stick to the bread.</i>

295
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,080
These are my pride and joy.
They are small bombs of flavour.

296
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,120
[Amanda] I'm doing them
in lines like that.

297
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,200
So if someone
doesn't like feta, you can just avoid.

298
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,200
I'm just spreading it out
so, you know, it's not uneven.

299
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,400
Then I'm gonna bake.

300
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,840
[Crystelle] Come on, be good to me.
Please be good to me.

301
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,720
I'm going in for 18 minutes,
and it should be perfectly done by then.

302
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,800
I'm going to put it on the bottom shelf
and bake it for a bit longer.

303
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,560
I'll do ten minutes on 240
and then turn it down.

304
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,680
Temperature sets the crust.
Time sets the crumb.

305
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,000
-[Noel] You all right?
-[George] I have to redo my dough.

306
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,040
-[Noel] Why?
-It wasn't wet enough.

307
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,760
[Noel] Crazy, this baking.

308
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,600
Too wet, not wet enough.
How long do you have to put it in for?

309
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,480
-Depends how wet it is.
-I know.

310
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,640
[both laugh]

311
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,520
-I meanâ¦ Bread.
-Oh, man!

312
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,000
I would love to prove this a bit longer,
but I'm going in.

313
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,120
This is the time everybody
in <i>Bake Off</i> starts looking in their oven.

314
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,520
At home, I've never looked in my oven.

315
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,520
[Giuseppe] Not thinking
of anything other than the focaccia.

316
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,360
If this tent collapses,
I probably won't notice. [laughs]

317
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,920
[Freya] I don't know
what I should be looking at.

318
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,520
I don't know if itâ¦ I don't know if I'mâ¦

319
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,040
I don't know. [chuckles]

320
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,280
-Should be regular, but open.
-Should be regular.

321
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,120
-Uh, yeah?
-Open.

322
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,360
-We're talking crumb structure.
-Yes.

323
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,120
-This hasn't happened before.
-[chuckles]

324
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,320
What's happened to me? I used to be funny.

325
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,720
[both laughing]

326
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,160
You just have to go with timings.
Timing and a bit of feel.

327
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,640
Just don't want it to brown too much.

328
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,280
Butchers, you have five minutes left.

329
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,520
Did he says butchers?

330
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,240
-Bakers.
-Oh, damn.

331
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,560
Don't panic, don't panic.

332
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,840
[timer beeping]

333

[groans]

334
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,360
Please let it be all right. There we go!

335
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,920
Okay, that's got a nice crust on it.

336
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,680
[Giuseppe] Looks done.

337
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,600
It looks dark, but it's, like, not huge.

338
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,120
-[timer beeping]
-That's me. Time's up.

339
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,120
Everyone else's is out
and mine's still in.

340
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
This is just truffle oil.

341
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,480
I'll give it a few minutes
in the tin and tip it out onto that.

342
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,040
[Crystelle] Bit of fresh fennel going on.

343
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,680
Do you know how long we've got?

344
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,600
Bakers, you have one minute remaining.

345
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
-Did he say one minute?
-Yeah.

346
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,240
[groans]

347
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Come on, get out. Get out! [chuckles]

348
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,360
It's just too much stress,
isn't it, really?

349
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,960
Try and get that under there
without ripping it.

350
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,160
-The dreaded flip!
-Come on, go, go, go, yeah!

351
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,920
Bakers, your time is up!

352
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,880
Oh, my mum! [chuckles]

353
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,280
[Matt] Please step away from your bakes.

354
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,200
Crystelle!

355
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,880
-[chuckles]
-Bit childish, but, you know, still cute.

356
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,280
We don't have
big bubbles sticking out also,

357
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,880
but we don't know until we cut into it.

358
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,600
Ay, ay, ay.

359
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,720
[Noel] <i>The bakers'</i>
<i>Signature focaccia breads</i>

360
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,960
<i>now face the judgment of Paul and Prue.</i>

361
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
-Hello, George.
-Hello.

362
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,800
[Paul] I know you did the dough again.

363
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,360
-Is this your second or your first?
-Second.

364
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,680
[Paul] It's packed
and I like that in a focaccia.

365
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,000
Sort of busy.

366
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,760
-[Prue] I think that's lovely, George.
-Thank you.

367
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,560
The bake is good. You created a good blend
of flavours all the way through.

368
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,080
You just needed a little bit
more water to open it up a bit more.

369
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,640
But I think you're sort of
85% of the way there.

370
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,039
And you were definitely right
to redo the dough.

371
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,400
Yeah.

372
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,680
[Prue] Looks very attractive.

373
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,319
[Paul] It's gotta be pushed down
till you feel the tray.

374
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,240
-[Maggie] Oh, right.
-That far down.

375
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,640
I like that stretchy soft texture.

376
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,160
It's very soft on the top,
which defeats the object a little bit.

377
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,520
But I do like the flavours.
I love the thyme in there.

378
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,120
Maybe a little bit more mixing.

379
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,840
-But overall, it's a decent focaccia.
-Thank you. [chuckles]

380
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,240
[Paul] This smells great.

381
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,560
The texture's nice.

382
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,760
I get the pepper and the cayenne
in there, little hint of paprika.

383
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,880
It's well baked.

384
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,200
I'm really relieved,

385
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,080
because I thought it was going
to be over-spiced and it's not.

386
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,960
-It's really delicately done.
-Ah, thank you!

387
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,240
[Paul] Love the design on the top
like you've scorched it.

388
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,680
-Wow.
-[Prue] That's all garlic.

389
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,920
-Strong, isn't it?
-Yeah. [laughs]

390
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,520
The texture is okay.
The problem is it's very strong of garlic.

391
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,680
I would have put the garlic on the top,
pushed it in.

392
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,120
In this piece there isn't any,
but loads in this one.

393
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,160
It's about keeping it all regular.

394
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,200
Let's ask the vampire
what you think of that.

395
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,080
Yeah, I can't go near that. [chuckling]

396
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,560
-[Paul] He backs away from it as well.
-[chuckling]

397
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,800
It's overbaked.
Needed to come out five minutes before.

398
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,920
-You put the filling in lines, didn't you?
-Yeah.

399
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
[Prue] Think I prefer it scattered
so you get a bit of everything.

400
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,400
If you'd put less flavours,
one of everything in one bite,

401
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,640
then you'd have smashed it.

402
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,760
Thank you.

403
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,520
When you put cheese on like this,
you end up with a dry spot,

404
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,240
and then you're going to have
exposed areas of dough.

405
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,200
And that'll always catch.
So what you've done is over-baked this.

406
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,760
-The flavours are lovely. Really powerful.
-[Chigs] Yeah?

407
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
-Great flavours there.
-It's delicious.

408
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,640
It's quite an open structure,
but it needed to be much, much thicker.

409
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,240
That's beautiful, annoyingly thin.

410
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,560
-Okay.
-It needed to be a little bit thicker.

411
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,640
And that was beautiful.
Great flavour combination.

412
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,040
And it's so unusual because it's so fresh.

413
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,240
Highly unusual, but beautiful.

414
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,760
-Well done.
-[Paul] Thank you.

415
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,720
[sighs] Thank you!

416
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,040
[Prue] It looks really nice.

417
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,880
[Paul] It's got a nice top,
it's fairly equal.

418
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,040
You've filled the tin quite nicely.

419
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,760
I think it's lovely. Good flavour,
nice and soft, crisp on the outside.

420
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,320
You could've proved it a little bit longer
just to open it up a little bit more,

421
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,480
but you have an irregular
structure with a crispy top

422
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,880
and a fantastic flavour and colour,
so I can't fault it that much.

423
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,680
-I think it's a great focaccia.
-Ta.

424
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,240
-[Paul] It's slightly over-baked.
-Mmm-hmm.

425
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,680
[Paul] You have a big wet spot
that runs down there along the base.

426
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,520
More proving and less baking.

427
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,680
It's quite tight inside.
It needed more mixing.

428
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,440
It does break pretty easily.
It's more cake-like than bread-like.

429
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,240
JÃ¼rgen, I'm not absolutely mad
about the flavours.

430
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,960
I normally love kippers.

431
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,520
I just think it could have been
a little bit better.

432
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,040
It's the sort of focaccia
that I would bake,

433
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
-but let's have a look inside, shall we?
-Yes.

434
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,800
It's really nice. It's soft,
and yet it's got the focaccia structure.

435
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,400
[Paul] Shows it's proved correctly.

436
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,480
But the thing that I particularly like,
you haven't gone overboard with flavour.

437
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,240
And made a beautifully light focaccia.

438
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,360
And you get a mouthful
of everything on every bite.

439
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,440
-That's what focaccia is.
-Thank you.

440
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,200
I think it's beautiful. Well done.

441
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,320
[all applauding]

442
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,000
[Prue] Are you all right, Giuseppe?
[laughs]

443
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,640
[Paul] So this is your recipe,
and you must give it to me.

444
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,640
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

445
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,360
-[whispers] Well done! Nice!
-Wow.

446
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,760
[both exhale in relief]

447
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,560
[Giuseppe whispering indistinctly]

448
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,280
[Giuseppe] I got a little emotional
because I never thought I would get one.

449
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,960
I was expecting a "but" there,
so you knowâ¦

450
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,560
"But this is wrong.
But you should have done this different."

451
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,080
[Crystelle] I'm quite okay with that.
"Annoyingly thin."

452
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,120
But I don't mind being annoyingly thin.

453
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,880
Considering I started again,
things turned out pretty well.

454
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,560
[JÃ¼rgen] <i>This time,</i>
<i>it didn't go 100% well.</i>

455
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,400
Paul and Prue certainly
have high standards.

456
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,160
<i>And having had two Star Bakers,</i>
<i>they're expecting things.</i>

457
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,880
But it's not a tragedy.

458
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,760
[Noel] <i>The Bakers</i>
<i>could practise their focaccia,</i>

459
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,080
<i>but have no idea what awaits them</i>
<i>in the Technical challenge.</i>

460
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,960
Welcome back, bakers.

461
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,040
It's Bread week, so obviously,
Paul's set your Technical challenge today.

462
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,480
Paul, any words of advice?

463
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,880
It's a fairly complicated recipe,
but be careful how you add the filling.

464
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,200
As ever, this task is judged blind.

465
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,240
So Paul and Prue,
if you'd like to leave the tent.

466
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,880
Bye-bye. We will miss you.

467
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,000
For your Technical challenge,

468
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,800
Paul would like you each

469
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,680
to make a batch of 15 olive and cheese
ciabatta breadsticks.

470
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,320
Your ciabatta breadsticks have to have
that classic ciabatta holey texture

471
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,680
with an even distribution
of cheese and olives.

472
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,120
They should be served
alongside a tzatziki dip.

473
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,120
Noel, do you have anything
amusing to say about tzatziki?

474
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,880
Funny you should ask, Matthew,

475
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,480
because I peered into
Prue's dressing room earlier,

476
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,120
and Paul was on his knees,

477
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,800
rubbing tzatziki into Prue's feet
while she was asleep. [chuckles]

478
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,360
-Really?
-Yeah.

479
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,960
Did that happen?

480
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,840
I don't know. How am I supposed to know
what's real life and what's a dream?

481
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,600
Well, what do you think this is?
Is this real or a dream?

482
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,360
This is definitely a nightmare.

483
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,320
Yeah. Yeah, I used to be in films.

484
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,960
Okay. You have two hours.

485
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,360
-On your marksâ¦
-[sing-song] Get setâ¦

486
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,120
Bake!

487
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,360
What a genuine nightmare.

488
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,200
Never made ciabatta,
never made breadsticks.

489
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,920
And never made ciabatta breadsticks.

490
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,720
I think I can blag my way through it.

491
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,880
I think. We will see.

492
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,520
Bread knowledge bomb. [mimics explosion]

493
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,400
[chuckles]

494
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,480
[Paul] So we're looking for
a gorgeous ciabatta stick,

495
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,440
obviously all the same size
and the same colour.

496
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,560
Nice and brown.

497
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,600
Too pale, they'll just flop.

498
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,720
Ciabatta. It's a very soft dough.
Quite tricky to work with.

499
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,800
-You're trying to keep the air in.
-[Paul] Yeah. They gotta be careful.

500
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,280
-[cracking]
-[Prue] Have that ciabatta rip.

501
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,640
[Paul] If you look inside,
you see a beautiful open structure.

502
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,640
-It's full of cheese. It's full of olives.
-Mmm.

503
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,440
Heaven.

504
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,040
Now we have an Italian in the tent.

505
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,760
He will know what ciabatta is,

506
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,440
but is he wise enough
to be able to produce these sticks?

507
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,200
He'll be rather carrying the flag
for his country, won't he? [chuckles]

508
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,760
I've never made ciabatta bread.
So this is gonna be an interesting one.

509
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,280
[Maggie] "Make the dough."

510
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,240
What could be simpler than that?

511
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,600
Six hundred grams of water,
750 grams of flour.

512
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,080
It's 80% hydration, this dough,
so it's gonna be very wet and sticky.

513
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,480
The mix is kind of just
letting it swill about.

514
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,800
Oh, golly gosh,
that cannot be good, can it?

515
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,360
Starting to slapâ¦

516
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,560
As we say <i>a schiaffeggiare,</i>
as we say in Italian.

517
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,240
So when the dough slaps
against the faces of the bowl,

518
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,960
that's a good sign
that it's coming together.

519
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,440
[Freya] And I thought focaccia
was a wet dough.

520
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,440
This is just water.

521
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,560
Number two is, "Add olives,
manchego, onion and coriander."

522
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,720
-Are you a fan of breadsticks?
-[Crystelle] Not really.

523
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,720
Food you only eat
when you're really hungry.

524
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,520
-Am I right?
-Yeah, it's a waste of time.

525
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,680
I completely agree.

526
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,520
This task is a waste of time!

527
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,840
As you were. Carry on.

528
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,280
I'm contemplating
whether to chop the olives

529
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,800
or just to leave them.

530
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,440
I am putting my olives in whole.

531
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,560
I'll go with that, otherwise the whole
olive will be as thick as the breadstick.

532
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,000
I was gonna put it on the bench,
but I feel like it's too sticky.

533
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,400
-Erâ¦
-You all right?

534
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,080
Looks like I'm dealing
with troll bogies, doesn't it?

535
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,240
Who eats a breadstick?

536
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,800
-Who?
-I don't mind a breadstick.

537
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,680
[laughs]

538
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,800
Something wrong with you then.

539
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,160
I'm quite working class,

540
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,160
so I didn't know
what a breadstick was until I was 18.

541
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,760
Uh, number three says, "Prove."

542
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,680
[George] Get in there, you lovely boy.

543
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,440
-I'm going to beâ¦
-[timer beeping]

544
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,480
â¦on the safe side
and only leave them 20 minutes.

545
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,600
It's faster and I need fast.

546
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,800
I'd ideally like to prove for an hour
but I might cut it short.

547
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,600
Surely ciabatta in two hours
is not normal.

548
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,720
[sighs] <i>Bake Off</i> isn't normal, is it?

549
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,840
[chuckling]

550
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,760
-[laughs]
-[Amanda] There he is.

551
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,440
[both laughing]

552
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,800
Bakers, you are halfway through!

553
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,400
-Well done.
-No, I haven't finished.

554
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,280
â¦ooh. Right, now I'm finished.

555
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,240
[chuckling] He might be.

556
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,280
And now, I'm gonna make the tzâ¦
Whatever that thing is.

557
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,040
[George] Tzatziki. If I get this wrong,

558
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,280
I won't be able to set foot
in Cyprus again.

559
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,480
I'm grating cucumbers to drain them.

560
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,880
You don't get taught that in school.

561
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,720
You put a condom on a cucumber in school,
you don't grate them.

562
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,640
[George] Done.

563
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,840
This will mean nothing
if the bread sticks don't turn out.

564
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,360
-There's the onions.
-[Noel] Oh, you forgot the onions.

565
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,520
-Forgot the onions.
-Can't you open that andâ¦ [whooshes]

566
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,480
No, because it's half-proved.

567
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,320
[Noel] What are you going to do,
how're you going to play it?

568
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,360
I'm not going to worry.

569
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,360
[Matt] <i>Judging how long</i>
<i>to leave their dough</i>

570
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,960
<i>for the first prove is critical.</i>

571
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,800
I just think it is not ready.

572
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,760
[Matt] <i>Too short a prove,</i>

573
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,560
<i>and it won't develop</i>

I'm just gonnaâ¦ I'm just gonnaâ¦
I'm just gonna leave myself five minutes.

[Matt] <i>Too long and they risk</i>
<i>running out of time to bake.</i>

576
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,680
I just don't want to rush
this first prove.

577
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,440
Is your mum an amazing cook?

578
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,840
-Uh, my dad is.
-Your dad's an amazing cook.

579
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,680
Mum is more of an amazing eater.

580
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,720
[laughing]

581
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,000
She's the taster.

582
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,000
The truth is, you probably know
more about bread than Paul.

583
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,720
[grunts] That's a bold statement.

584
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,120
I just said that.

585
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,320
[Chigs] Well, that looks decent.

586
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,520
It has risen.
You can see lots of bubbles all around.

587
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,280
"Cut the dough into 15 sticks,
approximately 35 centimetres long,

588
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,360
and place onto three prepared
baking trays."

589
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,000
[George] No, manâ¦
I don't know what I'm doing.

590
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,360
I know they're
supposed to be in stick form,

591
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,440
so that's good, that's in the name.

592
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,160
Approximately 35 centimetres,
which is hella long.

593
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,560
God, it can't be 35.

594
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,200
It's not even gonna fit on the, erâ¦
Oh, the other way, Freya. Sick.

595
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,080
[Amanda] That one's 35. Now. [chuckles]

596
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,640
That's going to be a bit thin.
So don't tell him that one.

597
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,680
Paul and Prue make a bit of an issue
if they think sizes don't match.

598
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,440
I know,
but these are not in a supermarket.

599
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,400
They're in a Greek taverna.

600
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,240
-They won't fall for that.
-[chuckles]

601
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,600
[Giuseppe] I'm hoping that,
by twisting them,

602
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,440
I can keep the ingredients in better.

603
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,600
-[Noel] You all right?
-Yeah.

604
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,120
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I'm learning counting.

605
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,280
-[chuckling] Learning counting?
-Yeah.

606
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,920
It's probably a bit late now.

607
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,880
-[Noel] Do you need this?
-No, you can eat it.

608
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,520
-[dough smacks]
-[gasps]

609
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,800
[both laughing]

610
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,120
Oh, my God!

611
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
-Stop it!
-Yeah. [laughs]

612
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,640
Was that you? JÃ¼rgen, I didn't know
you had that in you.

613
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,720
[Chigs] Come on. Second prove.

614
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,560
Give 'em as long to prove as possible.

615
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,840
[Lizzie] How do you get 'em in these bags?

616
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,960
Bakers, you are half an hour away
from victory, tragedy or comedy.

617
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,440
Or maybe all three.

618
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,400
I think I'm going to go
for, like, eight more minutes,

619
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,600
and then I'm going
to stick them in the oven.

620
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,360
The proof is very key, but given
the time restriction on this challenge,

621
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,360
ermâ¦

622
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,240
I'll do two 30-minute proofs,
which is very, very little.

623
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,680
So when you're home
and you're proving stuff, what do you do?

624
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,120
Er, read, maybe go for a run.

625
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,040
Wow. You definitely
haven't got children, have you?

626
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,040
-No, hell no.
-[chuckles]

627
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,760
Reading. Let me think, I remember that.
Going for a run.

628
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,200
Hang on.
I'm just going back into the archives.

629
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,440
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

630
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,000
There it is, look, one word. "Bake."

631
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,640
Okay, I'm just going in.

632
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,720
[Giuseppe] It's high temperature, 220.
I'm hoping that twenty minutes is enough.

633
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,520
[Amanda] I'm going to go for 12,

634
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,880
and then I'll have a look halfway
and see how they are.

635
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,440
[sighs]

636
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,720
I'll keep this in for a bit longer.

637
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,080
[Rochica] I haven't shaped them
all at the same time.

638
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,360
So I don't want
to put them all in at the same time.

639
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,400
-[timer beeping]
-I'm gonna do ten minutes at first

640
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,720
and then check them.

641
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,320
It will be what it is.

642
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,720
[Crystelle] Has everyone
put theirs in the oven?

643
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,080
Good. Just me.

644
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,600
I don't know if I'm doing this right,
but I feel like long proof, short bake.

645
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,160
[Freya] Don't even know
how long breadsticks usually take.

646
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,520
I just don't want them to be raw.

647
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,400
Bakers, you have 15 hours left.

648
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,680
-Minutes.
-[in silly accent] Same difference.

649
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,680
Maybe I'll just put them in.
Please be good to me, please.

650
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,880
Okay, that's fine.

651
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,120
We should bake
on a "bread" setting at 220.

652
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,760
[gasps] Oh. Turning it up a little bit.

653
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,880
Okay, so it says, "bread oven, 220."
So I've set my oven to 220 now.

654
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,600
There's no point opening the oven door,

655
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,400
I'm just gonna let cold air in.
They're not cooked yet.

656
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,920
They're not overcooked.

657
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,560
Let's turn the oven up.

658
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,840
They're looking out at me. Olive eyes.

659
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,480
[chuckling]

660
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,680
[Rochica] Take those ones out,
'cause there's like cheese,

661
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,280
I don't want to over-bake them.

662
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,840
How long have we got left?

663
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,000
Bakers, you have five minutes
remaining in this task.

664
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,600
You will then have to end the task.

665
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,560
Once that's happened,
then obviously the task will be over.

666
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,160
And then there'll be some judging and--

667
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,920
-You got four minutes left.
-[laughs]

668
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,960
Should I take them out?

669
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,040
They're still a bit blonde.

670
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,640
Perhaps I should put the grill on.

671
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,760
They take surprisingly long.

672
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,120
So I think it's good I went in when I did.

673
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,280
Come on.

674
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,480
I need to get a wriggle on.

675
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,840
So over Bread Week.

676
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,120
Oh, Giuseppe, yours are browning nicely.

677
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,800
I think that the top tray is done.

678
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,800
So I'm taking this out.

679
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,120
Oh, they look baked. God knows.

680
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,920
I was just so confident
they would bake in 15 minutes.

681
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,400
-Too late.
-Bakers, you have one minute left.

682
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,040
[Freya] "One minute"?
This is just rather wild.

683
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,360
[Rochica] Oh, mine are terrible.

684
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,640
Breadstick Jenga.

685
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,240
That's what everyone
wants to be playing right now.

686
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,280
It's just now or never, really.

687
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,200
-[Giuseppe sighs]
-Where's my scissors?

688
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,520
-[Crystelle] Just tell me I can do it.
-[Lizzie] You have got this right now.

689
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,320
[Giuseppe] Come on, come on, come on.

690
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,240
-[sighs]
-[Crystelle] Come on, come on, come on.

691
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,360
Bakers, your time is up.

692
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,840
Oh God, what a nightmare.

693
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,760
Please bring your bakes to the front
and place them behind your photograph.

694
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,520
Mine are going to be raw. Oh, God.

695
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,040
That is a lot of carbs.

696
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,120
Oh, all right. Paul hates raw things.

697
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Oh God! Nightmare.

698
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,320
[Matt] <i>Paul and Prue are looking</i>
<i>for 18 well-filled ciabatta breadsticks</i>

699
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,120
<i>with an open structure</i>
<i>and a crisp brown crust,</i>

700
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,800
<i>served with an unctuous tzatziki dip.</i>

701
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,560
[scattered laughter]

702
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,120
-There's a few here that look good.
-Hmm.

703
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,400
[Paul] Now theseâ¦

704
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,800
-They're like snakes.
-They're a little bit sad.

705
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,800
Not long enough in the oven.

706
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:40,359
You want them to be open-structured
and crispy on the outside,

707
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:41,600
so it's a bit bready, but it tastes good.

708
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,080
They're slightly up and down in shape.

709
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,919
Yeah, they are. Bit irregular.

710
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,200
-Nice tzatziki, though.
-[Prue] That's good stuff.

711
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,080
Mmm. It is. These are better.
The bread's good. It's crispy.

712
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,600
Nice to see the olives whole as well.
They got a bit of a stronger bake.

713
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,080
They need a little bit longer,
but there's a couple good ones.

714
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,879
You've lost a lot of the air
when it's been cut.

715
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,439
-Very odd shape too.
-[Paul] Longer in the oven.

716
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,879
-[Prue] The bread flavour's good.
-And more careful with the stretching.

717
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,560
Now these are too small, and then you get
that rigidity in there as well.

718
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,480
But it needed to be longer.
We're testing for their bread skills.

719
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,600
This almost looks like it's been rolled.

720
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,000
It's quite tight inside,
it's not really open at all.

721
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,760
[Prue] Slightly more colour
and crispness on it.

722
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,440
[Paul] Got no onions in it.

723
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,920
-It misses it actually. It needs it.
-Mmm. Move on to the next one.

724
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,080
Shape-wise, they're good.
It's just the colour. They needed longer.

725
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,040
Does taste good.

726
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,400
-[Paul] Tzatziki's nice.
-[Prue] Mmm.

727
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,160
Moving on, these are all
very pale, and flat.

728
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,920
-[Prue] And raw.
-[Paul] And raw.

729
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,280
-Every one of them.
-[Prue chuckles]

730
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,400
All the cheese has come out here.

731
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,560
Yeah.

732
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,160
There's a blind panic in this.
They haven't been in the oven long enough.

733
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,120
-Either that or the oven wasn't hot--
-Or it wasn't on.

734
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,880
[Prue chuckles]

735
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,480
This one also looks a bit underdone.

736
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,520
I know that it's a rustic dish,

737
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,000
but I'd feel cheated
if I got this one and you got this one.

738
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,920
[Paul] The flavour's nice though.

739
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,640
They need to be a bit more
uniform than that.

740
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,440
[Paul] Now these don't look too bad.

741
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,840
-[Prue] The colour's better.
-That's pretty good.

742
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,520
-[Prue] It's holding its shape.
-You see whole olives all the way through.

743
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,680
Structure's better.

744
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,960
-It's nice though.
-Yeah, they're quite strong.

745
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,160
I like that one.

746
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,480
-Same issue again?
-Underdone.

747
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,760
[Paul] Run out of time.

748
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,800
[breathes deeply]
[chuckling] That smell is so lovely.

749
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,320
-[Paul] You got a bit of, erâ¦
-[Prue] Flour all over me.

750
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,600
[Paul] Over your nose.

751
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,960
-I was kissing it.
-Oh, right.

752
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,680
Kissing it better.

753
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,320
-[Paul] Massively under-baked.
-[Prue] Yeah.

754
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,560
It's a shame. Flavour's all right, though.

755
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,480
Now, theseâ¦ Looks like it's been twisted.

756
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,080
[Prue] It's been twisted a bit, hasn't it?
But that looks quite nice.

757
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,760
[Paul] It's quite effective.
It's got a nice colour.

758
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,080
[crunches]

759
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,560
Delicious. You can taste the crust,

760
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,000
with the caramelization on the outside,
which is key.

761
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,840
Wow. Okay. This will be interesting.

762
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,520
[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue will now rank</i>
<i>the breadsticks from worst to first.</i>

763
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,720
Tenth place is this one.

764
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,240
Rochica. A little bit raw,
and badly shaped, really.

765
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,000
In ninth, we have this one. Whose is this?

766
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,400
What were you thinking?

767
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,760
I was like, long prove, short bake.

768
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,320
-And I was clearly wrong.
-[Paul] Short bake?

769
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,840
I apologize. Yeah.

770
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,640
In eighth place, we've got this one.

771
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,400
-Whose is this?
-Mine.

772
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,200
Maggie, what happened to the onion?

773
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,800
The onions, I forgot to put in.

774
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,080
[Noel] <i>George is seventh.</i>
<i>Chigs comes sixth.</i>

775
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,040
<i>In fifth is JÃ¼rgen.</i>

776
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,240
<i>-And Freya takes fourth.</i>
-Me.

777
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,600
In third, we have this one. Whose is this?

778
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,000
Just a little bit longer in the oven,
and you would have been there.

779
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,240
All comes down to the colour.

780
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,880
And in second place, we have this one.

781
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,680
Lizzie, they were absolutely lovely.

782
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,000
Just one or two of them were a bit soft.

783
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,640
In first place, we haveâ¦

784
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,160
It's got a good colour on it,
it's got a nice flavour to it.

785
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,400
And I think they're a pretty good bread.

786
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,080
[all cheering]

787
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,400
An Italian making ciabatta.

788
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,720
Who would have thought it, eh?
Who would have thought it?

789
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,680
First place. Can you believe that? Yeah?

790
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,240
<i>Bread, there are so many things</i>
<i>that can go wrong.</i>

791
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,240
Every time it's a bit of a gamble, really.

792
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,200
You know what you put in.
You never know what you get out.

793
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,480
They've been having some happy tea
or something in the back there.

794
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,920
Off their heads. Think mine's second.

795
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,240
It's definitely a long prove
and a short bake.

796
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,600
Like I was so sure of it.

797
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,520
Erm, and clearly, I was so wrong.

798
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,720
[groans] I'm so rubbish at Technicals.
I just don't understand.

799
00:38:47,544 --> 00:38:51,944
-It's a surprise to me that--
-You're on a baking show. [laughs]

800
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,376
-Yeah, who knew?
-[Noel] Same.

801
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,360
[Matt] Star baker, week one,
star baker, week two,

802
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,520
and he might be looking into the abyss
week three, JÃ¼rgen.

803
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,760
I think JÃ¼rgen's
in a little bit of trouble.

804
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,640
-But it is all to play for.
-Who really needs to up their game?

805
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,520
-[Paul] <i>Maggie and Rochica.</i>
-[Matt] <i>Right.</i>

806
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,640
[Paul] <i>Chigs-ish.</i>
<i>He's sort of middle, but could float down.</i>

807
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,240
What about Giuseppe,
of course, who's from Italy?

808
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,200
<i>-And who's smashing it.</i>
-[Paul] <i>Well, heâ¦</i>

809
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,440
<i>I think the two challenges</i>
<i>played in his favour.</i>

810
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,200
I never thought I'd see a grown lady
pick up a breadstick and kiss it.

811
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,800
I know. Well, I really love bread.

812
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,160
-[laughter]
-Andâ¦ And I likeâ¦

813
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,840
But that's taking it too far, Prue.

814
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,920
Come on, you must've kissed

815
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,680
-a piece of bread before.
-Come on. You've kissed a bap.

816
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,640
-Never in my life.
-Never kissed a loaf?

817
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,880
-[Paul] No!
-A bap?

818
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,600
-Why? What for?
-[Noel] Muffin?

819
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,040
I bet you've stroked a croissant.

820
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,480
That's different.

821
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,440
-You're dead inside.
-[all laughing]

822
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,360
Bakers, welcome back to the tent
for your Showstopper challenge.

823
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,600
Today, the judges would like you to make
a theme display using milk bread.

824
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,920
Never heard of milk bread.

825
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,040
I never heard of bread
until I just said it.

826
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,240
Your milk bread displays
need to be three-dimensional

827
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,280
and the shape and decoration
need to reflect your chosen theme.

828
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,880
[Matt] The judges would like you
to create a bread that is soft inside,

829
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,040
has a light and tender crust,
and is slightly sweet in flavour.

830
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,640
This is the Showstopper, so, like Prue,
it needs to be visually stunningâ¦

831
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,120
-And right tasty.
-[Noel] You have four and a half hours.

832
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,120
-[Matt] On your marksâ¦
-[sing-song] Get setâ¦

833
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,480
Bake.

834
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,120
Milk bread just means that you replace
the water content in the dough with milk.

835
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,880
[Giuseppe] <i>You do find milk bread</i>
<i>in Italian cuisine as well,</i>

836
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,880
but it's usually very small buns
that they use for party food.

837
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,640
Slightly sweet and filled also
with savoury fillings.

838
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,960
[Paul] <i>The bakers</i>
<i>can choose any theme they wish,</i>

839
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,800
but milk bread is notorious
for being a little bit smooth,

840
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,840
and avoiding those sharp edges,
so they're going to have to think of this.

841
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,360
What are they going to use
inside their dough?

842
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,640
It's entirely up to them.

843
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,080
Double cream as well as milk.

844
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,520
I'm using whole milk,
and I'm also using milk powder.

845
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
I think this is a really
exciting challenge.

846
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,680
<i>People don't make milk bread enough.</i>
<i>It's a wonderful loaf.</i>

847
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,720
<i>So I'm excited to see</i>
<i>what they do with it.</i>

848
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,960
If you can turn out focaccia and ciabatta,

849
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,560
you jolly well ought to be able
to turn out a milk loaf.

850
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,720
-Hello, Maggie.
-[Maggie] Good morning.

851
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,960
Tell us about your Showstopper display.

852
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,400
I'm staying with my theme of the beach.

853
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,640
It's going to be an octopus
sitting in a rock pool.

854
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,520
And the flavourâ¦

855
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,280
I'm hoping you've never tried before,
it's actually seaweed.

856
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
I've had seaweed bread.

857
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,560
-Have you?
-Yeah.

858
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,120
[laughs] I thought you might've.

859
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,320
[Matt] <i>Six tablespoons of dulse seaweed</i>
<i>will flavour Maggie's rock pool octopus,</i>

860
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,480
<i>which will be decorated with royal icing.</i>

861
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,920
I'm using plain flour.

862
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,360
No extra salt,
because the seaweed is so salty anyway.

863
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,840
And the whole of the liquid
is going to be milk.

864
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,760
Golly.

865
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:00,960
And today, my mantra is
a bit more concentration, less chatting.

866
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,200
-And seaweed.
-I'll leave you to it.

867
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,760
-Maggie, that might be hard for you.
-[all laughing]

868
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,520
[Matt] <i>And Maggie isn't the only baker</i>
<i>looking to marine life for inspiration.</i>

869
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,120
Maggie, when you were preparing for this,

870
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,320
how many tentacles did you think
an octopus had?

871
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,040
I made it with six legs.

872
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,760
-[chuckles]
-[Amanda] A sexy-pus.

873
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,760
[giggling]

874
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,000
[Matt] <i>Amanda will be showcasing</i>

875

<i>and mango puree.</i>

878
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,640
[Amanda] I thought of coconut and mango

879
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,720
'cause they're kind of
pina colada flavours.

880
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,400
And when I think of the sea,
I think of holidays.

881
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,000
And they do go well in bread.

882
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,960
[Matt] <i>And Freya is giving</i>
<i>her sea creatures a vegan twist.</i>

883
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,040
[Freya] I'm using soya milk
instead of whole milk,

884
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,760
and then instead of milk powder,
I'm using dry coconut milk powder,

885
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,040
so you don't actually
taste the coconut milk.

886
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,640
But I think it works really well.

887
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,440
[Matt] <i>Freya's seascape will see</i>
<i>a hazelnut praline-filled crab</i>

-Oh, very vegan.
-[Freya laughs]

891
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,640
Freya said she could beat me
in an arm wrestle.

892
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,680
-All right, go on, then.
-[Freya] You'll get me in trouble.

893
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,360
Put your elbow on the bench.

894
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,080
-Oh, I'm nervous.
-Right, hook up, you ready?

895
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,240
-Waitâ¦
-[Paul] So when I release, you go.

896
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,880
-[Freya] Butâ¦
-All right? Go.

897
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,600
No! No! No!

898
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,120
-Come on, Freya! Come on, Freya!
-Come on, Freya!

899
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,000
[laughter]

900
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,080
-Oh, there we go.
-[Noel] She beat me.

901
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,080
I can't move my arm now.

902
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,720
-You were too powerful.
-[Prue] I'll take you to the medic.

903
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,120
Jeez.

904
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,600
[Prue] That'll keep him fit.

905
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,880
-[JÃ¼rgen] Sorry, sorry.
-[all chuckling]

906
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,640
[JÃ¼rgen] Didn't get a workout yesterday.

907
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,840
God, he was doing my nut in
in the practice tent.

908
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,320
What can I do? It's my style. [chuckling]

909
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,400
[Lizzie] I'm kneading mine in the mixer
'cause it's easier.

910
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,720
That's what's happening here.

911
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,560
[Noel] <i>Using the mixer for kneading</i>
<i>can encourage gluten development</i>

912
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,280
<i>in an enriched and wet dough</i>
<i>such as milk bread.</i>

913
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,840
This mixer wants to go places,
it keeps roaming around the bench.

914
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,080
[Noel] <i>But overmixing</i>
<i>can result in a tight, crumbly loaf,</i>

915
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,680
<i>the opposite of what the judges</i>
<i>will expect.</i>

916
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,760
Milk bread is soft, and it's got
a baby-food texture, if you like.

917
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,200
[Noel] <i>Baby food is something</i>
<i>that JÃ¼rgen is taking literally.</i>

918
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,880
When we got the brief,
my wife Sophia, my coach,

919
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,280
immediately thought of a baby.

920
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,400
A baby is round, a baby drinks
a lot of milk, a baby is sweet.

921
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,040
Erm, everything the sculpture should be.

922
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,000
And so that's what I'm going to make.

923
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,480
[Matt] <i>A creche of toys</i>
<i>and two milk bottles</i>

924
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,760
<i>filled with chocolate</i>
<i>and vanilla crÃ¨me mousseline</i>

925
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,400

<i>playful milk-bread baby</i>

926
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,120
<i>on a polka dot play mat.</i>

927
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,360
-[Prue] We're going to eat a baby?
-Yes. Yeah.

928
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,560
Okay.

929
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,880
Well, you can eat the milk bottle
and the various toys.

930
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,560
Oh, there will be toys around?

931
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,640
-You can leave the baby for Paul.
-Okay.

932
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,360
Paul would love to eat a baby.

933
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,640
[Prue] Okay, baby and toys.

934
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,760
I'm looking forward to seeing this baby
and eating its rattle.

935
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,520
-Great.
-[both laughing]

936
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,200
So it's going to prove
for about 90 minutes,

937
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,920
in order for the yeast to liven up.

938
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,480
It will need a lot of time
to develop the flavour

939
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,680
and to develop the loftiness
that is typical of the milk bread.

940
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,720
I'm not using the proving drawer.
It's warm in here.

941
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,920
Let's have some faith here.

942
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,360
[Matt] <i>While George may be confident</i>
<i>with the prove,</i>

943
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,560
<i>his concerns lie elsewhere.</i>

944
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,600
[George] What worries me the most
is the baking process.

945
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:35,000
And stacking, 'cause it's kind of
going to be a bit stacked.

946
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,360
[Matt]
<i>Sitting on a cinnamon-flavoured tree</i>

947
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,440
<i>will be his children's favourite animal,</i>

948
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,120
<i>a koala bear, whose legs will be filled</i>
<i>with chocolate and tahini.</i>

949
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,200
[Paul] Have you practised this?

950
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,320
-I have. The first time was horrendous.
-Right.

951
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,040
It ended up looking
like a sunken sea turtle,

952
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,800
or some sort of blob.

953
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,960
The bread's very soft.

954
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,080
When you start stacking it,
anything can happen.

955
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,560
It's all about the shape.

956
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,000
So you just got to be careful
with proving and baking.

957
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,000
[Matt] <i>With multiple doughs to make,</i>
<i>prove and bake</i>

958
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,320
<i>time management is crucial.</i>

959
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,200
[Freya] Probably one of the hardest bits

960
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,320
is being able to stagger
your different bits,

961
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,160
so they're all sort of proved
and baked by the end.

962
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,240
[Matt] <i>And if things weren't already</i>
<i>tricky enoughâ¦</i>

963
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:21,200
I've got a system of Post-it Notes
going on so I don't get confused.

964
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,160
'Cause that's
what you don't need to be doing.

965
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,280
<i>â¦some of the bakers</i>
<i>have decided to make fillings</i>

966
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,640
<i>to complement the flavour</i>
<i>of their milk bread.</i>

967
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,200
[JÃ¼rgen] I'm making my crÃ¨me mousseline

968
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,480
which is essentially crÃ¨me pat
with added butter.

969
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,640
I'm doing the lemons
sort of like a craqueline,

970
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,440
which is going to go on my roast potatoes.

971

[Noel] <i>When it comes</i>
<i>to flavours and fillings,</i>

973

My milk bread Showstopper,
I'm calling it "Bready for Sunday Roast."

974
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,080
Because for me,

975
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,200
roast dinner is what
brings my family together.

979

I've got a lime curd piped in my potatoes.

980
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,520
I've got a carrot cake-inspired filling
for my carrots.

981
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,000
Erm, I've got
a chocolate hazelnut frangipane,

982
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,960
which is going on my Yorkshire pudding.

983
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,280
Oh, Yorkshire puddings.

984
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,280
[LIzzie] This is a honey glaze
for my pig banquet.

985
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,880
[Noel] <i>And Lizzie has traced</i>
<i>the traditional roast</i>

<i>back to its beginnings.</i>

987
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,280
Where I walk my dog, normally,
it's like an old Tudor hall.

If you were a Tudor, on your table,

you get a pig and veg around them.
Like that.

990
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,800
{\an8}[Matt] <i>Lizzie's Tudor hog roast</i>

-[Paul] That'll be nice and sweet.
-The reason for the condensed milk--

994
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,000
I just liked it better.
Plus, I've been having it in coffee.

-Nice, lovely in coffee.
-[Lizzie] Yes!

Bakers, you are halfway through!

00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,080
Okay, what am I doing?

1000
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,440
-Eh, do you want a handshake?
-No.

1001

-Sorry, Paul, your fingers are too doughy.
-Hey, hey, come on.

1002

This is proved, I'm happy,
I'm happy with the size.

[Matt] <i>If the first batches</i>

1005

1006

<i>â¦it's time to start shaping the dough,</i>

<i>themes Paul and Prue are looking for.</i>

1008
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,080
[Maggie] It's proved a little faster
than I thought but not much.

1009
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,480
So I need eight legs.

1010
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,680
It's a tricky dough to shape,
because it's so soft and supple.

1011
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,520
You've got to really
accentuate the shapes now,

1012
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,240
'cause it's going to lose a lot
in the oven.

1013
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,240
[Rochica] So this is
the top of the birdcage.

1014

Yeah. [chuckling]

1027
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,200

It died. Didn't eat it.

-[JÃ¼rgen] Yes.
-Have you made this at home?

1032

Was it authentic?
Did it taste of real baby?

1034

It tasted, uh, sweet
as a real baby tastes, yes.

1035
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,440
I knew there was something about this guy.

1036
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,560
-I haven't eaten babies.
-No.

1037
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,720
Let's get a few suckers on
and then I can get him in the oven.

1038
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,560
If the suckers stay on,
the little suckers.

1039
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,720
-Wow.
-What do you think it looks like?

1040
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,840
Uhâ¦

1041
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,360
-Oh, you're going to say somethingâ¦
-Paul naked.

1042
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,520
-[both laugh]
-Chicken, of course.

1043
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,160
165. We're going low and slow.
Like you'd cook a pig anyway, isn't it?

1044
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,360
[Matt] <i>Milk bread needs</i>
<i>a lower temperature than standard bread,</i>

1045
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,960
<i>as the lactose in the milk</i>
<i>can cause it to brown</i>

1046
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,760
<i>before it's fully baked through.</i>

1047
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,200
I'm baking at 170 degrees.

1048
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,640
Sweet dough likes lower temperatures
because the sugars burn easily.

1049
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,080
[Matt] <i>But if you take it out too soon,</i>

1050
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,080
<i>it will flatten,</i>
<i>losing its all-important shape.</i>

1051
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,080
They're going in at different times

1052
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,080
because I've got different sizes
and I want them to bake evenly.

1053
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,840
[Chigs] I'm going to get
the next one ready now.

1054
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,280
But making and shaping milk bread.
Two different things.

1055
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,640
So I'm trying to just create something
simple but trying to do it well.

-Oh, that's clever.

1066
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,040
So what you've done
is you've used bread to make bread rolls.

-Yeah.

We at home use and eat
an inordinate amount of fruit and veg.

I would like to say that we do it

because we want to set
the example to the kids.

-Who could that be?

Who's that? I don't know. You tell me.

1082
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,320
Did you call your family and tell them?

1083
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,600
-Indeed. Yes.
-Did you? What did they say?

-Well, my wife was very happy.

I'm just going to get into character.

1089
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,440
Bakers, you have one hour left.

1090
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,400
I think that was pretty good.

1091
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,320
Right, it's going in now.

1092
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,480
[Rochica] So I've just put
the other parts of my birdcage in,

1093
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,520
so they're going in for 15 minutes.

1094
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,440
This is now becoming a juggling act
because there's so many elements here.

1095
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,880
I don't want an under-baked dough,
that would be a disaster.

1096
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,160
This is the koala going in now.

1097
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,720
And now we wait.

1098
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,640
Gonna give it a bit longer.

1099
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,720
Oh, God, this is horrible.
Just worrying about him.

1100
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,160
Just sick with worry.

-Yeah.

1102
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,520
Happy? No problems?

1103
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,840
-No problems. Yeah.
-Baby in the oven?

1104

imagine I would be having with someone.

1105
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,320
Coincidentally, it's a bun as well.

1106
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,200
I think it can come out.

1107
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,240
I'm petrified of it not being cooked,

1108
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,760
but also, I want it to be cooked.

1109
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,000
I think that they look fine.

1110
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,480

Just gonna pop this onto the top.

[Lizzie] It's lost its definition.

1118

With shaping bread,
it's all about the definition.

1119
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,920
Still looks like a pig.
Once he's glazed and everything.

[exclaims] Golly gosh.

1128
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,040
They're not as shell-like
as I'd like them to be

1129
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:52,960
but they're okay.

1130
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,120
I don't know
if they're baked in the middle.

1131
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,600
I've got lime curd in here

1132
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,000
and I'm just using it
to pipe my roast potatoes.

1133
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,240
I'm brushing the top of my crab
with agave nectar,

1134
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,680
which is basically
a vegan version of honey.

1135

00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,560
Oh, it's all a bit
of a shambles, isn't it, really?

1141
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,920
That last hour just goes.

1142
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,360
Just adding a bit of isomalt
just to secure it a bit more.

1143
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,360
[George] Oh, used the wrong arm.
Doesn't matter.

1144
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,520
[Lizzie] My pumpkins are a bit burnt,
but better burnt than underdone.

1145
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,240
I wonder if the eyes are higher up.
What does a crab even look like?

1146
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,840
They are looking okay,
unless they collapse.

1147
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,800
Hopefully theyâ¦ They hold up.

1148
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,640
The only thing holding
this koala together is my hands.

1149

[Freya] Stupid bread.

1151

Just giving the kid a dummy.
Maybe it's making too much noise.

1152
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,880
He's just lost his head. [chuckles]

1153
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,360
It's very delicate,
but it's staying up on its own now.

1154
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,680
Do a milk display,
why'd you have to stack it?

1155
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,920
It's falling.

1156
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,880
Still looking like a chicken,
which is good.

1157
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,200
[Freya] I feel like Paul's gonna go,
"That's not attached."

1158

Paul can like what he wants,
but he's getting what he's given.

1159

that I left them in the oven too long.

[Crystelle] Oh, God.

[Maggie] I'm really on it now.

1163

that you can only find
in the <i>Bake Off</i> tent.

any sweetcorn in Tudor banquets

1166

but there is in mine.

1167
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,320
Oh. I thought I'd lost an arm.

1168
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,200
I would never plate a roast dinner
up like this at home.

1169
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,440
Oh, right,
I need to put them on the board.

1170
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,720
[JÃ¼rgen] Some finishing touches.

1171
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,320
[Lizzie] Don't like the way
he's gone all crinkly.

1172
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,120
[Giuseppe] Doesn't want to fit anywhere.

1173
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,320
Oh, that's hilarious. [laughs]

1174
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,480
Oh, my God! Just stay.

1175
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,160
Bakers, your time is up.

1176
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,760
-All right.
-Please step away from your bakes.

00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,520

Look at that octopus.

1181
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,920
Everything is so stunning.

1182
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,320
[Noel] <i>It's judgment time</i>
<i>for the baker's Showstoppers.</i>

1183
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,260
[in Australian accent] Mate,
would you like to bring your koala up?

1184
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,740
[all laughing]

1185
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:37,940
-I think he's adorable.
-[Paul] It's simple, but it works.

1186
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:38,860
[Prue] Lovely.

1187
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,580
The bread's a bit heavy.

1188
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:45,700
The thing is, when you do
stand-up milk bread sculptures,

1189
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,540
the dough is so soft, it will collapse.

1190
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,540
-Yeah.
-[Paul] It works on a koala.

1191
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,860
'Cause it's quite charming.

1192
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:54,300
But it's concertinaed up
because it can't carry the weight.

1193
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:57,020
But I think the design is clever enough,
and your base oneâ¦

1194
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,460
This is nice. It's just sweet enough.

1195
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,220
-[Prue] Well done, George.
-Thank you very much.

1196
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,900
You've caught a few of them in the oven.

1197
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,860
-Yeah.
-But I quite like that.

1198
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,220
-Looks like it's been on a barbecue.
-[both laughing]

1199
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,060
But the overall design
I think is very clever.

1200
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,900
The pig was probably up here,
and it's dropped a bit.

1201
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,060
So basically you've got mango tea.

1202
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,980
Yeah. I did have a pet pig,
so, it's called, er, Susie.

1203
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,180
What happened to Susie?

1204
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,860
She slipped on ice,
we had to get her put down.

1205
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,060
[all chuckling]

1206
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,100
Slipped on ice?

1207
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,220
-Yeah.
-Don't take pigs ice-skating.

1208
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,140
She was living in the garden,
the ground got icy.

1209
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,940
I like the texture. And it is light.

1210
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,380
You can get that tea, can't you?

1211
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,380
-Not sure whether I like it, but, ermâ¦
-Quite perfumed.

1212
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,860
But I can identify it,
that's the key thing.

1213
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,140
-Thank you, Lizzie.
-Ta.

1214
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,060
It's beautifully done.

1215
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,700
[Paul] It's not bad.
It looks quite well-proved.

1216
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,460
You can see how round it is.

1217
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,580
[Prue] I think that's really well made.

1218
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,860
But I don't get
a lot of orange blossom flavour.

1219
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,060
You get a hint of something
slightly aromatic at the back.

1220
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,420
It's light, it's fluffy.

1221
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,540
The textures and colours
are pretty consistent.

1222
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,660
-It's a nice bread, that.
-[Prue] Very nice.

1223
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,260
Good design.
Simple but highly effective as well.

1224
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,780
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done, Chigs.

1225
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,380
It's quite abstract. Looks quite rustic,
and then this looks quite neat.

1226
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,580
Yes.

1227
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,780
Is that four and a half hours'
worth of work?

1228
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,060
Well, it was for me.

1229
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,420
[all laughing]

1230
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,100
Good answer.

1231
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,660
[continues laughing]

1232
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,780
It's under-proved and it's got no flavour.

1233
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,140
I'm hard-pushed
to find the seaweed in that.

1234
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,660
See, there's simply not enough in it.

1235
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:52,140
The sweetness is there,
but it's very cake-like.

1236
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:53,300
Could be a bit lighter.

1237
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,500
But I honestly think
if you put a bit of salt in it,

1238
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,900
you'd have the flavour,
because I can get the seaweed.

1239
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,380
But there's no doubt
that salt would enhance it.

1240
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,900
[Maggie]
Well, that's rather disappointing.

1241
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,580
-But never mind.
-[Paul] Yeah, it is.

1242
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,140
-Thank you, Maggie.
-Thank you.

1243
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,340
[Noel] Well done.

1244
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,500
The way you've incorporated
different flavours

1245
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,460
in different breads is very clever.

1246
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:15,820
The babyâ¦

1247
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,660
[Paul and Prue chuckle]

1248
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:21,860
â¦is very basic,
but it does work, it's effective.

1249
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,260
Colour looks great on the bread as well.
You glazed this?

1250
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,260
I glazed it with egg wash. Egg wash.

1251
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,220
Lovely flavour.

1252
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,860
-[Prue] Very good flavour.
-The sweetness level's just right.

1253
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,820
But for me, it is slightly under-proved,

1254
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,700
and therefore
you haven't got that structure.

1255
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,940
So, nearly there.

1256
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,020
{\an8}-[Paul] Thank you, JÃ¼rgen.
-Thank you.

1257
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,420
It's very clever.
And you've created a theme.

1258
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,300
The chicken could have been a bit higher.

1259
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,220
-Spatchcock.
-Uh, yeah.

1260
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,540
[Prue] It's definitely
a spatchcock or a turtle.

1261
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:54,420
I think your craqueline
could've been a bit darker.

1262
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,340
-[Crystelle] Okay.
-[Paul] A bit longer in the oven

1263
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,340
would've created more of a darkness to it.

1264
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,740
The flavours are great, though.
The citrus kick is fantastic.

1265
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:05,180
The top is beautiful.
The texture is lovely. It's light.

1266
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:08,220
It's got a nice sweetness to it,
which is just right.

1267
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:11,220
-It's really a nice slice of bread.
-Thank you very much.

1268
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,900
I think the design is incredible.
You've done an amazing job.

1269
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:23,300
It's actually quite simple,
but you've executed it beautifully.

1270
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:26,420
Paul's never had fruit or veg before.

1271
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,900
He only eats bread.
So can you tell us what each one is?

1272
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,540
So you've got a courgette--

1273
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,260
-He is as well.
-[all laughing]

1274
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:36,540
Apples and mushrooms, yeah.

1275
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,140
The texture in there,
it's light, it bounces back.

1276
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:43,580
And the flavour's in there as well.

1277
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,300
It's difficult to get orange
to come through in bread,

1278
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:48,660
but you get the zest,
which is a much purer form of orange.

1279
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:52,100
I think you've done
something that's, erm, very clever.

1280
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,700
It's absolutely delicious.
And I think the texture's lovely.

1281
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,380
-Well done, Giuseppe.
-Thank you.

1282
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,180
I think you've done a really good job.

1283
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,460
You've lost a lot of definition,
but you've utilized that to your strengths

1284
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,500
to make the octopus the way it does.

1285
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,460
It's very clever and effective.

1286
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:11,860
I think it's delightful.

1287
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,860
You can see how tender the loaf is.

1288
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:19,700
I love that. I love the flavour.

1289
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:24,460
The sweetness is just the right side
of sweetness, and the texture is spot-on.

1290
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,860
But it's not bouncy.

1291
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:29,140
You've ended up
with a massive air pocket in there.

1292
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:31,060
But I think it's very good,
very brioche-like.

1293
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,740
-It's light, it's well-baked.
-I think you've done a terrific job.

1294
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,580
-Well done.
-Thank you so much.

1295
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:43,500
There's something wrong
with the proportions.

1296
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,660
That little bird, even if it was upright,

1297
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:48,020
couldn't have laid those eggs
in a million years.

1298
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,980
It's over-proved.
You've lost it 'cause it's going flat.

1299
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:54,020
It's a bit tight.
It's under-proved as well.

1300
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:57,300
This is going to prove
at a slightly different level to this.

1301
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,620
-[Rochica] Oh, okay.
-[Paul] Because it's smaller pieces.

1302
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:05,340
The cinnamon level's right.
Sweetness level's right as well.

1303
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,300
Just that the dough's too dense.

1304
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:10,100
And when you say
that's four and a half hours' work,

1305
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,500
I wouldn't believe you.

1306
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:15,300
Erm, that does taste absolutely delicious.
But the texture's not right.

1307
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:16,740
-[Paul] Thank you, Rochica.
-Thank you.

1308
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,100
[Prue] I think it's really very amusing.

1309
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:28,820
And I must say that the crab shell
is so realistic.

1310
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,580
-It's beautifully done.
-I like it, it's very neat.

1311
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:32,580
Let's have a look.

1312
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:36,580
Is the beach demerara sugar
or soft brown sugar?

1313
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,100
Yeah, it's soft brown sugar.

1314
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:43,540
Nice milk bread.
The structure's light, holds its shape.

1315
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:46,180
And the sweetness levels
are just right as well.

1316
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,300
-It's not overly sweet.
-It's nicely baked.

1317
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:53,820
Tastes good, and I love the look of it.
I think it's just hilarious.

1318
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,340
Aw, thank you so much. [chuckles]

1319
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,820
[Freya] <i>I'm so pleased.</i>

1320
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,260
<i>I wasn't sure what to expect</i>
<i>coming into this week,</i>

1321
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:03,300
with me not really enjoying bread.

1322
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,580
So I'm really thrilled about it. Yeah.

1323
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:08,100
[Maggie] <i>I'm disappointed</i>
<i>that I didn't do better in the bread,</i>

1324
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,540
<i>'cause I make bread all the time.</i>

1325
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:11,580
And this is maybe
the last time you see me.

1326
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,900
[Rochica] <i>It's definitely been</i>
<i>my worst week.</i>

1327
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:18,620
I would like another chance,
but I don't know if I'm going to get one.

1328
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,180
[sighs]

1329
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,840
[Matt] So where are we at?

1330
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,800
Milk bread's quite difficult
to do properly.

1331
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,080
I think most of them
did a pretty good job.

1332
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,000
Simplicity was the way forward.
And I think Giuseppe got that.

1333
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,520
What Giuseppe has done is clever.

1334
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,880
-[Noel] What about Freya?
-[Paul] I would say Freya was up there.

1335
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,400
She has done well.

1336
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,480
There's a few people
who are sort of middle ground,

1337
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,640
and I thought JÃ¼rgen saved himself.

1338
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,760
-George is--
-Lizzie is doing well.

1339
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,680
Lizzie really excelled, I think.

1340
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,200
What about Maggie?

1341
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,080
-[Paul] Maggie struggled.
-[Prue] I think she's in trouble.

1342
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,560
I didn't get the flavours in that.

1343
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,600
I thought the structure
wasn't particularly good.

1344
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,920
I think it was a little bit too simple.

1345
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,640
I think the two people,
I think Maggie and I also think Rochica.

1346
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,360
The trouble with Rochica's
is that the whole thing didn't work

1347
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,640
because there wasn't
a loaf of bread there,

1348
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,400
and we're trying to judge bread.

1349
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:21,080
But I really like them all now.
I don't want anybody to go home.

1350
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,200
This is quite a hard point to leave,

1351
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,800
because they're just
getting to know each other nowâ¦

1352
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,760
-Settled--
-Settling into the life

1353
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,840
of the prison camp where we film.

1354
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,760
[all chuckling]

1355
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,480
To be fair, a lot of them
have tried to escape already.

1356
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,160
Well done, bakers. Big week, bread week.

1357
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,320
Especially in front
of the breadfather, Paul.

1358
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,400
It's a tough one,
but you all did really well.

1359
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,800
I've got the great job this week
of announcing who is Star Baker.

1360
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:59,960
The person who's Star Baker this week isâ¦

1361
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,320
-Giuseppe.
-[all applauding]

1362
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,480
Yeah! <i>Bravo!</i>

1363
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,080
Now I have the less fun job of telling you
who's going to be going home,

1364
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,760
and it gets harder and harder each week

1365
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,960
because we're becoming friends
and we're bonding.

1366
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,840
And we don't want to lose anyone.

1367
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:30,200
But I'm afraid
we are going to be losing somebody,

1368
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,600
and that person isâ¦

1369
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,480
Rochica.

1370
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,920
[Freya] It's okay.

1371
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:48,720
[Rochica] <i>It's come to end,</i>
<i>but I have really, really enjoyed it.</i>

1372
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,760
And not everybody gets to bake
in the <i>Bake Off</i> tent.

1373
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,520
So I'm proud of where I've got to.

1374
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,840
<i>And I'm just going to keep baking.</i>

1375
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,960
Just don't do anything to,
like, time. [laughs]

1376
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,680
-We're gonna miss you.
-I'll miss you too.

1377
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,440
-Just getting to know you.
-I know, right?

1378
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,520
[Maggie] Your family
will be so happy to see you.

1379
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,880
[laughing] I think
I was very close to the edge.

1380
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,560
The cliff was crumbling rather badly,
but I seem to have scraped through again.

1381
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,200
-Well done, Maggie.
-I don't know how I keep doing it.

1382
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,000
-Squeak through.
-Squeak through.

1383
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,640
Next week,
I've got to be spectacular. [snorts]

1384
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,480
[JÃ¼rgen] <i>Can't win them all.</i>
<i>Can't win all the Star Bakers.</i>

1385
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:28,440
It feels very good to be
at the end of Bread Week and still in.

1386
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,360
-[Prue] So deserved, really.
-Thank you.

1387
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,360
Star Baker, can you believe that?

1388
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,720
<i>Especially for Bread Week.</i>

1389
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,480
I better savour it 'cause
it ain't gonna happen again. [laughs]
