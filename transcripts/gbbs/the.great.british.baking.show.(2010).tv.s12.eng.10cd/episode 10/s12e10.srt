Anybody would think
a carrot cake is so simple and easy,

but we want something
really special and different.

We're looking for inventiveness.
We want carrot to be the hero,

85
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,600
but we want to see
other highly decorated elements

cream cheese frosting onto a warm cake.

Because the whole thing
would just slide and melt.

<i>He plans to bake one large cake</i>
<i>and then slice it into three layers.</i>

152
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,120
[Giuseppe] I'm using
a heating rod in the centre

153
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,440
and a cake belt around it,
to homogenise the heat across the cake.

154
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,760
These are going to go in now.

155

-[timer beeping]

156

One hour and 15 minutes.

we will be telling you

163
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,760
that you are halfway through
a Signature Challenge.

164

[Noel] <i>A classic carrot cake</i>

166

169
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,880
This is the pineapple jam.

170
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,320
For me,
pineapple is one of the best fruits ever,

171
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,200
and I think it might complement the cake.

172
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,720
Hello. Congratulations.

173
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,600
-Thank you.
-You're in the final.

174
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,600
-I can't believe it.
-Wow.

175
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,760
I mean, this time last year,
you hadn't even started baking, had you?

176
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,240
Ermâ¦ No, no, yeah, I was baking last year.

177
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,840
-This time last year.
-Oh. Mmm.

178
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
The year before that I wasn't.

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,160
That's not that good then,
is it, for the show.

180
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,320
Bit disappointing.

181
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,720
[man] <i>Hi, Chigs.</i>

What you've achieved in one

I love you so much.

190

[Chigs] I lost my father when I was young.

191
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,920
I think I was 12 years old.
He died really young.

192
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,760
So I just take every opportunity I can.

193
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,520
I'm not gonna wait
for things to happen, I just do it.

194
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,520
That's the reason
why I wanted to come here.

195
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,120
Because I know
I'm gonna make amazing memories.

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,760
-Yeah, that's right.
-I would expect you to be here, then.

202
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,400
[laughing] It's easy, isn't it?

203
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,760
-In many ways you've under-achieved.
-Exactly.

<i>â¦Giuseppe</i>
<i>has a filling that goes back generations.</i>

208

Figs are very common
in the hottest part of Italy.

209
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,480
So, it's the family jam.

210
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,440
{\an8}Baking is in the family DNA.

{\an8}'Cause that's a main discussion
at our family gatherings.

What's going to be for dessert?
Who's done it and how?

[Noel] <i>Whilst Giuseppe was growing up</i>

214
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,920

<i>those questions was his dad, Cosimo.</i>

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,960
[Giuseppe] He was a baker by passion.

216
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,680
Every Sunday he'd put the dessert
in front of us after our main meal,

217
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,960
and I really wanted that
to be the case for my kids.

218
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,680
It was so pleasurable for me,

219
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,880

better than he ever was as a baker.

Which is absolutely a lie.

235

I've got some pictures of the things
that he used to make when he used to work.

My great aunt makes this every year,
and it's a figs and walnut jam.

And it goes very,
very well with carrot flavour.

241
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,360
Funnily enough,
there isn't any family recipe.

242
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,680
There's no godmother or auntie
that has a carrot cake recipe.

243
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,480
So, I've just gone
for full-on orange curd.

244
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,120
At home, I've got my mum, my dad,
my two sisters and my auntie.

245
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,680
I wouldn't have had the confidence
to apply if it wasn't for them.

246
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,240
{\an8}I've had a few turning points in my life.

247
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,080
{\an8}One when I was at school,
teachers called me the class clown.

248
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,480
They hated me.
I was just an absolute terror.

249
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,480
My parents sat me down and said,
"You need to sort your life out."

250
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,080
"We're not going to spoon-feed you.
You need to work hard."

251
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,800
And I thought, "Okay."
That was one turning point.

252
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,680
The second one is definitely this.

Basically, carrot cake is for people
who think they're being healthy.

which is really healthy."

Quite nice and firm, which is good.

299
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,120
Let's get this jam on here.

300
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,240
It's done.

301
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,760
And I can go straight in with those.

302
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,400
[Crystelle] Four layers,

303
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,480
but more layers
means I can put more filling in

304
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,840
and pack as much flavour as possible.

305
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,000
[Giuseppe] Now, it's all about
getting stuff as cool as possible

306
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,960
so that it doesn't collapse.

307
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,400
You have 15 minutes left.

308
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,760
Do you think
Giuseppe's got enough time, there?

309
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,720
It's still very hot. I've got no options.

310
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,680
I'm gonna have to slice it.
This is not gonna be pretty.

311
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,800
[Noel] <i>The judges have demanded</i>
<i>exquisite decorationâ¦</i>

312
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,960
My hand is shaking.

313
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,000
<i>â¦worthy of a baking show finalâ¦</i>

314
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,680
I'm going to stick in a dowel,
just to stop it sliding around too much.

315
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,800
[Matt] You've got a baby carrot
and made smaller carrots.

316
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,720
[Chigs] Yes.

317
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,560
And then you're going to make
smaller carrots out of those?

318
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,320
-I might quarter them.
-And then even smaller?

319
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,200
-[Chigs] Can do.
-[Matt] Don't go too small.

320
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,840
They'll be invisible to the naked eye.

321
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,040
-They'll lose their impact.
-We'll know they're there.

322
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,200
-We'll know they're there.
-It's literally steaming.

323
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
This is going to be carnage.
If it breaks, it breaks.

324
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,600
I don'tâ¦ I can'tâ¦

325
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,720
This is what <i>The Bake-Off</i>
is about, isn't it?

326
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,720
[Crystelle] There is a slight lean.

327
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,280
I'll put in a few dowels to make sure
that this stays where it needs to be.

328
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,320
It's really crumbly.
This is going to fall to pieces.

329
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,920
[Crystelle] Stay calm. Stay calm.

330
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,160
-How long do we have?
-[Noel] Five minutes remaining.

331
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
It's breaking up in front of my eyes.

332
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,200
Better have enough buttercream.

333
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,440
[Giuseppe] This is going to be messy.

334
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,800
[Crystelle] It's leaning, and I'm sure
that's not gonna do me favours.

335
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,760
-How long have we got?
-[Matt] One minute left.

336
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,400
-[Crystelle] It's just okay.
-[Giuseppe] These are still very warm.

337
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
No!

338
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,240
[Crystelle sighs]

339
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,000
[Giuseppe] That's enough.

340
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,760
It's horrible because it's melting,
but I will be able to finish it.

341
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,320
Time is up.

342
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,840
[Giuseppe] It's finished.

343
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,320
[Crystelle] It's so wonky, but still.

344
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,960
[Giuseppe] Mine looks
like my face over the years.

345
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,080
It's melting down. Ooh.

346
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,000
-[chuckles]
-Well done, my friend.

347
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
[sighs]

348
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,680
[Matt] <i>It's judgement time</i>
<i>in the final Signature Challenge.</i>

349
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,560
-Hello, Crystelle.
-Hello.

350
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,960
-I wouldn't have made it this high.
-Yeah.

351
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,160
By stacking it, you're retaining the heat.

352
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,200
And then you're going
to get some movement.

353
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,320
And it doesn't say to me, "carrot cake,"

354
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,360
but it might when it's opened up.

355
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,360
There are a couple of dowels in there,
just to try and hold it together.

356
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,560
Mmm. I love the flavour.

357
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,559
[Paul] You've got cardamom,
pistachio and then orange.

358
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,319
-Together, it's a really nice flavour.
-You taste all of them.

359
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,319
Yes, and it's well balanced.

360
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,360
But it's not
the best-looking thing you've done.

361
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,840
[sighs]

362
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,240
I particularly like your baby carrots.

363
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,080
[Paul] I think it looks very nice.
I love the pipe work.

364
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,160
-A bit solid.
-[Chigs] Yeah.

365
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,680
[Prue] You had a lot of carrot

366
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,920
and the carrot releases water
once it's in the batter.

367
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,040
I think the pineapple works well.
That bit of sweetness comes through it.

368
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,920
You expect a little bit of stodge
with a carrot cake.

369
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
-But this is a little bit rubbery.
-Okay.

370
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,600
You were affected by heat.
It wasn't cold when you put it together

371
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,640
and therefore
you've got a bit of movement.

372
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,840
-But it's fairly level.
-[Prue] Yeah, I like the look of it.

373
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,320
It's three layers of sponge
with figs and walnut jam in between.

374
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,000
It has an absolutely delicious flavour,
but the texture is very soft.

375
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,480
[Paul] Because the cake was warm
when you did it,

376
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,560
that's what's causing you to think,
"Is it underbaked, stodgy?" It's not.

377
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,680
It's just you've got the cream cheese
and you've got the jam

378
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,440
and it's soaking into a warm cake.

379
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,000
-So that'sâ¦
-It's added moisture.

380
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,040
[Paul] Yes, it has.

381
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,120
But I think the flavours are delicious.
The idea of introducing figs was good.

382
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,080
And it still tastes like carrot cake.
Which is important.

383
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,720
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thank you.

384
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,320
Well done.

385
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,240
[Giuseppe] The look of the cake
wasn't particularly stunning,

386
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,920
but I'm glad
they managed to see through that.

387
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,400
The fact that I made my least
nice-looking cake on the final

388
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,080
is probably not the most fortunate thing.

389
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,520
[Chigs] The thing is, nobody smashed it.

390
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,800
Everybody got some feedback, soâ¦

391
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
It's not a tragedy. It's not finished.

392
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,280
[Noel] <i>The bakers must now face</i>
<i>their final gingham-wrapped mystery.</i>

393
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,480
Well, bakers, I know
you must be devastated

394
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,640
that this is your last
Technical Challenge.

395
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,600
Crystelle, my thoughts are with you.

396
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,560
-[Crystelle and Matt laugh]
-Shedding tears.

397
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,880
Now, this challenge
has been set by Paul Hollywood.

398
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,040
Paul, any pearls of wisdom to impart?

399
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,760
You'll have to use
your baking knowledge on this one

400
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,040
because we've taken out
most of the method.

401
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,240
[chuckling]

402
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,680
[Matt] As ever, this task is judged blind.

403
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,360
So we ask Paul and Dame Prue
to leave us alone.

404
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,040
[Noel] For your Technical Challenge,

405
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,920
Paul would love you
to make 12 Belgian buns.

406
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,040
Your Belgian buns must be
filled with sultanas and lemon curd.

407
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,840
[Matt] You have two and a half hours.

408
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,280
-On your marks.
-Get set.

409
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,720
[sing-song] Bake!

410
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,000
-Is that it?
-Are you taking the mick?

411
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,680
[laughing]

412
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,960
-[Matt] What are you laughing at?
-There's two instructions.

413
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,840
{\an8}-Oh, my God. That's it?
-Yeah!

414
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,920
{\an8}"Make Belgian buns.
Fill it with lemon curd and sultanas."

415
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,200
That's cracking.

416
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,880
I've done a cinnamon bun so I feel
like that's enough bun knowledge.

417
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,360
Maybe today's the day
that I do well on a Technical.

418
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,720
I've never seen a Belgian bun.
I have no idea what they look like.

419
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Paul, for our final Technical Challenge,
we've got Belgian buns.

420
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,360
You haven't taken all the method out,
have you?

421
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,120
-Yeah.
-[laughing] Paul,

422
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,520
I think that's unbelievably unkind.

423
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,760
[Paul] You can see
where it's been coiled around.

424
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,200
-[Prue] Yeah.
-[Paul] You should get that lemon,

425
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,640
and a bit of sweetness
coming from the icing.

426
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,480
It's just got that bit of chewiness,
which I like.

427
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,720
I don't think there'll be any trouble
with them making the dough.

428
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,840
And of course they know
how to make lemon curd.

429
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,480
It's what to do with them
when they've got them.

430
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,720
I mean, how did they know
what a Belgian bun looks like?

431
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,520
We've got three great bakers in there.
Someone will get it right.

432
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,800
It's an enriched dough.
I've done enriched dough in the past.

433
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,120
This will be a very sticky dough.
It's gonna be very difficult to handle.

434
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,120
[Crystelle] You need
to work the hell out of it

435
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,840
to work up all that gluten.

436
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,440
My dad used to do this very often
when we made pizza dough.

437
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,400
"Refine the dough," he said.
I don't know what <i>that</i> means.

438
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,280
At last, I'm as tall as Giuseppe.

439
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,880
-That's not something to be proud of.
-Hello.

440
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,040
There's no more Italian thing
you could be doing right now than this.

441
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,280
If there was an advert made for Giuseppe,

442
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,240
-this is what you'd be doing isn't it?
-There you go.

443
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,240
It will go, [dramatically]<i> "Giuseppe,</i>

444
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,040

-That sounds like a very American accent.

00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,720
-and arms as long as other people's legs."
-[laughing]

447
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,840
"He wore gloves
where his shoes should be."

448
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,120
-"He was Giuseppe." [laughs]
-If I ever make it to Hollywood,

449
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,240
I'll give you a shout.

450
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,600
[Chigs] Dough done.

451
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,720
So I'm now gonna prove this
for an hour minimum.

452
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,720
[Matt] <i>Paul's demanded</i>
<i>a creamy lemon curd fillingâ¦</i>

453
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,160
I made an orange curd this morning.

454
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,640
<i>â¦with no explanation as to how to make it.</i>

455
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,800
-Have you seen that? Paul Vaguey-wood.
-Really helpful.

456
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,760
I have never made curd. Ever.

457
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,160
That's gonna be a wild guess.

458
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,120
Lemon curd looks very much like a custard.

459
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,280
So it needs to be
like a creamy liquidy thingy.

460
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
[Crystelle] Okay,
curd has gone in the freezer,

461
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,320
-just to chill.
-[Chigs] Mmm.

462
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,200
[Giuseppe] Does this look like
a curd to you?

463
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,120
I'm saying nothing. "Belgian Buns."

464
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,120
-Do you know what they look like?
-Do you not know?

465
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,000
Some sort of cinnamon bun swirled up.

466
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,920
Have you been to Belgium?

467
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,880
I've been to Belgium a few times.

468
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,600
-Yes.
-Have you? Why?

469
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,120
Bakers, you are halfway through.

470
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,400
It looks like it's twice the size.

471
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,040
[Crystelle] I think that's fine.

472
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,760
[Giuseppe] The question is,
how do we shape this?

473
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,000
I don't know what to do now.

474
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
Just don't know what that man wants.

475
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,000
There is no point in going back
to the instructions,

476
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,040
{\an8}because they say, "Make the Belgian buns."

477
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,280
[sighs] God, it's really hard.
[laughing] God, I hate this.

478
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,920
[Giuseppe] Matt's mentioned
a swirl somewhere.

479
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,720
So they might be like cinnamon buns.

480
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,600
Roll it out, spread the curdâ¦

481
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,160
Sprinkle the sultanas?

482
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,800
I'll roll this out flat,
spread over the curd,

483
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,440
sprinkle all the sultanas,
roll it up like a little sausage.

484
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,200
[Chigs grumbles]

485
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,040
Split the dough into two
and get a rough rectangle shape.

486
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,360
[Crystelle] I want them to get
an even, thick layer of curd.

487
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
This is going to all be very tight.

488
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,840
[Giuseppe] It is very tricky because
they did say, "Perfect swirl."

489
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,720
[Crystelle] The longer your dough,
the more of a swirl you'll get,

490
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,320
because you can really roll it up.

491
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,800
[Chigs] Let's see what happens.

492
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,600
[Giuseppe] I can only hope
that this is right.

493
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,480
Each roll needs to be the same.
I'm sure they'll want uniformity.

494
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,720
[Crystelle] How thick should each bun be?

495
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,000
If the buns have to be like cinnamon buns,

496
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,320
they would have to be
a couple centimetres each.

497
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
[Crystelle] If I do 1.2.

498
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,840
[Chigs] Five.

499
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,960
It needs to be a significant swirl.

500
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,960
I think whenever they ask for a swirl,
it has to be visible.

501
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,600
[Chigs] Mine look too high.

502
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,480
I rolled it the wrong way.
I rolled it long way upwards.

503
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,840
Whereas those guys have done
the short side and gone that way.

504
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,680
[Crystelle] And we have lift-off.

505
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,360
Can't do anything now.

506
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,720
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

507
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,360
Sorry. I was
just on the ceiling, eating bugs.

508
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,520
Okay.

509
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,280
[Chigs] I'm just going in at 180.

510
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,400
'Cause that's the bit of information
they did give us.

511
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,040
[Giuseppe] I'll go for 20 minutes first.

512
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,280
Fingers and toes crossed,
say a little prayer and hope for the best.

513
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,640
Coffee time.

514
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,840
You have 15 minutes left.

515
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,360
[Crystelle] They look a little bit pale.
Hmm.

516
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,680
[Giuseppe] They're browning.
It's looking good so far.

517
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,080
[Crystelle] I think
they should be golden brown.

518
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,320
I don't know, is the honest answer.

519
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,360
I'll keep them in there
until they are an even brown colour.

520
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,680
[Chigs] The swirl's
the only thing I'm worried about.

521
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,720
There's only three of us now.
I could be in last position.

522
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,880
-[whistles]
-You watching your bake?

523
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,360
-It's a very good perspective.
-Happy?

524
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,120
Yeah. Unless I've burnt them.
What should I do? What should I do?

525
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,960
Just chill out.
Don't worry about it. It's only the final.

526
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,920
[Crystelle] I might be
cutting it a bit fine.

527
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,640
I might have to cut this down
by about two to four minutes.

528
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,560
By doing that,
it should give me enough time

529
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,800
for my buns to cool before I glaze them.
Before I ice them.

530
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,720
Don't, Matt, come on.

531
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,960
-I'm better than that.
-You're better than that. Don't you dare!

532
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,000
The tension is palpable.

533
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,920
[Noel] Bakers,
you have ten minutes remaining.

534
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,120
Thermometer says they're baked.

535
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,120
[Chigs] They look like baked.
They just look very small.

536
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,520
They look ready.

537
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,400
The worst thing that can happen
is that they are underbaked.

538
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,440
[sighs]

539
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,840
So I'll keep them
another couple of minutes.

540
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,960
[Crystelle] They need to cool
because I need to put icing on them.

541
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,440
Just stick them in the freezer.
Do not drop. [gasps]

542
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,280
[Chigs] This one's got "last"
written all over it.

543
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,160
-[Chigs sighs]
-[timer beeping]

544
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,000
-Yeah.
-[oven beeping]

545
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,160
[Giuseppe] They're definitely done.

546
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,600
His look burnt.

547
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,840
Is this what Belgian buns
should look like?

548
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,400
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

549
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,080
[Crystelle] Taking them out now.

550
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,400
-[Chigs] I'll put icing on it.
-[Crystelle] I can do this. I can do this.

551
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,560
[Giuseppe] I hope
I haven't overbaked them.

552
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,760
Some of them are very dark.

553
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,000
[Crystelle] Oh, God.
Why are my hands shaking?

554
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,280
Turned into a shaking puppet.

555
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,160
[Giuseppe] I have to be quick.
Cherry in the middle.

556
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,600
I'm almost there.
There's no time to waste.

557
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,120
Bakers, your time is up.

558
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,840
[Chigs blows raspberry]

559
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,960
Please bring your bakes
and place them behind your photo.

560
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,320
[Matt] <i>Paul and Prue are expecting</i>
<i>perfectly swirled, golden Belgian buns</i>

561
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,240
<i>filled with silky lemon curd</i>

562
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,920
<i>and topped with icing and glace cherries.</i>

563
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,280
[Paul] Right. Now, these aren't too bad.

564
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,440
They're a little uneven.
The icing is a bit erratic.

565
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,120
-[Paul] But the colour's pretty uniform.
-[Prue] Yeah.

566
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,760
Mmm. Good lemon curd.

567
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,440
-It tastes all right.
-I think that's very nice.

568
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,000
[sighs in relief]

569
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,200
[Paul] Let's move on to number two.
They're too small, too high.

570
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,400
Cooked too thick.
Let's have a look inside.

571
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,640
-They're a bit too chewy and too solid.
-The dough may have been too thick.

572
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,240
-So, instead of rolling out thinâ¦
-I think it needed to be bigger.

573
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,240
Yeah. And have several spirals.

574
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,560
Moving on to number three.

575
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,480
-These are overbaked. Massively.
-[Prue] Overbaked.

576
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,760
They're very technically neatly done.

577
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,000
The icing's perfect, the shape is lovely.

578
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,560
Everything except
leaving them in the oven too long.

579
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,840
Oh. That's such a pity,
because this is the final.

580
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,280
-Dry as a bone.
-Hmm.

581
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,520
[Prue] Overbaked.

582
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,000
[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue will now rank</i>
<i>the final Technical Challenge.</i>

583
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,640
[Paul] Okay, in last place,
we have this one.

584
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,120
Giuseppe. Massively overbaked.

585
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,160
They would have been number one,
bar for the colour.

586
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,280
So, in second place
we have this one. Who's that?

587
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,640
Chigs.

588
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,520
That's what you should
have been rolling up

589
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,360
and what you were rolling up is thatâ¦

590
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,840
-Which meansâ¦
-[laughing] Oh, my God.

591
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,520
In first place we have this one.
Crystelle, the colour's good.

592
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,760
The roll is good. Well done.

593
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,200
[Crystelle laughs]

594
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:32,200
I cannot believe I've come first
in a Technical Challenge in the final.

595
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,200
Took me ten weeks, but I got there.

596
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,760
[Giuseppe] It's very disappointing.

597
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,600
Overbaking is something that,
at this stage, I should know better.

598
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
[Chigs] I'm second,
by the skin of my teeth.

599
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,080
[chuckling] I just need to have
an amazing day tomorrow.

600
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,560
I've done it before.
Can I do it again on the final? [chuckles]

601
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,560
Not asking for much, am I?

602
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,760
I don't make things easy for myself.
That's my problem.

603
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,200
[thunder rumbling]

604
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,400
[Matt] <i>There's just</i>
<i>one challenge remaining</i>

605
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,160
<i>in</i> The Great British Baking Show <i>of 2021.</i>

606
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,160
[Giuseppe] Ooh.

607
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,680
[Crystelle] It's the last time
we'll be doing thisâ¦

608
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,600
[Chigs giggling]

609

â¦walking into this tent. [sighs]

610
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,880
[Prue] We always say this.
It all depends on the Showstopper.

611
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,200
-[Noel laughs]
-This time it really does, doesn't it?

612
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,680
I would say that Crystelle
was slightly ahead of Giuseppe,

613
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,320
who's slightly ahead of Chigs.

614
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,840
Giuseppe in the Technical,
what was he doing?

615
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,400
He said he was watching them all the time.

616
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,080
-He couldn't have been.
-I might've distracted him a little bit.

617
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,720
-So, it's your fault?
-Probably. [laughs]

618
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,840
What has been so amazing
is the progression Crystelle has made.

619
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,280
But Chigs has been
so good of late, you know.

620
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,520
If he has a banger,
he could be up for a shout.

621
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,240
I think today's gonna be a real marathon.

622
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,440
Yeah, it's called Snickers now.

623
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,960
-Oh, is it? Sorry.
-[Noel laughs]

624
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,240
[all laugh]

625
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,880
Bakers, it's time for your
final Showstopper Challenge.

626
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,720
Paul and Prue would like you
to create an outstanding

627
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,360
Mad Hatter's tea party display

628
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,840
worthy of your final challenge
in the tent.

629
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,800
[Noel] The judges are looking
for a magical display

630
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,640
of sweet and savoury afternoon tea treats

631
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,360
shaped and decorated
in a Mad Hatter kind of a way.

632
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,480
Your display should showcase

633
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,240
at least four
different baking disciplines.

634
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,440
You have four and a half hours.

635
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,760
-On your marks.
-[sing-song] Get set.

636
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,040
[in Cockney accent] It all comes down
to the Showstopper.

637
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,320
[normal voice] Bake.

638
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,760
[whispers] Breathe.

639
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,760
Just remember to breathe.

640
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,920
There's a load to do.
Everyone's going on a mad one today.

641
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,000
[Giuseppe] There's so much to do.

642
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,840
This theme is the Mad Hatter's tea party.

643
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,240
So, we should have a feeling
that this is <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

644
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,520
It's all an illusion.
We want some of that craziness.

645
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,400
We want
at least four disciplines of baking.

646
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,760
A little bit of sweet, a bit of savoury
to find that balance.

647
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,040
There's an element of juggling.
You want that oven full.

648
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,600
So, one straight after the other.

649
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,960
If you've got an empty oven,
for me, something's wrong.

650
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,200
Get everything baked
as quickly as possible,

651
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,960
then you can cool and decorate.

652
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,680
[Prue] I want to see perfect bakes.

653
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,160
Amazing decoration.

654
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,600
And a whole display
that transports us into Wonderland.

655
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,000
-[Paul] Hi, Chigs.
-Morning!

656
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,120
Mad Hatter's tea party,.
What are you doing?

657
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,280
[Chigs] My centrepiece is going to be
a cake flavoured with orange curd

658
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,280
and it'll look like the Cheshire cat.

659
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,400
Second thing I'm doing
are jammy biscuit playing cards,

660
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,680
but the jam's gonna be flavoured

661
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,120
with strawberry,
elderflower and black pepper.

662
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,320
Interesting.

663
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,120
[Noel] <i>The Cheshire cat</i>
<i>and playing card biscuits</i>

667
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,760
[Paul] Have you done a timing sheet
to get it all done?

668
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,240
I've done a list of everything
in the order I need to do it.

669
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,320
We've given you a fair amount of time,
but you've got to rise brioche.

670
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,160
[chuckling] Fair amount of time, Paul?

671
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,440
-Good luck.
-Thank you very much.

672

<i>the dough for mini brioche toadstoolsâ¦</i>

shaped in the form of a mushroom.

-This is your challenge, surely.

682
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,720
-Do you think?
-[Noel] Yeah.

683
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,520
I'd say you've got four baking skills,
whereas the other two, not sure.

684
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,560
-[both laughing]
-Maybe two and a half.

<i>won't have long enough to rise.</i>

689
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,440
Dough is gonna have to go in
to first proof, for about half an hour.

690
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,840
[Noel] <i>But Crystelle has taken</i>

<i>to the heart of her Showstopper.</i>

692
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,080
My main centrepiece
is going to be a focaccia.

693
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,640
Erm, which will be a clock.

694
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,880
And that's got za'atar and garlic in it.

699
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,920
Yes, I am.

700
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,320
It's going to incorporate
all my favourite flavours,

701

712
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,200
[Giuseppe] I don't usually like muffins,

713
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,600
but these with figs
and oranges are just delicious.

714
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,640
The talking flowers are one of
the coolest things in Wonderland.

715
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,040
So I am doing chai-flavoured sponge

716
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,520
and I'm going to cut these
into little circles,

717
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,720

00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,840
[Noel] <i>Whilst Giuseppe waitsâ¦</i>

746
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,760
[speaking Italian] How do I reach 350?

747
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,400
<i>â¦Crystelle and Chigs</i>
<i>have moved on to their savoury treats.</i>

748
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,960
[Chigs] I am making sweet leek
and chicken and mushroom pies.

749
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,120
The tops of the pies
are gonna look like clocks.

750
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,560
-[Noel] Are you doing little curry pies?
-[Crystelle] I am.

751
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,720
-They're going to be top hats
-Top hats.

752
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,640
with little bunny ears
coming out of them.

753
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,800
[Noel] <i>As well as being</i>
<i>behind on his baking,</i>

754
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,920
<i>Giuseppe is the only finalist</i>

755
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,280
<i>that needs to find time</i>
<i>to set a tea party treat.</i>

756
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,920
Panna cotta in Italian means
cooked cream, and that's what it is.

757
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,360
The idea is that Alice
should be drinking this.

758
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,560
I will have "drink me" bottles.

759
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,960
Half of it is going to be flavoured
with mango,

760
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,560
the other half
with vanilla.

761
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,440
I should be shaping the dough now.

762
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,240
I want to finish the panna cotta first.

763
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,880
This little guy has literally
just been proving in olive oil,

764
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,960
and I've got my infused olive oil
with za'atar and garlic.

765
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,520
[Giuseppe] It's done.

766
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,640
[Chigs] This will make
the base of the mushroom.

767
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,520
I'm just going to
push this into the corners.

768
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,880
Very oily.

769
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,520
I'm going to let this prove
for another whole hour.

770
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,760
[Chigs] This is all thanks to Jurgen.

771
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,040
-[Matt] Oh, really?
-Jurgen taught me how to do this.

772
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,840
That's the base of the mushroom.
That'll be filled with crÃ¨me pat.

773
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,400
-Matt?
-CrÃ¨me Matt. [chuckling]

774
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,040
Perfect!

775
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,520
These go in to set.

776
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,400
And finally start making the bread.

777
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,640
Okay.

778
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,120
-[timer beeping]
-Oh, that's my cake.

779
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
[Matt] <i>One bake downâ¦</i>

780
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,240
Before I forget, let me whack up my oven.

781
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,840
<i>â¦three to go.</i>

782
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,800
-I've got loads, Noel.
-Have you given yourself a crazy--

783
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,120
A crazy amount of cakes, biscuits, pies.

784
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,400
-It's the final. You gotta go for it.
-You've got to.

785
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,440
-Pastry going all over me.
-You're on wheels.

786
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,280
If anyone can pull this off, it's you.

787
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,240
[Giuseppe] I'm going to be shaping this
into a mushroom.

788
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,640
I'm not gonna have time
to bake everything.

789
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,600
Pie base. We're gonna go in now.

790
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,160
I'm just going to knead in
that green food colouring.

791
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,800
Tops of the pies.

792
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,960
The head on the mushroom
is going to be layered.

793
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,640
So I'm going to be making discs,
layer them with chocolate and hazelnuts,

794
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,120
and then prove them again.

795
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,560
Biscuit, biscuit, biscuit, biscuit.
We're on track, we're on track.

796
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,120
Might just step it up a gear
after I've done this.

797
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,320
Did you sleep last night?

798
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,760
I actually did,
although I had a recurring dream

799
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,600
that I forgot to prove my focaccia.

800
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,760
And I kept waking up, like,
"Why did I not put my timer on?"

801
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,560
[Matt] And what was the consequence of it?

802
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,600
I don't know what happened.
It was one of those cliff-hanger dreams.

803
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,480
[Noel] <i>Whilst Crystelle is still haunted</i>
<i>by a focaccia clockâ¦</i>

804
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,600
[Giuseppe] I'm takin' them out.

805
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,880
<i>â¦time is still proving a nightmare</i>
<i>for Giuseppe.</i>

806
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,560
'Seps, I heard you forgot
to turn your oven on.

807
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,800
-I didn't forget to turn my oven on.
-What happened?

808
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,840
[stumbling] The door wasn't fully closed.

809
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,000
-All right.
-The oven didn't shut--

810
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,600
Let me tell you a few things
about baking, all right?

811
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,280
You need heat.

812
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,080
-[both chuckling]
-Mainly from an oven.

813
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,160
They're done.

814
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,880
Am I late for a very important date?
I'm not sure.

815
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,080
[Chigs] Brioche has gone
into the oven now.

816
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,520
Biscuits are going in after the bread.

817
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,560
Good luck, hats. Please be good to me.

818
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,400
[Giuseppe] Now we're starting
some choux buns

819
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,800
and shaping them as a caterpillar.

820
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,960
How long have we got?

821
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,280
Bakers, you have one hour left.

822
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,560
Hi! I'm here with Mervis the Alien.

823
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,880
-Er, Mervis, ermâ¦
-[makes indistinct noises]

824
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,520
Who do you think is going to win?

825
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,720
[gibbering]

826
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,760
[chuckling]

827
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,720
[squeals]

828
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,680
That's interesting.
I thought Jairzeno left in week two.

829
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,040
-Hmm.
-Ah!

830
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,960
[Giuseppe] The batter is slightly too wet.

831
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,360
[Chigs] There's the brioche.

832
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,960
[Crystelle] This is gonna go in the oven
very shortly.

833
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,920
I only learned this from bread week
that it's supposed to be so oily.

834
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,400
So I thought the more oil, the better.

835
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,160
[Chigs] I'm gonna put the biscuits in now.

836
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,080
[Giuseppe] These are going in.

837
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,880
[Matt] <i>As well as attempting to stick to</i>
<i>an incredibly tight baking scheduleâ¦</i>

838
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,760
This little piggy
is going in for 15 minutes.

839
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,240
<i>â¦the finalists have multiple fillings</i>
<i>to squeeze in.</i>

840
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
[Chigs] Right. CrÃ¨me pat.
Lemon and lime flavour.

841
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,320
This is going into the brioches.

842
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,560
[Giuseppe] I'm preparing the filling
for the choux buns.

843
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,320
The flavours will be asparagus and peas.

844
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,800
The peas are there just to give
some sweetness and creaminess.

845
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,360
I should add panna cotta layer.

846
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,400
Before that, I shouldâ¦

847
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,760
-Got a proposition for you.
-Oh, no!

848
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,320
This is Mr. Spatula.

849
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,840
Look, he's crying
because he knows the result.

850
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,160
-[Crystelle] Stop it.
-But he can also change the result.

851
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,640
Don't tell me I've got to
kiss that spatula. I'm not doing it.

852
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,800
-[laughing]
-I'm not doing it.

853
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,240
I knew you were gonna ask me to do it
and I'm not.

854
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,720
-He's crying.
-Can I give him an elbow pump?

855
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,880
You wanna, what,
just smash him in the throat?

856
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,720
So, hats.

857
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,120
[Noel] This is Mr. Spatula
and he knows the winner.

858
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,160
He also has the power to
change the result.

859
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,880
-All you need to do is kiss there--
-No.

860
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,240
-Like you'd kiss the Pope's hand.
-No.

861
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,760
This should be my focaccia.

862
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,200
I might just prove it.

863
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,840
It's really hard 'cause
there's piping hot oil in there.

864
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,600
Oh, that definitely seems done.

865
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,120
Yeah, I might take it out.

866
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,760
This is Mr. Spatula. You just have to
kiss his head and then you win.

867
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,000
She wouldn't do it and he wouldn't do it.

868
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,480
Yes!

869
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,320
The majority of it's all done.

870
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,880
I have to bake my biscuits,
then it's a case of decorating everything.

871
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,480
I'm going to start doing that now.

872
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,800
Yeah. Yeah.

873
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,040
[muttering]

874
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,160
[Matt] Bakers! You have half an hour left!

875
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,000
[Giuseppe] I might have to miss out
on some of the elements.

876
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,440
They need to go now.

877
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,280
Gotta get that cake done.

878
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,760
And these guys
are gonna bake for 12 minutes.

879
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,480
[Matt] <i>Crystelle and Chigs may be ready to</i>
<i>begin assembling and decorating,</i>

880
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,640
<i>but Giuseppe,</i>
<i>despite running behind schedule,</i>

881
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,040
<i>has given himself yet</i>
<i>another element to make.</i>

882
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,600
Ginger snaps.
These will go on the panna cotta.

883
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,960
I've gotta fill my piping bags
and then I'm gonna start piping!

884
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,880
[Chigs] There's two blues.
There'll be stripes.

885
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,960
'Cause the Cheshire Cat's stripy,
isn't she? Or he? Or whatever it is.

886
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,160
[Crystelle] These are going to become
little sandwich cakes.

887
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,120
What I can do now is to fill theseâ¦

888
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,440
[Crystelle] Smooth down these sides.

889
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,360
[Giuseppe] The outside
I'm making in purple.

890
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,480
It needs to be psychedelic and mad.

891
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,480
[Crystelle] This will be a sunflower.

892
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,040
[Giuseppe] Come on.

893
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,600
That's the cat done.
How long do we have left?

894
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,920
Fifteen minutes left.

895
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,240
That'll give me enough time
to put everything on the board.

896
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,760
I'm not gonna get
to do all of my extra bits.

897
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,960
I think they look all right.

898
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,920
Eleven minutes.

899
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,600
[Crystelle] All that's left
is to pipe little faces.

900
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,160
[Chigs] This is not a Sharpie, by the way.

901
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,000
Edible pen.

902
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,280
[oven beeping]

903
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,160
[Crystelle] So nice
seeing it come together.

904
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,640
[Giuseppe] Can't believe I'm done.

905
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,560
I have to assemble things,
but I don't have to make anything else.

906
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,720
[Noel] <i>But Giuseppe's assembly</i>
<i>isn't straightforward.</i>

907
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,640
You only have five minutes left.

908
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,920
[Chigs] This mushroom's done.

909
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,520
The head.

910
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,920
I'm sweating.

911
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,240
[Giuseppe] They're very well done.

912
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,520
-Done.
-One minute left.

913
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,920
What am I missing?
Oh, yes, the caterpillar.

914
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,040
Oh! God, they're all falling.

915
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,560
My hearts are falling.

916
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,720
Representing my love life.

917
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,960
[Noel] Your time is up!

918
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,400
[all applauding]

919
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,080
[squeals cheerfully]

920
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,280
Oh! Oh, my gosh!
You're gonna break your back.

921
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,400
Oh, my God!

922
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,400
Well done!

923
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,040
Completed it, mate.

924
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,280
-[applause continues]
-[Giuseppe whistles]

925
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,640
[Matt] <i>It's judgement time</i>
<i>for this year's final Showstoppers.</i>

926
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,400
Giuseppe. Would you like to bring out
your Showstopper?

927
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,880
Oh, God.

928
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,560
It's very precarious.

929
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,600
[Prue chuckles]

930
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,480
Well done.

931
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,160
I think it's simple and effective.

932
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,720
These are all very small.
I expected them to be a little bit bigger.

933
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,280
Okay.

934
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,680
[Prue] I don't mind
because it's a caterpillar.

935
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,040
The caterpillar is choux buns

936
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,880
with asparagus, peas filling
and mascarpone topping.

937
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,800
Mmm. Delicious.
You certainly get the asparagus. And pea.

938
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,360
Because it's been filled
with this creamy mixture,

939
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,800
they're quite soft now.

940
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,520
Which is a pity,
because it's all the same texture.

941
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,680
-Mmm.
-[Paul] Let's look at the sweet bread.

942
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,840
[Giuseppe] So the centrepiece is filled
with chocolate and hazelnut.

943
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,360
[Prue] Goodness!
That is quite complicated.

944
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,040
Hmm.

945
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,520
-It's very Italian in its flavour.
-[Prue] Isn't it?

946
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,040
[Paul] I like it, the bread is so crispy.

947
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,600
This is lovely.

948
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,200
-[Paul] This is theâ¦
-[Giuseppe] Orange and figs.

949
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,200
-[Paul] Orange and fig.
-[Prue] They're very cute.

950
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,560
They're very soft, they're juicy,
and they have a lovely flavour to 'em.

951
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,960
-[Prue] They're very good.
-You can take one of these, Prue.

952
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,520
[Giuseppe] They're passion fruit,
mango, panna cotta

953
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,720
with brandy snaps.

954
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,040
[crunching]

955
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,760
The panna cotta is delicious.

956
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,800
[chuckles] I mean, it really is stunning.

957
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,000
[Prue] That is the most perfect texture
for a panna cotta.

958
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,160
Just set and it sort of cracks
as you touch it.

959
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,000
-I might finish this one.
-[Prue] Mmm.

960
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,200
-I'm taking it away with me.
-Yeah, you did well. Thanks very much.

961
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,520
[all laughing]

962
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,480
[Paul] I like the choux buns.

963
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,000
Love the heart cakes.

964
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,400
-And the panna cotta is bliss.
-Thank you very much.

965
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,280
-Thank you.
-[Matt] Well done.

966
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,680
-[sighs]
-[sighs]

967
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,080
[sighs]

968
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,560
Chigs, would you like to bring
your final Showstopper up here?

969
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,360
Please may I have a hand
carrying it to the front, Matt?

970
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,640
-[Matt] Massive.
-[Chigs] Sorry.

971
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,840
To me.

972
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,920
-To you.
-To me.

973
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,440
-To you.
-[chuckling] To me.

974
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,800
To you.

975
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,840
-[Matt] Okay.
-[Paul] Thank you.

976
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,200
[inhales deeply]

977
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,480
I'm quite impressed
with the overall look of them.

978
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,440
I think you've got the Mad Hatter's
tea party very well.

979
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,360
I think the colour of the catâ¦
I love the cards.

980
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,560
{\an8}-These are particularly interesting to me.
-[Prue] There's something mad.

981
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,600
Which is part of
the sort of surreal thing.

982
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,640
[Paul] These clocks look quite neat.

983
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,040
-Shall we start with the savoury first?
-Yeah, why not?

984
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,880
[Chigs] Chicken, sweet leek
and mushroom pies.

985
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,560
-That's delicious.
-[Prue] Mmm.

986
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,240
[Paul chuckling]
One of my favourite things.

987
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,600
Very nice pastry.
Has it got thyme in there?

988
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,120
-Thyme and tarragon.
-[Prue] That was delicious.

989
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,160
This is a brioche?

990
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,040
[Chigs] Yes.
Filled with a lemon and lime crÃ¨me pat.

991
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,360
Delicious crÃ¨me pat.

992
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,920
It's beautiful. It's nice and sweet,
but just the right level of sweetness.

993
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,520
It's nice-looking.

994
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,800
[Chigs] These are shortbread biscuits

995
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,160
with strawberry, elderflower
and black pepper jam.

996
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,000
-[Prue] I think it's beautiful.
-[Paul] It is.

997
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,240
[Prue] The punched-out hearts
are charming.

998
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,720
-Don't really like to spoil it.
-[Noel] Go on, Prue.

999
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,760
-[Prue] Mmm. Very good.
-[Paul] Jam's very good.

1000
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,920
Jam is excellent.

1001
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,480
[Paul] It's a nice, buttery biscuit.
I'm not getting the elderflower.

1002
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,800
-I'm getting strawberry.
-And black pepper?

1003
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,200
-No.
-[Chigs] Okay.

1004
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,400
[Paul] The biscuit is delicious with it.

1005
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,920
-Okay.
-[Prue] Right.

1006
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,280
-[Paul] This is orange cake?
-[Chigs] Yeah.

1007
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,880
It's got orange curd
and mascarpone cream in the middle.

1008
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,280
I was looking forward
to the Cheshire cat's grin.

1009
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,560
I know. I'd kind of run out of time.

1010
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,400
[exhales heavily]

1011
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,800
-[chuckling] That's a delicious sponge.
-It's really good.

1012
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,360
The orange really works.

1013
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,360
You're left with a beautiful
floral flavour in your mouth.

1014
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,920
[Prue] You've not put too much buttercream
round the edge, so it's not too sweet.

1015
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,200
That's a very nice cake.

1016
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,640
-[Paul] Very good cake.
-Thank you.

1017
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,240
-[Paul] Well done.
-You've done a good job.

1018
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,680
-Well done, Chigs.
-[Chigs] Thanks.

1019
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,400
-[Matt] Amazing.
-Thank you.

1020
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,720
[breathing heavily]

1021
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,600
[sighs in relief]

1022
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,800
[exhales]

1023
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,600
Crystelle, would you like to bring out
your Showstopper?

1024
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,880
Please may I have a hand?

1025
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,680
Threeâ¦ twoâ¦ oneâ¦

1026
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,040
-Lift. Yeah.
-[Noel] You got it?

1027
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,680
-[Crystelle] Yep.
-I've got puppet legs. Don't drop it.

1028
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,160
It's okay.
I'm bending my knees and it's fine.

1029
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,560
-Don't let go.
-Where you gonna go?

1030
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,920
This way.

1031
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,720
[chuckles] Don't go low on me.

1032
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,240
Okay, we're gonnaâ¦ Okay.

1033
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,920
-Right. Erâ¦
-[Prue] Brilliant.

1034
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,280
[Noel whispers] There you go.

1035
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,440
{\an8}[Paul] It looks quite impressive.
It's colourful.

1036
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,800
[Prue] I like the little sunflowers
with their faces.

1037
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,960
What did you say
these biscuits were called?

1038
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,880
They're called nankhatais. They've got
brown butter, cardamom and nuts.

1039
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,760
[sighs]

1040
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,880
-It's very fudge-like, isn't it?
-Yeah.

1041
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,400
It's got a lovely balance of flavours
with the spices in there.

1042
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,680
Delicious.

1043
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,160
-[Paul] Let's move on to the talking--
-[Prue] Sunflowers.

1044
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,520
Which are chai sponges
with cream cheese frosting.

1045
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,800
I think that cake is really delicious.
It's very soft.

1046
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,880
[Paul] The chai comes through beautifully.

1047
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,920
Then the cooling from the cream cheese,
it blends nicely together.

1048
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,960
[exhales]

1049
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,440
[Paul] This is hot water crust pastry.

1050
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,160
[Crystelle] Yeah. Filled with chickpea
and potato curry.

1051
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,440
[exhales]

1052
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,560
Very nice curry middle.

1053
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,320
It's quite solid. But I really like that.

1054
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,880
-Absolutely lovely.
-It's a Goan curry? It's delicious.

1055
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,920
It's got a lovely kick to it as well.

1056
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,400
That's three out of four.

1057
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,640
[all chuckle]

1058
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,600
-[Paul] Right. Focaccia.
-[Prue] Yeah.

1059
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,720
[Crystelle] Which is a za'atar,
garlic and honey focaccia.

1060
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,200
[exhales]

1061
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,200
Erâ¦

1062
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,840
This is not recognizable as focaccia.

1063
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,320
-[Crystelle] Oh, no!
-That's raw dough.

1064
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:55,960
[exhales]

1065
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,920
-What have you done? That is raw.
-[Crystelle] I don't know.

1066
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,640
-Has it been in the oven?
-Yeah.

1067
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,120
I don't know what happened.

1068
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,440
-That's bizarre.
-[Paul] There's no rise at all.

1069
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,800
That's inedible, that one.

1070
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,760
-[Prue] That's a pity.
-[Paul] Never seen anything like it.

1071
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,920
I'm really sorry. I don't know
what happened. That's bizarre.

1072
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,800
But over all, I think your flavours
of what we did try was very good.

1073
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,000
Thank you.

1074
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,160
-[Prue] Thank you.
-Thank you.

1075
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,960
[Crystelle] Obviously,
I focus on the negatives, right?

1076
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,840
There was a big fat negative in there.

1077
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,120
I'm just baffled.

1078
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,680
How the hell did that happen
to my focaccia?

1079
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,000
[Giuseppe] I feel confused.

1080
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,960
Pretty much everybody
had very good comments,

1081
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:46,440
something that didn't quite meet
the expectations of the judges.

1082
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,600
[Chigs] I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't nervous.

1083
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,000
I've been waiting
all this time now. Ten weeks.

1084
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,960
[chuckling] I want to know the result now.

1085
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,880
[audience cheering]

1086
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,120
[Matt] <i>Everyone in our bubble</i>

1091
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,560
Do you think Crystelle
could still win this?

1092
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,080
[Paul] It's got complicated

1093
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,440
because she's dropped,
because of the focaccia being raw.

1094
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,760
-I could see her heart sink then.
-I know. Poor girl.

1095
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,400
[Paul] <i>So Chigs has come from the outside.</i>

1096
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,200
You were very impressed with Chigs.

1097
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,920
You were pretty impressed with Giuseppe
but when it came to this,

1098
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,920
-you couldn't stop eating it.
-That was very good.

1099
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,160
We don't want to rush
into picking someone,

1100
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,880
so we'll sit down,
have another cup of tea,

1101
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,960
maybe a couple of glasses of wine.

1102
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,280
See you tomorrow, chaps.

1103
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,200
-[chuckling] See you tomorrow.
-We might not be back, is that okay?

1104
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,400
That's fine, we'll do it ourselves.

1105
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,680
[all cheering]

1106
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,520
Well, before we do anything else,

1107
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,640
I would like to thank,
on behalf of the show,

1108
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,840
everybody who looked after us
here at the hotel.

1109
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,520
The cleaners, the caterers
and all of the staff.

1110
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,800
Thank you so much.

1111
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,480
[all cheering and applauding]

1112
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:17,600
And, now, I would like to invite
our three finalists

1113
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,680
to come and join us.

1114
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,440
[all cheering]

1115
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,800
Giuseppe. Come on.

1116
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,600
You guys are amazing.

1117
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,200
Bakers, thank you so much
for bringing your warmth

1118
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,640
and good humour and, of course,
your brilliant bakes into the tent.

1119
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,400
And now, I'm going to hand over
to my colleague, Mr. Noel Fielding,

1120
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,640
who has something to tell you.

1121
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:47,680
The winner
of <i>The Great British Baking show</i> isâ¦

1122
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,080
Giuseppe.

1123
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,920
[all cheering]

1124
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,920
[Crystelle yelling] Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1125
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,640
[Noel chuckling]

1126
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,600
-[Noel chuckling] Congratulations!
-[Matt] Congratulations, man.

1127
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,080
[cheering continues]

1128
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,020
[Paul] Well done, Giuseppe.

1129
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,220
Thank you. <i>Grazie.</i>

1130
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,460
[both laugh]

1131
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,700
-[Prue] Well done!
-[voice breaking]<i> Grazie.</i>

1132
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,260
[cheers and applause continue]

1133
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,260
There are no words.
[chuckling] I'm speechless.

1134
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:41,980
For once.

1135
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,780
[Paul] You're the first Italian
to ever win it.

1136
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,100
[all laughing]

1137
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,920
From the first time
I walked into the tent,

1138
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,120
on the first Signature
and I saw his mini rolls, I went,

1139
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,920
"That looks like our winner."

1140
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,280
You could see the heart and soul
going into his baking.

1141
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,120
He's done an incredible job.

1142
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,400
He's such a classic, beautiful baker.

1143
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,440
He represents a long tradition
of classical Italian baking.

1144
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,280
And done it brilliantly
the whole way through.

1145
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,440
So I'm going home
to make lots more Italian cakes,

1146
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,320
'cause they really are good.

1147
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,160
[Chigs grunts] Come on.
Well done, my friend. You deserve it.

1148
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,720
[Chigs] I am over the moon
that Giuseppe's won

1149
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,120
'cause I know how hard he has worked
throughout this whole competition.

1150
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,760
It's a euphoric moment.

1151
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,400
It's time to move on
to the next challenge in my life.

1152
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,720
<i>Bake Off </i>final. Tick. [chuckles]

1153
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,360
Thanks. Sorry about the focaccia.

1154
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,360
I am so happy for Giuseppe.

1155
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,680
He's an incredibleâ¦ I'm getting emotional.

1156
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,520
He's an incredible guy.

1157
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,160
So genuine, an insane baker
and he really deserves that win.

1158
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,160
His family are gonna be so proud of him.

1159
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,760
-[Noel] Let that sink in.
-[Giuseppe] I'm in shock. I'm in shock.

1160
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:56,920
All I can think of is the reaction
I'm gonna get from my mum and dad.

1161
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,480
The fact that everything
I've done to deserve this

1162
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,560
comes from his heritage.

1163
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,400
I think it's going to be the best
thank-you note I could possibly send him.

1164
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,880
He's going through
a very hard time, health-wise, soâ¦

1165
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,240
Er, I think that this is
going to be a boost.

00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,080
-[Matt] Go take a bow.

1168
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,760
[Giuseppe] I don't say often and lightly
that I'm proud of what I doâ¦

1169
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,760
But, in this case,
I can't possibly not say that.

1170
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,920
I'm really, really proud that I did this.

1171
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:38,720
[speaking Italian] It's unbelievable,
it's unbelievable.
