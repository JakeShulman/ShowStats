1
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:09,915
BELLS RING

2
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:33,195
Music: Walking in the Air
The Snowman

3
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:37,435
# We're walking in the air

4
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:45,435
# We're floating in the moonlit
sky... #

5
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:49,115
Isn't that...?
Yeah.

6
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,795
Forget about that, Prue -
Christmas Bake Off's about to start.

7
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:54,315
Come on.
It's freezing up here.

8
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:56,075
I've practically got...
Oh, snowballs!

9
00:00:56,075 --> 00:00:59,155
Welcome to the Great
Christmas Bake Off.

10
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:00,595
Hide your face.
Keep the magic.

11
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:03,275
My carrot's wilting.

12
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:26,395
Nothing says Christmas like a family
get-together, especially

13
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:29,315
if it's the extended
Bake Off family.

14
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:33,995
So dressed in their festive best
for our seasonal special are Flo,

15
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:36,435
Andrew, Jane and Liam.

16
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:38,515
I'm just happy to be back, do
you know what I mean?

17
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,675
Such a throwback, innit?

18
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:43,355
Bake one more time in a tent,
Christmas, Christmas jumpers,

19
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:46,155
trees and that...
Yeah.

20
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:48,995
Last year, Liam's creativity...
I think it's ingenious.

21
00:01:48,995 --> 00:01:52,155
..won the judges over.
I love that flavour.

22
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:54,155
Oh, yes!

23
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,635
..and took him all the way
to the quarterfinal.

24
00:01:56,635 --> 00:01:58,995
But a couple of
disappointing bakes...

25
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:01,635
I'm just not getting
any flavours at all.

26
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:03,835
OK.
It's just very raw.

27
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:05,515
..sent him home.

28
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:07,835
I've come such a long way,
so it's good to come back

29
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:09,395
to where it started, in a sense.

30
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:12,635
Paul, I'm coming.

31
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:15,955
Joining Liam is his
old baking buddy, Flo.

32
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:18,835
Want to try mine?
They're so good. That is sick.

33
00:02:18,835 --> 00:02:22,155
I never thought for one minute
that I would ever set my eyes

34
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:23,355
on that tent again!

35
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:26,355
She impressed the judges
with her watermelon sponge...

36
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,515
That's excellent, that.
I think that's wonderful.

37
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,035
..but she failed to rise
to the challenge in Bread Week.

38
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:34,275
It's more like a ciabatta.
Is that what you set out to do?

39
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:35,715
No.

40
00:02:35,715 --> 00:02:37,155
You could have lied then, Flo. No.

41
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:39,635
It's even more nerve-racking
because I know what to expect.

42
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:42,955
I've been there, done that,
and then I'm back again.

43
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:43,995
Oh, my God!

44
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:45,835
What am I doing here?

45
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:49,795
Also back in the tent...
I love Christmas trees.

46
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,475
..from series seven is
garden designer Jane.

47
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:55,995
I'm a huge Christmas fan,
so to be in the tent full

48
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:59,755
of the most amazing
decorations, it's just lovely.

49
00:02:59,755 --> 00:03:02,635
Although decoration has tripped
her up in the past...

50
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:04,395
They are half-iced.

51
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:06,115
..her baking expertise...

52
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:08,675
Three
layers of heaven. It's beautiful.

53
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:10,115
Thank you very much indeed.

54
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:14,875
..earned her a place in the 2016
final alongside our fourth returning

55
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,035
baker, Andrew.

56
00:03:17,035 --> 00:03:19,515
I love Jane and we've been great
friends since the Bake Off,

57
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:22,155
but I'd be lying if I said
we weren't a little bit competitive.

58
00:03:22,155 --> 00:03:23,475
We both want to do well!

59
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:26,915
The aerospace engineer was known
for his precision baking.

60
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,355
I think it's a great idea.
I love the design of it.

61
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:33,195
And, although his presentation
wasn't always up to scratch...

62
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:36,355
..the real chink in his
armour was Biscuit Week.

63
00:03:36,355 --> 00:03:39,075
What we're actually eating
there is like a stale biscuit.

64
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:41,995
Just being back in there, seeing
the benches and everything,

65
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:44,115
a little bit nervous.
I've got the tent nerves.

66
00:03:44,115 --> 00:03:47,795
But which one of our returning
bakers will reap the rewards

67
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:50,475
of becoming
this year's yuletide winner?

68
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:53,595
Hello, bakers, and welcome back
to the Bake Off tent,

69
00:03:53,595 --> 00:03:55,395
and Merry Christmas!

70
00:03:55,395 --> 00:03:57,075
Guess what my true love gave to me.

71
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:59,075
Was it a partridge in a pear tree?
No, socks.

72
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:00,395
It's really boring. OK.

73
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:04,035
For your Signature Challenge, Paul
and Prue would like you to make

74
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,835
a dozen iced biscuits on the theme
of the 12 days of Christmas.

75
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:10,115
Now, flavour of the biscuits
is entirely up to you,

76
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:13,395
but the judges will be looking
for 12 perfectly and evenly baked

77
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:16,675
biscuits, intricately decorated
with your own personal

78
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:19,555
interpretation of those
wonderful 12 days.

79
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:22,035
You've got two and a half hours.
On your marks...

80
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:23,635
Get set.
Bake.

81
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:28,115
I suddenly feel very nervous.

82
00:04:28,115 --> 00:04:30,195
You'll be grand, Jane,
you'll be grand.

83
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:32,635
I'm trying to keep
ahead of myself and just

84
00:04:32,635 --> 00:04:34,395
calm down. Not so wobbly.

85
00:04:38,715 --> 00:04:40,395
Christmas nerves!

86
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:41,395
Ho, ho, ho!

87
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:46,475
For the Signature Challenge,
we're asking for really

88
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:51,795
fantastically crisp, wonderful
biscuits, and amazingly decorated,

89
00:04:51,795 --> 00:04:53,875
and originally decorated.

90
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,995
Whatever they do, it
has to absolutely sing Christmas.

91
00:04:56,995 --> 00:05:00,115
You're looking for a balance
of flavours between the icing

92
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:01,395
and the biscuit itself.

93
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:04,355
You don't want too much icing
cos it overwhelms the biscuit.

94
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:06,635
The biscuit should be
the star of the show.

95
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:11,635
It's really difficult to not
like something that is Christmassy,

96
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:15,035
but old blue eyes will be as stern
as ever, I'm sure!

97
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:17,755
Noel called me
the Grinch this morning.

98
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:21,835
I probably think that's probably
going to be about right.

99
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:26,355
I'm feeling very festive.

100
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:29,235
I'm hoping my biscuits
are going to reflect that, too.

101
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:31,515
The first task for the bakers
is to make their dough

102
00:05:31,515 --> 00:05:33,675
as quickly as possible.

103
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:35,395
I'm doing it in a machine
cos I'm lazy.

104
00:05:35,395 --> 00:05:37,555
It just saves all that rubbing in.

105
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:41,395
Working the butter into the flour
creates a fine breadcrumb texture.

106
00:05:41,395 --> 00:05:43,755
I want to make sure
they're really crisp, because Paul

107
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:45,235
does like a good snap.

108
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:47,475
To truly bowl over the judges...

109
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:49,915
I've made a terrible mess of myself.

110
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:52,075
..the bakers will need
to cram their biscuits

111
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:53,435
with Christmas flavours.

112
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:55,115
So these are some currants.

113
00:05:55,115 --> 00:05:59,515
I've got ground cloves, ground
nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon - full

114
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:00,675
of flavour, they are.

115
00:06:00,675 --> 00:06:02,995
So I'm adding mincemeat
to my butter mix.

116
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,235
I'd say it's like a mince
pie shortbread.

117
00:06:05,235 --> 00:06:06,275
Yeah!

118
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:09,635
Liam's hoping his fruity Christmas
classic will help him stand out

119
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,075
from the crowd.

120
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:12,795
But he isn't the only one.

121
00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:16,555
So the biscuit itself, it's mince
pie inspired, so it's got a bit

122
00:06:16,555 --> 00:06:20,155
of orange zest, some mixed spice
and some currants for kind

123
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:21,995
of a pop of fruit in there.

124
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:23,435
And they're going to be crunchy.

125
00:06:23,435 --> 00:06:26,155
They're not going to have a snap
necessarily, because I know

126
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:28,355
what... You know what I'm going to
say!

127
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,475
I can see it in your face!
I know you love a snap.

128
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,715
I remember your comments
about my biscuits last year.

129
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:35,155
Do you remember your biscuits?
I do. Stale. They were soft.

130
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:37,795
Haunts me to this day. I like the
idea of a Hollywood haunt.

131
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:39,995
I think this is a new thing -
the Hollywood handshake

132
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:41,435
and the Hollywood haunt.

133
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:45,195
Andrew's aiming to put the ghost
of Paul's past comments to rest

134
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:48,995
with his orange zest and currant
shortbreads, crowned with royal

135
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:52,075
icing cartoons and an added dash
of Christmas spirit.

136
00:06:52,075 --> 00:06:55,275
It's royal icing but, instead of
lemon juice, I'm using apple brandy.

137
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:58,275
Wow. Because, you know, you get
a little bit of that in a mince pie

138
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:01,275
from mincemeat, so hopefully
you'll get a nice bit of brandy.

139
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:02,435
They're quite intricate.

140
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,355
I mean, very, very intricate.

141
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:06,555
I've got 13 different
colours going on.

142
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:09,395
I just hope you pull it off.
I'm focused, I'm determined.

143
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,355
I want to smash it.
Good luck, Andrew.

144
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:15,395
Thank you. Cheers. Who is my biggest
opposition in the tent?

145
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:17,675
I think they're all fantastic.

146
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:23,595
However, old feuds, Andrew and I...

147
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:25,995
I'm talking behind your back,
Andrew, but only because I am

148
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:30,755
behind your back. You're literally
talking behind my back.

149
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:33,915
Oh, look!
A time call doll.

150
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:38,475
Bakers, you have two hours!
Hey, that's gone quickly!

151
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:42,275
Half an hour! Jane's flapping.
Jane's flapping.

152
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:45,195
I'm just going to roll
my biscuits out.

153
00:07:45,195 --> 00:07:47,635
I heard on the grapevine -
this might not be true, someone

154
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:51,035
might be winding me up - but I heard
that you like to rap. No.

155
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:53,635
Paul told me you're quite
good at rapping. Yeah. No?

156
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:56,235
I did it on the Jo Brand Show.
Who's your favourite rapper?

157
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:58,395
And he was there.
Who do you like, Biggie Smalls?

158
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,995
Hmm. Tupac?

159
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:01,875
Who?
Never heard of them.

160
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,835
I like Will.i.am.
You like Will.i.am.

161
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:07,075
Oh, he's lovely. Wow!
He's lovely.

162
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:09,395
I could put in a word for you.
Could you? No.

163
00:08:09,395 --> 00:08:11,315
You're not going to rap
for us, are you? No.

164
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:13,715
You haven't got time. Hmm.
Good luck. OK.

165
00:08:13,715 --> 00:08:16,115
Don't let me down. Thank you.
I'll ring Will.

166
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:19,595
OK, you do that.

167
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:22,235
With 12 individual
biscuits to cut out...

168
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,515
Each biscuit is a different shape.

169
00:08:24,515 --> 00:08:26,955
So I'm going to be
using my craft knife.

170
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:29,155
The bakers will need a steady hand.

171
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:32,035
It does bring back
stressful memories.

172
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:34,835
Hello, Liam!
Oh, Gordon Bennett!

173
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:37,715
Right, tell us all about
your biscuits then, please.

174
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:40,435
So, they're inspired
by the 12 essentials of Liam.

175
00:08:40,435 --> 00:08:42,635
I've got a biscuit-shaped game
controller, I've got a

176
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:43,875
biscuit-shaped dance move.

177
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,075
Are they particularly about
Christmas or are they about Liam?

178
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:51,715
Liam at Christmas. I worry a little,
because you're rolling shortbread

179
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:54,155
over and over again.
This is only once.

180
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:57,115
And the layers are flaking
because you're getting flour

181
00:08:57,115 --> 00:08:59,115
in between, so it's
going to peel off.

182
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:01,195
It should be fine.

183
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:03,235
Paul, Paul, it will work.
OK.

184
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:04,355
Can you have faith?

185
00:09:04,355 --> 00:09:07,635
Liam's been praying to the baking
gods that his designs

186
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:10,475
will be clearly
recognised by the judges.

187
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:12,915
Can you tell me what that is?
That's my falafel.

188
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:13,955
THEY LAUGH

189
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:17,955
Sorry, it just...
How are you going to know that...?

190
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:19,915
Oh, leave it out, will ya?

191
00:09:19,915 --> 00:09:22,755
No, no, when I pipe it, it looks
legitimate like a falafel, I swear.

192
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:25,275
All right. Shall I take him away
now? Yes, please.

193
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:28,195
Right, Paul, this way, come on.
Good luck, mate. Cheers, man.

194
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:34,035
My biscuits are ready to go
in the oven for about 12 minutes.

195
00:09:34,035 --> 00:09:37,195
It's crunch time for the biscuits.
Ooh...

196
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:40,995
In a matter of minutes, the bakers
will know if the texture

197
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:44,875
of their biscuits will meet
the judges' expectations.

198
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,875
Paul was just worried
about the shortbread.

199
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,115
They should be fine.

200
00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:53,235
I don't want to jinx it.

201
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:58,835
Bakers, you are halfway through.
I love this show.

202
00:09:58,835 --> 00:10:00,475
You've just got stars in your eyes.

203
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,715
Only seconds lie between a soft
under-baked biscuit...

204
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:05,555
I'm paranoid about them being chewy.
I don't want them to be chewy.

205
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:10,115
..and a burnt over-baked one.

206
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:14,675
I forgot what it's
like to be in the tent.

207
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:18,395
It's a battle of the bakers' nerves.

208
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:22,435
And breathe.
A small Christmas hug.

209
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,315
You are very huggable.
Am I?

210
00:10:24,315 --> 00:10:26,035
Yeah.
Is that a compliment?

211
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:28,715
I don't know, it's this jumper,
something about this jumper.

212
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:30,195
I'll take that.

213
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:36,315
Yeah. I'm going to say done.
Yeah.

214
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:44,635
They've kept their shape
really, really well.

215
00:10:46,235 --> 00:10:47,595
Happy, happy.

216
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:50,275
The biscuits should be cooled
before being decorated.

217
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,395
I'm putting them in
the fridge for a minute.

218
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:56,155
Giving the bakers time
to prepare their toppings.

219
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,475
I'm going to be doing a brandy
icing because booze seems

220
00:10:58,475 --> 00:10:59,875
like a good tactic today.

221
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:03,715
Andrew, Liam and Jane
have all chosen to use royal icing.

222
00:11:03,715 --> 00:11:07,475
Beautiful colour. It's like you've
melted down the Pink Panther's legs.

223
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:10,795
That's deep. I'm making about 13
different colours of icing.

224
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,755
There's a lot to do in the time.

225
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,435
Just having so many
different colours to mix up.

226
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:18,435
But Flo is going for a more
traditional colour scheme.

227
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:20,875
That looks very festive.
What are you making there?

228
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,075
What are you doing? It's just red
fondant. Oh, right.

229
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:25,395
It's going to be a decoration
of the 12 days of Christmas.

230
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:28,715
Do you know in Scotland the 12 days
of Christmas has got a baboon in it?

231
00:11:28,715 --> 00:11:30,355
I'm just saying.
Interesting to know.

232
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:35,155
Isn't that a Scouse cut down?

233
00:11:35,155 --> 00:11:39,595
Well, that's fascinating.

234
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:43,355
Flo's Christmases may be
primate-free but her family are wild

235
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:46,315
about her festive treacle
and ginger biscuits.

236
00:11:46,315 --> 00:11:48,835
She's decorating them
with fondant and dusting

237
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:50,515
with festive golden designs.

238
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:53,075
So you did the partridge
on one, you're doing a pear

239
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:55,395
tree on another... Five gold rings.
Yeah.

240
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:57,995
That's a lot to do. Don't. I'm
panicked enough as it is, don't.

241
00:11:57,995 --> 00:12:02,395
Are you worried about it?

242
00:12:02,395 --> 00:12:06,075
You're fine. I'm nervous. Look at
me. You're fine. You're fine.

243
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:09,075
OK. Take it easy, Flo.
Enjoy. Right? Thank you.

244
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:11,075
Did you do these drawings?

245
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:12,395
I did.

246
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:14,595
I'm not very good at drawing.

247
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:16,555
This says otherwise.
Bless you.

248
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:18,675
I think you should do
some life drawing.

249
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:20,835
Have you ever done life drawing?
I have, actually.

250
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:23,515
Have you? And I found it really
awkward, when they say hold your

251
00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:25,675
pencil up,
so he was always looking at me.

252
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:27,115
It was very off-putting.

253
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:31,075
Also they're naked.
That is an issue.

254
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:33,395
Thankfully the only
baubles on display today

255
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:35,795
will be of the Christmas
tree variety.

256
00:12:35,795 --> 00:12:39,715
Jane's Norwegian spice biscuits
will be intricately iced to look

257
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:41,955
like 12 festive ornaments.

258
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:44,755
I see from the pictures
that you're going to put quite a lot

259
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:46,035
of detail into this.
Yes.

260
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:48,835
Last time you were in the tent
you didn't finish.

261
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:51,395
Know your biscuits and read
the colour and it's just down

262
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,875
to the piping. Fingers crossed.
Good luck, Jane.

263
00:12:55,235 --> 00:13:00,035
It's always fun to stretch yourself
in the time in front of Paul.

264
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:05,235
Bakers, you have half an hour.

265
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:07,795
You're not dressing
for Christmas, then? No.

266
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:09,155
I'm about to start icing.

267
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:14,315
When it comes to piping icing
you've got to be in that zone.

268
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:17,115
Flo might be keeping
her icing simple...

269
00:13:17,115 --> 00:13:20,235
I'm just putting fondant on top
of the ginger biscuit.

270
00:13:20,235 --> 00:13:22,115
..but the other bakers...
Yellow, purple...

271
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:24,795
..now
face the unforgiving...

272
00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:26,235
My hand is shaking.

273
00:13:26,235 --> 00:13:30,395
..and time-consuming task
of flood icing their designs.

274
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:33,315
I'm going to outline everything
and then fill them in with slightly

275
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:34,835
different colours of royal icing.

276
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:37,595
Because I'm terrible
at freehand I'm doing

277
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:42,115
this on parchment above my drawings
and then dry them out in the oven

278
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:44,275
and then stick them
on top of the biscuits.

279
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:46,555
It's risky cos they can crack.

280
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:48,035
They might not fit in time.

281
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,355
There's quite a lot
of risk to it, actually.

282
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:53,195
The icing should add
sweetness but not dominate

283
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:54,715
the bakers' biscuits.

284
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:58,675
What are you eyeballing me for?

285
00:13:58,675 --> 00:14:02,235
It's very interesting that the two
women are doing traditional things

286
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:04,875
but the guys are right off piste.

287
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,835
What does that look like to you?
A bum.

288
00:14:08,795 --> 00:14:10,235
Is it supposed to look like a bum?

289
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:12,635
I think the falafel thing
is going to be fascinating to see

290
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:15,155
if it looks like a falafel.

291
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,515
I do love his originality.

292
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:19,435
We've got some fantastic ideas,
I just hope they get the chance

293
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:21,315
to finish them so we get the full

294
00:14:21,315 --> 00:14:23,515
impact of what they should look
like.

295
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:26,395
My poor robin looks
really sorry for himself.

296
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:28,835
Those are going in to dry.

297
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:32,835
And onto the next batch.

298
00:14:32,835 --> 00:14:34,275
Have you got to do all these?

299
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:36,555
I've done six that are
crisping up in the oven.

300
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:38,555
Right. And
then these are the final six.

301
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:40,515
Do you think you can do it?

302
00:14:40,515 --> 00:14:42,635
It's pushing it, to be honest.

303
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,755
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.
That's not a long time.

304
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,515
No. Panic is beginning to set in.

305
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,275
Right, they're coming out.

306
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:54,515
I'm not very good at this

307
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:56,515
stencilling lark but I'm having a
go.

308
00:14:56,515 --> 00:15:02,755
You're going to have to like move
swift but be precise

309
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:04,875
at the same time.

310
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,635
Sugar!
This is do or die now.

311
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:11,115
Please come off, please come
off, please come off.

312
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:14,395
Oh, dear. They are not coming
off the transfer.

313
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:19,035
Right, what can I do?
What can I do?

314
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:20,515
Let's try another one.

315
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:22,515
Hello, lovely.
Hello.

316
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:24,595
I came because I heard
you squealing.

317
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:26,515
I was squealing.
It's not gone great.

318
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:27,795
They haven't really dried.

319
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:29,835
I'm just going to pipe
on top of this.

320
00:15:29,835 --> 00:15:32,235
What is that one?
It used to be an alarm clock.

321
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:36,035
OK. It's a good time to tell
you you haven't got much time.

322
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,875
Paul would not give me
a handshake for this one.

323
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,035
Oh, this is torture.

324
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:44,395
I'm far too heavy-handed.

325
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:47,915
They weren't usually this delicate
when I practised them at home,

326
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:51,515
to be honest, but stuff always
happens in the tent.

327
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:53,915
I'm dropping crumbs
everywhere off my hands.

328
00:15:53,915 --> 00:15:57,235
Bakers, you have one
minute, just one minute.

329
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:58,275
Panic stations!

330
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:01,635
Oh, my goodness.

331
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:05,195
SINGS: 12 falafel wraps...

332
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:08,555
It's time to get
these over to the tree.

333
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:11,755
Glazed doughnuts...

334
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:13,835
They are all on the verge
of falling off.

335
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:19,235
I've done my best.

336
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:20,835
Flo, those look amazing.

337
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:25,555
I think mine look like
a great dog's dinner.

338
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:27,115
Bakers, your time is up.

339
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:32,275
Please place your iced biscuits
at the end of your benches.

340
00:16:32,275 --> 00:16:35,915
Messy. You haven't seen
mine, Jane, honestly.

341
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:39,275
The first Christmas train for me.

342
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:51,595
festively flavoured
and impressively iced biscuits.

343
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:59,875
Each one is an image of something
that I do

344
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,475
when I'm home at Christmas time.

345
00:17:02,475 --> 00:17:05,595
The flavours are mince pie inspired,
with an apple brandy icing.

346
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:08,755
I love the imagination.
I think they're wonderful.

347
00:17:08,755 --> 00:17:12,875
I just think the piping
is a little clumsy.

348
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:16,995
Oh! Nice snap on that. Phew!

349
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,035
Yes, you were worried about them
being soggy.

350
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:21,075
I heard about
your soggy biscuits.

351
00:17:23,755 --> 00:17:25,315
Thanks, Prue.

352
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:28,195
It's got the flavour of shortbread,

353
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:30,715
but the star of it is that brandy
in that icing.

354
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:33,995
It's delicious altogether.
Apple brandy. I shall remember that.

355
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:36,035
Thank you, Andrew. Thank you very
much.

356
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:39,235
Are you going to steal that, Prue?
I'm going to steal that.

357
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:48,315
They're very elegant.
The colour's good.

358
00:17:48,315 --> 00:17:51,235
I do worry a little bit about that
thickness... Thickness, yeah.

359
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:54,275
Of the fondant on the top to the
biscuit, it's about the same. Yeah.

360
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,915
It's very treacly.

361
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:03,635
But because there's lots of ginger
in it, it doesn't taste too sweet.

362
00:18:03,635 --> 00:18:07,635
It's really an excellent biscuit.
The biscuit's great.

363
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:11,035
But that fondant is far too big.
It's just that, yeah, yeah.

364
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:18,555
I think you've got some
great colours going on.

365
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,475
A little bit rough round the edges.

366
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:23,475
I think you have to look at them
from a certain angle

367
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:24,915
to see that's a falafel!

368
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:29,155
Let's have a look at it, shall we?
Oh, lovely.

369
00:18:30,795 --> 00:18:32,555
Very crisp.

370
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:36,155
You were worrying about them
being flaky, but they're...

371
00:18:36,155 --> 00:18:38,915
..actually crumbly rather
than flaky. They're delicious.

372
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:41,755
I like the flavour.
I think the mince pie filling...

373
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:44,435
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
..it does work in there.

374
00:18:44,435 --> 00:18:45,955
I think you just needed more time,

375
00:18:45,955 --> 00:18:49,475
but I think you've done a decent
job. I do too. Sick.

376
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,155
The detail on your
pipework is excellent.

377
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:02,235
I mean, the cracker looks amazing.
Thank you. Very, very clever.

378
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:05,315
And also, it doesn't look
as if the icing's too thick.

379
00:19:05,315 --> 00:19:07,795
We just hope they taste
as good as they look.

380
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:12,955
It's baked to perfection.
I think they taste amazing.

381
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:15,475
They just explode in the mouth
with the cinnamon.

382
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:18,115
And the way they look, I think
you've done a grand job. Thank you.

383
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,795
I like those biscuits!
Love this guy.

384
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:22,035
Yes, he's looking a little
bit sorry for himself.

385
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,915
He needs to be a badge for me.

386
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:28,475
Jane is my friend,
slash Bake Off rival.

387
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:31,675
I think it would be fair to say
she is nudging into the lead.

388
00:19:31,675 --> 00:19:33,315
Well, I don't think that could

389
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:35,475
have been any better,
could it, really?

390
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,315
They both said such lovely things.

391
00:19:37,315 --> 00:19:39,675
It's like opening a really brilliant
Christmas present

392
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:42,995
that you didn't expect.
Yeah, excellent.

393
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:45,915
I did prove Paul wrong, so...

394
00:19:45,915 --> 00:19:48,795
You've got to believe in yourself.

395
00:19:48,795 --> 00:19:51,475
Am I looking forward
to the technical?

396
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:55,635
Kind of.

397
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:03,355
Hello, bakers.

398
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:06,915
It's Christmas, so there
is no technical today.

399
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,755
Instead, we're just going to lie
down on beanbags, play games...

400
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:12,235
No, no, Noel, there is one.
Paul's set it.

401
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:15,715
He's like the Grinch!
OK, any words of wisdom?

402
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,275
Get the design right in your head
before you actually start.

403
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:20,515
That actually was quite useful.
Yeah.

404
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:22,275
OK as ever, it's judged blind,

405
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:25,075
so I'm going to have to ask you two
to leave the tent.

406
00:20:25,075 --> 00:20:27,915
Off you pop. They're going to play
with Prue's train set.

407
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:30,595
Yeah, or Paul's doll's house.
Quite a choice, really.

408
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:32,435
Right, for your technical challenge,

409
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:35,075
Paul would like you to make
six Icelandic laufabraud.

410
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:37,315
Laufa... I love laufa...
What is laufabraud?

411
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:40,755
These are fried flat breads
and they are a traditional family

412
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:42,835
bake for Icelanders at Christmas.

413
00:20:42,835 --> 00:20:47,635
So your laufabraud needs
to be wafer thin, perfectly crisp

414
00:20:47,635 --> 00:20:50,355
and decorated with
delicate triangular cuts.

415
00:20:50,355 --> 00:20:52,235
I imagine it has to be uniform
in size,

416
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:54,475
otherwise the Grinch will go insane.

417
00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:57,435
Your ingredients
are under your gingham cloths.

418
00:20:57,435 --> 00:21:01,395
Tartan. And your instructions are in
your pants. Drawers. Same thing.

419
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:06,355
You have an hour and 15.
On your marks. Get set. Bake.

420
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:12,955
There's literally nothing here!
Oooh.

421
00:21:14,155 --> 00:21:16,875
What on Earth?
I don't really know what I'm making.

422
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,115
So these are called,
like, laufabraud?

423
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:21,595
I've never heard of these.

424
00:21:21,595 --> 00:21:25,355
A flat bread, innit?
Fried bread, like a doughnut.

425
00:21:28,435 --> 00:21:31,395
Paul, I have never seen
anything like these. What are they?

426
00:21:31,395 --> 00:21:33,515
Basically, think of it a bit
like a poppadom.

427
00:21:33,515 --> 00:21:35,435
First of all, they've got to create
the dough

428
00:21:35,435 --> 00:21:36,995
and then they have to roll them out.

429
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:41,155
Think filo, OK? So that's...
Very thin.

430
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:44,955
Very, very thin. And then the
tricky bit is to do the design.

431
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:46,235
They'll be given rollers,

432
00:21:46,235 --> 00:21:48,955
and these rollers have little
cutters on them, so you can cut.

433
00:21:48,955 --> 00:21:50,515
But that's only half of it.

434
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:54,035
You can then move them apart
to create this intricate design

435
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:57,595
and then they've got to fry it
and that literally takes minutes.

436
00:21:57,595 --> 00:22:01,435
Each one of them must be identical.
How many are they making? Six.

437
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:03,715
I mean, they are lovely
and they look so nice hanging.

438
00:22:03,715 --> 00:22:05,915
You really want them
to be used as decorations

439
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:09,275
as well as to eat, don't you?
Try some. Can't wait.

440
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:12,315
Oh, it cracks beautifully.
That's what we are looking for.

441
00:22:12,315 --> 00:22:15,755
Oh, and it's a little bit salty.
Delicious.

442
00:22:15,755 --> 00:22:19,115
And I think at Christmas time,
Boxing Day, certainly,

443
00:22:19,115 --> 00:22:21,955
if you're making
a turkey curry, perfect. Perfect.

444
00:22:21,955 --> 00:22:24,755
I just can't picture
what they look like.

445
00:22:24,755 --> 00:22:27,515
Even trying to decipher
the instructions.

446
00:22:27,515 --> 00:22:30,395
I've read ahead
to the decorating bit and...

447
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:31,835
It's a bit of an enigma, really.

448
00:22:31,835 --> 00:22:35,755
The first task is to make a dough,
combining conventional ingredients.

449
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,595
So "rub the butter into the dry
ingredients

450
00:22:37,595 --> 00:22:39,155
"until it resembles breadcrumbs."

451
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:43,235
So that's a bit like rubbing in
for a pastry, I would have thought.

452
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:45,955
But that is where
the familiarity ends.

453
00:22:45,955 --> 00:22:49,395
So have you heard of these breads?
No. Never? Never.

454
00:22:49,395 --> 00:22:51,635
I'm just going to read
this and see how it goes. OK.

455
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:53,675
I like your confidence, Flo.
It's good.

456
00:22:53,675 --> 00:22:56,675
Do you think I've got confidence?
Yes! Do you? Yes.

457
00:22:56,675 --> 00:23:00,155
Why, do you think...
Do you think you haven't got any?

458
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:02,155
I'm bluffing it!
THEY LAUGH

459
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:04,355
"Warm the milk and pour
over the flour and mix

460
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:06,275
"with your hands until
you have a warm dough."

461
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:08,795
I think you need to knead
until it's pliable, because if I try

462
00:23:08,795 --> 00:23:11,435
and roll that outcome at the minute,
it's going to be terrible.

463
00:23:11,435 --> 00:23:14,315
So I think I'm just going to keep
kneading until it's bread-y.

464
00:23:14,315 --> 00:23:17,395
Andrew's like stretching it like
that. So I'm just massaging it.

465
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:21,275
Like, plain flour, it's not
strong bread flour, so...

466
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:24,355
You might not want to overwork it.

467
00:23:24,355 --> 00:23:26,195
I don't know!

468
00:23:26,195 --> 00:23:32,275
"Knead the dough until smooth
and weigh out six 35g of balls."

469
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:42,075
35, boom! "Roll out each piece
of dough out very thinly."

470
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:43,635
"To 20 centimetres in a circle."

471
00:23:43,635 --> 00:23:46,675
It's going to take most of the pan.

472
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:50,315
20 centimetre circle?
20 centimetres?

473
00:23:50,315 --> 00:23:54,355
They've got to be 20 across and
they've got to be that thin.

474
00:23:54,355 --> 00:23:58,075
That's got to be transparent.

475
00:23:58,075 --> 00:24:01,075
Wow, they're thin and small? I know.

476
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:03,195
There's not much dough to get
out to 20 centimetres.

477
00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:06,675
OK, that's like 19.5.

478
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:08,195
I can get away with that.

479
00:24:08,195 --> 00:24:13,035
It's the most bizarre challenge
ever. It's thinner than paper.

480
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,675
I've never cut anything so thin.

481
00:24:14,675 --> 00:24:16,835
Oh, see, I can almost see
through it, to be fair.

482
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:19,675
I can pretty much see through it.
Hey, Sandi, I've just done this.

483
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:22,355
Wow. I'll... I'll get the medic.

484
00:24:22,355 --> 00:24:25,515
Bakers, you are halfway through.

485
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:27,995
Flipping heck!
Using the cutting tool...

486
00:24:27,995 --> 00:24:32,115
I'm assuming this makes
sort of triangular cuts on it.

487
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:34,435
Create a snowflake pattern.

488
00:24:34,435 --> 00:24:37,195
I'm trying to work out
what to do with these Vs.

489
00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:39,915
Cos the mind goes blank
on what a snowflake looks like.

490
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:42,475
Snowflake, six points, so go...

491
00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:45,875
Divide the 360 six ways.

492
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,875
Six... One, two...

493
00:24:57,155 --> 00:24:59,475
I don't know how to do a snowflake.

494
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:02,475
It's a fiddly little old thing.

495
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:08,275
Oh you've got some kind of V
machine. Yeah.

496
00:25:08,275 --> 00:25:11,515
Oh, that's V clever. I like that.

497
00:25:15,795 --> 00:25:19,675
Flo, what on Earth are you doing?
I don't know. I don't know!

498
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:22,955
I'm messing around.
You're just making patterns?

499
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:26,195
God help me, I don't know!
Is it a snowflake?

500
00:25:26,195 --> 00:25:28,075
It's supposed to be.

501
00:25:28,075 --> 00:25:31,915
All right, well, it seems
to be going really well here.

502
00:25:33,835 --> 00:25:35,675
So just press on, yeah?

503
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:37,915
"Using a knife, lift the tip
of every other V..."

504
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:39,915
"Fold each tip..."

505
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:42,515
"Back to cross over
the V behind it."

506
00:25:42,515 --> 00:25:45,675
I don't understand it.
I think it does that.

507
00:25:45,675 --> 00:25:48,995
You leave that one behind
and bring that one over.

508
00:25:48,995 --> 00:25:51,835
That looks good. That's going
to take ages, isn't it?

509
00:25:51,835 --> 00:25:55,235
I think it's going to take ages,
but I think that's what it says.

510
00:25:55,235 --> 00:25:58,955
Is that what it says?
I don't get the V part. Hang on.

511
00:25:58,955 --> 00:26:03,155
"Using a knife..."
"Lift the tip of every other V."

512
00:26:03,155 --> 00:26:04,915
I don't...

513
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:08,995
Oh, "lift the tip"!

514
00:26:08,995 --> 00:26:11,515
Oh, gosh, OK, it's so obvious now.

515
00:26:11,515 --> 00:26:15,475
OK, so the tip of that one
over the V behind it.

516
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:17,795
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

517
00:26:17,795 --> 00:26:20,555
Oh, it fell to bits!

518
00:26:20,555 --> 00:26:23,115
This is going to be a nightmare
to get into the fryer.

519
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:26,075
Traditionally, laufabraud
are deep-fried.

520
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:28,995
I am going to fry in,
hopefully, a minute,

521
00:26:28,995 --> 00:26:32,115
and I want it to fry at 200.

522
00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:35,435
But this process has
a fine margin for error.

523
00:26:35,435 --> 00:26:36,995
So that's heating up.

524
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,675
Too cool, and the bread
won't become crisp.

525
00:26:39,675 --> 00:26:41,595
I'm just getting it up to 200.

526
00:26:41,595 --> 00:26:43,955
Too hot, and it will burn.

527
00:26:43,955 --> 00:26:46,435
Fry one at a time until crisp.

528
00:26:46,435 --> 00:26:48,675
And despite being fried
individually,

529
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:51,075
the batch should be uniform
in colour.

530
00:26:51,075 --> 00:26:53,155
The temperature's nearly there.

531
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:57,395
I've got to do six. Six.
I've got 24 minutes. 24 minutes.

532
00:26:57,395 --> 00:27:00,955
How long do they...? Wait, we've got
24 minutes left? Yeah. Oh!

533
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:04,435
I'm not sure he's qualified
to do a time call. Oh, aren't I?

534
00:27:04,435 --> 00:27:06,435
I think that's my jurisdiction.
Sorry.

535
00:27:06,435 --> 00:27:09,275
You have 25 minutes left.

536
00:27:09,275 --> 00:27:11,355
There isn't enough time.

537
00:27:11,355 --> 00:27:15,115
Have you started frying, Andrew?
Going into the fryer with one.

538
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:17,755
I don't know whether
I'm doing right or wrong.

539
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:20,875
My oil is not getting any hotter.
Jane, is your oil hot enough?

540
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:25,395
No, my oil's not hot enough.
Is yours hot enough?

541
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:28,995
Come on, oil, come on.
I think that's crisp.

542
00:27:32,155 --> 00:27:35,275
They go quite dark quite quickly.
160.

543
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:40,435
Jane, what's your one on?
It's over 200.

544
00:27:40,435 --> 00:27:42,995
Maybe it's Centigrade.
Maybe I'm reading the Fahrenheit.

545
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:49,515
Oh, 200, there! BLEEP Oh, God.

546
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:53,635
I was taking it up to 200 Fahrenheit
rather than 200 Centigrade.

547
00:27:53,635 --> 00:27:56,675
I'm just going to have to go in,
soon, like, I don't have no choice.

548
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:01,155
Oh, God!
That one's too well done, I think.

549
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:03,195
I don't do any deep frying at home.

550
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:06,595
Whether it's meant to look
like that, I don't really know.

551
00:28:06,595 --> 00:28:10,355
This is awful. Right, bakers.
Important announcement.

552
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,515
You have five minutes remaining.

553
00:28:12,515 --> 00:28:16,115
OK, I'm going to have to.
Five minutes.

554
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:22,955
I'm going in. Under baked is better
than not baked, isn't it?

555
00:28:22,955 --> 00:28:24,835
Cook, little breads, cook!

556
00:28:24,835 --> 00:28:28,195
Man, these are horrid to work with.
Oh!

557
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:32,915
They are not going to be cooked.

558
00:28:32,915 --> 00:28:35,595
Oh, are they supposed
to look like that?

559
00:28:35,595 --> 00:28:39,515
They are brown and mine
are all sort of white and wimpy.

560
00:28:39,515 --> 00:28:43,875
That's my first one.
Um, it is what it is.

561
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:47,595
Carefully hang them
from your Christmas tree.

562
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:50,515
They are going to break the branch
if I hang them on that.

563
00:28:50,515 --> 00:28:52,475
I just want to get all six in there.

564
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:56,915
One minute left, bakers. One minute.

565
00:28:56,915 --> 00:29:00,155
They're going to be not crispy,
aren't they?

566
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:03,475
Oh, sugar.

567
00:29:07,035 --> 00:29:09,235
Right, my lovely bakers, that's it.

568
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:11,475
Please bring your laufabrauds up

569
00:29:11,475 --> 00:29:14,115
and place them
behind your photograph.

570
00:29:14,115 --> 00:29:18,835
But, you know, really slowly.
This century, if you can.

571
00:29:18,835 --> 00:29:22,995
Oh! Oh, Jane.

572
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,955
Uh-oh.

573
00:29:28,555 --> 00:29:33,355
Paul and Prue are looking for
six evenly-baked golden laufabraud.

574
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,875
And they won't know
whose bake is whose.

575
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,715
We wanted six.

576
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:42,355
There's six on this one.
Five and a bust one.

577
00:29:42,355 --> 00:29:45,155
Let's start with these.
How many have we got there? Four.

578
00:29:45,155 --> 00:29:47,595
They're pretty consistent
on the colour, though.

579
00:29:47,595 --> 00:29:50,075
But they are very bubbly, aren't
they?

580
00:29:50,075 --> 00:29:54,395
They're meant to have tiny little
bubbles, not great big balloons.

581
00:29:54,395 --> 00:29:57,875
Actually, that's lovely and crisp.
Hm.

582
00:29:59,635 --> 00:30:02,315
Very good. It's not greasy.
That's a good flavour.

583
00:30:02,315 --> 00:30:05,515
It's good. OK. What about this one?

584
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:08,195
I quite like these.
They're much more even.

585
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:09,435
The bubbles are smaller.

586
00:30:09,435 --> 00:30:12,355
They could have done with being
in there a little bit longer.

587
00:30:12,355 --> 00:30:14,315
They look a little bit too pale.

588
00:30:14,315 --> 00:30:16,875
But it's got a lovely pattern
on it, all the way across.

589
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,235
They're beautifully done, those.
They are.

590
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,235
They're quite even, all of them.

591
00:30:21,235 --> 00:30:25,035
And, and the business of getting
the little triangles down

592
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:26,635
is beautifully done.

593
00:30:26,635 --> 00:30:28,795
But they are very neat
and round and they taste good.

594
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:32,115
They're good. And they do...crack.

595
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:34,235
Now, moving on, we have...
One, two, three...

596
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:37,115
We've got five on this one.
A bit irregular in colour, look.

597
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:40,675
You see the difference
in the colour and it's too thick.

598
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:42,355
This is very undercooked.

599
00:30:42,355 --> 00:30:45,795
It's actually quite elastic
and it tastes of flour.

600
00:30:45,795 --> 00:30:50,835
OK, now we have six here.
Quite dark.

601
00:30:50,835 --> 00:30:53,755
I mean, fairly elaborate
in their decoration as well.

602
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:57,795
They've been over fried.
This one's very dark.

603
00:30:57,795 --> 00:31:00,195
They're a bit irregular,
aren't they?

604
00:31:00,195 --> 00:31:04,195
That's actually burnt. Yeah, it is.

605
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:09,795
Paul and Prue must now decide
whose Icelandic laufabraud are best.

606
00:31:09,795 --> 00:31:14,875
OK, so in fourth place,
we have this one. Who was that?

607
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,155
Nobody going to confess?

608
00:31:17,155 --> 00:31:20,755
Oh, Flo. You know what's wrong
with it. It's not... Yeah, I know.

609
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:24,515
..baked properly.
And, um, the decoration isn't great.

610
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:27,395
You didn't turn
any of the little Vs back.

611
00:31:27,395 --> 00:31:30,235
In third spot is this one.
Whose is this?

612
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:32,115
Liam, where are the rest of them?

613
00:31:32,115 --> 00:31:35,155
I rolled them out
and that, but, like...

614
00:31:35,155 --> 00:31:37,795
You didn't get a chance
to put them in the fryer?

615
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,315
Right, in second place,
who was this?

616
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:44,315
Andrew, well, in spite of being
rather overdone,

617
00:31:44,315 --> 00:31:47,275
there is a good attempt at
the decoration and they taste great.

618
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:50,555
Thank you. Which leaves...
Number one. Jane.

619
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:54,555
APPLAUSE
These were pretty perfect.

620
00:31:54,555 --> 00:31:57,155
You could have left them
in there another five seconds,

621
00:31:57,155 --> 00:31:59,035
just to put a little more
flash of colour.

622
00:31:59,035 --> 00:32:02,355
But you had a beautiful design,
nice and even, all equal.

623
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:04,315
Yes, one dropped, but you did manage

624
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:07,715
to get the six as well,
so well done. Thank you.

625
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:10,035
Who would have thought that?

626
00:32:10,035 --> 00:32:13,315
I've got to say,
it's been a pretty good day.

627
00:32:13,315 --> 00:32:15,435
I'm really pleased with that,
actually.

628
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:18,115
Considering how much of a mad dash
that was at the end, and the fact

629
00:32:18,115 --> 00:32:20,115
that, let's be honest,
some of them were burnt.

630
00:32:20,115 --> 00:32:22,155
Never seen one before in my life
and...

631
00:32:22,155 --> 00:32:25,315
I hope I don't ever see one again.

632
00:32:25,315 --> 00:32:27,155
I just hope tomorrow's good.

633
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:28,675
Even if I don't, like,
win or anything,

634
00:32:28,675 --> 00:32:30,915
it would be nice to end on a bang.

635
00:32:38,635 --> 00:32:41,635
before Paul and Pru will decide
who will be crowned winner

636
00:32:41,635 --> 00:32:43,875
of the Great Christmas Bake Off.

637
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:55,315
Morning, bakers. You'll be delighted
to know it's time for your
Showstopper Challenge.

638
00:32:55,315 --> 00:32:58,475
Today, Paul and Pru would
like you to make a spectacular

639
00:32:58,475 --> 00:33:01,555
hidden-design Christmas present
cake,

640
00:33:01,555 --> 00:33:03,515
decorated to look like
a Christmas present.

641
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:08,475
But once cut, it reveals - inside
the sponge - a design or picture.

642
00:33:08,475 --> 00:33:11,795
Your hidden designs can be shaped
in the tin before baking,

643
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:15,355
or the sponges can be baked
separately and carved

644
00:33:15,355 --> 00:33:18,275
and assembled after baking.
It's up to you.

645
00:33:18,275 --> 00:33:19,995
But you've got four hours to do it.

646
00:33:19,995 --> 00:33:21,315
On your marks... Get set... Bake!

647
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,195
Here we go again.

648
00:33:26,195 --> 00:33:27,275
SHE LAUGHS

649
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:28,995
It's going to be tight today.

650
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:30,995
It's going to be tight,
but I'm ready. I am ready.

651
00:33:30,995 --> 00:33:32,755
It's Christmas. I want to do well.

652
00:33:32,755 --> 00:33:37,155
I want to end my time in the tent
with a wicked Showstopper.

653
00:33:37,155 --> 00:33:40,475
So many things to do
at the beginning.

654
00:33:40,475 --> 00:33:44,035
It's sort of keeping all your balls
in the air, juggling your balls.

655
00:33:45,595 --> 00:33:48,675
Hidden design cakes are never easy.

656
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:52,235
What you want is a cake that looks
like a Christmas present.

657
00:33:52,235 --> 00:33:57,075
And inside is a design which you'll
see when you cut it open.

658
00:33:57,075 --> 00:33:59,715
The ideal sponge for a challenge
like this is Madeira.

659
00:33:59,715 --> 00:34:04,795
It's a robust sponge and allows
lots of flavour and colour to be run
through it.

660
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:07,035
Black cake. How delicious. Yum yum!

661
00:34:07,035 --> 00:34:10,715
As always, we want exquisite
decoration and to be absolutely

662
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:14,035
wowed by the Christmas flavours.

663
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:16,075
The bakers will have had to have
practised this,

664
00:34:16,075 --> 00:34:19,075
because the thing is, they're not
going to know what their design

665
00:34:19,075 --> 00:34:22,355
looks like until we actually
cut into it ourselves.

666
00:34:23,715 --> 00:34:25,995
It's nice and bright.
That's what I want.

667
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:29,115
This bake is all about
the magical final reveal,

668
00:34:29,115 --> 00:34:31,875
so the first task is to create
the sponge that will sit

669
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:34,315
inside the finished cake.

670
00:34:34,315 --> 00:34:35,595
So, this is going to be the pattern,

671
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:37,835
so I'm going to cut out stars
and gingerbread men.

672
00:34:37,835 --> 00:34:39,235
Time really is of the essence.

673
00:34:39,235 --> 00:34:41,435
I've got to get my first
coloured cake done.

674
00:34:41,435 --> 00:34:43,875
I'm going to cut that out, I'm going
to place that in the other tin,

675
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,475
and then bake the other
batter around it.

676
00:34:45,475 --> 00:34:48,675
A successful hidden-design cake
relies on the consistency

677
00:34:48,675 --> 00:34:50,195
of the sponge.

678
00:34:50,195 --> 00:34:51,395
It is a moist cake.

679
00:34:51,395 --> 00:34:55,715
A close texture is necessary
to maintain shape, once sculpted.

680
00:34:55,715 --> 00:34:57,715
I'd like them a little bit firm,

681
00:34:57,715 --> 00:35:00,355
just because I'm carving it,
and it really will fall apart.

682
00:35:00,355 --> 00:35:02,835
So, I'm cooking that for
about 20 minutes.

683
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:06,675
With the sponge for the hidden
designs baking, it's on to the main
mix.

684
00:35:06,675 --> 00:35:09,235
I'm just making my second
cake, which is going

685
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:11,155
to encase the coloured bit.

686
00:35:11,155 --> 00:35:14,355
Ah! I'm mucky worker, me.

687
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:15,795
Morning, Flo. How are you?

688
00:35:15,795 --> 00:35:17,235
I'm fine, thank you.

689
00:35:17,235 --> 00:35:19,235
Tell us about your present cake.

690
00:35:19,235 --> 00:35:22,555
I've got a green sponge in the oven.

691
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:24,555
That's called Christmas trees house.

692
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:27,195
And there's a bottle of mulled
wine going in the cake.

693
00:35:27,195 --> 00:35:29,395
A whole bottle of mulled wine?

694
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:31,955
Yeah, yeah. In the cake?
In the cake.

695
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:35,355
That bottle is going in the cake?
Yeah. Mmm.

696
00:35:35,355 --> 00:35:36,795
Yeah. Right.

697
00:35:36,795 --> 00:35:40,235
So, the basic flavour
of the cake is what?

698
00:35:40,235 --> 00:35:42,435
Mulled wine. Well, yeah.
I think it probably will be.

699
00:35:42,435 --> 00:35:46,075
I think so. It might be, yeah.
I like mulled wine.

700
00:35:46,075 --> 00:35:48,555
I haven't got a problem with this.
Have you practised this? Yeah.

701
00:35:48,555 --> 00:35:49,795
And you put a whole bottle in? Yeah.

702
00:35:49,795 --> 00:35:51,875
And you tried the cake
and you went, "That's delicious."

703
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:53,475
It's really a lovely cake.

704
00:35:53,475 --> 00:35:56,955
Flo's tried-and-tested recipe is not
for the faint-hearted.

705
00:35:56,955 --> 00:36:00,475
Her red wine sponge will be coated
in buttercream, inspired

706
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:04,475
by the perfect end to Christmas
dinner - the cheese board.

707
00:36:04,475 --> 00:36:06,835
It's cream cheese. Cream cheese?
Stilton.

708
00:36:06,835 --> 00:36:08,795
I thought you were going to...
What? Roquefort.

709
00:36:08,795 --> 00:36:10,955
With Roquefort, too? Yeah.
Roquefort and Stilton?

710
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:12,595
I want it really strong.

711
00:36:12,595 --> 00:36:15,035
Well, it goes, doesn't it?
Cheese and wine.

712
00:36:15,035 --> 00:36:16,955
Yeah, that's genius.
It does go really well. In a cake?

713
00:36:16,955 --> 00:36:20,075
I'm not sure it's genius.
I've never seen anything like it.
I think it could be genius.

714
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:21,115
It could be madness.

715
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:22,395
SHE LAUGHS

716
00:36:22,395 --> 00:36:24,955
I'm in. I'm not too sure which way
you're going on this,

717
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:26,555
but I'm really looking
forward to it -

718
00:36:26,555 --> 00:36:29,315
more than I have any other cake I
think I've ever heard of, in a
sense.

719
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:31,395
Don't be worried. It's lovely.

720
00:36:31,395 --> 00:36:33,395
Good luck, Flo. OK.

721
00:36:35,355 --> 00:36:36,235
Wow.

722
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,955
While Flo delves into
the drinks cabinet...

723
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:40,155
Nice boozy cake.

724
00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:42,155
SHE LAUGHS

725
00:36:42,155 --> 00:36:43,235
Bring it on.

726
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:46,075
..Jane and Andrew have had the
pick of the fruit bowl.

727
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:49,955
I'm so done with zesting oranges.

728
00:36:49,955 --> 00:36:52,435
And Liam has raided the cookie jar.

729
00:36:52,435 --> 00:36:54,875
Flavours like chocolate
and speculaas.

730
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:58,195
Speculaas?
Speculaas is like a biscuit spread.

731
00:36:58,195 --> 00:36:59,675
You know those little
biscuits you get...

732
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:03,875
Well, you get them in hairdressers,
but you probably don't go to
hairdressers.

733
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:05,235
I've got a team who come to me.

734
00:37:05,235 --> 00:37:09,475
And then in the cake, you've got
stars and gingerbread men
alternating.

735
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:11,595
So, are you confident about this?
Yeah, pretty much.

736
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:14,395
I mean, it's practice, isn't it?
So, I've practised it a couple of
times,

737
00:37:14,395 --> 00:37:15,955
so I've got, like, a clear
vision in my head.

738
00:37:15,955 --> 00:37:17,955
You should be a magician.

739
00:37:17,955 --> 00:37:20,315
I kind of am.
SHE LAUGHS

740
00:37:20,315 --> 00:37:21,875
A baking magician!

741
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:24,795
For his first trick, Liam
will be creating his hidden design

742
00:37:24,795 --> 00:37:29,595
by double-baking chocolate images
inside a speculaas sponge.

743
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:32,755
His second trick will involve
a sleight of hand with flavours.

744
00:37:32,755 --> 00:37:36,915
So you've got chocolate flavoured
gingerbread men with no ginger?

745
00:37:36,915 --> 00:37:42,595
Yeah. Well, you know what, I
remember your Showstopper pancakes.

746
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:46,155
And they were the best flavoured
thing I think I've eaten on Bake
Off.

747
00:37:46,155 --> 00:37:48,475
Amazing. They were just amazing.
They were very good.

748
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,475
So, if you don't do good
flavour, I shall

749
00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:52,675
be really, really disappointed.

750
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:57,595
Cooking and cooling their first
sponge as quickly as possible

751
00:37:57,595 --> 00:37:59,315
is imperative...

752
00:37:59,315 --> 00:38:02,595
Yeah, that's looking good.
Bring that out.

753
00:38:02,595 --> 00:38:06,795
..if the bakers are to have enough
time to build convincing hidden
designs.

754
00:38:06,795 --> 00:38:08,515
I'm going to put that
in the freezer in a sec,

755
00:38:08,515 --> 00:38:09,875
so it will be easier to carve up.

756
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:11,595
I'm going to put these
in the fridge to chill.

757
00:38:11,595 --> 00:38:12,875
I really need them chilled.

758
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,315
Cut corners at this stage,
and it will jeopardise

759
00:38:15,315 --> 00:38:16,715
the end result.

760
00:38:16,715 --> 00:38:19,915
But they'll only discover
that when the cake is cut in front

761
00:38:19,915 --> 00:38:21,275
of the judges.

762
00:38:21,275 --> 00:38:23,755
Ideally, you'd wait
for this to cool before cutting it.

763
00:38:23,755 --> 00:38:25,835
But there ain't much time.

764
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,115
Noel, Noel. What?

765
00:38:28,115 --> 00:38:32,195
This bird wants to speak to you.
Oh, yeah? Really? Mmm.

766
00:38:32,195 --> 00:38:34,515
Bakers, you have three hours left.

767
00:38:34,515 --> 00:38:36,035
HE WHISPERS: Release it into the
wind.

768
00:38:36,035 --> 00:38:37,555
Fly, my pretty.

769
00:38:37,555 --> 00:38:39,315
SMASHING

770
00:38:39,315 --> 00:38:41,235
That didn't go well.

771
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,595
HE WHISPERS: It's not a real bird.

772
00:38:42,595 --> 00:38:45,555
When you cut into the cake,
it's going to have two baubles

773
00:38:45,555 --> 00:38:46,875
hanging inside the cake,

774
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:49,035
because every Christmas, me
and my brother would get given

775
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,915
a Christmas decoration,
and we have since we were

776
00:38:50,915 --> 00:38:52,835
very young, the idea
being that when we were older,

777
00:38:52,835 --> 00:38:55,035
we would have a full set
of Christmas tree decorations.

778
00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:57,115
Hoping that his baubles
look good enough to hang

779
00:38:57,115 --> 00:39:00,235
on the tree, Andrew's
suspending his orange-flavoured

780
00:39:00,235 --> 00:39:04,995
decorations inside an orange
and hazelnut Madeira sponge.

781
00:39:04,995 --> 00:39:06,595
It's all about precision.

782
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:09,155
Generally, you're quite
good at that sort of stuff.

783
00:39:09,155 --> 00:39:10,875
Yeah, yeah.

784
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:13,515
Don't jinx me, Paul.

785
00:39:13,515 --> 00:39:14,795
All right, Andrew. Good luck.

786
00:39:14,795 --> 00:39:16,955
Thank you very much. Cheers.

787
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:19,955
Andrew, Flo and Liam,
having baked their first sponges,

788
00:39:19,955 --> 00:39:22,595
are carving to shape,
and will be placing them

789
00:39:22,595 --> 00:39:26,955
inside a second batter -
a technique known as double baking.

790
00:39:26,955 --> 00:39:30,195
I've got the hokey cokey,
going in and out of the oven.

791
00:39:30,195 --> 00:39:34,075
The aim is to create
a seamless internal design,

792
00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:36,675
but it also provides twice
the opportunity for something

793
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:38,235
to go wrong.

794
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:40,315
There is a risk of this
sponge over-baking.

795
00:39:40,315 --> 00:39:41,955
It goes in the middle,
so it should be the last bit

796
00:39:41,955 --> 00:39:44,475
of the cake to cook, in theory.

797
00:39:44,475 --> 00:39:46,755
Jane's adopting
a different approach.

798
00:39:46,755 --> 00:39:50,955
She'll be creating her hidden
designs by assembling pre-baked
sponges.

799
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:54,555
I'm sure you'll be here
when I assemble it,

800
00:39:54,555 --> 00:39:59,075
because it's a bit touch-and-go,
but hopefully, it'll hold together.

801
00:39:59,075 --> 00:40:03,435
Jane's hidden design is inspired
by her daughter's love of penguins.

802
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:06,675
Flanked by Christmas trees,
the flightless birds will be made

803
00:40:06,675 --> 00:40:08,675
from orange-flavoured sponges.

804
00:40:08,675 --> 00:40:10,475
Well, this looks very colourful.

805
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:13,515
So, these, believe it or not, are
going to be my penguins. Lovely.

806
00:40:13,515 --> 00:40:15,715
I'm not double-baking,
because I find it really hard

807
00:40:15,715 --> 00:40:17,835
to keep my penguins in a line once
I double bake.

808
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:19,635
They kind of move.

809
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:20,795
THEY LAUGH

810
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:22,115
What a weird conversation!

811
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:24,595
So when we cut it, we're going
to have a penguin and a tree?

812
00:40:24,595 --> 00:40:27,035
You're going to have
tree, penguin, tree. OK.

813
00:40:27,035 --> 00:40:29,315
Penguin lost in a forest?

814
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:33,395
In a non-existent forest
in the Antarctic, yeah.

815
00:40:33,395 --> 00:40:37,955
Bakers, you are halfway
through your Showstopper Challenge.

816
00:40:37,955 --> 00:40:40,555
SANDI: I'm sorry, I can't stop
moving, Noel.

817
00:40:40,555 --> 00:40:42,755
You're just really heavy on my
shoulders.

818
00:40:42,755 --> 00:40:43,795
LAUGHTER

819
00:40:43,795 --> 00:40:46,915
For Andrew, Liam and Flo,
it's assembly time.

820
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:50,195
Just a tiny layer on the bottom,
just to act as a glue layer.

821
00:40:50,195 --> 00:40:52,235
It's exciting times,
I'm not going to lie.

822
00:40:52,235 --> 00:40:54,675
But it's only exciting if it goes
well - do you know what I mean?

823
00:40:54,675 --> 00:40:57,515
Any mistakes at this stage
could spell disaster

824
00:40:57,515 --> 00:41:00,115
for their hidden designs.

825
00:41:00,115 --> 00:41:01,595
I hope this works,
I hope this works.

826
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:04,915
So, Paul seemed to think
I was precise, which would help.

827
00:41:04,915 --> 00:41:06,195
I hope he's right.

828
00:41:08,515 --> 00:41:11,755
So, I'm going to cover
it with the speculaas sponge,

829
00:41:11,755 --> 00:41:13,155
and put it in to bake
for, like, an hour.

830
00:41:13,155 --> 00:41:15,475
I'm just putting the mulled
wine cake mixture over

831
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:19,115
the Christmas trees.
It looks a good mix, doesn't it?

832
00:41:19,115 --> 00:41:20,955
So, have people been asking
you to bake things

833
00:41:20,955 --> 00:41:22,475
since you were on Bake Off?

834
00:41:22,475 --> 00:41:24,195
I've been asked to judge cakes.

835
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:27,155
Have you? Yeah. Are you a tough
judge, or are you like...? No.

836
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:30,675
I just say they're all nice,
but some of them...

837
00:41:30,675 --> 00:41:33,315
Terrible? Yeah.
SHE LAUGHS

838
00:41:33,315 --> 00:41:35,235
Well, if Paul retires,
I'll give you a call.

839
00:41:35,235 --> 00:41:36,315
In it goes.

840
00:41:36,315 --> 00:41:39,515
As their sponges go
back in the oven... Right.

841
00:41:39,515 --> 00:41:44,035
..the double-bakers now relinquish
control of their hidden designs.

842
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:47,515
I really don't want the
Christmas trees to move.

843
00:41:47,515 --> 00:41:51,555
They are difficult things to cook,
because you've got the cooked cake,

844
00:41:51,555 --> 00:41:54,235
and the cake above that struggles to
get up to the same temperature,

845
00:41:54,235 --> 00:41:56,115
because the heat's got
to go all the way round.

846
00:41:56,115 --> 00:41:58,595
So, it's not ideal.

847
00:41:58,595 --> 00:42:00,035
There we go.

848
00:42:00,035 --> 00:42:03,315
But for Jane, the baking is over.

849
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:05,955
So I'm going to give them five
minutes,

850
00:42:05,955 --> 00:42:09,235
and then I'm going to whack
them in the freezer,

851
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,115
because it's all about
getting into chilled.

852
00:42:11,115 --> 00:42:13,315
The main element of the cake
is baking, and now I'm focused

853
00:42:13,315 --> 00:42:14,395
on the buttercream.

854
00:42:14,395 --> 00:42:17,955
This is speculaas spread. It's like
peanut butter, but biscuit butter.

855
00:42:17,955 --> 00:42:20,035
Whatever their choice
of crumb coat...

856
00:42:20,035 --> 00:42:22,755
So, at the moment, I am
making a ganache.

857
00:42:22,755 --> 00:42:26,515
..the aim is to create a smooth
surface on which to apply fondant...

858
00:42:26,515 --> 00:42:30,035
This is Stilton and Roquefort.
It's a cream that's going

859
00:42:30,035 --> 00:42:32,035
in between the cake
and all around the cake.

860
00:42:32,035 --> 00:42:34,475
..and add an extra layer of flavour.

861
00:42:34,475 --> 00:42:35,675
It smells to high heaven.

862
00:42:35,675 --> 00:42:38,595
Is that the blue cheese? Yeah.
Can I taste it?

863
00:42:38,595 --> 00:42:41,075
Yeah, of course you can taste it.

864
00:42:42,035 --> 00:42:44,875
You'll judder. It'll judder you.

865
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:48,155
That's strong. It's nice, though.

866
00:42:48,155 --> 00:42:51,035
This is a wee bit soft,
but I'm going to use it anyway,

867
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,555
because I really want
to get this assembled.

868
00:42:53,555 --> 00:42:55,635
I know Jane is going
to do an epic job today.

869
00:42:55,635 --> 00:42:57,875
It's my job to keep up.
You can do it, Andrew.

870
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,515
For the double-bakers,
if their sponges are to be ready

871
00:43:01,515 --> 00:43:03,515
to decorate, cooling is key.

872
00:43:03,515 --> 00:43:05,435
So time is of the essence.

873
00:43:08,955 --> 00:43:10,115
Yeah.

874
00:43:11,955 --> 00:43:15,155
You need more time. I'm going to
give it another ten minutes.

875
00:43:15,155 --> 00:43:17,555
Ooh! Look at them babies.

876
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:20,795
There you go. You're coming out.

877
00:43:20,795 --> 00:43:24,195
The moment of truth.
Can I carve through it?

878
00:43:24,195 --> 00:43:27,835
This is where it could
all go horribly wrong.

879
00:43:27,835 --> 00:43:31,035
Jane's technique relies
on a steady hand.

880
00:43:31,035 --> 00:43:33,875
Any damage to the sponge
is irreparable,

881
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:36,115
and there's no time to start again.

882
00:43:36,115 --> 00:43:39,835
Well, there are several
nerve-racking bits to go.

883
00:43:39,835 --> 00:43:43,675
This is probably on a par with most
of the other bits still to go.

884
00:43:43,675 --> 00:43:45,035
SHE LAUGHS

885
00:43:45,035 --> 00:43:46,515
It's not good for my nerves!

886
00:43:47,955 --> 00:43:50,315
Oh, Jane. That looks amazing.
We shall see.

887
00:43:50,315 --> 00:43:53,475
Well, at least you'll have a design.
Mine is still baking.

888
00:43:53,475 --> 00:43:55,595
Did you get anything
for Christmas you didn't like?

889
00:43:55,595 --> 00:43:57,315
No, I liked all my presents.

890
00:43:57,315 --> 00:44:00,595
I particularly loved my
necklace from Pru. Yeah, me, too.

891
00:44:00,595 --> 00:44:02,555
Bakers, you have one hour.

892
00:44:04,235 --> 00:44:05,355
It's so close.

893
00:44:06,675 --> 00:44:11,315
It's still warm,
but it's buttercream. I can pipe it.

894
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,235
There you go. OK.

895
00:44:15,915 --> 00:44:16,915
It's warm.

896
00:44:18,315 --> 00:44:20,555
But I've got to move.

897
00:44:20,555 --> 00:44:23,035
Right, the cake is coming out.
It's got to be cooked.

898
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,515
It's got to be.

899
00:44:24,515 --> 00:44:26,555
If it's not, I'll deal
with the consequences.

900
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:27,835
I need to get it finished.

901
00:44:32,035 --> 00:44:35,675
These are going to go
into the fridge.

902
00:44:35,675 --> 00:44:38,515
This is all quite precarious now.

903
00:44:38,515 --> 00:44:40,475
It doesn't half smell.

904
00:44:40,475 --> 00:44:42,395
Whoo!
HE LAUGHS

905
00:44:42,395 --> 00:44:43,675
It's making my eyes water!

906
00:44:43,675 --> 00:44:45,075
HE LAUGHS

907
00:44:49,115 --> 00:44:52,115
It's beginning to bow out at the
sides a bit.

908
00:44:52,115 --> 00:44:55,395
I'm getting myself into a bit of
a mess, because I'm in a hurry now.

909
00:44:55,395 --> 00:44:57,195
I've got way too much to do.

910
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,595
So I'm going to get ahead
on the fondant, just so I can slap

911
00:44:59,595 --> 00:45:02,395
those panels on when
the time is right.

912
00:45:02,395 --> 00:45:06,875
Beautifully wrapped present cake
requires perfectly rolled fondant.

913
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:08,235
Ugh!

914
00:45:08,235 --> 00:45:10,235
I've had bad experience
with fondant here.

915
00:45:10,235 --> 00:45:12,915
Too thick, and it will appear
lumpy and misshapen.

916
00:45:12,915 --> 00:45:14,875
It's going to be nine by six.

917
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:18,115
Too thin, and there's
a risk fondant will tear.

918
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:22,035
It's quite soft, this fondant.
Quite soft.

919
00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:23,755
Ooh, big cake.

920
00:45:29,475 --> 00:45:31,035
One, two, three. Go!

921
00:45:36,115 --> 00:45:37,755
That's a "phew!" moment!

922
00:45:38,675 --> 00:45:40,355
This is the scary part.

923
00:45:42,395 --> 00:45:45,035
How are you doing? My cake's still
in the freezer, uncovered.

924
00:45:45,035 --> 00:45:46,395
So could be better.

925
00:45:47,475 --> 00:45:49,395
Bakers, you have half an hour.

926
00:45:49,395 --> 00:45:51,395
Just half an hour.

927
00:45:51,395 --> 00:45:53,395
That's not long. No, not really.

928
00:45:53,395 --> 00:45:55,035
This has started to cover.

929
00:45:57,115 --> 00:46:01,115
Ah, ah, ah!
Don't, please, don't. Don't do that.

930
00:46:01,115 --> 00:46:02,795
I can still feel it's warm.

931
00:46:04,035 --> 00:46:05,315
Right, ganache on.

932
00:46:05,315 --> 00:46:07,555
I've got to be quite quick now.

933
00:46:09,515 --> 00:46:10,515
Oooh!

934
00:46:18,955 --> 00:46:22,555
If I manage to get all these panels
on, it will be a minor miracle.

935
00:46:26,755 --> 00:46:28,035
I'm so messy.

936
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,035
This is the bit you don't miss -
the last-minute rush.

937
00:46:35,035 --> 00:46:37,915
No present will be
complete without a bow.

938
00:46:37,915 --> 00:46:42,155
To create theirs, Liam and Flo
are using more fondant...

939
00:46:42,155 --> 00:46:43,875
Looks like a bowl of spaghetti.

940
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:44,915
Anyone?

941
00:46:44,915 --> 00:46:46,395
SHE LAUGHS

942
00:46:46,395 --> 00:46:50,475
..while Jane and Andrew
are attempting sugar work.

943
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,515
So I've got to work fast,
because the sugar will cool down.

944
00:46:52,515 --> 00:46:54,675
So it's got to get to the right
temperature that you can pull it.

945
00:46:54,675 --> 00:46:56,395
Timing is everything.

946
00:46:56,395 --> 00:46:59,635
There we go. Stuck on the gloves.
I'm changing my gloves.

947
00:46:59,635 --> 00:47:02,395
They only have a small window
when the sugar is cool enough

948
00:47:02,395 --> 00:47:07,115
to handle before becoming
brittle and unworkable.

949
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:07,955
Oh, no!

950
00:47:09,395 --> 00:47:12,755
OK. That has crystallised, that one.

951
00:47:12,755 --> 00:47:14,395
Oh, it's all crystallised.

952
00:47:14,395 --> 00:47:15,635
The sugar's crystallised.

953
00:47:17,755 --> 00:47:18,995
OK.

954
00:47:20,835 --> 00:47:22,675
I have a bit of a problem.

955
00:47:22,675 --> 00:47:24,755
I'm in such a rush now.

956
00:47:24,755 --> 00:47:27,595
The fact that I'm getting
any of this done at all is,

957
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:28,915
frankly, a bit of a miracle.

958
00:47:28,915 --> 00:47:32,835
We need a plan B, because I haven't
got time to make any more.

959
00:47:32,835 --> 00:47:35,195
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

960
00:47:35,195 --> 00:47:36,955
No, no, no! No, no!

961
00:47:38,235 --> 00:47:40,875
Five minutes to go. I'm almost done.

962
00:47:45,035 --> 00:47:47,955
Pleased with the bow.
But that ain't going to save me.

963
00:47:47,955 --> 00:47:50,195
Ooh, I've got to put the bow on.

964
00:47:52,235 --> 00:47:55,235
I'm just now going to finish
this as quickly as possible,

965
00:47:55,235 --> 00:47:57,595
because I really want to get
all the elements on.

966
00:48:02,115 --> 00:48:04,395
Ah, ah! Stop! Don't!

967
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:06,875
I'm happy with that.

968
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:08,875
They wanted Christmas in a cake.

969
00:48:08,875 --> 00:48:09,875
Oops!

970
00:48:12,035 --> 00:48:14,555
Bakers, your time is up.

971
00:48:14,555 --> 00:48:15,875
Ooh!

972
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:19,115
Please place your celebration cakes
at the end of your benches.

973
00:48:19,115 --> 00:48:20,675
HE EXHALES

974
00:48:20,675 --> 00:48:22,475
Andrew, looks lovely. Well done.

975
00:48:22,475 --> 00:48:24,275
Oh, Jane, you haven't
seen it up close.

976
00:48:24,275 --> 00:48:26,275
It may not all come
down to a ribbon.

977
00:48:26,275 --> 00:48:30,475
But then it may.
And if it does, c'est la vie.

978
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:47,395
It's slightly understated
in the colours.

979
00:48:47,395 --> 00:48:49,635
It needed to be more in-your-face.

980
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,675
The green is a little dull,
but it's actually quite classy,

981
00:48:52,675 --> 00:48:56,755
those colours, aren't they?
Hidden inside is a penguin

982
00:48:56,755 --> 00:48:59,355
and a couple of Christmas trees.

983
00:48:59,355 --> 00:49:00,595
I hope!

984
00:49:00,595 --> 00:49:02,155
SHE LAUGHS

985
00:49:02,155 --> 00:49:04,275
This is very exciting, isn't it?

986
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,675
SANDI: Look at that! Wonderful.
Look at that!

987
00:49:11,675 --> 00:49:13,035
Wow!

988
00:49:13,035 --> 00:49:17,235
THEY CLAP

989
00:49:17,235 --> 00:49:20,195
That's wonderful! It's quite
effective, isn't it? Very clever.

990
00:49:21,915 --> 00:49:24,035
Delicious!
JANE: Oh, really? Thank you!

991
00:49:24,035 --> 00:49:26,715
It's really good.
The orange is just fragrant enough.

992
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:29,235
It's really good.
It's got a real depth to it.

993
00:49:29,235 --> 00:49:31,675
The sponge is beautifully baked.
Thank you.

994
00:49:31,675 --> 00:49:33,955
And the buttercream
really adds to it.

995
00:49:33,955 --> 00:49:36,355
It's a fantastic cake.
Oh, thank you!

996
00:49:36,355 --> 00:49:38,115
It really is a good cake.

997
00:49:45,795 --> 00:49:48,315
What happened to the stars?
They look a right mess.

998
00:49:48,315 --> 00:49:50,555
It looks like it's been put
on with your finger.

999
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:53,755
But I do like the sugar work on the
top. It's very good. Thank you.

1000
00:50:03,995 --> 00:50:05,675
Oh, look at that.

1001
00:50:07,075 --> 00:50:08,235
Isn't that lovely?

1002
00:50:08,235 --> 00:50:10,475
I think it would be nicer if you
could've got them a bit

1003
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:11,835
more in the middle.

1004
00:50:13,515 --> 00:50:15,715
It's an orange sponge.

1005
00:50:15,715 --> 00:50:18,195
One of the sponges has a little
bit of hazelnut in it.

1006
00:50:18,195 --> 00:50:22,035
It's a hazelnut liqueur chocolate
ganache and then some

1007
00:50:22,035 --> 00:50:23,835
vanilla fondant on the outside.

1008
00:50:23,835 --> 00:50:25,035
It's a nice flavour.

1009
00:50:26,435 --> 00:50:28,395
I think it is slightly over baked.

1010
00:50:28,395 --> 00:50:31,315
It's a little bit dry. All the
flavours are very Christmassy

1011
00:50:31,315 --> 00:50:32,835
and very good.

1012
00:50:32,835 --> 00:50:35,315
It's just the texture that isn't
as much of a pleasure

1013
00:50:35,315 --> 00:50:37,315
as the flavour is.

1014
00:50:43,595 --> 00:50:46,555
It's too messy, it's too clumsy.
It's not sharp enough.

1015
00:50:46,555 --> 00:50:49,435
When you cut in-between
it should alternate between

1016
00:50:49,435 --> 00:50:51,755
star, gingerbread man,
star, gingerbread man.

1017
00:50:51,755 --> 00:50:53,515
NOEL: Hey! There he is.

1018
00:50:53,515 --> 00:50:55,075
Look at that! SANDI: Oh, yeah.

1019
00:50:55,075 --> 00:50:56,915
Oh, I see.

1020
00:50:56,915 --> 00:50:59,275
Oh, how clever. It's a star.

1021
00:50:59,275 --> 00:51:00,675
It's clever.

1022
00:51:03,515 --> 00:51:05,595
I think that's a great cake.

1023
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:08,115
When you were talking about this I
was a bit disappointed

1024
00:51:08,115 --> 00:51:10,755
there was to be no ginger in it,
but in fact it tastes delicious,

1025
00:51:10,755 --> 00:51:13,075
especially when you get a bit of the
butter icing, which is

1026
00:51:13,075 --> 00:51:15,595
absolutely perfect.
I think you redeem yourself

1027
00:51:15,595 --> 00:51:18,115
with the inside, the texture and the
flavour, because that's good.

1028
00:51:18,115 --> 00:51:20,115
Get in. The sponge is baked
beautifully.

1029
00:51:20,115 --> 00:51:22,675
It just needs a little bit more
polish. Cool.

1030
00:51:34,715 --> 00:51:36,475
I do like the decoration.

1031
00:51:36,475 --> 00:51:38,995
I think the set-up is excellent,
I like the colour.

1032
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:41,635
It really does look
very elegant and pretty.

1033
00:51:41,635 --> 00:51:45,915
You've got Roquefort cheese, Stilton
cheese, cream cheese... Yeah.

1034
00:51:45,915 --> 00:51:48,155
And a bottle of mulled wine. Yeah.

1035
00:51:48,155 --> 00:51:50,915
SANDI: Yeah, stop talking about
it, start cutting.

1036
00:51:50,915 --> 00:51:52,195
NOEL: Here he goes.

1037
00:52:01,435 --> 00:52:04,115
THEY CHEER

1038
00:52:05,395 --> 00:52:08,355
Wow! Woo!

1039
00:52:08,355 --> 00:52:11,435
It's got the texture of a Christmas
pudding! I can smell it from here.

1040
00:52:11,435 --> 00:52:13,715
It is just amazing!

1041
00:52:13,715 --> 00:52:15,395
SANDI: Wow. Right.

1042
00:52:19,195 --> 00:52:21,595
I have to say I don't like it, Flo.

1043
00:52:21,595 --> 00:52:23,675
Don't you?
I just love your imagination.

1044
00:52:23,675 --> 00:52:25,475
I think the decoration is fantastic.

1045
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,715
Don't you like the wine?
I like the taste by itself.

1046
00:52:28,715 --> 00:52:30,955
Yeah.
But I don't like the combination.

1047
00:52:30,955 --> 00:52:33,115
PAUL SIGHS
That's not good, Flo.

1048
00:52:33,115 --> 00:52:35,395
No? Interesting idea, though.

1049
00:52:35,395 --> 00:52:39,835
What you've got is two major, major
punchy flavours that are totally

1050
00:52:39,835 --> 00:52:43,395
opposite ends of the scale,
and you've brought them together

1051
00:52:43,395 --> 00:52:46,395
in an unconventional
manner, which is cake.

1052
00:52:46,395 --> 00:52:48,795
I mean, I think it's amazingly
brave. It is.

1053
00:52:48,795 --> 00:52:51,395
I've never had anything like that
before. No. Never.

1054
00:52:51,395 --> 00:52:53,355
It's unique. Thank you, Flo.

1055
00:52:53,355 --> 00:52:55,435
Thanks, Flo. Oh, well. Never mind.

1056
00:52:58,955 --> 00:53:02,635
SANDI: Right, my lovely festive
bakers, that's it. Your work
is done.

1057
00:53:02,635 --> 00:53:05,995
Now it's up to Paul and Prue
to decide who is going to be

1058
00:53:05,995 --> 00:53:07,795
our Christmas Star Baker.

1059
00:53:07,795 --> 00:53:11,235
So you guys can go and join
your friends and family outside,

1060
00:53:11,235 --> 00:53:12,995
while the judges deliberate.

1061
00:53:16,955 --> 00:53:18,235
CHEERING

1062
00:53:23,355 --> 00:53:25,835
I was so pleased when they cut into
it and that the penguins

1063
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:27,235
looked like penguins!

1064
00:53:27,235 --> 00:53:29,475
Cos that would've been a disaster,
wouldn't it?

1065
00:53:29,475 --> 00:53:32,035
To know that it was
a perfect sponge cake

1066
00:53:32,035 --> 00:53:34,915
from Paul and Prue - gassed.

1067
00:53:34,915 --> 00:53:35,915
Gassed!

1068
00:53:37,835 --> 00:53:40,355
Of course I'm a little bit
disappointed. It would've been nice

1069
00:53:40,355 --> 00:53:43,235
to go out on a real high,
have the cake well baked.

1070
00:53:43,235 --> 00:53:48,155
But, you know, it doesn't always go
to plan in the tent.

1071
00:53:48,155 --> 00:53:50,835
I know that cake was a nice cake

1072
00:53:50,835 --> 00:53:53,115
and I will continue
to make that cake.

1073
00:53:58,115 --> 00:54:00,835
of the Great Christmas
Bake Off crown.

1074
00:54:00,835 --> 00:54:02,395
Well, here is the good thing.

1075
00:54:02,395 --> 00:54:03,715
We're not sending anybody home.

1076
00:54:03,715 --> 00:54:05,035
No. This is lovely. Yes.

1077
00:54:05,035 --> 00:54:07,635
But only one person's
going to be Star Baker.

1078
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:08,835
It's going to be quite tricky.

1079
00:54:08,835 --> 00:54:11,515
I think Andrew did well
in the Technical, and I thought

1080
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:14,395
the flavour of his cake
was very strong and very bold.

1081
00:54:14,395 --> 00:54:16,275
I just think it was
slightly over baked.

1082
00:54:16,275 --> 00:54:17,595
Great sugar work to make the ribbon.

1083
00:54:17,595 --> 00:54:19,595
Jane has done pretty well
all the way through.

1084
00:54:19,595 --> 00:54:21,555
She has.
The penguin looked amazing.

1085
00:54:21,555 --> 00:54:23,035
You knew it was a penguin.

1086
00:54:23,035 --> 00:54:24,315
As soon as you cut it you went, ah!

1087
00:54:24,315 --> 00:54:25,595
It was clever, that.

1088
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:29,235
I felt that Liam, to a large
extent, redeemed himself. He did.

1089
00:54:29,235 --> 00:54:32,195
To be honest, I liked his
cake best for eating.

1090
00:54:32,195 --> 00:54:34,275
Has the cheese ruled Flo out?

1091
00:54:34,275 --> 00:54:36,355
LAUGHTER

1092
00:54:36,355 --> 00:54:38,235
I mean, what was Flo
thinking with that?

1093
00:54:38,235 --> 00:54:40,315
It was never, ever going to be nice.

1094
00:54:40,315 --> 00:54:44,075
If it had've worked,
having a dessert and your cheese

1095
00:54:44,075 --> 00:54:46,675
at the same time, kind of genius.

1096
00:54:46,675 --> 00:54:47,675
Don't push it.

1097
00:55:03,715 --> 00:55:06,115
Right, let's have the bakers
forward, and many congratulations

1098
00:55:06,115 --> 00:55:07,235
to them!

1099
00:55:07,235 --> 00:55:08,795
CHEERING

1100
00:55:12,395 --> 00:55:15,475
Bakers, you've all been amazing,
but I've got the wonderful job

1101
00:55:15,475 --> 00:55:17,835
of announcing this year's winner.

1102
00:55:19,395 --> 00:55:24,835
The winner of this year's
Christmas Bake Off is...

1103
00:55:26,395 --> 00:55:28,715
..Jane.
CHEERING

1104
00:55:28,715 --> 00:55:29,755
Yes!

1105
00:55:33,435 --> 00:55:35,515
It's really rare, actually,
for someone to dominate

1106
00:55:35,515 --> 00:55:36,795
in all three challenges.

1107
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:38,475
And I think Jane did exactly that.

1108
00:55:38,475 --> 00:55:40,755
She was a finalist last time
she was in the tent,

1109
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:44,115
and she's actually won it this time,
and I feel very proud for her.

1110
00:55:44,115 --> 00:55:48,195
It's been such a great year,
and what a wonderful way to end it,

1111
00:55:48,195 --> 00:55:51,835
and such fun to meet the families
because they're so proud

1112
00:55:51,835 --> 00:55:53,515
of these bakers,
and so they should be.

1113
00:55:53,515 --> 00:55:55,075
I'm proud of these bakers!

1114
00:55:55,075 --> 00:55:56,515
I'm almost lost for words.

1115
00:55:56,515 --> 00:55:59,475
It is so lovely to win it.

1116
00:55:59,475 --> 00:56:01,155
It's going to have pride
of place somewhere.

1117
00:56:01,155 --> 00:56:03,835
There's no way I'm going to hide
this light under a bushel!

1118
00:56:06,915 --> 00:56:09,435
# Christmas time

1119
00:56:09,435 --> 00:56:11,115
# Don't let the bells end. #

1120
00:56:11,115 --> 00:56:14,275
I spent ten weeks in that tent with
Jane, right through to the final

1121
00:56:14,275 --> 00:56:18,035
together, so I'm really,
really chuffed for her.

1122
00:56:18,035 --> 00:56:20,995
# Christmas time

1123
00:56:20,995 --> 00:56:23,235
# Don't let the bells end. #

1124
00:56:23,235 --> 00:56:26,555
In the beginning when they asked me
to come back for Christmas,

1125
00:56:26,555 --> 00:56:27,795
I had my doubts.

1126
00:56:27,795 --> 00:56:29,995
I went, "Oh, no, I don't
want to come back."

1127
00:56:29,995 --> 00:56:33,995
I don't regret that one bit,
and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

1128
00:56:35,595 --> 00:56:38,475
# Christmas time

1129
00:56:38,475 --> 00:56:40,955
# Don't let the bells end. #

1130
00:56:40,955 --> 00:56:44,515
I am glad that I came back
because it's what I started,

1131
00:56:44,515 --> 00:56:46,195
and I can't forget that.

1132
00:56:55,035 --> 00:56:56,995
What have I got here? It seems...

1133
00:56:56,995 --> 00:56:59,155
Excuse me. I think this is mine.
Thank you.

1134
00:56:59,155 --> 00:57:00,195
Thanks, Jane.

1135
00:57:01,235 --> 00:57:02,355
Maybe next time!

1136
00:57:03,355 --> 00:57:04,475
Next time...

1137
00:57:04,475 --> 00:57:05,835
Good luck!

1138
00:57:05,835 --> 00:57:08,675
..four more familiar faces
get their festive bake on...

1139
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,715
I'm back!

1140
00:57:10,755 --> 00:57:13,075
..tackling a challenging
Germanic signature...

1141
00:57:13,075 --> 00:57:14,955
I'm just going to scatter some nuts.

1142
00:57:14,955 --> 00:57:17,675
I just feel I've arrived
at exactly the right moment.

1143
00:57:17,675 --> 00:57:19,715
..and oh-so-eggy technical...

1144
00:57:19,715 --> 00:57:21,235
This is hectic!

1145
00:57:21,235 --> 00:57:22,355
No!

1146
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,835
..and a 3D Showstopper.

1147
00:57:23,835 --> 00:57:26,835
I'm not a big fan of innuendo,
but - what is that?

1148
00:57:26,835 --> 00:57:29,475
Celebrating their New
Year's resolutions...

1149
00:57:29,475 --> 00:57:30,755
PAUL: It's very, very clever.

1150
00:57:30,755 --> 00:57:32,395
It jolly well better taste good.

1151
00:57:33,915 --> 00:57:35,755
Are you a Star Baker in the making?

1152
