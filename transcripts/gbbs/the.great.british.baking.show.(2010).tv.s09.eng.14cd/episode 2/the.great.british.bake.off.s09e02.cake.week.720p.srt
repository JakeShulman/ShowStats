1
00:00:00,609 --> 00:00:03,289
It's week two, and
it is cake week, and...

2
00:00:03,849 --> 00:00:07,848
Wow! Noel, that is amazing!

3
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:11,808
I love your commitment
to the theme of the week.

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:13,545
No, I mean... No, no,
don't have to explain.

5
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:15,105
I've totally got it.

6
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:16,865
You are Marie Antoinette,

7
00:00:16,889 --> 00:00:19,265
because what is the one thing
that we all know about her?

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,265
That she famously said, "Let them
eat cake," and it's Cake Week.

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,265
I just... I love that you've bothered.

10
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:26,305
I mean, I don't want
to nit-pick, you know,

11
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:28,065
cos historically probably
she never said it.

12
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:30,145
I think it's one of the
great misquotes of history.

13
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:32,585
If anything, she would have
said, "Let them eat brioche."

14
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,585
But chances are she
never even mentioned cake.

15
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:35,905
I mean, people just said it about her

16
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:38,825
because, you know, they were
mean. But honestly, well done.

17
00:00:38,849 --> 00:00:40,945
I don't know what you're talking about.

18
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:44,282
These are the only clothes
I had left that were clean.

19
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:46,729
Clean is good.

20
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:48,345
Last time...

21
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:49,745
Come on, biscuits.

22
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:51,945
...Briony saw herself rising to the top.

23
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,865
I love the balloons. Can
we eat a balloon? Please do.

24
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,145
But it was Manon...

25
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:58,265
I think you've done an
amazing job. Thank you.

26
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,288
...who was crowned this
year's first Star Baker.

27
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:02,705
And although Ruby crumbled...

28
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,105
I am losing it, Noel.

29
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,145
...it was Imelda...

30
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:06,545
Oh, sugar plum fairies!

31
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:08,808
...who was first to leave the tent.

32
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:10,585
Now it's Cake Week.

33
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,065
This is not going to go well.

34
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:14,385
The Signature Bake sees
temperatures rise...

35
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,545
Well, good luck cooling it.

36
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:17,905
...the bakers go green for
the Technical Challenge...

37
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:20,968
The weirdest thing
I've ever done for a cake.

38
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:22,785
...and face a chocolate Showstopper...

39
00:01:22,809 --> 00:01:24,145
Lordy, Lordy. It's hot.

40
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:26,169
...on one of the hottest days...

41
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:28,774
...the Bake Off tent has ever seen.

42
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,049
It's OK.

43
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:57,865
Cake Week. Kind of looking forward to it

44
00:01:57,889 --> 00:01:59,865
cos I've been practising
literally nonstop.

45
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:00,905
Best of luck.

46
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:03,745
Even though I'm a baker,
cakes are not really my thing.

47
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:06,065
So many things that
can go wrong with cake.

48
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:08,745
Just trying not to
think about that right now.

49
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:12,582
I am going to run out of time
today so warning, spoiler alert.

50
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:18,728
Welcome to Cake Week and
your Signature Challenge.

51
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,448
Today, the judges
would like you to create

52
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,928
that classic crowd pleaser, a traybake.

53
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:26,488
They want you to tray and bake a cake.

54
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:28,968
That posh accent's not working for you.

55
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:31,848
You can use any type
of sponge, any flavour,

56
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:36,608
but you must be able to make 16
identical slices from your traybake.

57
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:39,865
You've got two hours to complete
your Signature Challenge.

58
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:42,139
On your marks... get set... bake!

59
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:47,288
A traybake, as the name
implies, is baked in a tray.

60
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:50,305
Generally, they're the good,
old reliable sponge cakes

61
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:52,368
with sort of white icing on top.

62
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,745
But I would like to see
something I've never seen before.

63
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:55,985
You've got to bite into it.

64
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,625
A little bit of crunch
on the top's nice.

65
00:02:57,649 --> 00:03:00,065
Hit that beautiful sponge
and, of course, flavour -

66
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:03,545
they must get that flavour
across to us in a very small bite.

67
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,465
Time management is critical.

68
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,288
Get this wrong, they're in
a whole world of trouble.

69
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:12,025
Good morning, Antony. Hello,
Paul. Morning, Antony. Hello, Prue.

70
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:14,385
Hey, Noel. Tell us about your traybake.

71
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:17,545
So it's a frangipane with a
nice sweet pastry, pineapple jam

72
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,265
and then a coconut burfi
on top. What is burfi?

73
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:22,985
It's like a coconut sweet,
really. Just milk powder,

74
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,065
desiccated coconut... Oh,
delicious... and sugar.

75
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:27,528
Hi, Mama. How are you? I'm very well.

76
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:29,985
Antony lives in London
but calls his mum, Maria,

77
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,905
back in Bangalore, every day.

78
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:33,385
How's the weather in Bangalore?

79
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:34,905
Oh, it's horrible.

80
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:38,168
Inspired by the burfi he
ate with his mum as a boy,

81
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:40,465
Antony's cardamom frangipane traybake

82
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,105
blends Indian sweets with
classic British baking.

83
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:45,825
Sounds like a slightly different
Bakewell tart, doesn't it?

84
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,945
Yeah, it's like an Indian
Bakewell tart. Yeah.

85
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:50,785
I think you might have
invented something there. Yeah.

86
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:54,208
Briony is also attempting
to pull off a culture clash.

87
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:58,249
I've gone for Spanish flavours
because I'm a massive fan of Spain

88
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:01,305
and all things Spanish, so I
wanted to sort of incorporate that

89
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,265
into the good old British traybake.

90
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:06,225
Briony is currently training
for her third half marathon

91
00:04:06,249 --> 00:04:08,288
with her cockapoo, Archie.

92
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:11,208
And the race is on to
complete her traybake

93
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:14,505
with an orange pastry base, almond
sponge and a chocolate ganache

94
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:16,745
on top of a soft Spanish
nougat called a turron.

95
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,928
Hola. Hola. Hola! Hola! Que tal, Sandi?

96
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:22,408
Do you speak Spanish? Si. Claro que si.

97
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:24,985
Do, do you really? Yes. I
studied it at university.

98
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,145
And your Danish? No.

99
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:27,945
Well, I'm going to... I'm up for trying.

100
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:29,385
We've got time. Yeah, teach me.

101
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:32,065
You need actually, probably, to get
all the way through to the final,

102
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:34,785
I'm just saying, if I'm going
to teach you anything. Yeah. OK?

103
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:38,488
OK, here we go. Jeg Jeg
konge i... konge i...

104
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,408
...Danmark... Danmark.
Og jeg... Og jeg...

105
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,145
...kan lide... kan lide...
...Jordbaer... Jordbaer.

106
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:45,665
Yeah. What did you just make me say?

107
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,745
"I am the king of Denmark
and I like strawberries."

108
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:50,265
And I think that is
going to see you though

109
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,745
any part of Denmark
that you wish to go to.

110
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:53,905
Come on.

111
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:55,625
Dan is also headed for Europe.

112
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:57,305
I'm just going to try not to panic,

113
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:59,185
cos it didn't serve me well last time.

114
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:01,808
He's off to Germany via the 1970s.

115
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:03,505
It's a riff on a Black Forest gateau.

116
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:05,345
Maybe they were trendy
when I was growing up,

117
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:07,145
but you don't see them much these days.

118
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:10,208
Despite being too young
to remember the '70s,

119
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:13,185
as a boy, Black Forest gateau
was Dan's absolute favourite.

120
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:15,305
He's making a vanilla cream topping

121
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:17,865
and will decorate with
intricate tempered chocolate,

122
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,545
but he's already discovered a problem.

123
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,265
I thought nobody else would
do it but, unfortunately...

124
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:25,968
Chocolate, cherries,
cream, is delicious.

125
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:27,665
...Ruby's stealing my ideas.

126
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:30,208
Honestly!

127
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:33,128
Less of that "stealing
the idea" business!

128
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,865
Ruby's ideas in the kitchen
have usually been inspired

129
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:37,185
by her mum, Kalvinder.

130
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:40,105
That's good. Got to say,
not as good as Mum's though.

131
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:43,225
Ruby made her Black Forest gateau
for her family last Christmas.

132
00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:45,105
It has a dark chocolate ganache

133
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:47,945
and white chocolate drizzle on
top of a moist chocolate sponge.

134
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:51,305
I'm a bit worried because it's quite
a tender chocolate sponge. Yeah.

135
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:54,025
How are you going to
get it into neat slices?

136
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:56,745
The key thing for me is to
make sure that it's chilled,

137
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:58,865
otherwise it could
turn into a sloppy mess.

138
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,889
Yeah, no pressure.

139
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:03,568
When it comes to her sponge recipe...

140
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:05,145
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six.

141
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:06,545
...last week's Star Baker, Manon,

142
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:08,545
has put herself under
even more pressure.

143
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,785
I'm not using any raising action.
I'm only using the egg whites,

144
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:13,865
actually are going to make it fluffy.

145
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:15,889
So it's quite a lot of eggs.

146
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:19,745
When Manon left the family farm in
Brittany for London six years ago,

147
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:22,144
it awoke a passion for British baking.

148
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:29,345
Her raising agent-free traybake,
with rosemary, honey and fresh figs,

149
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:32,585
was one of the first recipes
she learnt in her adoptive home.

150
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:36,265
My first job in London, there's
a landlady where I used to work -

151
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:38,848
she made the best honey cake ever.

152
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,448
The risk is that it can not raise.

153
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:45,985
Terry is taking an even bigger
risk with his sponge batter.

154
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:48,385
What's this, then?
this is just an apple sauce.

155
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,505
And where's that going? Into my batter.

156
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:52,145
It's interesting that you're using this

157
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:53,625
cos there's a lot of liquid in apple.

158
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,025
It's a nice, moist cake

159
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,985
and it's actually it's better
a few days after you make it.

160
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:00,648
Terry also has the
patience to keep bees.

161
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:02,985
Looks like I've got a nice
active little queen in there.

162
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:05,928
Using their honey to
slowly brew his own beer.

163
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:08,048
Should be a nice, sweet mix.

164
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:10,585
There's an alcoholic
kick to his traybake,

165
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:12,025
with rum-soaked raisins and dates

166
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:14,424
being added to his moist apple sponge.

167
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:16,345
Are we going to taste the rum? You will.

168
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,505
There is a rum syrup that goes on
the top once the sponge is cool.

169
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:20,745
A lot of rum? Hopefully.

170
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:22,065
I'm counting on it.

171
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:24,345
Some rum shots on the side?
I might. I might, yeah.

172
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:27,432
Just keep bringing the
rum and Prue will be happy.

173
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:30,852
Every minute in the
Signature Challenge...

174
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:32,865
...is now precious.

175
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:35,327
I need to get this into the oven, ASAP.

176
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:38,905
The longer the bakers'
large traybake-sized sponges

177
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:39,985
need in the oven...

178
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:41,225
Come on.

179
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:42,825
...the less time they'll have to cool.

180
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:44,968
And now... waiting time.

181
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:47,848
And a warm cake can't
be sliced and decorated.

182
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:49,105
Doesn't that look delicious?

183
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:50,425
There we go.

184
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,145
That's going to be in
there for about 25 minutes.

185
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:54,785
This is going in for 35 minutes.

186
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,105
This needs 20 minutes.

187
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:58,705
It's quite a thin cake.
It's a very short bake time.

188
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,792
So it's got lots of time to cool.

189
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:05,889
Bake well, my love.

190
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:08,265
Now there's even more to worry about.

191
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:09,665
Okey dokey.

192
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,065
The judges will be expecting
each traybake sponge

193
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:15,105
to be accompanied by complimentary
fillings and toppings.

194
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:18,425
This is Valencian orange jam but
they still a nice bitter taste.

195
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:20,665
You know when it's ready
when it hits when it hits 105.

196
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:22,625
Very helpfully, it says
"jam" on it, actually.

197
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:24,585
And it also says "hard
crack" on there as well.

198
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:27,728
I'm not sure what
that temperature's for.

199
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:31,568
I am making my rosemary
syrup. I love rosemary.

200
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:34,025
You know, it reminds me of
Welsh lamb like, you know?

201
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,208
While I'm eating a lemon cake.

202
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,265
I think you should wear this one.

203
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,928
Jon also adds an unconventional twist

204
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,745
to his job delivering blood to the NHS

205
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:45,025
by letting his daughters,
Lucy and Hannah,

206
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:46,265
choose what he wears to work.

207
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:48,025
Why not this one? Oh, that is very nice.

208
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,705
Your mother doesn't
like that one at all.

209
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,865
But Mum and the girls have all approved

210
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:53,585
his Italian meringue-topped traybake

211
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:56,025
that pairs his favourite herb
with his favourite pudding.

212
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:57,705
I like lemon meringue pie,

213
00:08:57,729 --> 00:09:00,025
so I thought I would
try a lemon meringue cake

214
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:01,825
rather than lemon meringue pie.

215
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:05,968
In the oven, I'm making a
pandan chiffon traybake cake.

216
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:07,505
And what's pandan?

217
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:10,568
So pandan is like a long leaf,

218
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:12,225
and you get the juice from it.

219
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:15,688
And does the pandan give
colour as well as flavour? Yes.

220
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,425
That's revolting.

221
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:20,705
Do you know...? Do you
know what it's like?

222
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:23,225
It's going well, I think.
It's like I just cut me lawn.

223
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:25,249
It's just like I cut me lawn.

224
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:28,865
Kim-Joy often bakes treats
for her and her partner Nabil's

225
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:31,048
marathon board game sessions.

226
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:34,665
Her pandan and coconut traybake,
topped with palm sugar cream,

227
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:36,105
is one of his favourites.

228
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:38,345
It's kind of a love
or hate flavour, so...

229
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,608
Isn't that a dangerous
thing to do? I love it, so...

230
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:45,665
I quite like it. Do you? It's
like pond water. Yeah, good...

231
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:47,665
I think that could be delicious. Thanks.

232
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:49,877
Sort of reminding me of frog spawn.

233
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:53,169
Lovely.

234
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:55,305
Bakers, you have one hour left.

235
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:59,568
Wow, if we've got an hour we could
cut your hair using this bowl.

236
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:01,065
I'll take that.

237
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:04,905
There's a saying where I come from
- a watched pot never boils.

238
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:07,105
The bakers now face a crucial decision.

239
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:08,865
I'm a bit scared to look in the oven.

240
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:10,425
Cake's coming out in about a minute.

241
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:12,945
Take a traybake out of the oven too soon

242
00:10:12,969 --> 00:10:16,225
and the under-baked sponge
could collapse when it's cut.

243
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,705
Leave it too long,

244
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:20,225
and not only do they risk
running out of cooling time...

245
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:21,865
Oh, no. Definitely more time.

246
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,225
Yeah, that's done.

247
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:25,368
...but also tough, crumbly slices.

248
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:27,488
Let's just wait for it.

249
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:28,985
Omm.

250
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:32,225
Might have to whack the oven
temperature up a little bit, maybe.

251
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:33,945
In fact, I'm going to do that now.

252
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:36,568
Got about another 15,
20 minutes left yet.

253
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:38,968
Just a bit of a waiting game now.

254
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:42,025
Back home in Sheffield, a
bake in the oven means a chance

255
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:44,105
for Luke to take Ruby, Oscar and Daisy

256
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:46,865
for one of their two walks a
day with his fiancee, Kelly.

257
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:49,848
You all right? Yeah,
I'm losing my jeans.

258
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:54,328
They often return to his classic
lemon and poppy seed traybake,

259
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:56,705
with a white chocolate
and mascarpone topping.

260
00:10:56,729 --> 00:10:58,945
Not sure if it's cooked
in this little bit.

261
00:10:58,969 --> 00:11:00,945
Yeah, there's this one
little section within it

262
00:11:00,969 --> 00:11:02,745
that just doesn't want to bake.

263
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:05,985
Whilst most bakers have enough
to worry about with one sponge...

264
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:08,009
All right.

265
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:13,328
...one has managed to make his
Signature Challenge twice as hard.

266
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:15,705
I don't really want to over-bake them.

267
00:11:15,729 --> 00:11:18,105
I don't want to under-bake them either.

268
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:20,905
Rahul's planned a traybake
that's double layered.

269
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:23,505
I did quite a lot of
experiment with this recipe.

270
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:27,408
I baked it, like, five or
six different versions of it.

271
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:29,968
Rahul often gets his best baking ideas

272
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:34,008
whilst working out at his local
leisure centre in Rotherham.

273
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:35,985
It's inspired a seventh version

274
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:39,088
of his double lemon
joconde sponge traybake,

275
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:40,985
with Italian meringue buttercream

276
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:44,425
and now a drizzle with the juice
of four lemons and 25 cardamom pods.

277
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:47,425
It just smell like, disinfectant
so don't worry about that.

278
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:50,128
Wow! That's... strong.

279
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,665
Oh, my God. So it does
smell like disinfectant?

280
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:54,745
Well, I think I certainly wouldn't mind

281
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:57,585
cleaning the corners of my
fridge with it. Oh, wow, great.

282
00:11:57,609 --> 00:11:59,705
No, I'm sure it will taste delicious.

283
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:01,305
Right. I'm going to go for it.

284
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:02,945
I think I'm going to take it out.

285
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:04,969
♪ Hallelujah! ♪

286
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,065
He is ginormous.

287
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:09,585
How thick is it? Mine's probably
going to be about that thick.

288
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:11,985
Oh, no, mine's like that.
Oh, mine's quite deep.

289
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:14,259
Well, good luck cooling it. Oh, God!

290
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:16,705
With time running out...

291
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:17,865
Come on.

292
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:19,865
...the moment their
sponges are cool enough...

293
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:20,945
He's big.

294
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:22,785
...the bakers need to be ready

295
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,585
with all their fillings,
toppings and decorations.

296
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,785
Hopefully I'll squeeze
it in, in ten minutes.

297
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:30,585
Yeah, you know you're not
actually wearing a watch, right?

298
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:33,145
Just... that's
not really helping you.

299
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,665
Rum sauce. A tablespoon of rum
in. Just a little extra for Prue.

300
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,568
Hopefully she'll get the
rum flavour from that.

301
00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:43,385
Mixing together the honey and the
sugar and water for the turron.

302
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:45,488
My marmalade is simmering.

303
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:46,585
Ganache ganaching.

304
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:49,288
Maybe I've just done too many things.

305
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:52,625
At the moment, I'm just piping
some chocolate shapes onto acetate,

306
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:55,568
and they will stand
upright on top of the cake.

307
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:59,288
I tried various things for
the topping, unsuccessfully,

308
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:02,985
and I wanted to use the marzipan and
I just got a flash of inspiration.

309
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:06,088
Just thought, "Edible
food paint. Metallic."

310
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:07,865
So it's beautiful and shiny.

311
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:10,505
Since recently becoming a
grandmother for the first time,

312
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:12,665
Karen has been devoting
her creative energies

313
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:14,928
into artistic bakes for her family.

314
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:17,385
Now then, this seal, do they have legs?

315
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:18,785
No, they have flippers.

316
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:22,208
Her striped marzipan will
sit on an almond sponge

317
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:24,025
layered with a tart rhubarb jam.

318
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:26,865
I've done the stripy bits, although
I could titivate for a while,

319
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,105
but I'm just putting some
beautiful glitter on it.

320
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:31,065
Why wouldn't you?

321
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:32,305
Full disco.

322
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:33,985
Sandi, we need to do a time call.

323
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:35,305
Yeah, no, I'm skipping this one.

324
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:38,328
Bakers, you only have
15 minutes remaining.

325
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:40,225
So that's a slight worry.

326
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:42,385
I shall have to caramelise
my nuts a bit quicker.

327
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:43,985
Now it's messy.

328
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:46,128
Turron can set quite quickly,

329
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:48,425
so I have to make that
kind of at the last minute.

330
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:51,488
It's going to be a rush at the end!

331
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:52,745
Pushing it a little bit.

332
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:54,665
Just putting my drizzle into my cake.

333
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:57,305
I'm just spreading my
Italian meringue buttercream.

334
00:13:57,329 --> 00:13:58,585
I'm reasonably happy.

335
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:01,025
I think Ruby's struggling
with cooling it down.

336
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,049
It's still way too hot.

337
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:04,505
Quite warm now, isn't it?

338
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:06,305
It is very warm.
cheers for that, Sandi.

339
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:07,945
Is that better? That's amazing.

340
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:09,969
Right, here we go. Turron on.

341
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:11,345
It's so sticky.

342
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:12,425
Mine's roasting.

343
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:14,985
This bad boy just needs to go
and chill in the fridge, though.

344
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:18,884
It's too hot. It's going to melt.
This is going to look a mess.

345
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:21,385
God, I've got to get 16 pieces off this.

346
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:24,928
The judges have demanded
identical crisp, clean slices.

347
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:26,345
This is all about precision.

348
00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:28,385
Hopefully get it
looking relatively even.

349
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,665
So I've divided in four,

350
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:31,865
and each four is going to
be divided into four more.

351
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:35,327
Un, deux, trois, quatre...
Sorry. So I need to do seize.

352
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:41,585
Oh, God. They're looking hot.

353
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:44,109
Some are a bit bigger than others. Oops.

354
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:47,248
They look so messy and rubbish.

355
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:51,305
They might not be as finished
as I'd like them to be

356
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:53,329
but they'll be there.

357
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,385
It's hotting up.

358
00:14:57,409 --> 00:14:58,785
So now the ganache is melting.

359
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:00,585
I'd like to take a bit
more care in doing this

360
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,305
but I just haven't
got time at the moment.

361
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:04,585
Bakers, you have one minute remaining.

362
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:06,609
Oops.

363
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:11,705
Oh, you mucky pup.

364
00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:13,625
Finished.

365
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:14,785
What a mess.

366
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:16,888
Bakers, your time is up.

367
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:21,345
You're done. Done.
You're done. We're done.

368
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:22,705
Look at everyone's.

369
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:26,848
It's just pretty and pretty and
pretty. Pretty, pretty, pretty.

370
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:28,889
Oh, dear.

371
00:15:34,354 --> 00:15:37,330
It's judgment time for the
bakers' Signature traybakes.

372
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,354
Hello, Rahul. Hi.

373
00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:44,170
They are quite elegant

374
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,610
and it reminds me of an
afternoon tea in a five-star hotel

375
00:15:46,634 --> 00:15:50,697
cos they look like they're finger
sandwiches. Let's have a taste.

376
00:15:54,114 --> 00:15:56,050
You certainly get the
lemon and the cardamom,

377
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:58,810
and they're in the right
proportion. I think that's very good.

378
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,330
For something that looks like
a wholemeal finger sandwich,

379
00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:05,593
they taste beautiful. Sigh
of relief. Yeah. Thank you.

380
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:07,634
Cheers. Thanks.

381
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:17,882
It's quite a tough sponge. And
it's a bit bland as well. OK.

382
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:26,810
You really have got the balance
of the coconut and the frangipane

383
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:29,610
absolutely perfect. It's
very delicate. Not as powerful

384
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:32,250
as I thought it'd be. It is a
little bit of a mess... Thanks, Paul.

385
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:34,962
...but I think it's a
pretty decent traybake.

386
00:16:39,474 --> 00:16:41,250
Tough as old boots.

387
00:16:41,274 --> 00:16:44,290
And the top is very sloppy,
so you've got sloppy and tough.

388
00:16:44,314 --> 00:16:52,153
Sounds like a terrible
double act, Sloppy And Tough.

389
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,570
You were right about the rum.

390
00:16:56,594 --> 00:16:57,970
It's very rummy.

391
00:16:57,994 --> 00:17:00,890
Because the amount of apple
that you've put in there,

392
00:17:00,914 --> 00:17:03,450
it brings flavour. Blending
that with the raisin, the rum,

393
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:05,810
I think you have a beautiful,
traditional traybake.

394
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:08,897
Not very sophisticated
but a real pleasure to eat.

395
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:14,050
I think they look very elegant.
You have kept it simple...

396
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,387
Yes... but it is down to that sponge.

397
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:21,090
I think the marzipan's a bit too
thick for that amount of sponge.

398
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:24,090
The sponge is very dry. That's
a shame, cos they look great.

399
00:17:24,114 --> 00:17:27,989
Thank you very much for your
feedback. That's great. Thank you.

400
00:17:28,074 --> 00:17:29,690
They look really elegant.

401
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,330
They look all the same size.

402
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:32,610
Very neat.

403
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,690
Oh, lovely colour. I
love that pale green.

404
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:37,777
That comes from the pandan
leaf, doesn't it? Yeah.

405
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:42,433
I love the chiffon. That is lovely.

406
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:44,170
Textures are perfect.

407
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:45,530
The look of it's perfect.

408
00:17:45,554 --> 00:17:46,890
But I just don't like the pandan.

409
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:48,890
No, I accept that. Some people don't.

410
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:51,610
For me, it's not the right flavour
to go in a traybake, but I admire

411
00:17:51,634 --> 00:17:55,134
the fact that you did it,
because that chiffon's perfect.

412
00:17:57,074 --> 00:18:00,810
I hope, really hope they taste OK.
So do I, cos they look hideous.

413
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:02,834
I know! I know. I'm sorry.

414
00:18:06,074 --> 00:18:08,353
It's divine. Is it? There you go.

415
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:12,170
Honestly, I don't care the
way it looks. Really? Yeah.

416
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:14,250
I have to have another
bite. The almonds in there.

417
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:16,330
The turron as well. The
whole thing together.

418
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:19,530
The orange. It's delicious.
Absolutely lovely. Oh, thank you.

419
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:22,054
Can't believe I'm
crying over a traybake.

420
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,530
Well, I have to say they
look very elegant. Thank you.

421
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:31,890
I'm not quite sure I'd like a whole
piece of rosemary leaf in my mouth.

422
00:18:31,914 --> 00:18:34,690
Right. But you've got chopped
rosemary inside, haven't you?

423
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,714
Yes. Yes.

424
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:40,610
I'll tell you what, it's delicious
when you do get a bit of rosemary.

425
00:18:40,634 --> 00:18:43,610
The Italian meringue, it tastes
fine, it just needed more whipping.

426
00:18:43,634 --> 00:18:45,090
Chocolate goes well with it as well.

427
00:18:45,114 --> 00:18:47,610
Sponge is good, but it's down
to those little elegant touches

428
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:50,050
and I think you lost it slightly
with the Italian meringue.

429
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:52,074
Thank you.

430
00:18:54,074 --> 00:18:56,074
It looks like a forest floor.

431
00:18:57,274 --> 00:19:00,170
OK. It's a mess. It's broken apart
as you've tried to portion this,

432
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,319
cos some are thin, some are thick.

433
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:06,050
I think, as a chocolate cake
goes, it's fantastic. Yeah.

434
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:07,570
I mean, very, very good.

435
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:09,570
The biggest issue is that
you don't get any cherry.

436
00:19:09,594 --> 00:19:12,090
Right, OK. Maybe more kirsch in
there would have helped as well.

437
00:19:12,114 --> 00:19:14,410
Oh, I'm not sure about the
kirsch but I could eat that

438
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:17,372
with a great deal of pleasure,
though. Oh, good.

439
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:24,233
Well, the decoration
is absolutely excellent.

440
00:19:24,274 --> 00:19:26,610
Everything is very
neat. You pipe very well.

441
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:28,610
It's not too thick. Impressive.

442
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,822
Thank you. I think they
look amazing. Good interior.

443
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,274
Nice and boozy.

444
00:19:39,114 --> 00:19:41,090
Come on. Say something nice.

445
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,930
Like your T-shirt.

446
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:45,704
Just doing my best here.
That'll do. Oh, wow.

447
00:19:48,074 --> 00:19:50,153
Thank you very much.

448
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:53,313
What I liked about it,
it looks incredible.

449
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:55,450
But, when you get inside,
and you do hit that cherry

450
00:19:55,474 --> 00:19:57,370
and the kirsch sits there,
and then the topping,

451
00:19:57,394 --> 00:19:59,890
it's just a really nice cake. I
could sit and eat the whole lot.

452
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:03,593
He's blushing. He's
actually blushing. I am.

453
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,530
I thought he was joking.

454
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:09,970
I was waiting for him
to go... "Just kidding!"

455
00:20:09,994 --> 00:20:12,993
And I said I wouldn't
cry, and I did cry.

456
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:16,530
They were tears of happiness, though.

457
00:20:16,554 --> 00:20:19,530
I was always expecting Paul to
have a gripe but "forest floor"?

458
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:21,554
He is savage.

459
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:25,953
The bakers were able to
practise their traybakes

460
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:28,873
but, with ingredients
shrouded in gingham,

461
00:20:28,914 --> 00:20:32,033
the cake they'll take on
next is a total mystery.

462
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:34,850
Right, bakers, time for
your Technical Challenge,

463
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:37,170
which today has been
set for you by Prue.

464
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,330
Any words of advice?

465
00:20:38,354 --> 00:20:39,690
Go like the clappers.

466
00:20:39,714 --> 00:20:41,690
You don't have much time.

467
00:20:41,714 --> 00:20:43,890
Wow. That's made
everybody feel good, right?

468
00:20:43,914 --> 00:20:47,050
Off you two go, and carry
on with your extreme ironing,

469
00:20:47,074 --> 00:20:49,113
whatever you're doing.

470
00:20:49,154 --> 00:20:51,050
For your Technical Challenge today,

471
00:20:51,074 --> 00:20:53,330
Prue would like you to make
an impression of a cake.

472
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:55,050
Quite literally.

473
00:20:55,074 --> 00:20:58,233
It's her version of the
Impressionist painter

474
00:20:58,274 --> 00:21:01,993
Claude Monet's favourite
birthday treat, Le Gateau Vert.

475
00:21:02,034 --> 00:21:06,313
You need to make a light,
delicate pistachio, genoise sponge.

476
00:21:06,354 --> 00:21:07,450
Green...

477
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:11,233
Sandwiched with a pistachio
creme au beurre. More green.

478
00:21:11,274 --> 00:21:15,033
And covered in a fondant
coloured green with? Spinach?

479
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,673
Yes. That's a complete fluke.

480
00:21:17,714 --> 00:21:20,233
You have two and a quarter hours.

481
00:21:20,274 --> 00:21:22,587
On your marks... Get set... Bake!

482
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:26,050
Oh, there's actually spinach.
I thought he was joking.

483
00:21:26,074 --> 00:21:29,170
For the Technical Challenge, the
bakers have identical ingredients...

484
00:21:29,194 --> 00:21:31,050
This is absolutely ridiculous.

485
00:21:31,074 --> 00:21:33,074
...and Prue's pared-down recipe.

486
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:35,330
In shock.

487
00:21:35,354 --> 00:21:37,250
I don't even know what I'm making.

488
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:40,113
Prue. Gateau Vert. Claude Monet cake.

489
00:21:40,154 --> 00:21:41,490
What on earth are you thinking?

490
00:21:41,514 --> 00:21:45,170
One of the reasons I really love
this cake is because not only

491
00:21:45,194 --> 00:21:48,170
was it one of Claude Monet's
favourite cakes but he had it

492
00:21:48,194 --> 00:21:49,890
every year on his birthday.

493
00:21:49,914 --> 00:21:51,970
So, how does it get that
beautiful green colour?

494
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:53,850
It's some spinach puree.

495
00:21:53,874 --> 00:21:57,130
The thicker the puree, the more
green you can get into the fondant.

496
00:21:57,154 --> 00:21:58,810
Those layers look amazing.

497
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:01,770
The most usual problem with a
genoise is not getting the volume.

498
00:22:01,794 --> 00:22:05,170
It has to be at least an inch
and a bit, so that you can cut it

499
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:08,450
into three and it'll be light
and delicious. That is beautiful.

500
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:12,162
This is about the basics being
done well and I think at this

501
00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:14,610
early stage, it's a fantastic challenge.

502
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:17,610
The person who keeps their
head will do the best because

503
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:19,610
there's a real danger of panicking

504
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:21,770
when you see how much you've got to do.

505
00:22:21,794 --> 00:22:24,770
If Prue Leith tells you've got
to hurry, I guess that means

506
00:22:24,794 --> 00:22:27,890
you've got to hurry. "Make
the genoise sponge". OK.

507
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:30,890
It's actually my favourite
sponge to make. Fingers crossed.

508
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:33,490
"Place the sugar and
eggs in a large bowl".

509
00:22:33,514 --> 00:22:36,610
You have to whisk it for quite a
high speed, for quite a long time.

510
00:22:36,634 --> 00:22:39,610
All of the lift comes just
from whisking the eggs.

511
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:42,009
So, that's going to be the tricky bit.

512
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:45,810
I'm just going to time it,
how long I'm going to whisk it.

513
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:48,313
I think I'll say about eight minutes.

514
00:22:52,274 --> 00:22:55,530
Fold in pistachios and flour
mixture, butter and lemon zest.

515
00:22:55,554 --> 00:22:57,530
Don't want to knock out any of the air.

516
00:22:57,554 --> 00:23:00,050
What I take now is a little
bit of the genoise and mix it in

517
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:02,690
with the butter cos then
I find it easier to fold it

518
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,214
into the rest of it. I'm just
a bit concerned about this.

519
00:23:06,914 --> 00:23:09,153
Oh, I know what I've done wrong.

520
00:23:09,194 --> 00:23:12,753
It seems I should have done
something with this and I

521
00:23:12,794 --> 00:23:16,794
didn't and I don't know whether
I should have separated the eggs.

522
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:21,250
This is not going to go well.

523
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:24,033
But Karen isn't the
only baker struggling.

524
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:27,137
I should have done the
whites separately, I think.

525
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:30,474
Softly. Gently.

526
00:23:32,434 --> 00:23:35,890
It's a question of whether I
just abandon ship or go back.

527
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,914
I'm going to go with it.

528
00:23:39,994 --> 00:23:41,610
I'm trying again.

529
00:23:41,634 --> 00:23:43,634
So, start from the beginning.

530
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:47,450
It just says "bake".

531
00:23:47,474 --> 00:23:49,890
For... I don't know.
It just says, "bake".

532
00:23:49,914 --> 00:23:52,530
I'm baking for ten minutes
initially, then I'll check on it.

533
00:23:52,554 --> 00:23:54,290
I think it'll be about 15.

534
00:23:54,314 --> 00:23:56,130
Just going for unlucky 13.

535
00:23:56,154 --> 00:23:58,050
I'm sure it'll need at least 20 minutes.

536
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:59,610
Let's come back in 20.

537
00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:01,634
18 minutes.

538
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:05,770
Right, bakers, that's half an hour gone.

539
00:24:05,794 --> 00:24:08,530
So, that'll be like a biscuit.
Sandi, that was magnificent.

540
00:24:08,554 --> 00:24:11,330
Thanks, Noel. I mean, I'm
not actually meant to be here.

541
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:14,330
I just love watching you work.
I know. Thank you so much. OK.

542
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:16,530
So, now I'm going to make the marzipan.

543
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:18,554
"Finely grind the pistachios".

544
00:24:20,274 --> 00:24:22,050
Add the icing sugar and combine.

545
00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:24,170
No-one got time to be making marzipan.

546
00:24:24,194 --> 00:24:25,770
You just go and buy it.

547
00:24:25,794 --> 00:24:27,170
I've made marzipan before.

548
00:24:27,194 --> 00:24:29,130
"Add the egg whites
and pistachio essence.

549
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:31,850
"Knead until smooth, wrap in
clingfilm and leave to rest".

550
00:24:31,874 --> 00:24:34,050
I actually quite liked
Monet, as well, before this.

551
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:37,753
Do you like Monet, though?
I'm not sure who he is.

552
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:40,873
I know Monet but I've
never seen this cake.

553
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:43,793
He did the water lilies. Yeah.

554
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:44,970
Right.

555
00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:48,153
Do you like van Gogh?
You know van Gogh. Yeah.

556
00:24:48,194 --> 00:24:51,433
Done his ear in, didn't
he, you know? One ear.

557
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:54,793
My cake does not look right at all.

558
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:56,490
Oh, it's pretty poor.

559
00:24:56,514 --> 00:24:58,890
I don't want to be scolded
for baking, after this morning

560
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,810
saying I had tough-as-old-boots
sponge, I don't want to do it again.

561
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,834
Oh, my God, his looks so good.

562
00:25:03,874 --> 00:25:05,690
I think I would go with that.

563
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,970
It's come out how I
expected it to come out.

564
00:25:07,994 --> 00:25:11,170
Looking like a cake. You have
totally nailed how Bake Off works.

565
00:25:11,194 --> 00:25:12,690
It hasn't risen.

566
00:25:12,714 --> 00:25:14,714
But anyway...

567
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:18,953
Oh, mate, this is a disaster.

568
00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:20,690
It's sunk.

569
00:25:20,714 --> 00:25:22,130
Nope.

570
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,770
I don't know whether to start again.

571
00:25:23,794 --> 00:25:24,850
I'm making the cake again.

572
00:25:24,874 --> 00:25:27,490
Like, I've got a flat one
and I can always use that

573
00:25:27,514 --> 00:25:29,610
in an emergency but I need another one.

574
00:25:29,634 --> 00:25:31,170
Started my sponge again.

575
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:33,194
Oh, God.

576
00:25:34,154 --> 00:25:35,690
"Make la creme au beurre".

577
00:25:35,714 --> 00:25:37,890
Creme au beurre, is, well,
buttercream, basically.

578
00:25:37,914 --> 00:25:40,410
"Add the spinach and cook until wilted".

579
00:25:40,434 --> 00:25:43,193
The colours in a Gateau Vert...

580
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:46,810
...are all natural. Oh, man.
Oh, look at that. Look at that.

581
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:48,210
That is green, isn't it?

582
00:25:48,234 --> 00:25:50,970
It's quite weird cos we're
making cake but it smells like...

583
00:25:50,994 --> 00:25:52,530
And it smells like... weird...

584
00:25:52,554 --> 00:25:55,050
...smells like health,
doesn't it? ...boiled cabbage.

585
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:57,170
Unless the bakers ensure they squeeze

586
00:25:57,194 --> 00:25:59,330
every drop of water from
their pureed spinach...

587
00:25:59,354 --> 00:26:01,330
Let's see how much it is at the moment.

588
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:03,690
...their creme au beurre
and fondant topping...

589
00:26:03,714 --> 00:26:07,473
...won't have the vivid green
appearance that Monet loved.

590
00:26:07,514 --> 00:26:10,850
OK, yeah, that's the weirdest
thing I've ever done for a cake.

591
00:26:10,874 --> 00:26:12,874
That's a full sack.

592
00:26:14,354 --> 00:26:16,513
Spinach-flavoured creme au beurre.

593
00:26:17,554 --> 00:26:19,250
Conscience is saying
- that's not good.

594
00:26:19,274 --> 00:26:21,930
I hope this one works, cos I
definitely won't have a chance

595
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:23,130
to do this one again.

596
00:26:23,154 --> 00:26:25,530
This time, I've beaten
my egg whites first.

597
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:28,850
As Dan and Terry begin baking
a second genoise sponge...

598
00:26:28,874 --> 00:26:30,410
See how we get on with that.

599
00:26:30,434 --> 00:26:34,410
...the rest of the bakers need to
cut theirs into three equal layers.

600
00:26:34,434 --> 00:26:37,690
How anybody's going to slice that
into three is anybody's guess.

601
00:26:37,714 --> 00:26:40,913
When I'm doing this,
I can see where I'm at.

602
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,854
My knife skills are pretty questionable.

603
00:26:53,994 --> 00:26:56,793
OK, we've got one layer.

604
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:58,834
No, no, no, no, no, no.

605
00:27:00,514 --> 00:27:02,410
That is bad. Very bad.

606
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:05,833
Second time round, I would
have preferred a bigger rise

607
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,874
on the sponge but
- hey.

608
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,250
Starting again.

609
00:27:10,274 --> 00:27:12,690
Everyone must be looking at me
- "Has he lost the plot?"

610
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:13,970
Oh, there's so much to do.

611
00:27:13,994 --> 00:27:16,490
Bakers, you have half an hour remaining!

612
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:19,793
That was the best time call
of the year. Oh, thanks.

613
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:22,610
Actually sorry, second best.
Going to have to take that back.

614
00:27:22,634 --> 00:27:25,250
Wow. I had an acceptance
speech and everything, ready.

615
00:27:25,274 --> 00:27:28,393
That's the most gracious
defeat of the year.

616
00:27:28,434 --> 00:27:30,953
Oh, thanks so much. Sorry, second.

617
00:27:30,994 --> 00:27:32,850
Second place.

618
00:27:32,874 --> 00:27:35,250
I would have liked to have
spent a bit more time prepping it

619
00:27:35,274 --> 00:27:39,024
and folding it all together
but, just, time's not on my side.

620
00:27:39,274 --> 00:27:42,033
"Sandwich together with
the creme au beurre".

621
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:44,673
So, you're looking
for that silky texture.

622
00:27:44,714 --> 00:27:46,714
That is absolute liquid.

623
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,410
That's very thin towards the end.

624
00:27:51,434 --> 00:27:54,250
Cover the top and the sides
of the sponge with marzipan.

625
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:55,890
I made marzipan.

626
00:27:55,914 --> 00:27:58,873
Oh, come on. Please
just do it and be cooked.

627
00:27:58,914 --> 00:28:01,890
Keen to get this excess off
cos it's weighing it down.

628
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,970
Quite pleased with
the marzipan, actually.

629
00:28:03,994 --> 00:28:06,033
It's looking all right.

630
00:28:08,234 --> 00:28:10,873
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

631
00:28:10,914 --> 00:28:13,313
Right, this is coming out.

632
00:28:13,354 --> 00:28:15,410
I don't think it's any
better than the other one.

633
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:16,890
Right, what's next?

634
00:28:16,914 --> 00:28:18,890
"Coat the cake with the icing".

635
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:21,033
It looks pretty green, isn't it?

636
00:28:22,394 --> 00:28:24,970
I'm just choosing the best bits
from, like, the sponges I've made.

637
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,994
We'll cheat a bit.

638
00:28:28,354 --> 00:28:30,354
Oh, God. Such a mess.

639
00:28:32,434 --> 00:28:34,250
Starting to come together a bit now.

640
00:28:34,274 --> 00:28:35,490
Finally.

641
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:39,113
Says, "Elegantly decorate
with chopped pistachios

642
00:28:39,154 --> 00:28:41,154
"and edible flowers".

643
00:28:46,954 --> 00:28:49,050
Can't believe I've managed
to do this, to be honest.

644
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:51,673
Bakers, your time is up.

645
00:28:52,954 --> 00:28:54,610
I'm walking away.

646
00:28:54,634 --> 00:28:57,753
It's a little ring of beauty, isn't it?

647
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:00,050
It looks like something.

648
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:03,690
Please place your Gateau Vert
behind your photograph on the table.

649
00:29:03,714 --> 00:29:07,673
Paul and Prue are expecting
Gateau Vert with three even layers

650
00:29:07,714 --> 00:29:10,570
of pistachio genoise
sponge, pistachio marzipan,

651
00:29:10,594 --> 00:29:13,210
and spinach-coloured
fondant and creme au beurre.

652
00:29:13,234 --> 00:29:14,970
And they won't know whose is whose.

653
00:29:14,994 --> 00:29:17,610
Right, shall we start with
this one? Lovely colour.

654
00:29:17,634 --> 00:29:19,759
It's got a nice colour, hasn't it?

655
00:29:20,714 --> 00:29:23,193
That looks like the proper layers.

656
00:29:25,074 --> 00:29:27,610
That's a nice cake. Delicious,
isn't it? The creme au beurre

657
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:30,450
and the genoise are fantastic.
The pistachio comes through.

658
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:32,410
Now, the colour's all wrong on this.

659
00:29:32,434 --> 00:29:34,434
The layers aren't too bad.

660
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,450
Nice flavour. Moving on.

661
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:39,930
Now, it's lost all the
height, hasn't it? Yeah.

662
00:29:39,954 --> 00:29:41,954
Looks quite wet as well.

663
00:29:43,154 --> 00:29:44,530
It's a bit puddingy, to be honest.

664
00:29:44,554 --> 00:29:46,793
OK, moving on. Nice colour.

665
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:48,834
It is.

666
00:29:49,074 --> 00:29:51,210
That is very nice. It does taste good.

667
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:52,930
It's quite a rounded cake.

668
00:29:52,954 --> 00:29:56,353
How have they achieved that?
The layers aren't too bad.

669
00:29:59,354 --> 00:30:02,330
Flavour's OK. The filling's
good and the sponge is all right.

670
00:30:02,354 --> 00:30:05,410
Now, this one looks quite nice
when you initially look at it.

671
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:06,690
The layers are equal.

672
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:08,714
The flavour's all right...

673
00:30:09,634 --> 00:30:11,810
You seem to have lost a
couple of the layers here.

674
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:14,897
The creme au beurre, seem
to have lost some of it.

675
00:30:15,554 --> 00:30:19,179
It's quite stodgy, isn't it?
I think it's a bit overcooked.

676
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:22,970
OK. I worry about this one.
First of all, it's very thin.

677
00:30:22,994 --> 00:30:25,770
They've knocked all the air out
the genoise and the colour's wrong.

678
00:30:25,794 --> 00:30:27,690
Where are the layers?

679
00:30:27,714 --> 00:30:29,290
Very rubbery,

680
00:30:29,314 --> 00:30:31,050
undercooked cake.

681
00:30:31,074 --> 00:30:32,690
That's sad.

682
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:34,050
I quite like the look of this.

683
00:30:34,074 --> 00:30:35,770
I do, too. It's very pretty.

684
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:37,794
The cake looks very good.

685
00:30:38,634 --> 00:30:41,713
Tastes of pistachio.
Really beautiful sponge.

686
00:30:41,754 --> 00:30:43,170
I quite like this one as well.

687
00:30:43,194 --> 00:30:45,130
It's got a bit of height to it.

688
00:30:45,154 --> 00:30:47,953
That's a lot of icing on there.

689
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:52,034
The cake is lovely.

690
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:55,330
Right, moving on to the last one.
This looks bone-dry on the side,

691
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,770
with a flooding of fondant
on the top. It is. And it's...

692
00:30:57,794 --> 00:31:01,233
It's a bit of a mess.
...over-decorated. Yeah, it is.

693
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:04,212
The sponge is quite light.
Though not very high.

694
00:31:05,634 --> 00:31:09,134
Prue and Paul will now rank
the cakes from worst to best.

695
00:31:10,074 --> 00:31:12,233
In 11th place, we have this one.

696
00:31:12,274 --> 00:31:13,530
Karen.

697
00:31:13,554 --> 00:31:15,970
You know what's the matter
with it, it wasn't cooked.

698
00:31:15,994 --> 00:31:17,970
In tenth is this one.

699
00:31:17,994 --> 00:31:19,970
Quite stodgy inside, actually.

700
00:31:19,994 --> 00:31:21,850
In ninth place, it's Antony.

701
00:31:21,874 --> 00:31:23,290
Terry is eighth.

702
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:24,610
Seventh is Luke.

703
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:25,690
Manon is sixth.

704
00:31:25,714 --> 00:31:27,130
Briony fifth.

705
00:31:27,154 --> 00:31:28,570
And Kim-Joy is fourth.

706
00:31:28,594 --> 00:31:30,913
In third place we have this one.

707
00:31:30,954 --> 00:31:33,713
Dan, it looks lovely
and it tasted great.

708
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:35,754
So, in second spot...

709
00:31:36,994 --> 00:31:40,393
...is this one. Whose is
this? Pretty good, Rahul.

710
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:41,970
Nice cake. Well done.

711
00:31:41,994 --> 00:31:45,193
Which means, number one, we have Jon.

712
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:48,690
Yes. There's nothing to say about
this, it's just a lovely cake.

713
00:31:48,714 --> 00:31:50,714
Thank you. Cheers.

714
00:31:51,634 --> 00:31:54,490
That was amazing. Absolutely
spot on. That is up there.

715
00:31:54,514 --> 00:31:57,690
Birth of the kids, wedding
day, and that. That's there.

716
00:31:57,714 --> 00:31:59,690
Well done, mate. Oh, yeah, definitely.

717
00:31:59,714 --> 00:32:00,810
Yeah, it's OK.

718
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:03,833
I'm just quite scared
about what's coming next.

719
00:32:03,874 --> 00:32:08,633
It was technical and it
was a challenge. So... yes.

720
00:32:08,674 --> 00:32:11,690
What I always do, when I have
a disappointment, is sort of

721
00:32:11,714 --> 00:32:14,513
crash down like this and, normally,

722
00:32:14,554 --> 00:32:16,793
within a short space of time,

723
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,913
I bounce straight back again.

724
00:32:18,954 --> 00:32:21,433
So, watch this space for tomorrow.

725
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:24,029
Yeah.

726
00:32:24,498 --> 00:32:27,634
Just the showstopper challenge
remains before we discover who will be

727
00:32:27,658 --> 00:32:31,817
our second Star Baker and who'll
be leaving the Bake Off tent.

728
00:32:31,858 --> 00:32:34,234
Coming into the Showstopper
I think Dan's done well.

729
00:32:34,258 --> 00:32:37,194
First handshake. He is in line
for Star Baker, along with Jon.

730
00:32:37,218 --> 00:32:39,714
Rahul has been
consistently near the top.

731
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:41,834
Some people need to fight
to stay in the Bake Off

732
00:32:41,858 --> 00:32:44,314
and I would include Manon
in there. This is shocking.

733
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:47,097
Terry has to be in
there as well, and Karen.

734
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:49,434
Her gateau vert was a complete disaster.

735
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:51,474
And likewise, Luke struggled
in the Signature and

736
00:32:51,498 --> 00:32:53,514
didn't do particularly well
either in the Technical.

737
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,634
And I would include Ruby in that.

738
00:32:54,658 --> 00:32:57,434
You said her traybake looked
like a forest floor. It did.

739
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,554
The Showstopper today
involves chocolate.

740
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:02,034
And it's going to be
extremely hot today.

741
00:33:02,058 --> 00:33:05,394
It's going to be a very
challenging last bake for somebody.

742
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:08,177
Too hot for a Goth. I'll probably melt.

743
00:33:17,218 --> 00:33:20,114
Hello, bakers, time for
your Showstopper Challenge.

744
00:33:20,138 --> 00:33:23,754
Paul and Prue would love you
to make a chocolate collar cake.

745
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:26,274
The cake can be any
flavour that you like

746
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:28,697
but it must be at least two tiers,

747
00:33:28,738 --> 00:33:31,354
encased in chocolate that wraps
all the way around the cake,

748
00:33:31,378 --> 00:33:33,234
hence the name chocolate collar.

749
00:33:33,258 --> 00:33:37,777
The design must be eye-catching and,
of course, the cake must be delish.

750
00:33:37,818 --> 00:33:39,394
You have four hours.

751
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:40,914
On your marks... get set...

752
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:42,938
...bake.

753
00:33:43,578 --> 00:33:46,737
Good Lord, I am roasting.

754
00:33:46,778 --> 00:33:49,466
It's much hotter than
chocolate likes to be.

755
00:33:49,498 --> 00:33:52,314
It's one thing to make a cake
but unless you're a chocolatier,

756
00:33:52,338 --> 00:33:55,497
you are not likely to
make a chocolate collar.

757
00:33:55,538 --> 00:33:58,074
Now, the chocolate collar itself
is all about the tempering of

758
00:33:58,098 --> 00:34:00,634
the chocolate, setting it on
acetate and then placing it around

759
00:34:00,658 --> 00:34:03,234
the cake of their choice. You
have to be part architect on this.

760
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:06,674
Nobody in their right mind
would be dealing with chocolate

761
00:34:06,698 --> 00:34:07,914
on a day like today,

762
00:34:07,938 --> 00:34:10,754
but this is Bake Off and
they're going to have to.

763
00:34:10,778 --> 00:34:13,114
Hello, Jon, you all right?
How are you all, all right?

764
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:14,714
Well, that looks like pineapple cake.

765
00:34:14,738 --> 00:34:15,914
I'm doing a pina colada cake

766
00:34:15,938 --> 00:34:19,977
cos I like pina colada and
getting caught in the rain.

767
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:22,954
Jon's pineapple sponge with
coconut buttercream will be wrapped

768
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:26,074
in a collar, which should bring
his tropical Showstopper together.

769
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:28,474
My collar is a Hawaiian
shirt going round the outside.

770
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:30,194
I can't think how you
thought of it, Jon!

771
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:31,714
Well, where would that come from?

772
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:34,994
Out of the top of my head or
out of my wardrobe. Either one.

773
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:38,617
Antony has also raided the
wardrobe for inspiration.

774
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:42,337
The collar is a sari, which
is worn by most Indian women.

775
00:34:42,378 --> 00:34:45,017
Let's hope I get it down to the tee.

776
00:34:45,058 --> 00:34:47,994
His sari collar will wrap
pistachio and rose water sponge

777
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:49,674
with saffron buttercream.

778
00:34:49,698 --> 00:34:52,897
The flavours are my
mum's favourite flavours,

779
00:34:52,938 --> 00:34:54,874
so it is a dedication to her.

780
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:58,417
My mum doesn't like chocolate,
so my sponge is orange

781
00:34:58,458 --> 00:34:59,674
and the cream is chocolate.

782
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:02,097
Ruby's future in the Bake Off rests on

783
00:35:02,138 --> 00:35:04,594
her mum's favourite
orange liqueur sponge...

784
00:35:04,618 --> 00:35:05,874
Just a splash.

785
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:09,154
...sandwiched with a chocolate
mascarpone and hazelnut cream,

786
00:35:09,178 --> 00:35:12,354
all wrapped in a collar straight
from the walls of an art gallery.

787
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:15,777
My collar is inspired
by Jackson Pollock.

788
00:35:15,818 --> 00:35:18,657
Some might just say it's a mess.

789
00:35:18,698 --> 00:35:22,897
Some might say that's very strategic
of me, to have a messy collar.

790
00:35:22,938 --> 00:35:26,074
The judges have demanded the
bakers wrap collars around at least

791
00:35:26,098 --> 00:35:28,074
two tiers of delicious sponge.

792
00:35:28,098 --> 00:35:31,154
It's going to be chocolate
cake, salted caramel cake,

793
00:35:31,178 --> 00:35:33,794
chocolate cake, and there'll
be three tiers of that.

794
00:35:33,818 --> 00:35:36,034
And while some are
going above and beyond,

795
00:35:36,058 --> 00:35:38,058
hoping to avoid an early exit...

796
00:35:39,898 --> 00:35:41,977
...Terry is aiming even higher.

797
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:45,657
My chocolate collar cake is
going to be the Eiffel Tower.

798
00:35:45,698 --> 00:35:49,257
Two tiers of sponge and then
a lace chocolate topping.

799
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:51,577
That's quite brave. Yeah.

800
00:35:51,618 --> 00:35:53,914
Have you practised in heat?
I've practised in heat.

801
00:35:53,938 --> 00:35:56,194
I've had my central heating
whacked up to 80 degrees,

802
00:35:56,218 --> 00:35:57,834
working in the kitchen with the oven on.

803
00:35:57,858 --> 00:36:00,737
I hate to see my bill
when it comes through!

804
00:36:00,778 --> 00:36:03,474
Terry's tower will rest on white
chocolate sponge filled with

805
00:36:03,498 --> 00:36:06,194
champagne buttercream and
topped with strawberries.

806
00:36:06,218 --> 00:36:08,674
It's a very summery
sort of flavoured sponge,

807
00:36:08,698 --> 00:36:12,136
and strawberries, champagne, Paris
- you can't go wrong.

808
00:36:17,018 --> 00:36:19,018
All right, Tez.

809
00:36:21,858 --> 00:36:24,497
Oh, perfect Paris, Marie Antoinette.

810
00:36:25,738 --> 00:36:26,994
Exactly. All right? Yeah.

811
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,274
Made a big sacrifice.

812
00:36:28,298 --> 00:36:29,474
You better win.

813
00:36:29,498 --> 00:36:31,914
This is what I do for
you kids, all right?

814
00:36:31,938 --> 00:36:34,097
So make it count in the baking.

815
00:36:34,138 --> 00:36:36,114
That is quite a costume.

816
00:36:36,138 --> 00:36:37,954
I'm going in the oven.

817
00:36:37,978 --> 00:36:43,057
The bakers now face an epic test
of their ability to multitask.

818
00:36:43,098 --> 00:36:45,217
Bake, angels, bake.

819
00:36:45,258 --> 00:36:47,897
With several different-sized sponges...

820
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:51,154
So, I'm going to put this little
one here so I can keep an eye.

821
00:36:51,178 --> 00:36:53,954
...they'll have to keep track
of multiple baking times...

822
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,794
Six inches will take about 45 minutes.

823
00:36:55,818 --> 00:36:57,954
Eight inches will
take about an hour.

824
00:36:57,978 --> 00:37:00,954
...whilst at the same time prepare
their show-stopping fillings

825
00:37:00,978 --> 00:37:03,017
and decorations.

826
00:37:03,058 --> 00:37:05,354
I'm trying to do a
chocolate sail, if possible.

827
00:37:05,378 --> 00:37:07,354
So that's why I'm making
two instead of one.

828
00:37:07,378 --> 00:37:11,314
If one fails, then at least I have
something to put it on the top.

829
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:14,737
Rahul's sail will join
chocolate shards and an ornate

830
00:37:14,778 --> 00:37:18,034
Bengali-inspired collar,
wrapping triple-layered chocolate

831
00:37:18,058 --> 00:37:21,777
and orange sponges with a
white chocolate Swiss meringue.

832
00:37:21,818 --> 00:37:23,194
You're doing creme au beurre,

833
00:37:23,218 --> 00:37:25,074
Swiss meringue
buttercream, your collars...

834
00:37:25,098 --> 00:37:27,114
I'm doing a lot... two
different types of sponges.

835
00:37:27,138 --> 00:37:29,554
I'm literally running around
like a headless chicken now.

836
00:37:29,578 --> 00:37:32,154
So I'm just going to do it a
little bit early and then put it

837
00:37:32,178 --> 00:37:33,914
in the fridge for a bit
just to set it a bit.

838
00:37:33,938 --> 00:37:36,394
But I quite like Swiss
meringue buttercream because

839
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:39,314
it's quite good to do the coating,
and creme au beurre is quite,

840
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:42,914
like, similar, so it's very
good to stack things up together.

841
00:37:42,938 --> 00:37:44,634
So that's why I'm
doing two buttercreams.

842
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:46,834
But if I run out of time I
might have no creme au beurre,

843
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:48,874
just do everything with
Swiss meringue buttercream.

844
00:37:48,898 --> 00:37:50,114
Very succinctly put.

845
00:37:50,138 --> 00:37:53,951
Thank you very much indeed.
Sorry. Look forward to it. Cheers.

846
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:56,034
Kim-Joy's Showstopper...

847
00:37:56,058 --> 00:37:57,314
Brr.

848
00:37:57,338 --> 00:37:58,674
...is a little more focused.

849
00:37:58,698 --> 00:38:00,914
They're just, like,
little cat silhouettes,

850
00:38:00,938 --> 00:38:02,954
cos I thought it'd
look kind of fun, like,

851
00:38:02,978 --> 00:38:04,754
with them playing all around it.

852
00:38:04,778 --> 00:38:08,274
Her cats will chase a ribbon
around a white chocolate collar that

853
00:38:08,298 --> 00:38:11,954
surrounds genoise sponge filled
with yuzu curd and topped with

854
00:38:11,978 --> 00:38:14,057
even more cats made with fondant.

855
00:38:14,098 --> 00:38:16,634
I think I get a lot of
influences from Japan.

856
00:38:16,658 --> 00:38:21,177
Also kind of makes sense because,
like, cats wear collars, don't they?

857
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:23,593
So let's hope it's not a cat-astrophe.

858
00:38:24,778 --> 00:38:27,257
After a disappointing first day,

859
00:38:27,298 --> 00:38:30,657
a catastrophic Showstopper
isn't an option for Manon.

860
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:34,794
So when I was an au pair, I
used to look after a little girl

861
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:37,354
that I used to love
dressing up as a princess,

862
00:38:37,378 --> 00:38:39,034
so this cake is for her.

863
00:38:39,058 --> 00:38:42,434
She's aiming for a fairy-tale
ending to Cake Week with a fondant

864
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:45,874
princess and prince for an
almond castle cake wrapped in

865
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:49,273
a crown of white chocolate
and dark chocolate ramparts.

866
00:38:49,298 --> 00:38:51,737
Sandi's had an accident.

867
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:54,857
Sandi, get up! It's OK.

868
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:56,714
That's fantastic.

869
00:38:56,738 --> 00:38:57,954
Is that me and Sandi?

870
00:38:57,978 --> 00:39:00,954
Yeah, well, that's you fast
asleep and that's Sandi,

871
00:39:00,978 --> 00:39:02,674
she's off because you're late.

872
00:39:02,698 --> 00:39:04,954
I think... I don't
think you can say that.

873
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:08,097
You've been looking at the wrong script.

874
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,754
90 minutes remaining.

875
00:39:09,778 --> 00:39:11,994
I think it needs a few more minutes.

876
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:14,354
I don't want to bother
them for too long.

877
00:39:14,378 --> 00:39:18,128
It doesn't look that bad. It
actually... I think it's cooked.

878
00:39:18,178 --> 00:39:20,178
Woof.

879
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,074
They've risen a lot better
than the one at home.

880
00:39:23,098 --> 00:39:26,017
They'll need about
another ten minutes or so.

881
00:39:26,058 --> 00:39:29,808
Just going to get these bad
boys out and onto a cooling rack.

882
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,738
Oh, no.

883
00:39:40,218 --> 00:39:42,114
Yeah, that's just raw.

884
00:39:42,138 --> 00:39:45,154
Briony needs to bake three
tiers of chocolate fudge

885
00:39:45,178 --> 00:39:48,057
and salted caramel
cake and fill them with

886
00:39:48,098 --> 00:39:49,954
salted caramel vodka buttercream,

887
00:39:49,978 --> 00:39:52,594
and she plans to wrap them
in a dark chocolate collar

888
00:39:52,618 --> 00:39:54,354
with peanut butter brushstrokes.

889
00:39:54,378 --> 00:39:57,554
I can't serve them raw cake.
That's just not happening.

890
00:39:57,578 --> 00:39:59,354
I'll just have to remake it.

891
00:39:59,378 --> 00:40:02,128
Where's my recipe gone?
Right, take a breath.

892
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:04,818
Take a breath.

893
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:06,434
It's looking OK. That one is,

894
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:09,257
but the other one is
looking very dubious.

895
00:40:09,298 --> 00:40:11,594
Before they can wrap a
collar around their cakes...

896
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,857
They feel nice and bouncy.

897
00:40:13,898 --> 00:40:17,874
...the bakers will need to cover the
rough edges of their cooled sponges.

898
00:40:17,898 --> 00:40:19,874
Oh, I'm just trying to
make the creme au beurre.

899
00:40:19,898 --> 00:40:21,898
I have a lot going on, as usual.

900
00:40:23,058 --> 00:40:25,634
All right, we're now tipping
on some really good saffron.

901
00:40:25,658 --> 00:40:27,074
Smells delicious.

902
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:29,874
But while most bakers are making
a flavoured buttercream for

903
00:40:29,898 --> 00:40:34,337
their crumb coat, Luke has
chosen a more luxurious approach.

904
00:40:34,378 --> 00:40:36,714
Just whipping the double
cream together now.

905
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:39,034
I'm doing the last bit by
hand cos it can all of a sudden

906
00:40:39,058 --> 00:40:40,074
just over-whip.

907
00:40:40,098 --> 00:40:43,314
He's making a whipped double cream
and white chocolate crumb coat

908
00:40:43,338 --> 00:40:46,154
for a triple-tiered raspberry
and white chocolate cake

909
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:48,777
which he'll wrap in an Art Deco collar.

910
00:40:48,818 --> 00:40:50,594
I've now folded in the white chocolate.

911
00:40:50,618 --> 00:40:53,194
It needs to cool a bit,
cos in this temperature

912
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:55,406
it's just going to not get on well.

913
00:40:59,618 --> 00:41:02,297
Bakers, you have one
hour. Just one hour.

914
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:08,573
They're still warm. In an ideal
world, you would never do this.

915
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:10,554
He is a biggie.

916
00:41:10,578 --> 00:41:13,234
Going to start with the smallest
tier and then work my way up,

917
00:41:13,258 --> 00:41:15,434
cos obviously the other
ones are still in the oven.

918
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:17,554
I'm just concerned that
the buttercream is melting

919
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:19,314
as it goes on the cake.

920
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:21,377
It's quite runny.!

921
00:41:23,378 --> 00:41:25,777
My buttercream is just wilting.

922
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:27,818
Trying to get this neater.

923
00:41:30,138 --> 00:41:32,074
Oh, it's just melting like crazy.

924
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:33,434
This is awful.

925
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,458
Time is running away fast.

926
00:41:36,658 --> 00:41:41,457
But avoiding molten crumb
coats is just the first battle

927
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:43,937
in the bakers' war against the heat.

928
00:41:43,978 --> 00:41:45,978
Absolute nightmare.

929
00:41:46,898 --> 00:41:49,217
Oh, Lordy, Lordy, it's hot.

930
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:52,034
Tempering the chocolate is going to
be the most difficult bit in terms

931
00:41:52,058 --> 00:41:53,394
of the conditions that we're in.

932
00:41:53,418 --> 00:41:55,634
Yeah, so you basically
want to heat it up

933
00:41:55,658 --> 00:41:58,154
and then almost cool it back
down. There's more to it than that,

934
00:41:58,178 --> 00:42:00,554
I'm not saying I know everything
about chocolate tempering.

935
00:42:00,578 --> 00:42:02,514
Bring it up to 38 degrees and then...

936
00:42:02,538 --> 00:42:06,377
No, bring it up to 43 degrees
and then bring it down...

937
00:42:06,418 --> 00:42:09,057
...to 40... 30, I think.

938
00:42:09,098 --> 00:42:12,034
Basically, chocolate has
different types of crystals in it.

939
00:42:12,058 --> 00:42:14,394
So what you do is when you
heat the chocolate, they kind of

940
00:42:14,418 --> 00:42:17,754
break down all the crystals,
and then you cool it quickly

941
00:42:17,778 --> 00:42:20,377
so that some crystals
start forming again.

942
00:42:20,418 --> 00:42:21,674
It sounds a bit funny, doesn't it?

943
00:42:21,698 --> 00:42:24,114
Basically, when you get your
chocolates in the chocolate shop

944
00:42:24,138 --> 00:42:27,114
and they've got a lovely gloss on
them, that's tempered chocolate.

945
00:42:27,138 --> 00:42:29,994
Karen's tempering dark
chocolate to wrap two tiers of

946
00:42:30,018 --> 00:42:33,314
rich chocolate cake filled with
strawberry jam and soaked in

947
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:35,537
a home-made strawberry liqueur.

948
00:42:35,578 --> 00:42:38,074
But staying in the
competition may depend on her

949

successfully decorating her
collar with hand-piped lyrics

950
00:42:41,818 --> 00:42:43,314

955
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,634
No, it's about a young lady
that meets a young suitor

Dan's collar decoration will
be a little less freehand.

959
00:43:05,218 --> 00:43:07,194
I've done it twice in practice.

960
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:08,514
I don't do things timed.

961
00:43:08,538 --> 00:43:11,034
I can't get four hours of
undisturbed time in my house,

962
00:43:11,058 --> 00:43:13,074
so I don't actually do
it against the clock.

963
00:43:13,098 --> 00:43:17,217
Dan still needs to cover his
red-coloured white chocolate stripes

964

in dark chocolate for a
collar to surround chocolate

and raspberry cakes with raspberry
Italian meringue buttercream.

966
00:43:25,378 --> 00:43:27,914
Hopefully there'll be enough
of a pattern in that one,

967

00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:34,114
30 minutes left.

971
00:43:34,138 --> 00:43:36,634
I'm just going to have
to chill this fast.

972
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:38,114
Wow. I'm happy with this one.

973
00:43:38,138 --> 00:43:42,457
It's way too hot to be cutting it
but don't have time to mess around.

974
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:44,554

So I'm going to put the
white chocolate in between,

978
00:43:54,778 --> 00:43:57,394
but obviously need to be quite
careful with the temperatures.

979

There's something about a sari

Yay!

982

987
00:44:19,778 --> 00:44:22,977

I have just got to

Just going to put this as well...

992
00:44:31,498 --> 00:44:33,714
You need to just gauge it,
because if you leave it too long

993
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:34,954
it's not flexible.

994
00:44:34,978 --> 00:44:38,154
You've only got a few minutes,
really, in which to get it on.

995
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:41,617
Oh, it's way too stiff now.

996
00:44:41,658 --> 00:44:44,337
I wussed out. Solidly wussed out there.

997
00:44:47,298 --> 00:44:50,857

998

Just going to go with it.

1002

It just won't go on. It's just wet.

1005

1037

I think you've done an amazing
job and the stripes are beautiful.

Well, that's beautiful.

It's delicious.

The Swiss meringue with the
raspberries is bringing a tartness.

Married with the chocolate and the
collar, that's mighty impressive.

Well done, Dan. Thank you.

The sponge is quite firm.

1047
00:47:45,114 --> 00:47:47,114
It is slightly too dry.

1048
00:47:48,594 --> 00:47:51,393

There is no pistachio to
blend with the saffron.

1052
00:48:02,434 --> 00:48:06,059
It's just saffron in my mouth,
so it tastes almost savoury.

1053
00:48:08,114 --> 00:48:09,890
I think it looks amazing.
I love the piping.

1054
00:48:09,914 --> 00:48:12,010
The sheen you've got on
the chocolate is very good.

1055
00:48:12,034 --> 00:48:14,034
The collar's very neat.

1056
00:48:16,434 --> 00:48:18,873
That is really lovely chocolate cake.

1057
00:48:18,914 --> 00:48:21,890
It melts in the mouth, which
is perfect. Fair play to you.

1058
00:48:21,914 --> 00:48:23,890
That's a great job. Well,
that's great to hear.

1059
00:48:23,914 --> 00:48:26,164
Thank you so much. I can't fault it.

1060
00:48:32,594 --> 00:48:35,130
It's simple and highly effective.
You've got a great sheen

1061
00:48:35,154 --> 00:48:37,842
on that chocolate. I
think it looks amazing.

1062
00:48:40,354 --> 00:48:43,330
It is tender. The pineapple
has made it very moist.

1063
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:46,010
I think the sponge is
fantastically baked, and the coconut

1064
00:48:46,034 --> 00:48:47,410
really works with it as well.

1065
00:48:47,434 --> 00:48:50,633
And I really love
your design. Very good.

1066
00:48:50,674 --> 00:48:53,112
Well done. Thank you very much. Cheers.

1067

Cream in this sort of heat... Yeah.

1071
00:49:07,274 --> 00:49:10,890
...white chocolate in this sort of
heat. Let's see what it tastes like.

1072
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,914
It might taste wonderful.

1073
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:21,033
The flavour is delicious
but the cake is tough.

1074
00:49:21,074 --> 00:49:24,010
especially with the white
chocolate. Your sponge isn't good.

1075
00:49:24,034 --> 00:49:26,034
Is it not good?

1076
00:49:32,354 --> 00:49:34,354
It's a nice-looking sponge.

1077
00:49:37,994 --> 00:49:40,490
What's going on? Why
wasn't this taken off?

1078
00:49:40,514 --> 00:49:42,490
Basically, my chocolate didn't set.

1079
00:49:42,514 --> 00:49:44,370
Well, it's set now.

1080
00:49:44,394 --> 00:49:47,690
And, now it's off, this
chocolate is beautifully tempered

1081
00:49:47,714 --> 00:49:49,650
and absolutely shining.

1082
00:49:49,674 --> 00:49:51,674
OK.

1083
00:49:52,714 --> 00:49:55,890
That's a very nice sponge. I
think it's a very, very nice cake.

1084
00:49:55,914 --> 00:49:57,770
Very smart. Thank you.

1085
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:00,544
It's a shame you didn't
take the acetate off!

1086
00:50:06,274 --> 00:50:07,490
Well, I have to say,

1087
00:50:07,514 --> 00:50:10,810
I think the way you've done
the ironwork is brilliant.

1088
00:50:10,834 --> 00:50:14,210
It may only be half the Eiffel
Tower but everybody knows what it is.

1089
00:50:14,234 --> 00:50:16,234
Yes. OK.

1090
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:23,490
What I'm mostly getting is the
sweetness of the buttercream,

1091
00:50:23,514 --> 00:50:25,514
and the cake is a bit boring.

1092
00:50:28,394 --> 00:50:30,010
Bad luck, Terry. No problem.

1093
00:50:30,034 --> 00:50:32,097
Thank you, Terry. You're welcome.

1094
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:39,610
We only asked you for two tiers...

1095
00:50:39,634 --> 00:50:42,570
Yes. I know. I know... so you did
get the collar around two. Yes.

1096
00:50:42,594 --> 00:50:44,907
We'll have a look at your sponge now.

1097
00:50:47,874 --> 00:50:50,473
Oh, look at that.
That is very beautiful.

1098
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,514
Thank you.

1099
00:50:54,834 --> 00:50:56,050
Your sponge is overbaked.

1100
00:50:56,074 --> 00:50:58,610
You can see by the colour on
the outside how dark that is,

1101
00:50:58,634 --> 00:51:00,130
and the others are like rubber.

1102
00:51:00,154 --> 00:51:03,650
I agree with you that the
textures of the cake are not right

1103
00:51:03,674 --> 00:51:06,799
but I think the flavours
are lovely. OK. Thank you.

1104
00:51:10,954 --> 00:51:13,393
Wow. It's a wonderful construction.

1105
00:51:13,434 --> 00:51:16,210
I'm really impressed that you
managed to keep it together

1106
00:51:16,234 --> 00:51:17,730
and it hasn't all fallen down.

1107
00:51:17,754 --> 00:51:19,610
Based on the weather today and the heat,

1108
00:51:19,634 --> 00:51:21,610
I think you've done an unbelievable job.

1109
00:51:21,634 --> 00:51:24,890
Not just to do two collars
but to do this little pipework

1110
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:28,250
across the top as well and then
do the shards on top of that.

1111
00:51:28,274 --> 00:51:30,593
I'm impressed, Rahul. Thank you.

1112
00:51:32,354 --> 00:51:34,873
You can hear that crack. It's beautiful.

1113
00:51:36,274 --> 00:51:38,274
Very bold, strong colours.

1114
00:51:42,354 --> 00:51:44,354
Fantastic.

1115
00:51:50,114 --> 00:51:52,677
Rahul, can you come
here a minute, please?

1116
00:51:59,794 --> 00:52:02,810
I've never given a handshake
for a Showstopper before.

1117
00:52:02,834 --> 00:52:04,090
Thank you.

1118
00:52:04,114 --> 00:52:06,353
That is a fantastic cake.

1119
00:52:06,394 --> 00:52:09,513
Well done, Rahul. Well done, Rahul.

1120
00:52:18,794 --> 00:52:22,113
It really is very elegant
and very restrained.

1121
00:52:22,154 --> 00:52:24,154
Thank you. It's classy.

1122
00:52:25,754 --> 00:52:29,050
I can just tell by the way you're
cutting it that the sponge is

1123
00:52:29,074 --> 00:52:31,074
beautifully cooked.

1124
00:52:35,114 --> 00:52:38,833
I can sit here eating
this for an hour or so.

1125
00:52:38,874 --> 00:52:41,033
It's just delicious.

1126
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,074
Thank you. Come here, Ruby.

1127
00:52:44,474 --> 00:52:46,593
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1128
00:52:55,234 --> 00:52:59,353
That cake, that sponge,
the flavour in there...

1129
00:52:59,394 --> 00:53:01,410
The hazelnut and the chocolate...

1130
00:53:01,434 --> 00:53:04,113
Every element comes through perfectly.

1131
00:53:04,154 --> 00:53:05,690
The collar is so elegant.

1132
00:53:05,714 --> 00:53:08,090
The brittle on the
top... That's a fine cake.

1133
00:53:08,114 --> 00:53:10,593
Oh, thank you. Oh, I'm made up.

1134
00:53:13,474 --> 00:53:15,050
When Prue said that she could sit there

1135
00:53:15,074 --> 00:53:16,370
and eat my cake all day long...

1136
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:18,050
...buzzing.

1137
00:53:18,074 --> 00:53:20,913
I'm really happy with Paul's handshake.

1138
00:53:20,954 --> 00:53:22,770
Would never take that back now.

1139
00:53:22,794 --> 00:53:25,607
Like, I'm pleased that
one's in the bag but...

1140
00:53:26,154 --> 00:53:27,690
...I wanted to impress Prue.

1141
00:53:27,714 --> 00:53:30,913
Good job. Yay. Amazing.

1142
00:53:30,954 --> 00:53:33,690
When Paul invited me to the table,
I just first thought that maybe

1143
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:36,570
I have left something stupid
inside the cake, you know, like,

1144
00:53:36,594 --> 00:53:38,450
I was poking it with a cocktail stick.

1145
00:53:38,474 --> 00:53:41,330
Maybe I left a cocktail stick
inside, so he wanted to show me.

1146
00:53:41,354 --> 00:53:43,673
Yeah, that was very surreal.

1147
00:53:43,714 --> 00:53:45,873
There weren't any surprises. No.

1148
00:53:45,914 --> 00:53:48,970
I'm surprised they even wanted
to judge it, to be honest.

1149
00:53:48,994 --> 00:53:50,690
You know it's only a cake.

1150
00:53:50,714 --> 00:53:53,490
The logical side of you
knows it's only a cake and,

1151
00:53:53,514 --> 00:53:56,330
at the end of the day, it's
not the end of the world.

1152
00:53:56,354 --> 00:53:58,793
It weren't as bad as mine, at least.

1153
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:00,834
Look at it that way.

1154
00:54:01,514 --> 00:54:07,009
At least you had a collar on it!

1155
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,866
Prue and Paul must now decide
who will be our second Star Baker

1156
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:13,026
and who will have to
leave the Bake Off tent.

1157
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,666
It was an extraordinary day,

1158
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:16,666
because we went in very clear about

1159
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:20,146
the people who were in trouble,
and all that has changed.

1160
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:22,266
I was so pleased with Ruby and Karen,

1161
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:24,649
because they looked in such trouble.

1162
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:27,426
And Manon. I think those
three people saved themselves.

1163
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:29,786
I think we've got Luke and
Terry down at the bottom.

1164
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:31,786
Yeah, and they didn't
even look good, did they?

1165
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,226
Briony's Showstopper
wasn't particularly good.

1166
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,786
She let herself down.
She's better than that.

1167
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:37,746
The cake was stodgy.

1168
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:39,786
I think when you're
looking at Star Baker,

1169
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,666
Jon did a great job
with his pineapple cake,

1170
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:44,186
I think Rahul's done a fantastic
job, and I also feel like

1171
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:46,866
Dan has been probably the
most consistent throughout all.

1172
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:47,946
Absolutely steady.

1173
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:50,769
Quite amazing that two
handshakes happened.

1174
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:53,106
I've never given a handshake
on a Showstopper before,

1175
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,706
but to give two... I'm
disappointed with myself!

1176
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:58,066
But it... The only... The only reason...

1177
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,965
We're disappointed with
you, too. I know. Yeah.

1178
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:11,969
Bakers, what a tremendous,

1179
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:14,969
cake-fuelled weekend we have had,

1180
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:18,026
and I have the pleasure of
announcing the Star Baker.

1181
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:21,929
The person who is this week's
Star Baker made a giant of

1182
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:25,209
a tray bake, has been
technically consistent,

1183
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,586
and persuaded Paul

1184
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,649
to give his first-ever handshake

1185
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:29,786
in a Showstopper.

1186
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:31,810
Rahul!

1187
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:39,409
Unfortunately, that means I
get to deliver the bad news.

1188
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:43,449
The person who's leaving
us this week is...

1189
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,850
...Luke.

1190
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:02,289
I know, I know. It
wasn't my weekend, hey?

1191
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:04,946
I'm just going to, like,
really miss everybody here.

1192
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:07,129
Oh, mate, mate! I've lost my mate!

1193
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:10,226
I just can't believe I've even made
it onto the show in the first place.

1194
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,466
Just little old me, who just,
like, bakes in his kitchen,

1195
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,706
started with his nan, taught himself.

1196
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:17,466
But, hey, I was still in the Bake
Off, I still went in the tent,

1197
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:19,666
I still had Paul and
Prue try food I've baked,

1198
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:22,315
which is, like,
literally, a dream of mine.

1199
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:25,586
Next week, next week? I know,
next week, I will. Thank you.

1200
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:28,369
I am so relieved to still be here.

1201
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:31,409
I'm not going to cry!
I'm not going to cry.

1202
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,450
Nope.

1203
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,490
No, I'm not!

1204
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:38,489
Still here, Terry.

1205
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:41,129
Still here. Still in shock, I think.

1206
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:44,386
It's a bit surreal, actually,
how much you do want it.

1207
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:47,866
I will return home tomorrow and
practise, practise, practise!

1208
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:50,066
Well done, Rahul. You can cheer up now.

1209
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:53,146
Yeah, I will try, yeah. Thank you.
All right? Yeah, yeah. I just...

1210
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:56,249
Yeah, my emotions just
go a little bit crazy.

1211
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:57,586
It feels so surreal.

1212
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:00,609
Hollywood handshake
and the Star Baker...

1213
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:04,386
Well done!

1214
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:07,569
I just hope I didn't peak too early.

1215
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:08,786
Next time...

1216
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:10,706
And we're off... it's Bread Week...

1217
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:12,626
Come on, bread. Don't let me down.

1218
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:14,666
...and Paul's not taking any prisoners...

1219
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:15,586
Makes me nervous.

1220
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,426
...with a fruity classic
Signature Bake...

1221
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:19,386
Do you want to see my buns?

1222
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,449
...a heated Technical Challenge

1223
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:23,226
that's a British takeaway favourite...

1224
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,626
I genuinely have no idea.

1225
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,889
...and show-stopping sweet breads

1226
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:29,769
that are the largest
ever baked in the tent.

1227
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:33,685
It is a big waiting game, but
it's worth it, you see? Worth it.
