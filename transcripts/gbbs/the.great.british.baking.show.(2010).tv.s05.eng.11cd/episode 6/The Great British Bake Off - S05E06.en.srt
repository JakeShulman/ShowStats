1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Welcome back to the Bake Off tent -

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,240
the bakers are past the halfway point.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,760
They've had their orange segments

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,680
and a thorough sponge-down from Mary Berry.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,600
- Was it a Genoise sponge?
- I think we've extended this analogy too far.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,520
BOTH: Welcome to the Great British Bake Off.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,320
'Last time, the bakers took on pies and tarts.'

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,880
Are you a pie or a tart?

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,080
Oh, a tart.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,720
Yeah, I'm a tart as well.

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,080
'Kate's pork pies won over the judges...'

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,880
It's a great-looking pie, that.

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,760
And the pastry, really lovely.

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,840
'..finally winning her Star Baker.

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,080
'For others, it wasn't such a good week...'

16
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,520
Come on, there is a plumbing issue here.

17
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,640
- What's in that egg white? 
- Lavender.

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,320
Lavender?

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,080
'..and it was Norman who left the Bake Off tent.

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,120
'So which of the remaining six...'

21
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,440
- Is it Alien Autopsy week? 
- It does feel a bit like that.

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,120
'..will get a rise out of yeast-leavened cakes...'

23
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,240
It's dipped slightly.

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,800
I think it's going to be sad.

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,280
'..make cakes fit for Swedish royalty...'

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,520
This is the classic Swedish princess cake.

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,280
'..and produce monumental Dobos tortes?'

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,800
It's what I call a Showstopper.

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,120
'And whose Bake Off will come to a sweet but sticky end?'

30
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,560
Done.

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,480
EUROPEAN DANCE MUSIC PLAYS

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,240
"SCANDINAVIAN" ACCENT: Welcome to the 2014 Euro Bake Off.

33
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,400
Amsterdam, can we have your points, please?

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,880
- "DUTCH" ACCENT:
- Hello, Melly, this is the Amsterdam jury

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,440
and want to say thank you for having such a groovy show

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,680
and everybody in the Netherlands really enjoying themselves tonight.

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,920
So, the votes from the jury,

38
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,280
we have British bakers with the 12 points.

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,720
BOTH: This is European cake week.

40
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,920
I've had lots of European holidays

41
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
and I've probably eaten lots of cake.

42
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,640
But not thought about what they're called and how they're made.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,920
There's definitely an element of winging it this week

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,120
because I haven't had a whole great amount of time to practise.

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,800
It's half term at the moment

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,720
but I've got two exams next week which are also suffering.

47
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,240
I'm looking forward to a good or average week now, I just don't

48
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,160
want to have another one where I get told off in the middle of the tent.

49
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,160
Bakers, good morning. Great to see you all here.

50
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,520
For your Signature Challenge this morning,

51
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,360
Mary and Paul would like you to bake, please,

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,600
a cake inspired by those great cakes of Europe.

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,400
Think Germany, France or possibly be a little bit more adventurous.

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,720
Romania, Estonia, Lithuania or the famous...

55
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,680
IMPERSONATES DUTCH

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,040
..cake from Holland.

57
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,520
Your cakes must be leavened with yeast.

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,760
None of this GB baking powder nonsense.

59
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,880
The choice of filling and decoration is entirely up to you.

60
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,800
I'm merely here to say you have three hours to complete your bake.

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,560
So as the Spanish, our beloved European brethren, would say...

62
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,520
- En sus marcas.
- Listos.

63
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,840
Bake!

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,520
- PAUL:
- Leavened cakes are the oldest cakes in the world!

65
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,200
Baking powder was only invented in the 1850s,

66
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,160
and so the only way to rise a cake before was with yeast.

67
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,040
So, these cakes have been around an awfully long time,

68
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,640
and they're all embedded right the way throughout Europe.

69
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,360
- MARY:
- A leavened cake is made in a similar way

70
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,320
that you would make a loaf of bread

71
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,760
and it can't really be hurried too much.

72
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,760
Get it too hot and it will rise too quickly

73
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,920
and you won't get the right texture.

74
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,520
Too slow - they won't have had time.

75
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,480
It's all to do with timing.

76
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,160
Austrians have been baking the kugelhopf for years.

77
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,080
Luis has been practising his for the last week.

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,040
- Hello, Luis.
- You all right? 
- Yes, I'm good.
- Good, thank you.

79
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,360
So, what's this bake you're going to be doing for us today?

80
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,400
Apple and cinnamon kugelhopf with honeyed apples on top.

81
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,440
Luis will be topping his apple kugelhopf with roasted almonds

82
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,720
and spooning calvados syrup on top.

83
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,320
Are you going to be able to do it in the time?

84
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,400
Yeah, I should be able to because it's pretty much an all-in-one,

85
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,360
it proves for about an hour and 15 minutes or so,

86
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,400
and it bakes quite quick, it's only about 40 minutes.

87
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,560
- CHETNA:
- I'm making a savarin.

88
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,360
It's mainly orange-flavoured.

89
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,600
Once it's done, then I'm going to give it a bath

90
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,360
in this lovely orange syrup.

91
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,120
Once she's soaked the savarin in syrup,

92
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,680
Chetna will be filling it with pistachio and cinnamon cream.

93
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,160
It needs that cream to cut through the orange

94
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,680
so it just gives a balance.

95
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,440
- Does the savarin end up looking like that then?
- Yes.

96
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,920
It's a bit like a piles cushion, isn't it?

97
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,400
Let's just put that back there.

98
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,680
Everything that enriches and flavours a dough

99
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,520
has the potential to retard the yeast and inhibit the cake's rise...

100
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,920
There's so many other things here that could slow the yeast down,

101
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,600
you just need to get it going.

102
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,960
..something that Richard and Nancy are taking an extra step to avoid.

103
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,400
The first thing I've had to do is make what's called a sponge.

104
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,760
So, I've put the yeast, and some warm milk and the sugar

105
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,120
and half the flour, all the things the yeast likes.

106
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,400
So, I've put that to work for 20 minutes,

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,160
and then I'll know that the yeast is working.

108
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,520
That certainly looks like a sponge, doesn't it?

109
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,200
Richard's making a cake similar to Luis' Austrian kugelhopf,

110
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,320
but Richard's hails from Germany.

111
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,320
My brother-in-law is German and he often makes them,

112
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,480
so it's something I think I know what it's meant to taste like.

113
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,320
It's got cranberries, apricots, raisins, mixed peel,

114
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,640
rum and orange zest in it as well.

115
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,000
Once baked, Richard's guglhupf will be encrusted with flaked almonds.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,640
- MARY:
- Is it staying as it is or is it having a syrup?

117
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,960
How are you finishing it?

118
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,720
I'm going to wing it again this week.

119
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,120
You're going to wing it?

120
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,440
I'll either do a syrup or I'll icing-sugar it.

121
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,600
Dangerous thing, week six, winging it.

122
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,280
You've got to go with your heart, haven't you, really?

123
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,720
Is your heart there, Richard?

124
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,640
Slightly worried if your heart's there.

125
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,360
My heart is in my stomach a lot of the time while I'm here.

126
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,800
My sponge is sponged, you can just see it's got some holes in it,

127
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,560
so that's good.

128
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,960
Renegade baker Nancy's already opted out of Europe.

129
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,240
My European cake isn't 1% European.

130
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,160
Probably Caribbean. I suppose it's European in design.

131
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,560
Nancy's hybrid savarin will be

132
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,000
soaked in an orange and passion fruit syrup

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,840
and flavoured with banana.

134
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,440
Savarin's quite light.

135
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,960
You've added banana, which sits on the dough.

136
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,400
It's dangerous putting not only a banana in but a fresh banana.

137
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,360
Do you feel the danger of the banana?

138
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,240
I'm feeling it, yeah, but I didn't let it get me.

139
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,480
Nancy and Luis are hoping to get enough rise from one long prove.

140
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,520
It's just a patience game now really, just waiting for it.

141
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,880
'For everyone else...'

142
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,160
So sticky. Love it though.

143
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,440
'..timing the rise is twice as complicated.'

144
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,360
Why are you proving it twice then?

145
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,480
I've put it in the first time to rise it.

146
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,560
I've put the butter in and the chocolate chips in after.

147
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,720
Hang on, you're adding butter to the dough after? How much?

148
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,280
Four tablespoons?

149
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,960
Four tablespoons?!

150
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,800
The first couple of times I made it, it tasted like a bread,

151
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,840
so I added a bit more cake-y ingredients to make it more cake-y.

152
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,360
If it rises, Martha's cake will be decorated with melted white

153
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,400
and dark chocolate, with crushed almond brittle sprinkled on the top.

154
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,280
Tell us about what the dough is, then.

155
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,880
It's got cocoa powder and melted chocolate in the dough

156
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,920
- and a bit of almond essence.
- OK.

157
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,920
When it's baked, I'm going to soak it in an almond liqueur.

158
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

159
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,280
I don't know what a savarin is.

160
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,960
I don't know what it should... I've never tasted one...

161
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,680
I'm nervous because mine actually is inspired by a babka,

162
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,680
- which isn't even European! 
- What is it then?
- Israeli.

163
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,320
But it's exactly the same as all the other yeast-leavened cakes.

164
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, come on, that is European. Almost, isn't it?

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,160
It's in the Eurovision Song Contest.

166
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,440
Yeah! Oh, that counts, that does count.

167
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,760
Kate's Israeli babka will be flavoured with dark chocolate,

168
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,240
sour cherries and pecans.

169
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,160
I spent some time in Israel as a teenager.

170
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,840
Had a wonderful time there

171
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,440
but didn't really like their cakes very much,

172
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,000
so I've had to really change the way I've thought about it and put

173
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,240
lots more flavour into it than perhaps they would traditionally.

174
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,800
Kate's non-traditional cake will be topped with melted white

175
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,400
and dark chocolate and chocolate-dipped cherries to decorate.

176
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,800
What I want to do is make sure that the filling is incorporated

177
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,600
all the way through.

178
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,160
Is it Alien Autopsy week?

179
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,600
- It does feel a bit like that. 
- Just checking.

180
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,960
I'm just adding the butter to my risen dough

181
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
and then chocolate chips as well.

182
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,760
I'm cutting it in two and then I'm just twisting them together.

183
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,400
It's such a soft dough, it's actually quite hard to do.

184
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,320
Plenty of egg-wash for sticking.

185
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,000
So, now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to cover it

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,480
for the second prove.

187
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,120
Back in the proving drawer.

188
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,200
Bakers, you have one hour left on your European cakes,

189
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,640
one hour left.

190
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,920
Thank you.

191
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,600
Ooh!

192
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,120
Deciding when to stop proving

193
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,320
and when to start baking is the key to this yeast-leavened challenge.

194
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,720
Let's have a look at her.

195
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,480
Oh, that's great!

196
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,880
Yeah, that's looking good.

197
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,280
Don't over-prove cos it'll sink again.

198
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,480
It goes up and down if you over-prove.

199
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,840
- KATE SIGHS 
- I hate this bit.

200
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,080
I think it's ready now

201
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,160
because there's enough space for it to grow a little bit in the oven

202
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,040
but it's come up enough that I know it's got the air bubbles inside it.

203
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,680
It's risen so I'm going to get it in the oven now and start it baking.

204
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,920
I hope it has risen enough.

205
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,560
Can't do anything about it now.

206
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,800
Trying to be as careful as possible

207
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,400
because I don't want to knock any air out.

208
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,440
No.

209
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,160
It's got a little bit further to go, it's about that far off the top.

210
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,240
I'm just preparing the syrup that I'm going to cook my apples in.

211
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,960
It's got cinnamon and honey and butter in.

212
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,680
You just drizzle it over the cake as well.

213
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,160
A classic yeast-leavened cake has the simple syrup added

214
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,440
after it's baked.

215
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,640
In here, there's orange and passion fruit juice,

216
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,480
some sugar and 100mls of rum.

217
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,160
But all six bakers are aiming to improve on hundreds of years

218
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,520
of European baking tradition.

219
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,960
I'm just preparing the cream to go in the centre of the cake.

220
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,720
This is just a bit of frippery.

221
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,440
This is the almond brittle, and I'm going to crumble it up

222
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,200
and then sprinkle it on the top.

223
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,880
Richard has gone with a traditional syrup glaze.

224
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,360
It's meant to taste orangey so that's a touch.

225
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,240
But also has a backup plan.

226
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,640
I'm making up some orange liqueur icing.

227
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,280
I know Paul told me that maybe winging it is a bad idea

228
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,200
but I've tried several decorating techniques on it,

229
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,480
and I'm not hugely happy with any of them,

230
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,120
so I'm just going to see where my heart takes me

231
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,800
when it comes out the oven.

232
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,680
- "DUTCH" ACCENT: 
- So, bakers, don't be alarmed.

233
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,120
Let's take it really mellow

234
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,960
but you've got half an hour for your kugelhopfs and your guglhopfs.

235
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,840
15 more minutes.

236
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,880
The cakes need to be baked long enough to complete the rise.

237
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,840
It will rise a little bit more but what also happens is the heat

238
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,240
kills the yeast so it actually will set like a loaf of bread.

239
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,520
But there needs to be enough time left for them

240
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,880
to cool down so that they can be decorated.

241
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,040
It's just hard not knowing what it should be like.

242
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,200
I feel like I feel like in technicals even though

243
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,240
this is a bake that I could have practised,

244
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,840
which isn't very good cos I could have practised it.

245
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,520
You can start smelling it now.

246
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,120
- Is that your one? 
- It's the cherries.

247
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,040
God, I need to check it. One sec.

248
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,240
Yeah, check the hopf, man.

249
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,920
- Ooh, he's risen.
- He has.

250
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,160
I think that's ready to come out.

251
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,600
Who do you think's going to win this, Luis?

252
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Can I just ask you boldly and baldly?

253
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,720
Can you tell yet, out of the six of you?

254
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,840
- Money's on Nancy. 
- Money's on Nancy?

255
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,280
Deffo.

256
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,200
It's dipped, slightly.

257
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,160
I think it's going to be sad.

258
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,360
The moment of truth.

259
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,640
Brilliant.

260
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Looks how it should look.

261
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,840
It's a bit of a scary moment in a bake.

262
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,960
Love it, looks great, looks so tasty.

263
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,400
Let's hope it comes.

264
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,600
More rather than less is good, I think, for this one.

265
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
Hey!

266
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,680
Looks more like a Yorkshire pudding.

267
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,840
I'd probably do it a favour if I dropped it on the floor.

268
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,120
All we need now is for it not to come out the tin.

269
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,680
See, that actually looks all right.

270
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,120
"LITHUANIAN" ACCENT: Bakers for Euro challenge,

271
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,840
ten minutes left on clock.

272
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,080
NORMAL ACCENT: I apologise to all Lithuanians.

273
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,680
All of this needs to go into this.

274
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,680
I think the best way to soak it in the syrup really is to put it

275
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,040
back in there and then to put that back in, then I pour it over

276
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,960
the top as well and it should kind of meet in the middle somewhere.

277
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,480
I'm putting the fruit on next.

278
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,000
After having stuck my finger in all of my various different options,

279
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,840
this was the one that tasted the nicest, so on it went.

280
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,880
It's almost soaked up because now

281
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,240
when I put the syrup in, it's not going inside any more.

282
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,440
I'm just putting the honeyed apples on top.

283
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,080
The weight of the syrup is making it bend over in the middle.

284
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,960
How much longer have we got?

285
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,160
"SCANDINAVIAN" ACCENT: Bakers, one minute left on the clock.

286
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,800
I'm running out of chocolate.

287
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,680
There's been a slight European collapse on the west wing there.

288
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,720
Thanks.

289
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,800
I just need to drizzle some syrup on.

290
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,920
- "DUTCH" ACCENT:
- Bakers, it is very, very important for you

291
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,800
to realise that the bake is now over.

292
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,240
Done. I love it!

293
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,000
LUIS CHUCKLES

294
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,560
I don't know what they'll make of mine, Chetna, I really don't.

295
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,280
The appearance is most attractive

296
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,480
and you've got a good height to it.

297
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,320
But it's all to do with the texture.

298
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,200
Let's start hassling the hopf.

299
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Oh, sehr gut!

300
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,520
I think the texture's very good.

301
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,040
It's short, so when you chew it, there's no chew to it at all.

302
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,440
It breaks really quickly.

303
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,440
And I like very much the apple that you've put on the top

304
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,800
because it needs the moisture from the top.

305
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,040
Well done.

306
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,040
You've got good height there.

307
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,400
I like what you've done with the chocolate.

308
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,840
It'll be fascinating to see what the structure's like inside.

309
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,360
I love the flavour of that.

310
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,600
The cherries, the chocolate... goes well together.

311
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,080
Thank you, Mary.

312
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,520
He's something up his sleeve to say to you.

313
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,000
Your choice of flavours for the inside, I think, are wrong.

314
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,520
- Oh.
- Because it's quite dry inside.

315
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,080
The fact that it was dry chocolate with dried cherries

316
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,840
- and dried pecans... 
- Well, it had a lot of butter in it.

317
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,040
It's not enough.

318
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,000
KATE SIGHS

319
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,920
It's a beautiful colour, that lovely rich golden colour.

320
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,280
- We've got a bit of a sort of waist to it.
- Yes.

321
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,600
I think you've put too much liquid in there.

322
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,000
It shouldn't get like that.

323
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,880
It normally comes out and it stabilises and when it's stable,

324
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,560
then you add the syrup, and it soaks in and remains the same.

325
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,120
You've probably put it on when it's too warm.

326
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,400
Well, the orange is coming through.

327
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,280
It's short, it's moist.

328
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,320
The cream goes really well with it.

329
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,960
The flavour and the texture and the moisture is very, very good.

330
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,920
I think it's a great pity that the top has crystallised

331
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,000
because it doesn't look very inviting.

332
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,960
I feel it ought to have a beautiful shine all over it.

333
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,440
For me, the flavour is good,

334
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,400
but the texture, it looks as though it hasn't been mixed smoothly.

335
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,120
If you look down at the bottom, there's a little split.

336
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,480
That is an indication that the yeast hasn't reached its full potential

337
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,880
before you put it in the oven.

338
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,200
I like the look of it but it needed more of a rise

339
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,320
and that would have given you a lighter structure. It's too dense.

340
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,120
- Thank you, Richard.
- Thank you.

341
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,840
I think the actual savarin itself is a beautiful colour.

342
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,600
I think the decoration doesn't add an awful lot to the savarin.

343
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,120
Bit '70s?

344
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,720
Ah. You've over-proved it.

345
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,760
- Have I?
- Yep.

346
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,000
You can tell by the structure inside, it's so irregular and open.

347
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,440
And then you've got the crease.

348
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,840
- The flavour's fantastic by the way. 
- God, yeah. Amazing.

349
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,240
Well, that's something, anyway.

350
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,840
Not getting the banana, as I thought.

351
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,520
There's a little hint at the end.

352
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,800
- Tastes good, remember that. 
- That's fine!

353
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,080
Thank you.

354
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,160
It does look fantastic, sits well.

355
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,560
Can't see any cracks in there at all.

356
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,240
That looks, to me, a nice texture.

357
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,080
It's a good thing you've got the brittle on the top,

358
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,640
because the chocolate is fairly bitter, but adding the sweetness

359
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,840
of the icing, the white chocolate and the brittle gives it a lift.

360
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,160
The blend of the alcohol, which Mary would love,

361
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,520
with the chocolate, is beautiful.

362
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,280
- Well done, Martha.
- Thanks.

363
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,840
Really well done.

364
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,120
I didn't know what it should taste like or what it should look like

365
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,440
or what the texture should be like but, apparently,

366
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,520
I nailed it, so that's really good.

367
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,360
Really relieved and quite happy that they enjoyed it.

368
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,360
It's still that eternity of waiting when they take a bite of it

369
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,280
and you're waiting for the verdict.

370
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,720
That seems to last for like half an hour

371
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,000
even through it's only seconds, you know.

372
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm kind of happy when they give you constructive criticism

373
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,760
because it helps you as you go along, you know,

374
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,040
I'm not... I'm an amateur hobby baker.

375
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,960
I think my decoration was... I mean, even as I was doing it,

376
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,120
I thought this looks a bit naff, really.

377
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,480
You can't move forward while you're looking behind you

378
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,560
so that's what I'll do.

379
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,000
I wouldn't want to put myself at top, I wouldn't want to put

380
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,480
myself right at the very bottom,

381
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,680
but, yeah, I'd be happy with middling.

382
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,720
In Southern Jutland, the area where mainland Denmark meets Germany,

383
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,280
cakes were vital,

384
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,520
they helped preserve national identity in a time of war.

385
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,280
In 1864, Jutland was invaded and occupied by Germany.

386
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,960
In this area, you weren't allowed to speak Danish or be Danish.

387
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,760
So, what way did they find to express their national identity?

388
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,000
Formed unions and met in community houses.

389
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,560
Alcohol was banned so they needed something else to serve

390
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,280
while having these meetings, so that would be cakes.

391
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,680
The second drug of choice.

392
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,040
THEY CHUCKLE

393
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,280
It was all about who could bring the most delicious and creative

394
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,680
and beautiful-looking cakes.

395
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,920
So, deeply competitive, it was sort of Bake Off, wasn't it?

396
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,440
There was a Bake Off competition every week,

397
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,320
but with political songs.

398
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,360
These gatherings were called cake tables

399
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,440
and modern-day Danes continue this tradition.

400
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,640
What would the Danes call this spread?

401
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,400
Sonderjysk Kaffebord.

402
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,760
Eating cake from start to finish.

403
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,640
- For three to four hours?
- Yeah.

404
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,760
There's a way of doing this. If you think of an athlete training,

405
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,040
this is what we're doing essentially.

406
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,840
You have to have the yeast part, the dry part,

407
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,360
the part with the cream and then you stop.

408
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,440
What would happen if I hadn't eaten all the cakes?

409
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,720
It wouldn't be an option.

410
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,680
It's the host making sure. Eat some more, come on, you can do it.

411
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,200
- You haven't tasted this one, have you?
- Right.

412
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,560
Do you want some coffee?

413
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,320
Yeah, you drink about five to seven cups of coffee.

414
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,640
- So, essentially, by the end of this, you will require a paramedic.
- Yeah.

415
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,520
And the sugar is like whoo, whoo, whoo.

416
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,440
Yeah, never felt so alive. Let's have another coffee to celebrate.

417
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,320
That is utterly superb.

418
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,800
What are these ones here?

419
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,640
- Knippkea. 
- Knippkea, what does that mean?

420
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,200
That they have a snap.

421
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,960
Oh, that's really good. Sort of chewy.

422
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,280
I've never been drunk on cake before.

423
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,800
There were times when I didn't think I could do it

424
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,600
but you were always there by my side, so thank you.

425
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Oh, you're so welcome.

426
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,920
- All the best, guys. 
- And to you, Chetna, all the best.

427
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,320
Good luck.

428
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,040
The bakers are about to face a technical challenge

429
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,000
that explores a part of Europe rarely visited in the Bake Off.

430
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,120
I feel sick.

431
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,720
Good afternoon, bakers, and welcome to your technical challenge.

432
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,920
Now, Mary, this is one of your recipes,

433
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,520
so have you got any little pearls of wisdom?

434
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,600
I suggest that you read the recipe at least twice before you start,

435
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,720
so you know exactly what you're up to.

436
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,400
- Good advice, Bez.
- Now leave. 
- Off you go.
- Right, off we go.

437
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,240
There they go.

438
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,040
Now, Scandinavia is very popular at the moment -

439
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,600
- with ABBA and The Killing.
- ABBA was in the 1970s.
- It was, yeah.

440
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,560
So, Mary and Paul would like you, please, to make

441
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,560
a Swedish traditional cake called Princess Torte,

442
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,400
which means "Princess Cake."

443
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,360
It's three layers of sponge, it's filled with creme pat and jam.

444
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,480
It's got a dome of whipped cream on top. On top of that it's got some

445
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,480
green marzipan, and don't forget, a little rose plonked on the top.

446
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,840
I do believe we have two and a quarter hours for you

447
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,200
to assemble this Princess Torte.

448
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,840
- On your marks...
- Get set... 
- And ba-a-a-ake!

449
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,440
My heart is beating.

450
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,600
Mary's recipe requires 26 separate ingredients...

451
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,200
I've never done a Scandinavian recipe in my life.

452
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,360
..and has 14 stages, making it one of the Bake Off's

453
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,240
most complicated technical challenges yet.

454
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,800
I've never heard of it. I've never seen it. Never eaten it.

455
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,960
Not a clue. Not a Scooby-Doo.

456
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,960
Mary, why did you choose this Princess Cake?

457
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,920
It's a delicious cake.

458
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,360
In Sweden they have it for all sorts of celebrations.

459
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,360
As you cut through, you will see first of all the bottom layer

460
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,040
will be Genoise - a tricky sponge to make.

461
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,640
On top of that will be jam with a ridge of piped creme patissiere

462
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,200
round the outside, then a layer of sponge.

463
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,680
On top of that, a mixture of creme patissiere and cream,

464
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,320
then a layer of sponge, and a dome of cream on the top.

465
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,480
Lastly, that blanket of green marzipan.

466
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,640
I think you're cruel, Mary, I really do.

467
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,120
This is a particularly difficult challenge.

468
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,400
HE LAUGHS

469
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,920
That's everything I like in a cake, that.

470
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,440
Don't count the calories. But, oh, so good!

471
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,000
SHE EXHALES

472
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,880
That is quite something.

473
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,080
If it's what I'm thinking of, there was a baker's in Stockport

474
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,160
that used to sell them when I was a child,

475
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,920
and I remember my mum buying them, which is really weird.

476
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,320
And a line on the recipe sheet simply says...

477
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,000
"Make a creme patisserie and chill."

478
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,960
They're relying on your knowledge.

479
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,480
The recipe's so vague.

480
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,320
Get that milk up, add it to the yolk, then add the flour

481
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,880
and then put it back on the heat to cook the flour out.

482
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,080
That's what I'm thinking.

483
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,920
And then the whole lot goes back into the pan.

484
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,720
You can make it too thick and it will taste horrible and curdled,

485
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,160
but you can get it too thin and it won't hold any shape

486
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,120
and it won't hold in the middle of the cake.

487
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,720
I think I'm almost there, actually.

488
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,440
I think I'm going to have to try and do two things at once

489
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,760
because there's hardly any time for this bake,

490
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,280
so I'm going to make the jam as well.

491
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,560
I'm used to having two pans bubbling. I make tonnes of jam.

492
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,600
This is a whisked sponge, which I do quite a lot,

493
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,440
so I'm hoping that it should go OK.

494
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,000
Basically trying to make it as light and airy as I possibly can.

495
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,520
You're looking for, when you pull the whisk out,

496
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,920
to leave a trail that lasts for about three seconds.

497
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,760
Which means that it's got enough air in it to inflate a sponge.

498
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,400
It's just under that now so I'm just going to leave it going

499
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,240
- for a couple more minutes. 
- That's nearly there...

500
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,400
I would say that's about right.

501
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,240
Yep, it's about three seconds, so now I'm going to sieve over the flour.

502
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,520
The recipe says cornflour, plain flour and baking powder,

503
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,440
so I'm just giving them a sort of a mix.

504
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,600
You have to fold it, which is bit by bit circular,

505
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,560
just so you don't knock the air out.

506
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,200
That's what Mary does, so it must be right.

507
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,200
Everyone's just moving so fast.

508
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,360
It doesn't say to bake it for any amount of time at all,

509
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,960
so it's all guesswork.

510
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,760
Right. "Create a rose with individual petals."

511
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,920
I think what you have to do is roll out little pieces

512
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,040
and then flatten them and stick it together.

513
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,520
Ooh, nice.

514
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,240
Oh, no. No, no, it's definitely not done yet.

515
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,880
It's still a bit wobbly, so I'm just going to give it a few more minutes.

516
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,600
My sponge isn't rising and I don't understand that,

517
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,040
and I think I'd like to make another one.

518
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,400
OK, bakers, one hour to present your princess cake, one hour!

519
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,960
Let's go!

520
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,280
For the marzipan, it's 400g of ground almonds, 150g of caster sugar,

521
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,720
250 grams of icing sugar, which are all in the bowl.

522
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,200
I'm just kneading it together, getting everything combined.

523
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,080
I don't normally make marzipan. I usually buy it.

524
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,360
I can do this.

525
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,440
Oh, good(!)

526
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,480
I made my grandson a football cake.

527
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,800
I had to get it a really sort of grass green colour, which I didn't

528
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,800
think looked very appetising, but he thought it was great!

529
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,960
I've made a rainbow cake for my daughter that did have green in it.

530
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
I was looking for lighter green

531
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,160
but it doesn't look like I'll be getting that!

532
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,000
If I put more colour in now it might end up being too much.

533
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,920
Here's hoping!

534
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,600
That looks pretty done. Yep, cake's coming out.

535
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,680
How are you?

536
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,320
I've got to be able to cut that into three slices.

537
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,240
- How's your sponge coming up? 
- Yeah, it's better.
- That's better!

538
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,600
- Not risen that much. 
- So, listen, read out...

539
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,440
"Cut the sponge into three layers." I am aware of that.

540
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,120
- Right. We're going to need an electron microscope!
- Yeah.

541
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,040
So, are you going to do it again? You've got time. I say go for it,

542
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:20,040
- just in case, while you've got everything else chilling.
- Right.

543
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,440
Five centimetres divided by three is...

544
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,080
..about one and a bit.

545
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,440
The best way of doing this is much colder than I'm currently doing it.

546
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,000
I suspect once again I'm going to be up against time.

547
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:44,040
- Now, that looks a little more buoyant and princess-y.
- Doesn't it?

548
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,960
Normally I would never attempt to cut a sponge

549
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,160
until it was completely cool.

550
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,160
Bakers, you've got half an hour

551
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,960
to get your princesses to the marzipan ball.

552
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,400
I won't have time to finish it, to be honest.

553
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,320
"Spread a thin layer of creme pat..."

554
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,280
"Over the base of the first sponge."

555
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,680
It's got to be cool, because if not it will just melt.

556
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,480
It's just not going to happen, is it?

557
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,880
- Apparently you pipe a border round it.
- The border looks good!

558
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,520
It feels fairly stiff.

559
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,760
Looks like a circular border.

560
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,120
"Spread the jam evenly within the border."

561
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,200
- Any enjoyment in this? 
- No, not really.
- OK.

562
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,840
I'm quite far behind. But I'm catching up fast.

563
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,480
"Fold half of this into that."

564
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,200
Certainly haven't got time to measure, that'll do.

565
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,920
- That's got a really good consistency. 
- It needs to be thick, doesn't it?

566
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,560
"Spread a third of this mixture over the jam."

567
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,560
This is such a complicated recipe! Eurgh!

568
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,440
Yep, speed is of the essence, my love, you're doing well.

569
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,640
Some people are getting quite stressed. Are you quite stressed?

570
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,320
- I was at the beginning. 
- Were you? Why?
- Yeah, really.

571
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,000
I didn't know if I was Arthur or Martha first thing.

572
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,120
"Place the second sponge on top."

573
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,600
"Spreading out the cream and creme pat mixture."

574
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,800
Oh, no! It's just slipping off!

575
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,320
It says "put the third sponge on top, cover the sides with cream."

576
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,240
"And smooth into a dome top."

577
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,280
Nice princess-y curve there.

578
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,720
- What did the male judge say?
- Did you just say the male judge?
- Yes.

579
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,680
You're not even calling him Paul now?

580
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,680
You know when the male judge said - I'd forgotten it!

581
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,200
I'm going to put that in the freezer right now.

582
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,600
I'm going to use half this cake and half the cake in the oven.

583
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,960
I'm going to make a dome and freeze the top layer.

584
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,600
- Ooh, it's slipping!
- In it goes. 
- Wow, it's really slippy.
- Yeah.

585
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,400
I won't have time to freeze that, for sure.

586
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,000
Ten minutes until your Swedish bakes face their Waterloo. Ten minutes.

587
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,600
Am I showing a bit?

588
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,640
- This is hilarious. 
- I know, it's ridiculous.

589
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,160
Thin layer of jam.

590
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:17,600
I think if I try and cover it all in one go it will just squidge,

591
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,040
so I'm going to wrap this round the side.

592
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,280
I wish I'd put it on this thing to begin with.

593
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,600
This is a shame.

594
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,920
Couldn't think of another way of doing it.

595
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,880
One minute! Until the winner takes it all.

596
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,040
Where's my chocolate? Where's my chocolate?

597
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,560
Hideous.

598
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,920
Bakers, that's it, stop nozzling the princesses.

599
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,600
Bring your bakes up,

600
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,680
pop them behind the photos of yourself on the gingham altar.

601
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,960
- Marvellous.
- What a lovely bunch of princesses.
- Beautiful.

602
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,640
And the cakes aren't bad, either.

603
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,640
Paul, Mary, a whole shed-load of princesses await.

604
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,720
We really were looking for a domed top and then clear layers

605
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,000
and a good chocolate decoration,

606
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,160
with good piping and a flower on top.

607
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,160
It's a good rose. It's a bit wavy, the chocolate decoration,

608
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,160
a bit over-chocolated. It's not a very even top,

609
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,520
and we've still got some dusting of icing sugar on the top.

610
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,880
- And the creaming looks terrible. 
- Let's have a look inside.

611
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,600
There's a little bit of collapse there. I think.

612
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,160
You can't see distinctive layers there.

613
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,040
Sponge looks good, creme pat's holding.

614
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,360
Mm-hm. Nice jam.

615
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,800
The thickness of those layers are really very thick, aren't they?

616
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,240
Bit neater, isn't it? The dome's sort of there.

617
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,160
It's certainly got the layers there.

618
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,800
The flavour's good, the jam's good.

619
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,720
This one's more square, isn't it?

620
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,400
The marzipan has been put over not a very smooth top.

621
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,440
- The lid actually comes away from the base, look.
- Ah, you've spied.

622
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,240
Please come on, please.

623
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,000
- Interesting. 
- And it is collapsing.

624
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,840
And the creme pat's not set.

625
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,920
- And once you cut the cake it is not holding up.
- Yeah.

626
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,960
- This is more elegant. 
- It's a pretty decoration.

627
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,680
We've got a few folds in the sides of the marzipan.

628
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,360
- Well, that's quite neat. 
- Generous with the jam at the bottom.

629
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,640
- It's stable, it's holding. 
- Good layers, too.

630
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,040
Not much cream in there, though, is there?

631
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,920
This is a lovely colour, this one.

632
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,040
Not such good piping of the cream at the bottom.

633
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,520
Good rose on the top.

634
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,200
- Nice layers here. 
- Good amount of cream on the top.

635
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,360
Really, they can't go wrong with the flavours.

636
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,440
This one is so simple and so perfect,

637
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,120
the chocolate decoration on the top, and a lovely dome.

638
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,560
This is the classic Swedish Princess cake when it has that dome on top.

639
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,280
I'd like it a little bit greener.

640
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,680
Good layers of sponge, that is beautifully done.

641
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,120
Very elegant looking, I think. Nice and neat - I like that.

642
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,720
Beautiful.

643
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,320
But which Swedish Princess was technically perfect?

644
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,280
In sixth place is this one.

645
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,080
Kate, right. You know why.

646
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,920
And in fifth place...a little bit higgledy-piggledy all the way round.

647
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,880
In fourth place is this one. Martha, it's not bad at all.

648
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,280
But the whole decoration thing didn't work.

649
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,600
In third place, we loved your chocolate decoration and the flower.

650
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,880
Second place is this one. Well done, Chetna.

651
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,960
And who have we here?

652
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,080
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

653
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,880
APPLAUSE

654
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,320
Lovely dome, simple decoration, beautiful flower, a lovely cake.

655
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,680
Well done, everybody.

656
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,800
It's all about tricks of the trade

657
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,120
and if you've got them it's not too bad.

658
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,560
It's when you haven't got them. I didn't have them this morning!

659
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,760
They loved it! That is unreal.

660
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,200
Another half an hour would have been brilliant for me.

661
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,280
Hm...

662
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,960
So, once again the question of Europe has divided the pack,

663
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,720
it seems. Mary, who do you think's done well?

664
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,400
I think safe are Chetna and Luis.

665
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,040
I think what we've got is a natural split between three sets of two.

666
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,440
We have Nancy and Martha who, having an exceptional day today,

667
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,960
could be pushed right up to the top.

668
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,120
And then on the other side of the fence we have Kate,

669
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:15,080
who was Star Baker last week, and Richard down at the slippery end.

670
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,720
Do you think there's a curse of Star Baker? It seems that the Star Baker,

671
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,600
the following week, really suffers.

672
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,360
It happened to Richard, and it's happened to Kate.

673
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,400
Do you think it's because the tent

674
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,000
- is built on an ancient Indian burial site?
- Could be.
- Mm.

675
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,760
Morning, bakers and welcome to Showstopper day.

676
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,200
Now, I have to say, today is pretty epic.

677
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,040
Mary and Paul would like you, please, to create a contemporary version

678
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,880
of the Hungarian Dobos torte,

679
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,240
which is traditionally a multi-layered sponge cake

680
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,000
topped with caramel slices.

681
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,640
We'd like you to make a cake of at least two tiers

682
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,200
with the emphasis on sugar work and all things caramel.

683
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,360
You can have spun sugar, pralines,

684
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,000
caramel-flavoured Italian meringue buttercreams,

685
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
caramel sculptures, butter caramel, bitter caramel,

686
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,440
caramel sauces, butter-bitter caramel sauces, towers of praline,

687
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,520
a praline stack, a praline villa, a huge massive tower of sugar.

688
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,880
- Are you all right?
- I'm not all right, could you take me to the sunroom?

689
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,320
- You've got five hours. 
- On your marks...
- Get set...
- Bake!

690
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,720
The Hungarian Dobos torte is traditionally constructed

691
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,280
from thin layers of sponge topped with caramel decoration.

692
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,400
Mary and Paul want the bakers to pull out all the stops

693
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,040
with their sugar work.

694
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,160
Traditionally, on the top of the torte,

695
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,480
they normally have triangles of caramel,

696
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,240
but to be honest they can do anything they want with the caramel.

697
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,840
They've got five hours to complete this challenge.

698
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,760
I expect some serious caramel work.

699
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,880
It's got to have that look about it that my eyes won't leave it.

700
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,960
It's got to be stunning.

701
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,120
I am making a two-tiered Dobos torte,

702
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,840
in the shape of a local monument from home

703
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,560
that you can see from where we live,

704
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,400
and it's my wife's favourite place to visit. It's like a tower

705
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,360
and it's on a hill, so I've called it The Cage On The Rocky Hill.

706
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,120
Luis' torte will be filled with hazelnut, vanilla,

707
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,480
salted caramel and coffee buttercream.

708
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,520
But it's his sugar work that he hopes will be "monumental."

709
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,920
It's going to sound a bit bonkers actually, the caramel is stuck

710
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,600
on the outside of the cube to give you the tower effect.

711
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,400
I'm going to do that shape in sugar work on all four sides,

712
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,560
and then there's a flag on the top, which means it's always open

713
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,760
- when the flag's up.
- I think it might need planning permission.

714
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,760
I hope you have your papers in order.

715
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,720
I'm doing a two-tiered Dobos torte with ten layers in each.

716
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,880
The bottom tier will be like a thick raspberry puree

717
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,880
and a chocolate cream caramel covering.

718
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,640
The top layer will be a peach and white chocolate one as well.

719
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,760
Richard's two-tiered cake will be topped with white

720
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,080
and dark chocolate buttercream and ambitious sugar work.

721
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,640
I'm going to make myself a sugar bird in a spun sugar nest

722
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,520
with some trees. So, yeah, I've got lots of sugar to play with as well.

723
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,480
- So, you're baking these off individually, your sponges?
- Yeah.

724
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,880
- OK.
- I just think I can get them thinner.

725
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,720
You seem to be organised, and you've done it completely at home?

726
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,120
I've done it completely at home and within the time, so...

727
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,480
I'm not going to say confident, I would say cautiously optimistic!

728
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:38,160
I am making a two-slash-three-tiered chess-inspired Dobos torte.

729
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,560
I'm hoping to cut out the middle of my second tier

730
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,640
and put, like, a chess board design inside, like a hidden design.

731
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,040
And then if the sponge that I cut out of the middle comes out

732
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,760
in one piece, I'll just put that on the top as the third tier.

733
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,800
Martha's Dobos torte will be covered with chocolate ganache,

734
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,920
with chocolate and caramel chess pieces topping the cake.

735
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,960
Your flavours in-between the layers of sponge are going to be what?

736
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,320
I'm making a salted caramel Swiss meringue buttercream.

737
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,760
- It's a bit of a mouthful. 
- You had me at salted caramel.

738
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,880
Martha, Richard, Kate and Luis are making their European Dobos tortes

739
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,080
from individual layers of a whisked fatless sponge.

740
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,760
So you have to get a bit of a production line going of a layer in,

741
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,720
a batch out, cut them, get the next ones in.

742
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,920
But Chetna's building her European Showstopper with layers of sponge

743
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,840
that are a little more British.

744
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,520
I can see it's a Victoria sandwich-type sponge.

745
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,080
Yes, for me it's my favourite sponge so I just try

746
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,080
- and use it wherever I can. 
- Will you be trimming those?

747
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,720
No, what I'm doing is I'm cooking all my sponges in the tins

748
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,400
because I tried on paper and what happens is once it's cooked

749
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,640
it goes thin on the sides, it doesn't have that height.

750
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,840
Chetna will be filling her 14 sponges with chocolate caramel

751
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:59,520
buttercream, and she's invented some unique caramel decorations.

752
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,320
I want you to describe to me how you're going to...

753
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,640
I'm going to oil it and then put a toothpick, dip it in the caramel

754
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,240
and then once it's cold, just lift that caramel circle off.

755
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,520
It's a clever idea.

756
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,040
- How many of those are you doing? 
- Covering the whole of the top tier.

757
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,440
- Good luck. Thank you very much indeed.
- Thank you.

758
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,280
Two left to do.

759
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,760
- This is like your in-tray of sponge, isn't it?
- It is.
- In-tray, out-tray.

760
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,520
- You like all this, the organisation bit, don't you?
- I do.

761
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,600
You do, I know you do!

762
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,800
I am just releasing my sponges.

763
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,720
That's the bottom tier, and it's all the layers are done - seven of them.

764
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,400
You need obviously a lot of layers to make a cake.

765
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,160
I've done 12, I've got another eight to go.

766
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:51,240
I think there should be about 24 layers in total.

767
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,600
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

768
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,520
Which is a lot of layers, actually.

769
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,960
I'm going to make a two-tiered torte.

770
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,720
I'm doing Italian meringue chocolate buttercream,

771
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,440
but then I'm putting a layer of praline in as well.

772
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,200
Nancy will be topping her tiers with chocolate ganache and caramel,

773
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,440
and decorating with caramelised hazelnuts and caramel shards.

774
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,800
I'm building up my cakes now and then I'm going to put them

775
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,280
in the freezer, just for 15 minutes cos I want everything to firm up.

776
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,360
If I took these out of the tin now they'd just be a mess.

777
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,880
In the Venn diagram of baking and building,

778
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,000
how many points of intersection are there?

779
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,680
- This is slap bang in the middle. 
- It really is, isn't it?

780
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,720
This is an absurd amount of sponges, isn't it?

781
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,280
Well, it's my own fault, I did do an extra tier,

782
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,320
I can't blame anyone but myself for that.

783
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,280
So you're going for the old three tier-er?

784
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,480
I am because I think that two-tier cakes look like hats!

785
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,080
Kate's ambitious three tiers will be flavoured with raspberry,

786
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,000
chocolate and orange, and decorated with caramelised pistachios.

787
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,080
- Time is so tight now.
- What are your worries within the time?

788
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,320
Well, I want to be able to do a good job with my caramel.

789
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,120
I'm hoping for two hours, but it's not going to happen.

790
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,520
- Just on caramel? 
- Just on caramel.

791
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,920
As the Dobos tortes are constructed,

792
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,880
the proportion of sponge to filling should be even...

793
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,000
Scrap that layer, let's go for this one.

794
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,720
..so that when the cake is cut,

795
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,160
clearly defined layers are revealed.

796
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,200
It's a shame because I really wanted this cake to look really good

797
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,840
and I think it's going to look a little bit slapdash.

798
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,160
One positive thing is that the ganache looks nice and shiny.

799
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:37,040
OK, bakers, GST time - Greenwich Sponge Time -

800
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,480
you're about 12 layers in.

801
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,800
Nothing like cutting it fine, is there?

802
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,080
In GMT, that's halfway through the bake!

803
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,160
I've used modelling clay to make a template to pour some sugar in,

804
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,000
although looking at that, it's a little bit mottled,

805
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,120
so I might have another go.

806
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,080
My chocolate has gone sort of grainy and a bit funny,

807
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,040
but it's not the end of the world cos I've scraped it off

808
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,120
and I'm going to put another coat over the top, make some more.

809
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,800
I'm not the world's best chocolate person,

810
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,400
so my plan with this ganache is I shall keep my eye on it.

811
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,520
It just seems, like, gloopy and separating,

812
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,080
so I think I might just start again - again!

813
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,280
I am having another crack at making a bird,

814
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,600
which may or may not go well.

815
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,320
Sugar work is a tricky art. Too much heat, too little heat,

816
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,920
or even stirring, can all have disastrous consequences.

817
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,120
I just put the cream in too quick into my caramel, so I took it off

818
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,320
before it could incorporate, so I'm going to do it again!

819
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,320
I'm dipping pistachios into caramel.

820
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,680
Yeah, it's working now.

821
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,040
You have to wait till it gets to exactly the right temperature

822
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,640
in order to get the spike.

823
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,000
How long a spike are you looking for?

824
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Not that long. What I do is I chop them off.

825
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,320
- Right, I'm going to try and make... 
- It'll be a bit hard at the moment.

826
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,920
Ooh, it's completely gone.

827
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,880
Aggh!

828
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,680
It's totally gone.

829
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,640
OK, I need another saucepan. Thank you.

830
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,280
OK, bakers, 30 minutes remaining,

831
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,800
until I get to see more tiers than an England penalty shoot-out.

832
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,480
This is spun sugar, with blobs in it.

833
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:42,600
Hopefully, what it will end up being is the nest for my bird to sit in.

834
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,760
I wouldn't say caramel work is a strength for me -

835
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,240
my pulled nuts are rubbish.

836
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,440
I'm running out of time severely now,

837
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,200
because I haven't done enough of my nuts!

838
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,160
They're supposed to surround the cake.

839
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,320
It's supposed to be a crazy amount of caramel

840
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,720
but I'm just going to do as many as I possibly can.

841
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,960
Look at that bending.

842
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,400
I'm having to put on curly ones that have died in the heat.

843
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,600
Once something goes wrong, like my ganache went wrong,

844
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,680
it's all about keeping your head on.

845
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,880
That's it.

846
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,880
I'm just hoping I've got, like, ten minutes.

847
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,680
OK, five minutes on your Hungarian cakes.

848
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,800
Damn! What am I doing?

849
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,520
The last-five-minute panic has kicked in!

850
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,080
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

851
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,360
I think I'll have it done just about in time, which is good.

852
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,560
Bakers, one minute left on your Hungarian creations.

853
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,440
It's tricky knowing when to stop!

854
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,720
At least it looks a bit like a chessboard, if nothing else.

855
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,680
OK, bakers, it's over. Finished. No more tiers.

856
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,200
Step away from the bakes, thank you.

857
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,800
Nancy, if you'd like to come and present

858
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,440
to Mary and the male judge...

859
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,560
You've got beautiful cut edges there,

860
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,400
even layers of the filling, which I like.

861
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,320
I like the taste of that, it's rich.

862
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,040
Wouldn't want a big slice of it

863
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,280
but I can taste the caramel coming through.

864
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,440
The nuts you're getting through there are lovely.

865
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,600
They really add a nice touch to it - the praline coming through it.

866
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,440
The whole torte itself is very well-made and well-executed.

867
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,800
- Congratulations!
- Thank you. 
- Well done, Nancy.

868
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,760
- Can you now call him Paul again now he's said something nice?
- Yeah.

869
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,880
- He's wonderful, he's lovely. 
- Aw-w! Creep! Women!

870
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,040
The cakes look a bit sad, a lot sad.

871
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,800
- They've drooped.
- It looks a bit of a mess, yeah.

872
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,640
You've incorporated quite a lot of caramel in it.

873
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,080
I've done pistachio-praline blitzed on the bottom,

874
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,720
I've made a spun-sugar nest for my sugar bird

875
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,040
and I've attempted to make some trees for the front.

876
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,520
Have you got caramel in it or just on it here?

877
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,440
The chocolate has got caramel whipped into it as well.

878
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,160
The sponge is a little dry, a lot drier than the top.

879
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,640
I just think you could have presented the cake

880
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,480
- a little bit nicer with the icing...
- I entirely agree!

881
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,240
- ..which I thought would have been your thing, to be honest.
- I know.

882
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,960
What can I say?

883
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,520
It is a monumental effort.

884
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,480
It is spectacular.

885
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,560
It's what I call a Showstopper.

886
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,280
Thank you very much.

887
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,800
- Sorry for destroying it! 
- That's all right, go for it.

888
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,920
It's quite washy with the flavour.

889
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,400
It needs an identity, if you know what I mean.

890
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,000
For me, it's far too sweet and if you took a decent slice of that,

891
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,880
it would be too much, but how beautiful is that?

892
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,360
- You missed slightly on the flavour. 
- OK.

893
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,040
Kate, please bring your torte up.

894
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,520
The top layer has a raspberry ganache filling,

895
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,040
the middle layer has a milk chocolate filling

896
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,680
with a chocolate sponge

897
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,320
and the bottom layer

898
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,000
has a hint of dark chocolate orange.

899
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,440
The only caramel you've got on there is what we've got on the side?

900
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,680
Yes, pistachio caramel.

901
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,880
The bottom layer is my least favourite,

902
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,280
- because the actual sponge hasn't softened.
- OK.

903
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,520
I'm getting the orange, but it is the drier one.

904
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,480
I think you've got two winners with the two top layers

905
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,560
but I'm not so fond of the bottom layer.

906
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,640
I would have liked to have seen more caramel, however.

907
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:46,160
I admire the sheer volume of caramel on there. Well done.

908
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,880
Clever idea with the grapes - everybody will be copying that.

909
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,320
I must say at the beginning when you were doing Victoria sandwich,

910
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,920
I was all ready for it not to work and, of course, it has worked.

911
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,960
I'm really impressed with the definition

912
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,360
on the lines that you've got.

913
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,240
The flavours are good and I think you've done a really good job.

914
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,560
Thank you.

915
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,480
It looks a bit, um, uneven.

916
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,640
Yes.

917
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,440
It's got a great flavour, going towards the top.

918
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,200
It's beautiful, moist. It reminds me of an opera cake.

919
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,280
There's nothing wrong with an opera cake.

920
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,600
The flavours are very good. I like the sort of brittle in it,

921
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,000
but the chess pieces, in fact, don't show too much skill

922
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,400
because you used a bought mould that you just pour the caramel into,

923
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,720
but the whole effect is very good.

924
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,680
- Well done, Martha.
- Thank you.

925
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,920
Let's move the queen and checkmate!

926
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,880
- I love a queen.
- I love a queen.

927
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,120
So who do you think might have come through on the Showstopper for you?

928
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,200
Luis' was as nigh-on perfect as you can get

929
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,960
and he just needed a bit more flavour.

930
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,520
Now Chetna - she had very good layers.

931
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,000
I was really surprised that she got success with a Victoria sandwich.

932
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,480
I think Nancy has to be in there as well.

933
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,040
The chocolate looks good, the layers are strong,

934
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,520
great flavour, great textures all the way through.

935
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,120
Let's look at the bottom two. I think we're in a difficult position.

936
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,080
The brief was multiple layers

937
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:31,440
and caramel in all sorts of shapes and forms.

938
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,480
In Richard's, we have got the layers.

939
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,360
They are not distinctive but he has done quite a lot of sugar work,

940
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,080
so he has followed the brief.

941
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,760
Whereas Kate did three tiers,

942
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,680
which looked, and actually tasted to me, beautiful.

943
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,520
But she only did one skill with her caramel.

944
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,160
It's really tricky, we go round in circles all the time.

945
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,560
There's so many factors to take on board. As you say,

946
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,920
it's not just this round. They have jostled. It's a photo-finish.

947
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,640
We've got a really difficult decision between the two.

948
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,800
For Mary and Paul, it has never been such a close call on the Bake Off.

949
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:16,240
Bakers, can I just start by saying thank you, merci, grazie,

950
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,240
- gracias, and the Swedish one.
- Tak!

951
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,680
Tak for some amazing Euro baking this weekend.

952
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,560
So I have the great joy and pleasure of announcing

953
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,520
who this week's Star Baker is going to be.

954
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:36,320
Now this person has sort of risen through the ranks this week

955
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:41,120
and presented a very pert little Swedish green princess to us,

956
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,960
and has provided today

957
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,120
the most caramel-filled amazing amount of layers of spongedom

958
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,720
I have ever had the pleasure of putting into my mouth.

959
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,840
This week's Star Baker is Chetna!

960
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,480
And, as you know, Mel and I alternate this job

961
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,280
because, quite frankly, it's horrible.

962
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,200
This was a particularly tough one,

963
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,040
and there was an awful lot of argy-bargy

964
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,560
between our esteemed judges.

965
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,080
Um, we don't agree.

966
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,760
The reason why we came to this impasse

967
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,560
is because it came down to two people.

968
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,520
Kate, Richard, coming into the final, you were both neck and neck.

969
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,360
When it came to your Signature, Richard, yours was under-proved,

970
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,680
Kate, I thought with the moisture, I think you needed more to it.

971
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,440
When it came to the Technical, again it was five and six respectively.

972
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,840
And then when it came into the Showstopper,

973
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,880
it came down to the caramel.

974
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,960
Kate, you never did enough caramel.

975
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,240
All we got was your nut with a sort of lovely shard at the top.

976
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,360
We didn't get anything in the layers.

977
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,320
It was beautifully proportioned.

978
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,920
You had very good flavours in the top two layers,

979
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,480
not so good on the bottom.

980
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,840
Richard, on the other hand, you did a lot of caramel work on it

981
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,720
but it just looked a bit amateurish, that was part of the problem we had.

982
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,200
I do agree that it did look a bit messy,

983
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,840
and when it came to the caramel, we had spun sugar,

984
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,120
we had praline, we had crushed praline at the bottom,

985
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,000
so, as you can see, we were at loggerheads.

986
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,520
But a decision had to be made and so the person leaving us today is...

987
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,440
It's nobody, lads,

988
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,400
cos they were really rowing and it was really awful.

989
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,600
- Come on, come on! 
- See you all next week.

990
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,120
See you all next week.

991
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,000
Oh, that was really tough, that was really tough.

992
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,200
I think I completely dodged a bullet just now, erm, yeah.

993
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:52,440
Over the moon, getting ready to come back and redeem myself.

994
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,840
Next week, mate. Next week, remember...

995
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:59,440
I think that was the toughest week on Bake Off I can remember.

996
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,320
We had a little bit of a tiff.

997
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:05,600
On the whole, Paul and I agree because we have the same standards,

998
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,280
but, on this particular occasion, we definitely disagreed.

999
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,800
It was so close. First it was Richard, then it was Kate.

1000
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,200
Then it was Kate. Then it was Richard. Then it was Richard

1001
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,600
and Kate together. It was as simple as that. It was a draw.

1002
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,360
Listen, I'll see you next week.

1003
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,120
I don't feel relieved yet. I will.

1004
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,400
At the moment, I'm just...

1005
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,520
I'm not very good at coming last.

1006
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,240
Finally, finally!

1007
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,360
God, I'm still in shock!

1008
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,440
'It feels amazing.'

1009
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,280
It feels like all that planning

1010
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,160
and hard work has paid off.

1011
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:43,280
I'm just happy to have survived another week, so job's a good 'un.

1012
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,520
My family will be thrilled that I'm through another week.

1013
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,040
I mean, we still take every week as, like, a triumph.

1014
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,240
It's like, "Oh, my goodness, another week!"

1015
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,600
- Well done, my dear. 
- Thank you.
- Well done.

1016
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,920
Though it seems stressful,

1017
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,680
and you don't know what you're doing at times, but...

1018
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,880
At the end of the day, it's such fun.

1019
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,640
Next time...

1020
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,680
Oh!

1021
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,960
..the bakers face complex pastries...

1022
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,720
No excuses, it must be done in the time.

1023
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,400
Come on, pasties!

1024
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,960
..with a completely unknown Technical...

1025
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,560
I don't think I've ever even seen one of these.

1026
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,000
..a choux pastry Showstopper which has them reaching new heights.

1027
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,480
I was a bit bored so I thought I'd put a set of stairs.

1028
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,480
So this is your first eclair stair?

1029
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,600
'And the remaining six bakers...

1030
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,560
This is Paul Hollywood if I come last!

1031
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,120
'..battle it out for a place in the quarterfinals.'
