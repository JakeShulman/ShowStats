1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,640
At least the weather's good this year.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,000
Perfect for a picnic, isn't it?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,600
- Have you got your thermal girdle on? 
- Never off.
- Me too, I sleep in it.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,920
Welcome to the Great British Bake Off.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,080
Last time, the bakers tackled biscuits.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,960
Perfectly round.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,960
Richard's building skills prevailed in the Showstopper...

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,760
Absolutely ingenious.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
..winning him Star Baker.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,880
- It's not something I ever thought I'd get.
- Ah-ha.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,960
For others, it was a different story.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,600
- I'm not happy with them, they're going back in.
- It tastes burnt.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,800
- Welded.
- To de-stress, do you have any good sort of techniques?

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,120
- BEEPING SOUND 
- Yeah, bake properly.

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,480
And Enwezor...

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,040
You can almost bend it, see?

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,680
That's an issue for a biscuit.

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,000
..became the second baker to leave the Bake Off tent.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,480
Now the ten remaining bakers are taking on bread.

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,600
Rise!

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,000
Can they meet Paul's exacting standards with their rolls?

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,280
I've got to keep in the zone,

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,600
otherwise he'll shake me off balance.

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,200
Master the technically demanding ciabatta?

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,800
Oh, it's so stretchy!

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,240
And produce show-stopping filled loaves?

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,000
My last chance to rise to the challenge.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,200
Who will achieve bread perfection?

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
I think it's a bit of a success.

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,520
And who's Bake Off will come to a sticky end?

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,120
It'll either be great or a complete disaster.

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,880
Woo!

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,520
I don't think bread week holds any fear for you.

34
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,000
Does now!

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,720
The hair's silly, the glasses annoy me,

36
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,520
even your profile against that leaf is somewhat irking.

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,480
Are you trying to get a RISE out of me?

38
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,800
- BOTH:
- It's bread week.

39
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,240
Morning, bakers.

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,160
Welcome back to the high humidity

41
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,920
of a classic British summer and, um, today's challenge.

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,920
We would very much like you to bake 12 right royal rye rolls

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,240
which is our most alliterative challenge to date.

44
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,640
Now, this can be a German pumpernickel,

45
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,400
or you can go Nordic noir, or something Scandi and make a Killing.

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,480
It does not matter as long as they're beautifully presented,

47
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,240
and ready for Paul and Mary to get their choppers into.

48
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,640
Paul and Mary would like 12 of them, please,

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,680
and, above all else, they must be identical.

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,040
You've got three and a half hours on the clock, so,

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,320
- on your marks.
- Get set. 
- BOTH:
- Bake!

52
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,680
I haven't baked much with rye flour at all,

53
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,320
so, it's concentrated the mind, I think.

54
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,520
Rye bread has gained in popularity as a healthy alternative to wheat.

55
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,080
But the flour's low gluten content

56
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,160
could present a real challenge to our bakers.

57
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,920
I love rye, it just takes a little bit longer,

58
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,800
which is why I need to really rush!

59
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,760
Rye is an extremely difficult flour to work with.

60
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,360
Because it has less gluten, it's very tricky,

61
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,280
because you really have to work that protein to build the gluten up

62
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,200
to create the sacks that the air will sit inside.

63
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,280
Many of them will be adding black treacle,

64
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,760
honey and even cocoa, because they want it to be dark.

65
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,320
But the real danger is when they glaze it

66
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,000
and it gets too dark before the middle is done.

67
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,200
- Morning, Martha.
- Good morning.

68
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,320
So, what are you doing for your rye rolls?

69
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,120
I'm making date and walnut rye rolls.

70
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,960
Classic combination and you've got quite a dark colour there,

71
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,120
- what are you putting in there? 
- I've got treacle, I've put treacle in it.
- Using black treacle?
- Yes.

72
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,800
Martha's also adding honey to her date and walnut rye rolls.

73
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,160
When you put them in the oven, are you expecting a shine?

74
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,360
Yes, I've got an egg wash to put on the top of it,

75
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,120
- makes them a bit shinier. 
- That's very daring.

76
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,800
- Is it?
- Yeah, very.

77
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,880
- Daring to put an egg wash on? 
- Yeah. I won't tell you why,

78
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,200
I'll talk about it later, but good luck.

79
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,840
I don't think bread week holds any fear for you.

80
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,280
Does now!

81
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,240
I've got a wee touch of black treacle in them.

82
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Gives them a nice, mild sweetness and a bit of colour as well.

83
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,840
Norman's bakes have already been criticised for their simplicity,

84
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
but with his caraway seed and sultana rye rolls,

85
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,040
he's staying in his comfort zone.

86
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,280
I'm a traditional baker more than anything.

87
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,520
I'm no Heston Blumenthal.

88
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,600
While Martha and Norman have stuck to flavours traditionally added to rye,

89
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,120
Louis is going all-out to create something unique.

90
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,360
They're called opposites attract rolls,

91
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,440
which are two types of dough.

92
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,320
One of the doughs is pale

93
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,440
and the other dough is quite dark.

94
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,160
Luis is hoping that his marriage of pale fennel and parsnip dough,

95
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,040
with a darker dough made from carrots, coffee and chocolate

96
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,280
will pay off.

97
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,080
I'm on the Bake Off and you're here once,

98
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,600
so I want to do something that's a little bit different than just a normal roll,

99
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,880
so they'll either be great or a complete disaster.

100
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,120
If you're feeling a bit angry about something,

101
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,680
it's quite good to take it out on a bread dough,

102
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,240
rather than the dog.

103
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,320
This is an awful, awful dough to knead.

104
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,080
It has a really low gluten naturally,

105
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,720
which means that it takes a good, good while

106
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,480
for it to really start to come together like a dough.

107
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,560
Can you tell us about your rolls, please?

108
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,160
Yes, I'm making orange and cardamom knots,

109
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,080
with two different types of dough, then I'm knotting them together.

110
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,360
Kate's combined doughs will form her two-toned knots,

111
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,120
which she'll glaze with a sticky orange syrup.

112
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,840
That looks a nice, soft dough. Not too tight.

113
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,840
It's much easier, especially Kate, look at little Kate...

114
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,160
Yes, but I have big muscles, Mary.

115
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,760
My God, woman. You've got the face of a wood nymph

116
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,160
and the body of Ryan Gosling, look at that.

117
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,040
Morning!

118
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,640
Sorry, that's really worn me out...

119
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,680
- That's quite a work-out you're doing there.
- Yeah, about 13, 14 minutes.

120
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,640
It's very dry, but do you think you'll get the result from it?

121
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,200
Absolutely, this is how I've done it at home and I'm been very happy with my results.

122
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,520
Jordan's flavoured his dough with lemon, honey and poppy seeds.

123
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,080
Lemon and poppy seed is a very much a sort of muffin flavour.

124
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,680
They're really floral, which I quite like in my bread.

125
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,800
Well, we shall see.

126
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,400
I'm doing an American pumpernickel today.

127
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,960
You have a lot less rye, but a lot of extra flavouring

128
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,440
so I'm filling it with treacle and coffee and cinnamon.

129
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,600
Richard's also put cranberries in his dough

130
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,240
and the rolls will be sprinkled with caraway seeds.

131
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,440
Isn't pumpernickel a German brot?

132
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,800
Well, there's two types.

133
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,760
The American one is one they invented that was a quicker version.

134
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,520
There is only one pumpernickel, and that comes from Germany.

135
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,680
- Well, in that case I'm doing a poor facsimile of a pumpernickel.
- Yes!

136
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,600
Rye dough does take longer to knead but it shouldn't be over-worked.

137
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,880
I think this is called the window pane test.

138
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,920
You can see through it, means there's enough gluten developed.

139
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,080
Can you tell us about your bread rolls?

140
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,760
Yes, they are cheese and walnut rye rolls.

141
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,560
So what sort of cheeses have you got here?

142
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,920
There's some Shropshire Blue and a bit of Stilton.

143
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,800
- Will it melt?
- Yes.

144
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,920
Will that slow it down with the rising?

145
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,680
- I can't say that, Mary, because Diana's listening.
- Oh.

146
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,160
As well as cheese inside her dough,

147
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,080
Diana will top her flowerpot rolls with a cheese and nut butter.

148
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
I have not made much bread at all

149
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,080
but I've made more this week than I made for ever, really. Ha-ha!

150
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,320
The bakers must now leave their bread dough to rise

151
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,440
for at least an hour, until it's doubled in size.

152
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,640
Diana's the only one who's risked adding her fillings at this stage.

153
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,920
Go, go, go.

154
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,520
I hate the waiting.

155
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,160
I actually thought it'd be great, but I don't like it at all.

156
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,720
When you're a little bit nervous and edgy,

157
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,520
you need to be doing something.

158
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,320
Rise!

159
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,240
Another ten minutes should do it.

160
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,360
Ten minutes of waiting, doubting!

161
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,680
The dough is in the proving drawer

162
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,480
so I'm just doing the filling, which is onion and pine nuts.

163
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,200
Chetna has introduced pine nuts

164
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,240
to give an extra crunch to her onion rolls,

165
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,360
which she's serving with a lentil chutney.

166
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,360
What sort of consistency are you looking for?

167
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,600
It's not very light,

168
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,680
but it's slightly dense, but not extremely dense, I don't know.

169
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,280
That's a get-out-of-jail free card, that one.

170
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,160
That's covering all the bases, that one!

171
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,400
I'm going to do pear, cider and walnut.

172
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,000
And I'm putting a few dried pears in that have been soaked in some cider

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,320
but you don't actually see them, they just give you a sweetness.

174
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,160
Nancy's also incorporating pears into the topping for her rolls,

175
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,600
combining pear cider, walnut oil and rye flour

176
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,880
to form a yeasted crust.

177
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,280
The idea of putting the crust on the top, nice.

178
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,440
How long are you going to bake these for in the oven?

179
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,920
11-15 minutes How big are they? 70 grams.

180
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,720
They might need longer to crust the top

181
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,200
but 15 minutes, that's what I want to go for, really.

182
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,160
Whatever he says, you're not going to listen.

183
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,480
I've got to keep in the zone,

184
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,360
otherwise he'll shake me off balance.

185
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,280
I'm panicking about everything.

186
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,360
I know, and then I put an egg wash on mine and he was like,

187
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,240
"I'm not going to tell you why, but that's a bad idea."

188
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,200
- Did he?
- And I was like...

189
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,840
- What do you do, then? 
- I'm going to do it anyway.

190
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,840
With it being rye, it doesn't grow that much,

191
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,480
you need to leave it for hours and hours,

192
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,760
but it's definitely got air in it.

193
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
I'm just mixing the onion and pine nuts,

194
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,160
which are my main flavours.

195
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,080
Not an easy task.

196
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,480
As soon I start, it all keeps coming out!

197
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,000
The bakers' next hurdle

198
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,760
is to achieve 12 equal-sized, meticulously-shaped rolls.

199
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,840
Good little action going on there. It's a twist and fold, is it?

200
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,240
How would you describe that?

201
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,160
The more folds you can get in, the better, when you're on a time thing.

202
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,240
- Nice technique.
- Yeah?
- Unusual.

203
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,480
Good or bad unusual?

204
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,520
I've never seen rolls made like that before.

205
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,960
I think it's good, the sort of very gentlemanly way

206
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,040
you're approaching the dough. There's no slapping and crushing.

207
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,480
Iain's making cranberry and walnut rye bread rolls

208
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,160
with a hint of orange zest.

209
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,000
He's the only baker to use a sourdough starter to form his dough.

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,440
Has this been made today?

211
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,680
No, I made it, it's about five months old

212
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,160
- So you're going to keep it? 
- I'm going to keep it, yes.

213
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,080
It's like a little pet. Where do you leave it then, normally?

214
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,480
I leave it in a closet in my house.

215
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
You leave your pet in your closet?!

216
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
What kind of a dough owner are you?

217
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,680
The idea is, as the buns prove, this paste will crack,

218
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,320
so you get a really nice finish.

219
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,400
Right, now I'm going to put them in the proving drawer.

220
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,680
Let me see what temperature this is.

221
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,280
Oh, I love that!

222
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,120
What temperature am I, Norman?

223
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,000
- Slightly scared by that. Stun.
- 35.

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,520
- 35? Could I do you? 
- Yeah, I don't know what I am.

225
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,080
What do I do, just press?

226
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,360
- Press the button?
- Yep.

227
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,800
And let it go.

228
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,240
35.1, very good.

229
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,240
I'm a bit hotter, you're sending my temperature up just a wee bit.

230
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,400
By 0.1 degree! Thanks, Norman(!)

231
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,240
You're watering your pots. They're coming up nicely.

232
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,320
Well, let's hope so, cos Paul didn't think they would.

233
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,600
Bakers, just 30 minutes! 30 minutes left.

234
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,360
Fingers crossed.

235
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,760
I put the egg wash on. I think it makes it look nicer.

236
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,640
But Paul might not think that, which is a bit scary.

237
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,160
I'm doing an egg-white wash, rather than a yolk.

238
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,520
There'll probably be an incredibly obvious reason

239
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,920
why you shouldn't do this,

240
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,240
but I ain't going to find out unless I do it and get told off for it.

241
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,040
As well as a hot oven, the bread needs steam.

242
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,600
This stops the crust drying out,

243
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,760
so the bread can rise higher and move evenly.

244
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,640
With a rye roll, if it's got a little bit of a tinge,

245
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,280
it's probably not too bad, but under-baked, they'll be disgusting.

246
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,800
It's comparable to the start line of a marathon.

247
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,760
I've only done one, but I felt this frightened then.

248
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,640
Yeah.

249
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,120
They're looking browner with each second.

250
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,840
Stressful! Just don't know - when's the right time?

251
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,800
I think they sound hollow.

252
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,480
This is not cooked.

253
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,360
Oh, no, a bit longer.

254
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,880
Don't know what I'm doing.

255
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,480
OK, bakers, five minutes

256
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,520
before we unleash Mary Berry and the Mahogany Tiger.

257
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,640
I'm happy with them.

258
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,000
Perfect, perfect.

259
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,520
They're like lovely apples, aren't they?

260
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,800
- Rolled rolls, aren't they? That's the...
- Beautiful.

261
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,840
Whoo!

262
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,200
Dropped rolls, never good.

263
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,560
Some of them are a little bit too dark

264
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,600
but the majority of them are OK.

265
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,120
I don't think perhaps I could have done any better

266
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,320
but they're not bad.

267
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,360
Oh, everybody's baskets are ready.

268
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,480
Bakers, I hope you're rocking and rolling.

269
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,520
You've got one minute left on your rolls.

270
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,080
OK, bakers, that's it. Stand away from your hot baps! Stand away!

271
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,320
They WILL be tasty.

272
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,400
Well, Nancy, you've cracked it. They look stunning.

273
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,160
Thank you.

274
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,520
It comes down to the bake

275
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,760
cos, again, putting the crust on it hides what the bread is all about.

276
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,520
The pear that you've got in there, the cider, it tastes beautiful.

277
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,160
It's slightly under-baked. Needed about another five,

278
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,640
possibly ten minutes wouldn't have done it any harm,

279
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,800
- and they would have been almost perfection.
- Thank you.

280
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,480
It does look rather flat,

281
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,480
and I would have thought they should have been more dome-like. OK.

282
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,960
The reason why it flattens out is down to the mixing.

283
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,600
You haven't mixed the gluten strong enough, so it collapses,

284
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
or you haven't shaped it.

285
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,760
Having said all that, the flavour is absolutely delicious. Well done.

286
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,920
Thank you.

287
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,680
It's a nice texture inside, isn't it?

288
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,920
It's well baked, you've got a lovely flavour.

289
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,200
The orange is coming through with the cranberry. That is a nice roll.

290
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,240
Thank you.

291
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,680
It's a good flavour.

292
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,920
(Thank you.)

293
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,000
But...

294
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,120
because you put the glaze on the top,

295
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,400
which has falsely accused the roll of being ready,

296
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,560
- you brought it out too early.
- OK.

297
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,880
Open this fella up.

298
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,560
I think it's just a little bit simple.

299
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,680
- Mm.
- It kind of reflects my personality a wee bit, then.

300
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,720
Nothing, Norman. Son of a baker like me, nothing wrong with that at all.

301
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,440
- The appearance is not very appealing.
- No.

302
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,240
If you were to take one of these

303
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,160
- and get rid of all the extra bit on the side, like that.
- Yes.

304
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,960
- See how much prettier that looks? 
- Yeah.

305
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,400
I think the flavour's pretty good, actually,

306
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,720
- and you've got a lovely bake.
- Yes. 
- Actually, that is a nice roll.

307
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,000
I think they look OK.

308
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,680
I don't like these lines when you see

309
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,040
where the glaze finishes and the roll starts.

310
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,440
Let's open it up.

311
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,040
- Looks good.
- It does, to me, look a little bit under-baked inside.

312
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,240
When you push it down, it sticks to the bottom.

313
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,280
- I love the crust on it.
- Thank you.

314
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,400
- Probably could do with being a little bit slacker.
- Mm-hm.

315
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,440
But the flavour's good.

316
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,720
I like that blend of spelt and rye as well.

317
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,360
Thank you very, very much.

318
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,600
They look very inviting.

319
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,200
Yeah, they've got a nice bake.

320
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,920
The blend you've got between the orange and cardamom

321
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,360
is absolutely spot-on.

322
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,760
It's really scrumptious, and the orange is just perfect.

323
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,760
And it's coming through just a little with the other spice.

324
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,400
You've just made my year!

325
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,760
SHE LAUGHS

326
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,840
That's so pretty on the inside, isn't it? Look at that.

327
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,360
Very clever. And it is baked very well, I can see that.

328
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,960
- I like that.
- Mmm.

329
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,760
Pure alchemy.

330
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,680
I was thinking "too many flavours".

331
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,800
But, actually...

332
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,880
- well done, mate. 
- Wow! Thank you very much!

333
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,680
I was really delighted.

334
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,000
For Paul Hollywood to shake your hand in Bread Week,

335
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,320
job's a good 'un.

336
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,520
Every week so far, I've been thinking

337
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,040
"When am I going to go? This is terrible, terrifying."

338
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,400
But now, for the first time, I don't feel like that.

339
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,360
I feel...delighted.

340
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,320
In the 17th century,

341
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,280
all you really needed to mark a special occasion was a wig.

342
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,760
No, not like the one I'm wearing, but a spiced dough.

343
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,240
For centuries, the spice trade was dominated

344
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,640
by nations like the Dutch and the Portuguese

345
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,520
and spices were an expensive luxury.

346
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,400
Then Britain got in on the action.

347
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,680
Thanks to a royal charter issued in 1600 by Queen Elizabeth I,

348
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,320
the East India Company was formed in London,

349
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,440
and Britain slowly saw the rise in affordable spices

350
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,400
such as mace, cinnamon and nutmeg.

351
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,680
As they became more readily available,

352
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,280
spices began to make their way into everyday British food

353
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,240
and, in particular, bread.

354
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,800
One of the spiced breads that gained a huge following during the period

355
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,920
were wigs.

356
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,640
This isn't the Great British Hair Piece, this is a baking show!

357
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,840
What's a wig?

358
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,960
Well, apart from the thing you put on your head,

359
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,000
it's a fortified bread with a lot of spice in.

360
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,800
Delicious. Now I notice you have a spice dungeon.

361
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,400
What kind of spices would I use for this wig?

362
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,840
Bit of mace, and a bit of nutmeg, we're also going to use cloves.

363
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,440
The other things we also need to use is caraway seeds

364
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,960
but we won't crush those up, we will put those in whole.

365
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,040
Which recipe book is this one from, this wig?

366
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,520
This is from E Smith, The Compleat Housewife,

367
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,920
which was first published in 1758.

368
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,680
Let's pop this in here.

369
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,240
So am I going to knead this?

370
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,640
Yes, you're just going to knead it all in.

371
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,080
Spiced doughs, such as wigs, were the start of British fascination

372
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,760
with sweet breads, cakes and puddings.

373
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,600
Famous diarist Samuel Pepys was partial to a wig.

374
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,480
He wrote of eating one with his ale.

375
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,760
So, happy with that. Let's taste these.

376
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,120
- Amazing. It's like a proto-hot cross bun.
- Yeah.

377
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,560
Right, well...

378
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,080
..you get back with all the other cooks into quarters,

379
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,880
I'm going to stay up here and just binge myself witless.

380
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,160
The next challenge is the nerve-inducing technical.

381
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,280
With only a basic recipe to follow, the bakers must rely

382
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,960
on their own bread-baking knowledge to get it right.

383
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,000
Bakers, this is your bread technical challenge.

384
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,440
Now, you're going to be baking one of Paul's recipes.

385
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,840
So, Paul, as the voice of bread,

386
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,520
any advice or words of encouragement for the gang?

387
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,680
Be patient.

388
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,920
- "Be patient".
- Yeah.

389
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,840
All right, we're now going to ask Paul and Mary to leave the tent.

390
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,320
- Off you go, Bez. 
- Everything will come, Grasshopper.

391
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,640
Today, we would like you to bake

392
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,160
four

393
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,240
perfect

394
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,400
ciabatta.

395
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,080
It should be a crisp, floury surface

396
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,120
and, inside, you want big, visible air holes.

397
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,120
You've got three hours to get your four perfect ciabatta out.

398
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,400
- On your marks.
- Get set. BOTH:
- Bake!

399
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,800
Be patient!

400
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,080
Italian bakers became worried that the French baguette

401
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,600
was becoming too popular in Italy.

402
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,080
So they developed a rival bread - ciabatta.

403
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,560
I've never made it.

404
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,840
It's kind of like,

405
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,560
long,

406
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,600
oblong-shaped bread.

407
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,320
I have made it a while ago, and I know the pitfalls.

408
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,640
I don't know if I know how to avoid those pitfalls.

409
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,440
There's a reason why I said "be patient".

410
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,320
Because take this dough too early

411
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,200
and the air holes will be very small.

412
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,800
Take it too late and it'll go flat as a pancake.

413
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,040
So it's all about the timing.

414
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,360
There you go, Mary.

415
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,400
And, see, you've got an irregular structure

416
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,760
all the way through the loaf,

417
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,000
it's a sign that you've made a decent ciabatta.

418
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,040
I don't know when I've enjoyed bread more.

419
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,680
I know it's meant to be a wet dough

420
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,920
but, beyond that, I'm all at sea.

421
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,040
The dough's really slack,

422
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,040
so the yeast can push air bubbles a lot easier

423
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,800
than a thick, heavy dough.

424
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,160
If I put a spatula in and pull it out,

425
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,560
you get this massive, like, sticky trail.

426
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,000
And I think that means there's enough gluten developed.

427
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,000
It says "oil a container, tip this into there and then leave it."

428
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,680
For an undisclosed amount of time.

429
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,600
So thanks, Paul. Nice one(!)

430
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,640
The first rise is crucial for the success of ciabatta.

431
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,240
Well, it says prove at room temperature,

432
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,760
so I'm going to keep it out.

433
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,640
The proving drawer is for proving,

434
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,120
so you'd think that you would use it.

435
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,560
But maybe that's completely wrong.

436
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,640
What some of the bakers don't realise

437
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,840
is that the proving drawer will over-activate the dough.

438
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,480
It will rise, but it won't hold its shape.

439
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,000
It said to prove it at room temperature.

440
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,320
Which is the only reason I've not put it in, so...

441
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,160
I thought, "The sun's out..."

442
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,960
God, it's changing in a second.

443
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,040
It's just got a bit rainy, got a bit cold in here,

444
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,640
so I'm going to pop it in there, in the proving drawer,

445
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,400
just to bring it up a bit and I might take it out again later on.

446
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,280
Really, I'm just going to go with my heart and see what happens.

447
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,280
I'm not going to look at everybody else's,

448
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,840
cos they're all using proving drawers and I'm not.

449
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,040
I'm going to stick with my guns.

450
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,320
Yeah.

451
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,320
Most people are using proving drawers.

452
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
In fact there's one, two, three, four...

453
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,640
Don't buckle.

454
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,240
Did his advice make any sense to you

455
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,160
when he said the rather enigmatic, "Be patient"?

456
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,560
- Does that make sense? 
- Afterwards, yes.

457
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,760
- So what was he referring to? 
- This bit, wait. Wait.
- OK.

458
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,880
So who's going to be the first to start doing something, though?

459
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,920
Not me.

460
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,480
That's the chat round the tent.

461
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,760
Who's going to crack first and shape it?

462
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,640
See, that's an hour.

463
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,520
ALARM SOUNDS

464
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,960
Someone's going to break the seal, someone's got to do it

465
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,360
so just keep an eye out.

466
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,400
Martha's thinking about it, Nancy's tempted.

467
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,880
- Chetna's flouring!
- What?!

468
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,040
Chetna's flouring! Are you just going to wait, just hang on?

469
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,320
Till the last second.

470
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,200
Jordan's taken his out.

471
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,480
Oh, yes!

472
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,440
- That's like something out of a John Carpenter film!
- It is.

473
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,800
I don't know if that's what's supposed to happen.

474
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,160
It's slightly better than I thought. I expected it just to go "bleurgh!"

475
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,760
I want to maintain as many bubbles as possible,

476
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,040
which is why I've just tipped it out.

477
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,080
Oh, it's so stretchy! Ahh!

478
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,840
- The Blob is about to be bisected. 
- It is.

479
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,200
- Have they given you a clue as to the shape?
- Nope.

480
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,640
Make it pretty, make it pretty.

481
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,760
The things you need to do are flour your board very well,

482
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,960
and give a good dust of semolina top and bottom

483
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,280
before you cut up the ciabatta.

484
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,560
I don't know how to make it not stick! Oh, please-ah!

485
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,840
I'm not thinking that oil's the right thing.

486
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,560
No oil in the recipe.

487
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,240
The less you handle it, the less air you'll knock out of it.

488
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,640
Don't touch it too much.

489
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,600
Something like that?

490
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,800
HE SIGHS

491
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,720
I don't even know how to pick it up.

492
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,480
You've really taken this whole "be patient" mantra

493
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,440
- to its fullest conclusion, cos you're the last to tip out.
- I am.

494
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,680
Ooh, what?!

495
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,760
I'm thinking tip gently...

496
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,360
Ooh! That is bubblicious, girl!

497
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,360
They've got lots of air in them already,

498
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,120
so I think it's just a case of a short prove

499
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,480
just to let the air build up again, cos they've been handled.

500
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,760
IN ITALIAN:

501
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,080
Cook my pretties, cook!

502
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,480
I'm just keeping a close eye on these ciabattas,

503
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,280
so they go golden but not too far.

504
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,880
I was going to go with 20.

505
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,640
I'm now thinking 15.

506
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,720
OK, bakers, after sitting on your backsides for two hours 55 minutes,

507
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,240
being patient,

508
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,040
I can now bring you the drama of just five minutes remaining!

509
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,200
OK...

510
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,160
They look a bit like slippers, actually. I could hollow them out...

511
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,480
The word in Italian for slipper is "ciabatta"!

512
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,080
- That's it - slip those on your feet. 
- Slip them on.

513
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,880
I think they're all right.

514
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,720
Look like ciabattas - I don't know.

515
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,120
I think they look quite golden brown.

516
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,160
Quite a lot of flour on them, it's quite hard to tell.

517
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,400
Oh, lovely.

518
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,240
Oh, that's a good aroma!

519
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,640
I'm happy with everything apart from the shape.

520
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,320
OK, bakers, the ciabatta challenge is done.

521
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,640
If you'd like to bring your bakes up to the table of doom

522
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,040
and place them behind the photograph of yourself.

523
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,520
Paul and Mary are looking for a ciabatta with a strong crust,

524
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,800
good dome and an airy structure.

525
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,680
And they'll have no idea

526
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,720
whose loaf they're judging.

527
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,960
Right.

528
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,840
We'll start with this one.

529
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,120
We were actually looking for a ciabatta rather than a pitta.

530
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,320
If you try and speed up the growth of a ciabatta in a warmer,

531
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,000
you will have a problem,

532
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,720
because you're forcing heat into it

533
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,480
and it should be a slow rise in a normal heat.

534
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,760
The next one, however, looks a little bit more like a ciabatta.

535
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,040
- And it's got this nice, floury top. 
- It's chewy. Good flavour.

536
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Now these look very flat and over-proved.

537
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,680
- But it tastes good... 
- It's a good flavour.

538
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,320
But we've got a pitta bread again.

539
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,000
And here we have one

540
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,720
that is much higher

541
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,080
- than all the others.
- Mm-hm.

542
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,120
The structure's OK, I'm just wondering...

543
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,040
It's almost been pounded again, all the air's gone out of it again,

544
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,760
it's been shaped.

545
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,960
- Tastes all right.
- Mm, tastes good.

546
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,040
These aren't too bad,

547
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,480
the length is good on this one.

548
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,520
It could have done with longer proving, though.

549
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,720
I like the colour, it's got a very good crust.

550
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,120
Yeah, the crust is good, it's nice, it's strong.

551
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,400
The next one, similar problem, could have been forced into heat.

552
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,680
And, also, this one in particular

553
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,040
looks a rather uneven shape.

554
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,680
The height of this one's better

555
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,400
cos the structure's very good.

556
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,120
The skin's good, the colour's good.

557
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,280
- Again...
- Nice flavour. 
- ..it tastes right.

558
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,120
Moving onto this one, we've got a pitta,

559
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,680
it's probably been forced, again, in heat.

560
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,880
This has got a very strange appearance -

561
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,480
could this be oil here?

562
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,760
Yeah, it is olive oil.

563
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,120
- It just doesn't look right, does it?
- Mm-mm.

564
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,160
OK, I think this has been handled again,

565
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,240
tried to be shaped into a size rather than just stretched.

566
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,920
Now, this one has got a nice colour.

567
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,880
It's got a lovely crumb structure at the top.

568
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,760
- It's got a lovely crust.
- Mm.

569
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,640
It seems right except for the shape.

570
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,320
It just needed to be slightly longer again.

571
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,040
Paul and Mary must now decide who they rank bottom

572
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,760
and who's come top.

573
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,000
So, in tenth position, this one - who's that?

574
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,760
It's me. Exactly as you said,

575
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,000
I didn't want to use flour, so I used olive oil.

576
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And turns out that was the wrong thing to do!

577
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,840
In number ninth place is this one.

578
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,760
Too flat.

579
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,680
Number eight is this one.

580
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,760
A little misshapen, and a bit flat.

581
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,320
Diana is seventh,

582
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,640
Richard sixth,

583
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,880
Nancy fifth

584
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,240
and Norman is fourth.

585
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,000
Number three is this one.

586
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,520
Lovely shape, it was a good size, actually,

587
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,120
but it just needed to be left a little bit longer to prove

588
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,560
before you put it in the oven.

589
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,040
And number two is here.

590
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,920
A bit too big, but a nice flavour.

591
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,840
- Thank you.
- That was very good.

592
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,120
It was a toss-up, actually,

593
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,800
because obviously number one is this one, who's this?

594
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,320
It's me.

595
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,800
- Well done.
- Well done, Kate.

596
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,440
APPLAUSE

597
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,800
I can't believe it!

598
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,560
Might have been handled a little bit,

599
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,560
but you had a nice structure on the top,

600
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,200
good height to it as well, and a good consistency.

601
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,200
And guess what, Paul? She WAS the most patient.

602
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,160
I had it in my head what I was going to do

603
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:06,960
and, for some reason, a calm came over me and I did it.

604
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,680
I'm going to do that again.

605
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:14,240
So far I've been 11th, 10th and now 4th, so that's a result.

606
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,560
Next week, first.

607
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,840
Like last week, game of two halves, one good one and one bad one.

608
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,040
So, still tomorrow.

609
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,360
I shall hopefully get a good one in again.

610
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,720
Who's at the top of the pile? Who's looking really good this week?

611
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,240
Luis and Kate, definitely.

612
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,560
She seems to have just got better and better each week.

613
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,000
She has great skills and she's very calm.

614
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,600
And Luis - very inventive.

615
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,080
I think the rest of them are all pretty much bunched together,

616
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,320
so I think...

617
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,040
You know, they have a bad day,

618
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,160
it's going to be tricky.

619
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,880
Says Paul, and then smiles.

620
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,520
Good morning, bakers, and welcome to your bread Showstopper.

621
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,120
Now, for this challenge,

622
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,960
Paul and Mary would like you to make a bread centrepiece -

623
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,520
forget flowers and candles, think dough.

624
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,880
Now, we'd like you to make a filled loaf.

625
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,320
It could be stuffed, it could be rolled,

626
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,240
you could do a tear and share, or a keep and weep.

627
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,000
The most important things to remember are these -

628
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,640
spectacular on the outside, it's got to look good on the inside,

629
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,360
and taste delicious.

630
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,680
You've got four hours on the clock.

631
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,880
- On your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake!

632
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,520
My last chance to rise to the challenge,

633
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,520
because if I don't have a strong Showstopper here, I'm going out.

634
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,960
There's certain pitfalls which the bakers could have

635
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,560
during this challenge, and the main one is moisture.

636
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,400
If you use a vegetable or any fruit that releases moisture,

637
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,120
produces steam as it bakes,

638
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,880
you end up with a big, huge air hole -

639
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,280
and you don't want that.

640
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,880
The very first thing we'll be looking for is the appearance,

641
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,160
the design, the crust,

642
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,480
and we want the dough to be cooked all the way through.

643
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,480
So we are seeking perfection.

644
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,920
- Morning, Kate.
- Hi!

645
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,000
What are you doing for your Showstopper?

646
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,960
I am doing a prosciutto, olive and coriander bread.

647
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,480
It's a very Greek dish. Having lived out there for six years

648
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,360
- making bread out there for six years...
- OK.

649
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,920
..coriander is all over the place.

650
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,560
- I've been worried about it. 
- Coriander and olive...
- Together?

651
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,000
..is what they always, always do -

652
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
- they also add onion to it as well. 
- Oh, really?

653
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,480
- You're adding prosciutto - that's the difference.
- Yeah.

654
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,800
It'll be fascinating to see how the texture turns out

655
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,400
- with all those ingredients in.
- Yeah.

656
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,120
I'm quite interested to see that, too!

657
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,760
All the bakers have chosen a strong white flour for their dough,

658
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,480
but Luis has added saffron to create a very special kind of bread.

659
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,120
I'm making a Roscon de Reyes today,

660
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,920
which is a traditional Spanish bread

661
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,440
which is usually eaten around Epiphany,

662
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,160
which is just after Christmas,

663
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,920
which is when the three kings visited Jesus.

664
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,120
Luis' Spanish loaf will be packed full of flavours, and form a crown.

665
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,880
It's always a really ornately decorated bread,

666
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,400
because it's supposed to be a celebration of the gifts.

667
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,880
Jordan's also making a white flour dough

668
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,080
but he's adding sugar, milk and butter.

669
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,120
I'm making a strawberry and raspberry cheesecake brioche.

670
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,920
As for why, er, it's my favourite bread.

671
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,600
It turns out I'm the only one doing sweet, as well, in the ten -

672
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,960
which will hopefully play to my advantage.

673
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,320
Jordan's sweet centrepiece

674
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,040
will feature layers of cream cheese

675
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,960
and raspberry and strawberry compote.

676
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,760
I like to take the best bits of different foods

677
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,600
and push them together.

678
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,960
So I really like cheesecake,

679
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,480
I really like brioche and I really like strawberries and raspberries.

680
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,640
So if you mash them all together in one big loaf,

681
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,800
it's tasty.

682
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,760
- At least
- I
- think it's tasty.

683
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,640
- So, Diana, tell us all about your loaf.
- Yes.

684
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,560
I'm calling it UK/Italian Pinwheel and making five pinwheels in there.

685
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,360
When I take that off we'll make a sunburst.

686
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,160
- Wow.
- And in the middle of that I'm going to put a pot of chilli jam.

687
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,240
'Diana has used the Italian Tricolore as inspiration

688
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,080
'for her savoury pinwheel containing Parmesan spinach and ham.'

689
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,760
So, the overall idea - you're building it in there,

690
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,160
creating the whole image and then popping the ring off

691
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,280
- and then pulling out the end bits of the wheel.
- The tail...

692
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,680
Now, you may be able to tell me -

693
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,640
no, you're not going to tell me, are you? -

694
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,080
but the last inch of that tail,

695
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,080
either oil or flour to stop it sticking to the pinwheel

696
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,120
so that it comes out.

697
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,000
- Good luck.
- Yes.
- I've tried... You're not going to tell me!

698
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,520
I'm going to make a white bread loaf.

699
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,320
It'll be stuffed with chicken and pesto

700
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,600
with roasted vegetables and sun-dried tomatoes.

701
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,480
Nothing too fancy, just enough to satisfy the most discerning palate.

702
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,920
Norman's aiming for a sophisticated finish,

703
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,920
coating his picnic loaf with rosemary-infused olive oil,

704
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,920
sea salt and oregano.

705
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,120
Goes nice with a glass of Chateauneuf-du-Pape.

706
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,640
I'm making a pinwheel shaped tear and share

707
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,200
with pesto and roasted veg.

708
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,760
This is my normal loaf bread

709
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,280
so, if I muck this one up, I'm really off my game today.

710
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,840
Richard's pesto pinwheel with feta and walnuts is a family favourite.

711
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,760
I think I've probably made this one about 20 or 30 times.

712
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,720
You practised it 20 times?!

713
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,800
I haven't practised it, I've made it to eat!

714
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,160
That's fine.

715
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,640
Now what comes next?

716
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,960
The vegetables.

717
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,840
Whilst Norman, Richard and Luis have drawn on Mediterranean flavours

718
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,920
for their fillings, Martha's inspiration is decidedly Gallic.

719
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,880
I've got a small Epoisses cheese I'm going to bake into the middle of it,

720
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,240
and I'm going to make it like a sunflower, hopefully.

721
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,760
- Epoisses?
- Yes.
- Never heard of it.

722
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,440
- You've never tried Epoisses? 
- No, I've never tried it, Martha!

723
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,280
- It's one of the smelliest cheeses. 
- Oh, my days, it's one of those,

724
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,320
- in the, um...
- Yep.

725
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,120
- I think it's banned from public transport in France.
- It is indeed.

726
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,840
I took it on the train here and I was like, "Sorry, everybody!"

727
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,080
The smellier the better!

728
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,640
Martha's sunflower is designed to be cut open

729
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,520
to reveal an Epoisses fondue

730
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,080
with petals filled with apricot

731
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,200
or fig chutney.

732
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,440
It's a nice idea, where did you get the idea for this?

733
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,600
I don't know - I've made camembert baked in a bread

734
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,800
- for my family before.
- Mm-hm. 
- So I just thought...

735
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,840
SHE LAUGHS

736
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,080
That is like essence of a thousand students' socks.

737
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,160
I'm making a Moroccan-themed plait.

738
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,520
I'm going to wrap it round a tagine and have a dip in the tagine,

739
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,000
and the bread will be round the outside of it.

740
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Iain's plait will be studded with black olives and served with a dip

741
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,120
made from broad beans, lemon, cumin and paprika.

742
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,480
I visited Morocco a couple of years ago

743
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,480
and spent a couple of weeks travelling around,

744
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,400
so I just really enjoyed the food there

745
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,120
and I really enjoyed the flavours.

746
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,880
Can you tell us about your bread?

747
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,360
Yes, I'm doing white bread

748
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,840
and I'm going to stuff it

749
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,600
with a cauliflower, potato, tomato kind of mixture

750
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:38,080
with onion and fresh curry leaves and a lot of spices.

751
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,880
Surprise, surprise!

752
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,280
Lovely.

753
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,720
This time, Chetna is incorporating her chutney into her bake.

754
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,120
She's decorating her loaf with a bread spiral

755
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,600
filled with mango chutney.

756
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,920
Are you going to get a gap?

757
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,640
Because what tends to happen is when you get a filling in a loaf

758
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,040
and you're using the dome you've got bread, bread,

759
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,920
- you will have this gap sort of in the middle.
- Oh!

760
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,520
Ooh, there's a good smell.

761
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,000
Lovely sausages, bacon, mushrooms - breakfast?

762
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,040
- Yes.
- Tell us.

763
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:16,360
I'm going to do a stromboli, which is an Italian rolled bread,

764
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,560
but I've called it a full English stromboli.

765
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,080
So I'm doing bacon, eggs, sausage, mushrooms,

766
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,880
tomatoes and home-made ketchup.

767
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,320
Please hurry up, cos we're hungry!

768
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,000
For an added twist,

769
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,760
Nancy's using quail's eggs in her full English

770
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,400
and her ketchup is made from home-grown damsons.

771
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,760
One of the issues is, you get big gaps.

772
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,880
I'm going to try and roll it fairly tightly,

773
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,120
and I'm trying not to have a lot of moisture going on.

774
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,480
- Are there baked beans in it, Nancy? 
- No baked beans, no.

775
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,280
- Black pudding?
- They're on the side. 
- Good, baked beans on the side.

776
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,320
I can't wait.

777
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,400
By the time the dough has risen to the bakers' satisfaction...

778
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,840
It's looking huge!

779
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,280
- It's bigger than your head!
- It is!

780
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,480
Cool.

781
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,240
..they only have two hours left

782
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,840
to shape, fill and bake their Showstoppers.

783
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,040
Are you a competitive person?

784
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,360
Oh, gosh.

785
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,400
Little bit.

786
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,800
- I have entered the local competitions a bit recently...
- Yes.

787
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,440
- ..and quite enjoyed that, so... 
- Does that mean you won?

788
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,600
- Yeah, I did. 
- SHE LAUGHS

789
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,960
Oh, I love the euphemism! "I quite enjoyed that."

790
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,160
I'm just doing loads of coriander.

791
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,760
I want the fragrance of the coriander to punch through a bit.

792
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,320
I'm just wrapping the cheese up in the dough.

793
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,520
It's really important that it's a good seal,

794
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,840
because if the cheese leaks out, the bread will be rubbish.

795
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,920
My wife and I are both quite OCD

796
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,880
about things being the right shape and size,

797
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,720
so, yeah, it's a bit of a hangover from home

798
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,200
but it helps in being a builder, everyone wants things to fit.

799
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,360
Jordan did say he was doing another twisty shape,

800
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,640
but he's doing his sweet, I'm doing mine savoury.

801
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,800
So mine can be dinner and his can be pudding.

802
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:22,320
One...two. You look it at, and it looks so pink and messy,

803
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,080
but actually when it bakes, you don't notice that,

804
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,720
I don't know, it seems to absorb into the bread

805
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,840
far more than you would think.

806
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,080
I'm going for the posh rustic look.

807
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,600
If it's home-made, it should look home-made.

808
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,280
I'm feeling a bit more tense now

809
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,560
because this is the most crucial part -

810
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,280
just getting the plait right.

811
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,960
There's a lot of petal on the top,

812
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,440
and there's slightly sparse petal action at the bottom.

813
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,840
- Oh, no, I think I might have put... 
- Have I distracted you?

814
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,640
- What have you done?
- Well, some of them are fig and some are apricot

815
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,000
and it's meant to alternate...

816
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,880
but I think I've forgotten where I put them.

817
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,280
Oh, no! I have no idea.

818
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,360
Um...smell them, smell them.

819
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,320
Smell - fig, apricot.

820
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,720
- , I've got flour on my nose now... 
- I'm just getting dough!

821
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,600
Martha! What are we going to do?

822
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,240
Just giving it a light spray

823
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,480
just to keep the dough moist while it proves,

824
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,840
so I'm going to pop it in a bag

825
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,640
and then pop it back in the proving drawer.

826
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,400
I've never glazed any fruit in my life,

827
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,960
this was me going home last week

828
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,120
and thinking, "How do I take my loaf that I know tastes really nice

829
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,920
"and make it look Showstoppery?"

830
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,840
Because that's what I struggled on every single week,

831
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,600
is just making it look as pretty as everyone else's.

832
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,800
Thanks, Kate, you're a legend.

833
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,000
- I can smell that saffron, it's lovely!
- Yeah.

834
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,160
That's amazing.

835
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,120
It's a lot stronger than the one I had at home.

836
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,840
The final task before baking

837
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,320
is the all-important decoration of the centrepiece loaves.

838
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,680
Enormous bread is going in.

839
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,600
All I can do is sit on the floor and stare at my bread

840
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,480
and hope that it bakes properly.

841
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,760
We'll see. Keep your fingers crossed for me.

842
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,240
There's really not a way to tell if it's cooked inside,

843
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,320
because you can't tap and check,

844
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,200
it's filled inside - you can't do the temperature check because...

845
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,520
Oh, it's just...

846
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,720
- It's looking splendid, isn't it? 
- Yeah.

847
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,080
Who'd have thought that a browning plait could be so interesting?

848
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,280
It's huge!

849
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,160
With bread, that's good, though.

850
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,920
It hasn't broken through the sides, so...

851
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,840
Actually, I quite like it broken through the sides,

852
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,560
but it's not good when you're under scrutiny, is it, really?

853
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,480
Pleased with the way it looks?

854
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,200
Yes. Once it's nicely browned, I'll take it out of the oven,

855
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,240
and then I'll coat it with the rosemary-infused olive oil

856
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,640
- to give it a...
- Very, very nice..

857
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,200
Because Mr Hollywood likes lots of flavour, you know?

858
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,320
Now, I sense that, um, Mr Hollywood has irked you, somewhat.

859
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:11,040
Not at all! He did say my rolls were a bit bland.

860
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,280
For me this is very exotic. You know - pesto.

861
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,160
OK, bakers, you've got five minutes.

862
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,200
If you listen to it, you can hear the cheese on the inside bubbling.

863
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,080
FAINT BUBBLING

864
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,000
- I can hear the cheese. 
- That's the cheese.

865
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,400
- That is artistry.
- Thank you!

866
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,320
I was really fearful that it was going to burst

867
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,040
and the filling come out. Somebody must be watching over me.

868
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,480
That's quite simply the biggest bread table decoration

869
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,520
I've ever seen.

870
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,080
SINGS: Doo, doo, doo, doo...

871
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,000
So, Captain Chaos, how many times have you made this?

872
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,840
- You said that you've made it a lot. 
- Yeah, more than I care to count.

873
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,360
How many times has it worked?

874
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,560
Er, it's only not worked twice.

875
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,320
Which was actually this week, when I was practising.

876
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,000
This is not good, this is not good,

877
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,880
I feel like the angel of doom.

878
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,440
Five - come on - four, three,

879
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,000
two - stop touching your dough-balls - one...

880
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,160
OK, the bake's over. We're done.

881
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,160
Richard, do you want to bring

882
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,880
your lovely bread up, please?

883
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,920
Well, we can see that precision is part of you.

884
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,720
It looks very neat.

885
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,520
You baked it really well, actually.

886
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,520
- (Phew).
- The flavour and the texture works extremely well.

887
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,080
And I love the pesto - you made your own pesto, didn't you?

888
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,200
- I did.
- It's nice.

889
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,120
That's a very, very nice loaf.

890
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,360
- Thank you.
- Very nice.

891
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,120
What are we expecting just inside there?

892
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,000
They're kind of alternating fig chutney and apricot chutney.

893
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,440
I don't think I've alternated them!

894
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,440
Think I might have had a mix-up... with alternation.

895
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,120
- You got two the same.
- Oh!

896
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:32,720
- There is definitely apricot in there somewhere!
- Rip all the legs off!

897
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,160
- Ah, there's one.
- There's one.

898
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,040
- I've got one 
- Oh, that's embarrassing.

899
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,960
I quite like the idea of the figs with it.

900
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,960
I like figs and cheese together.

901
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,800
I think the idea was very good.

902
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,360
I just think you could have neatened up slightly on the legs,

903
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,040
- and a little bit longer in the oven.
- OK.

904
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,520
Norman,

905
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,800
we're looking for something very spectacular.

906
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,720
Now to me, that looks like a very nice family pie.

907
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,800
I'm just hoping that there's more excitement

908
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,640
when we get inside that you've described.

909
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,720
I don't think you'll be disappointed.

910
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,560
I think the issue is down at the bottom,

911
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,760
- where it is just raw dough.
- Uh-huh.

912
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,960
It doesn't...

913
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,640
- you know, excite me.
- OK.

914
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,840
Um, it's a bit messy on the top.

915
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,000
Your dough's not been mixed enough.

916
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,480
It doesn't take much to turn that back to dough.

917
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,200
Wonderful flavours, and they all blend together.

918
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,360
It's just a bit cakey, rather than bready.

919
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,840
Nice and crispy.

920
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,760
You've got a lovely crisp to it,

921
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,200
and the texture of the crumb is very good.

922
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,720
I think it tastes great.

923
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,160
And the plait's pretty good, too.

924
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,240
I think it's a bit of a success.

925
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,480
- Thank you.
- Very good.

926
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,520
Dying to see what it's like inside.

927
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,200
I thought it would be quite moist,

928
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,640
but the middle has all sunk together.

929
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,160
I think the biggest issue is - the outside is OK,

930
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,320
I think just this bit here,

931
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,920
and as you go a sort of a third in, it then becomes raw dough,

932
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,880
there's so much liquid in there.

933
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,040
Nice idea, but unfortunately it's not been executed that well.

934
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,440
Sorry about that.

935
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,920
As a filled loaf, it's there.

936
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,240
As a centrepiece, it ain't. I mean, it looks...

937
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,120
- Poor on presentation?
- Yeah.

938
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,400
MEL: (Oh, wow!)

939
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,480
I don't like the big gaps.

940
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,800
And actually, in many ways, you've overfilled it.

941
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,760
I think I would have left the tomato out,

942
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,920
- which is what has made it come away from the top, is the tomato.
- OK.

943
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,520
- I quite like all the filling. 
- I think the flavour's lovely.

944
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,120
It's lovely. Very breakfasty.

945
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,480
It's bold and beautiful, you know.

946
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,520
It's a nice idea.

947
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,400
I think it's quite fun to be able to rip off.

948
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,520
THEY LAUGH

949
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,640
Bit of a soggy bottom.

950
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,680
Oh, dear!

951
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,400
The flavour of the ingredients inside is delicious.

952
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,880
- It is very, very good.
- Good, good.

953
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,560
- However, there's just not enough of it.
- Right.

954
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,080
It's a very clever presentation.

955
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,360
That twist - I don't think I could do it without a map.

956
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,600
I know Paul was thinking there might be a gap

957
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,440
between the ham and the bread.

958
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,040
There is no gap...

959
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,040
because inside is raw.

960
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,200
- It's raw?
- What?

961
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:14,040
The problem is when you create a dough, and then wrap it up,

962
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,560
it's got nowhere to go.

963
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,280
You've shown us great skill - just get the middle cooked.

964
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,320
Yeah. OK.

965
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,640
Well, it looks right royal and regal.

966
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,440
- Great presentation, you're good at that.
- Thank you.

967
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,400
Looks very good.

968
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,520
You've got a little bit of a gap, but not much.

969
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,560
Not that keen on the flavours.

970
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,000
It could be the dough.

971
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,600
- You know, that saffron.
- Mm-hm.

972
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,840
It's quite strong.

973
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,040
- But very, very well decorated. 
- Thank you.

974
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,440
I like the flavours, it's very Spanish to me -

975
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,960
- figs and Serrano ham. 
- Thank you very much, Lu.

976
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,840
- Thanks, guys. 
- Well done, Lu. Thank you.
- Thank you.

977
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,840
So the bread Showstoppers today -

978
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,920
on the whole, on the outside, they looked pretty good.

979
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,160
Did they deliver on the inside for you?

980
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,280
Several of them had a problem, with the base being soggy.

981
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,320
Kate did the, sort of, Serrano ham.

982
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,080
But she swirled it so tight that it couldn't actually move.

983
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,360
It was restricted. However, the outside wasn't,

984
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,600
- and then it opened up and it tasted fantastic.
- Yeah.

985
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,960
Looking at Luis, he did really well in the technical,

986
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,920
I thought his Signature rolls were very good.

987
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,680
- He was second in the technical. 
- He was.

988
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,720
- And Kate was first in the technical...
- Yeah.

989
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,320
- ..so surely that puts both of them...
- Very, very high indeed.

990
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,640
They're our leaders, I think.

991
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,680
Who didn't have such a good day at the office,

992
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,600
and who's therefore in contention to leave?

993
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,000
I don't think Jordan had a particularly good day.

994
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I think it was a bad choice to try and make such a wet fruity filling

995
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,360
- and expect the base to be cooked. 
- I thought Norman was very simple.

996
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,280
We've mentioned to him before, it needs to be a bit more creative.

997
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,760
You've now got quite an interesting dilemma.

998
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,640
You've got a couple of people at the bottom -

999
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,080
Norman, who's played it safe every time.

1000
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,680
And another who's way more maverick. One of them has got to go,

1001
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,400
so I don't envy you that task.

1002
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,920
OK, bakers, well...

1003
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,640
Paul and Mary have been deliberating,

1004
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,200
and this week I get the fun job.

1005
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,600
I get to say who is this week's Star Baker.

1006
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,200
Now, I have to say, this Star Baker just pummels dough

1007
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,360
and then slashes it and then forms it into a ring

1008
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,600
and shoves every ingredient known to man in it.

1009
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,000
Luis, you're our Star Baker.

1010
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,640
- APPLAUSE 
- Thank you very much.

1011
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,440
Thank you, thank you.

1012
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,200
Finally!

1013
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,760
Yes!

1014
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,440
OK, now for the difficult bit.

1015
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,120
We can't take all of you with us next week.

1016
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,920
And I'm really sad to have to tell you

1017
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,520
that the person who will not be joining us

1018
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,960
for next week's Bake Off is...

1019
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,440
..Jordan.

1020
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,680
Very sad.

1021
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,200
- Ahh, thank you very much for the chance.
- Captain chaos!

1022
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,360
- Captain chaos.
- He's straight in.

1023
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,680
I'm disappointed, of course. I wanted to stay in.

1024
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,280
There's other things that I really wanted to bake

1025
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,720
and, you know, get out there,

1026
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,960
things that I really enjoy and really like.

1027
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,320
You've been a sheer joy

1028
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,680
and we really will miss you.

1029
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,920
I'm really sad that Jordan's gone.

1030
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,880
He was inventive, he was creative, he was flamboyant,

1031
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,440
and so were his bakes.

1032
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,360
- Well done!
- Thank you.

1033
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,120
I'm totally ecstatic,

1034
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,880
I-I dunno, I'm so cynical, you never expect it, really.

1035
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,160
But, yeah, to get Star Baker,

1036
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,280
that's the Bake Off dream ticked off, to be honest.

1037
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,000
Thank you so much, thank you very much, I appreciate that

1038
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,400
- Well done, mate.
- Thank you.

1039
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,080
The whole attention to detail

1040
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,000
that Luis puts into his work throughout all of his bakes

1041
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,560
have been stunning.

1042
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,040
And a well-deserved Star Baker.

1043
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,200
Next time, the bakers tackle desserts...

1044
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,480
Don't make a mess.

1045
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,320
Don't make a mess.

1046
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,000
Probably won't be fancy enough for the judges, but there you go.

1047
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,840
..and, as the temperature rises...

1048
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,040
It's so hot.

1049
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,640
Freezer, freezer, please, freezer!

1050
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,840
I just need to get this on really quick.

1051
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,400
..there's a meltdown in the Bake Off tent.

1052
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,840
I think that's sort of unacceptable.
