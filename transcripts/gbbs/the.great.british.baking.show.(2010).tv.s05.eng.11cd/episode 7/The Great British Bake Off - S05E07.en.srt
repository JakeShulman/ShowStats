00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Welcome back to the Bake Off tent, where we're just weeks away

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,560
from being able to announce Britain's best amateur baker.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,360
And the scores on the oven doors are...

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,520
boys, two remaining, girls, four remaining.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,640
- Sounds like a party. Welcome to... 
- BOTH: The Great British Bake Off.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,080
'Last time, the Bake Off went all continental.'

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,400
- Estos marcas...
- Listos...
- Bake!

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,280
'The bakers battled with European yeast leaven cakes.'

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,640
I think it's going to be sad...

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,680
'Swedish princess cakes.'

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,600
Couldn't think of another way of doing it...

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,800
'And tiered Hungarian tortes.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,640
'Chetna was crowned Star Baker.'

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,960
Clever idea, everybody will be copying that.

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,800
'But an unprecedented decision from Mary and Paul...'

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,440
They were really rowing and it was really awful.

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,240
'..meant that no-one went home.'

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,640
'This week, the six remaining bakers tackle pastries.'

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,440
Urrgh!

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,160
'With a savoury signature...'

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,680
Come on, pasties!

22
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,160
'A technical pastry that no-one has even heard of...'

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,880
I don't really know what I'm looking for, to be honest,

24
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,120
because I've never seen one or heard of one.

25
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,320
'And a choux pastry Showstopper which reaches new heights.'

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,040
I was a bit bored, so I thought I'd build a set of stairs, you know.

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,080
So this is your first eclair stair?

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,280
'With a place in the quarterfinals up for grabs, tensions are high.'

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,160
- This is Paul Hollywood, if I come last... 
- SHE LAUGHS

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,080
So, what do you get if you cross butter, flour, a crime scene

31
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,360
and a woolly jumper?

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,960
- Dunno. 
- A Danish pastry.

33
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,520
I think that might need work. It's pastry week.

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,240
I'm delighted to be back again - I mean, the sun's shining,

35
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,040
the birds are singing!

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,000
I love working with pastry, so I'm looking forward to it.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,680
The two previous weeks have been the hump to get over,

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,560
but, yeah, ready for this week, looking forward to it.

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,640
Bakers, good morning.

40
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,000
What a beautiful morning it is, and welcome to your Signature Challenge.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,720
Mary and Paul would like you to bake some savoury pastry parcels.

42
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,560
Pretty much every culture has a tradition for these,

43
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,040
from the samosas to Cornish pasties to Spanish empanadas to...

44
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
- And the other ones! 
- ..the other ones. Good.

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,520
Now, Mary and Paul would like 12 savoury parcels.

46
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,880
This could be any pastry you like - could be puff, could be shortcrust.

47
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,520
You've got an hour and three quarters. Very much on your marks...

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,040
- Get set.
- Bake!

49
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,240
I think the judges are definitely looking for flavour every time

50
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,600
and I think last week I fell short on that,

51
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,280
so I need to put it right this week, I think.

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,520
When I reach a week where I can do some of my flavours,

53
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,000
I get really excited.

54
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,240
Week seven, we're looking for 12 perfectly formed,

55
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,160
beautifully browned, excellent-flavoured parcels.

56
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,360
I'd like to see something that they think we've never had before.

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,760
No excuses - it must be done in the time.

58
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,360
The seasoning must be right, the moisture must be right,

59
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,640
the bake must be right.

60
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,200
- Morning, Chetna.
- Good morning.

61
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,240
Chetna, tell us about your savoury parcels?

62
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,520
I'm making Indian savoury parcels - surprise, surprise!

63
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,800
I'm making kachoris, which are pastry

64
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,840
and inside there's a lentil mixture and then deep-fry them.

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,160
- You're going to deep-fry them? 
- Yes.

66
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,000
Chetna's kachoris will be made

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,600
using a carom seed pastry,

68
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,360
which will crisp up when deep-fried.

69
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,160
Boiling away in that pan is lentils...

70
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,680
- Yes.
- So how far are you going to cook them down to?

71
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,200
Cos you've got to fry them as well, haven't you?

72
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,280
It's just going to be cooked - not al dente, but JUST cooked.

73
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,440
OK, this is going to be fascinating, it's all about the blend

74
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,960
- of the spices going in there, thank you very much, Chetna.
- Thank you!

75
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,520
Kate's bake is also inspired by Indian flavours.

76
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,680
So what are your savoury parcels?

77
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,400
They're samosa-inspired paneer and spinach parcels.

78
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
So the spinach you're using - fresh spinach?

79
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,840
No, I'm using frozen.

80
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,400
I've tried it with both and I've found that fresh spinach

81
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,040
is just way too wet, and samosas are traditionally quite dry.

82
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,880
Her samosas will be folded into triangles, crimped and deep-fried.

83
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,080
Tell us what's on here.

84
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,560
Well, I've got cinnamon, powdered ginger, turmeric, chilli flakes -

85
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,240
sorry, Mary - and in here I've got coriander, cumin, mustard seeds.

86
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,040
- Could be an overload. 
- What, of chilli?

87
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,360
- An overload of flavours as well. 
- Well, we'll see.

88
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,160
Luis will also deep-fry his parcels.

89
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,560
I was brought up on fried food, I'll be honest.

90
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,800
I remember eating these empanadas as a child in various places -

91
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,800
at my gran's, and so I didn't have the recipe,

92
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,120
so I've had to reverse engineer it and make it how I remember it.

93
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,920
- Morning.
- Morning, Luis. 
- You all right?

94
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,800
So what flavours are you going to be doing in the empanadas?

95
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,440
It's mainly beef and chorizo, but there's potato, carrot,

96
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,080
celery and then a herb, a lot of spice mixing.

97
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,640
There's paprika, oregano...

98
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,200
Luis's Spanish flavours aren't just in the filling.

99
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,400
He's making an orange and paprika pastry.

100
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,400
- They're quite big! 
- Well, they look quite big.

101
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,480
What I do is, I do the traditional rope around the edge.

102
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,120
- So you're crimping it? 
- I crimp it all the way around,

103
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,600
so I only put about three tablespoons of filling in each one

104
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,680
and then I use the excess pastry to get my crimp round. I want them

105
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,440
completely sealed and don't want them to leak in the fryer.

106
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,480
Good luck, Luis.

107
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,960
I'm not happy.

108
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,280
See, I don't think that's right, I'm going to do that again.

109
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,200
Good morning, Nancy. Can the male judge ask you

110
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,720
what savoury parcels you're doing, please?

111
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,880
Yes, today I'm going to make spicy duck parcels, pasties.

112
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,160
- What's the pastry then? 
- This is a quick flaky pastry.

113
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,920
Nancy's duck will be mixed with

114
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,840
oriental vegetables

115
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
and flavoured with Chinese spices.

116
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,480
How do you seal the whole pie up together

117
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,520
- so you don't get any leakage? 
- I DID get some leakage.

118
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,040
So I decided to soak it up with a teaspoon of ground rice.

119
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,440
That's such a good idea.

120
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,520
They did seep, and they looked a bit messy.

121
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,680
Um, I wanted to do something different

122
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,120
because I think it's quite good to stand out.

123
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,800
Because if I was making a pasty and then Rich was making a pasty

124
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,960
they would be directly comparing our pasties.

125
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,120
Whereas I don't think anyone else is doing a miniature beef Wellington

126
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,880
so no-one else can be compared to mine!

127
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,960
Martha will wrap the beef in Parma ham,

128
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,400
add the mushroom duxelle

129
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,600
and enclose it in a rough puff pastry.

130
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,840
The beef, are you going to fry it beforehand?

131
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,680
I'm going to sear it very lightly so that the juices stay inside,

132
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,480
but it's almost impossible to get the beef really as rare

133
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,040
as it'd ideally be, because you'd have to get the pastry to cook.

134
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,480
So they're a little bit more medium/well-done kind of beef.

135
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,720
Unlike Martha, Richard and Nancy

136
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,960
aren't cooking their meat at all before it goes into the parcels.

137
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,200
It has to be cut so, so small, because it's going in the pasty raw.

138
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,280
- Good morning, Richard.
- Morning. 
- So, what are you up to?

139
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,680
What have you decided to do for your savoury parcels?

140
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,120
- I'm doing lamb and mint pasties today.
- Nice!

141
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,880
Like a Cornish pasty, you're putting raw meat in there,

142
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,280
and quite big pieces, and let's hope that they cook in the time.

143
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,200
Richard will add sweet potato to his pasties

144
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,120
to complement his traditional choice of filling.

145
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,680
- How are you going to fold them? 
- He's doing a live masterclass

146
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,840
for us, Mary, doesn't get more exciting than that.

147
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,320
I'm folding them all over first.

148
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,400
The crimping is critical on something like this

149
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,280
- to stop any leakage from the meat. 
- Yes.

150
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,960
Hopefully if you crimp them well enough, you don't have

151
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,720
too many explosions - that's always the main worry.

152
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,960
Each of the bakers has their own individual way

153
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,160
of sealing their parcels.

154
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,480
How much time have I got left?

155
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,040
It's about half an hour, coming up to half an hour.

156
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,560
- How long's the bake?
- 25.
- OK.

157
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,000
Bakers, you've got half an hour. Half an hour on your parcels.

158
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,560
- You are the king of crimping. 
- Thanks, Mel!
- Senor Luis!

159
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,880
How do you say "to crimp" in Spanish, do you know?

160
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,280
Oh, God, I don't know!

161
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,760
Crimpar? Crimpar! So you reckon those two are done?

162
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,240
These two are definitely done.

163
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,480
That's one hell of a twist you've got going on there.

164
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,400
So why an Indian-inspired bake?

165
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,200
I love Indian food. But obviously Chetna's the queen of spice.

166
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,520
Not leaking.

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,840
OK, bakers, I'm in a rough puff kind of a mood, it's ten minutes!

168
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,240
I'm going to need every bit of ten minutes.

169
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,880
Nothing's burst yet.

170
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,240
I'm a little bit behind where I'd like to be.

171
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,680
I re-made my pastry, because I wasn't happy

172
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,280
and it didn't seem right, which set me back.

173
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,840
I've got enough time, it's just tight.

174
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,440
Urgh! I don't know whether mine are going to be cooked!

175
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,320
It's not a very hot deep fat fryer

176
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,760
and it's concerning, to say the least.

177
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,280
And if I put more in, I lower the temperature,

178
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,160
I'm just going to have to... I don't know what to do.

179
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,560
I'm going to literally be taking them out the oven, cooling rack,

180
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,280
straight into me basket.

181
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,480
Bakers, that's five minutes till pastry parcel paradise.

182
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,320
- My fryer went off, Luis. 
- Oh, you're joking!
- No, I'm not.

183
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,320
- It's on a timer. 
- I didn't know.

184
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,960
Come on, pasties!

185
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,520
I'd like to have seen a bit more colour.

186
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,080
Every time I get to this point, I can just hear the music,

187
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,520
- you know the music that they play at the end...
- Yeah!

188
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,520
Hoh!

189
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,560
Ow!

190
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,200
OK, bakers, your parcels are due for delivery now! NOW!

191
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,840
What a nightmare.

192
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,480
They look so...ah!

193
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,880
Paul and Mary will be looking for parcels which are uniform

194
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,240
in size, well filled, perfectly cooked and sealed to prevent leaks.

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,600
- Hello, Richard.
- Hi, Paul. 
- So, I think

196
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,120
you've got some good uniformity,

197
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,760
you have got consistency and a nice dark colour.

198
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,000
They're not burnt.

199
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,240
No, it's not burnt. I'll take this fella.

200
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,480
- Nice and flaky.
- Oooh!

201
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,120
- It's a bit of a gap.
- Yeah.

202
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,200
You can really, really pack these things out.

203
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,120
PASTY CRUNCHES

204
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,800
What a wonderful combination! And I was the one that thought

205
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,800
- the meat wouldn't be done, and it IS done, so well done.
- Thank you.

206
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,320
It's a great bake, great pastry. Great flavours.

207
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,040
- Do you mind, Richard?
- Fill your boots.
- Fill my pockets!

208
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,520
Fill your pockets!

209
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,520
They look very tempting, they're a lovely golden brown.

210
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,400
And if I look underneath, this has had a little bit of leaking here.

211
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,560
The beef is a gentle pink and a lovely thin layer of pastry.

212
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,080
Tastes good, the flavours are fantastic.

213
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,720
- The seasoning is just right, I'll go for that.
- Thank you.

214
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,280
- Mind if I just...? 
- Of course, go ahead!

215
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,080
Not bad, not bad.

216
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,120
Probably could have done with a little bit longer in the fryer,

217
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,640
if I'm honest. The colour's a bit pale, I think to me it is

218
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,920
a bit big for a traditional empanada.

219
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,680
I love their size, I know Paul thinks they should be dinky,

220
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,000
but that's about the size I'd like for my lunch.

221
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,440
- Yeah, too right. 
- Good filling inside.

222
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,480
I think they look most attractive

223
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,320
and there's no leakage anywhere of the filling.

224
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,880
It's very, very tasty indeed, it's lovely.

225
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,400
But I think for me it's slightly under-done.

226
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,480
- Can I take another one? 
- Absolutely.

227
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,360
- Thanks, Luis.
- One for later. 
- Thank you.

228
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,360
I think you know what I'm going to say.

229
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,120
They needed another five minutes. I ran out of time.

230
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,640
- I love the look of them. 
- I think I want to have a try.

231
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,120
I think it could have taken a shade more filling.

232
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,040
Yes, your idea of ground rice I think has worked.

233
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,960
There's just not enough in there. That combined with

234
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,160
- the lack of baking has sort of let it down a bit.
- Thank you.

235
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,720
Thank you, Nancy.

236
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,760
- Do you mind if I have one? 
- Help yourself.

237
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,520
Did it all go as you wanted it to?

238
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,760
They should be an awful lot darker than that.

239
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,880
My deep fat fryer went off and I didn't realise.

240
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,640
You've got the nice even shape,

241
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,680
I think, you've got VERY good crimping at the base, which I like.

242
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,480
- The colour's pale.
- Yeah.
- I think the only thing we can do with these...

243
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,800
- Is try them.
- Is try them.

244
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,800
I've made them less spicy than I would normally, for you, Mary.

245
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,440
- Have you?
- Yes. 
- I like things spicy.

246
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,720
The filling's interesting. I don't particularly like the pastry.

247
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,720
I had a bit with the crimp on and it was quite doughy.

248
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,600
And it's not too hot. It's just the outside, your pastry isn't cooked.

249
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,400
You should have been watching your fryer.

250
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,560
Well, I did, I was kind of really confused about it

251
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,000
and I took some out and thought "I'll re-do them later"

252
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,600
and tried all kinds of things and it just had turned off.

253
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,440
- Shame. OK, thank you very much. 
- Thank you.

254
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,320
- Kate, do you mind? 
- I wouldn't mind at all.

255
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,080
SHE LAUGHS

256
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,240
Great colour, right.

257
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,040
Lots of filling in there, pastry looks well done, flaky.

258
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,800
I like to have more filling than pastry, and that's what we've got.

259
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,960
That pastry is delicious. I DO love the flavour.

260
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,720
Your spices, the volume of spices you put in there

261
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,640
is frankly staggering. That's lovely, well done.

262
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,240
- Thank you.
- Do you mind, Chetna, if I just...?

263
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,120
- Not at all, no, please.
- There's no room in the pockets, I'll just...

264
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,640
- Put it in your mouth.
- Eat it, yeah.

265
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,280
- Phew!
- They look really nice.

266
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,320
There's a few under-cooking comments in there

267
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,680
so I'm getting a little bit of comfort from that. SHE LAUGHS

268
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,840
Paul was absolutely right, I tried it and they were under.

269
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,120
I couldn't really have asked for better comments,

270
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,960
under the circumstances. So I'm pretty delighted, actually.

271
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,040
I've learnt how to use a deep-fat fryer now.

272
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,360
SHE LAUGHS

273
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,720
The iconic Cornish pasty found fame as a miner's packed lunch,

274
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,880
but its popularity has spread further than you'd think.

275
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
In the early 1800s, the Cornish tin mining industry was world-famous.

276
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,120
And in 1825, a group of 60 miners from the county

277
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,160
were recruited to work in a silver mine in Mexico.

278
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,160
It was in the early 1820s.

279
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,240
They purchased 1,500 tonnes of equipment,

280
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,880
and they set sail for the silver mines.

281
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,360
It took them 14 months to get to the mines in Pachuca

282
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,920
and Real del Monte.

283
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,680
When they arrived at the mines, the Cornish miners were working

284
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,640
very closely with the locals, who were quick to embrace

285
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,680
parts of Cornish culture. Including the cuisine.

286
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,120
I believe that the indigenous Mexicans

287
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,800
saw in the Cornish pasty a fast food.

288
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,200
A type of food that could be easily made,

289
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,320
manufactured and taken so simply to their workplace.

290
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,560
The local Mexican miners created their own version of a pasty.

291
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,440
A Mexican paste.

292
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,720
And that is the story that started 190 years ago.

293
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,560
Today, we are now forming stronger

294
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,080
and stronger links with our friends in Mexico.

295
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,400
Descendents of both the Cornish and Mexican miners still regularly

296
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
get together to celebrate this unique bond.

297
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,840
My grandfather also,

298
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,000
and my grandfather stayed for 40 years in the silver mines.

299
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,440
Mi abuelo trabajo las minas.

300
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,240
His grandfather worked in the mines.

301
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,320
And both pasties and pastes are on the menu.

302
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,280
At first glance, the pasty and the paste look very similar.

303
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,880
When the pasty first went to Mexico,

304
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,120
they wasn't able to get the ingredients that we have

305
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,480
in Cornwall so they had to use regional ingredients.

306
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,640
So the Mexican pasty has potato, leeks, chillies, steak,

307
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,520
butter and parsley.

308
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,560
It's a very similar pastry, but considering they're so small,

309
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,360
they've got so much in them.

310
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,520
But not every Cornish palate can take the Mexican heat.

311
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,320
That was eye-wateringly hot.

312
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,480
I think I should have had a Cornish one.

313
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,960
'The bakers are about to face a technical challenge

314
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,640
'which will test their advanced pastry knowledge.'

315
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,920
Hello, bakers, you're going to love this one.

316
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,240
I mean that in a sort of

317
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,200
"You're going to hate this one" kind of a way.

318
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,840
Now, it's Paul's recipe, the Queen of Mean as I like to call him.

319
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,800
We'd like you two to just go away.

320
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,040
If you'd like to go away for us, that'd be great.

321
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,960
Go and do some crocheting, Paul.

322
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,280
Now, Paul and Mary would like you to make 12 individual kouign amann.

323
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,400
- Yep, we don't know what it is either.
- No idea.

324
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,080
OK, so apparently it's a traditional Breton pastry

325
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,760
and you've got three and a half hours on the clock to do that.

326
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,960
All the very best.

327
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,080
- Kouign amann.
- On your marks, get set! Bake!
- Bake!

328
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,680
For the first time in the history of Bake Off,

329
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,720
not one of the bakers has heard of this technical challenge,

330
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,840
let alone what it's supposed to look like or how to make it.

331
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,640
I don't think I've ever even SEEN one of these.

332
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,160
I have never heard of this.

333
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,200
How do you pronounce it? Koi...?

334
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,440
Queen-a-man.

335
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,840
- Queen-a-man.
- Queen-a-man.

336
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,280
It's called a kougan aman?

337
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,120
A queen-a-man, a queen amon?

338
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,200
It's kouign amann.

339
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,880
Traditionally, it's quite large, it's got to be buttery,

340
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,640
it's got to be crispy, it's got to be flaky.

341
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,800
So basically, the lamination is all about the dough butter,

342
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,000
dough butter layers.

343
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,320
They've got to build up the dough, it's got a little bit

344
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,560
of salt in it, it's got butter, it's got sugar in it.

345
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,360
It's got yeast in there.

346
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,240
What you're looking for is the texture of a puff pastry,

347
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,640
but a bit more open, a bit more structured,

348
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,400
and that comes from the yeast.

349
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,720
So when do they actually add the sugar?

350
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,240
They need to do a minimum of three turns before they add sugar to it.

351
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,320
If they put the sugar in during the turns, what happens is

352
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,600
it just dissolves, it doesn't go anywhere.

353
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,680
But also, they've got to think of when to put these in the oven,

354
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,240
it's got to be risen and rested before it goes in,

355
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,360
otherwise it'll just be too tight and not opened up like a flower.

356
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,400
Something like four or five ingredients...

357
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,280
..and three and a half hours to work with them.

358
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,160
So what's that all about?

359
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,040
Make the dough, shape into a ball and prove.

360
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,080
I've never made a pastry with yeast before.

361
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,120
Yes, first time for everything, isn't it?

362
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,480
A little bit nervous, don't really know what it's meant to be like.

363
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,200
My dough feels quite sticky, but I know that Paul's quite critical

364
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,960
if you don't add all the water sometimes.

365
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,800
Paul's recipe tells them to prove the dough,

366
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,400
but does not state for how long.

367
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,600
I'm just going to keep an eye on it, I'm going to wait until it doubles.

368
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,680
Then I'm done and I'm going to have a cup of tea.

369
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,680
Now, I'm going to sit and look at the recipe.

370
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,640
HE HUMS TO HIMSELF

371
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,680
The next step is roll out the dough into a 20cm square,

372
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,800
and roll out the chilled butter into a slightly smaller square

373
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,480
and place diagonally on the dough.

374
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,720
I think a bit of butter bashing reduces the tension, doesn't it?

375
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,400
This is Paul Hollywood if he hates

376
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,960
my kouign amann, if I come last.

377
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,320
SHE GIGGLES

378
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,600
When they think it's proved for long enough,

379
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,200
the bakers press on with the next stage.

380
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,600
I'm rolling out my dough to 20cm square.

381
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,120
I'm onto stage five, which is fold the corners of dough

382
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,640
over the butter.

383
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,400
I'm going to do it the way I know, which is basically a longer piece

384
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,720
of dough, a shorter piece of butter and you get a fold straightaway.

385
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,000
Next stage is roll the dough into a rectangle, fold down

386
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,560
the top third then lift the bottom third and then refrigerate.

387
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,560
Only Chetna is leaving hers to prove for longer.

388
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,400
Everyone else has already folded their pastries, but I haven't,

389
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,480
I'm just waiting for a bit more rise.

390
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,440
Am I stupid? There's two and a half hours left?

391
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,720
Why is everybody folding it right now? What's going on?

392
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,400
Halfway through the bake and it's decision time.

393
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,640
Part seven of the method is a little bit ambiguous.

394
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,720
It says "repeat the rolling and folding process three times,

395
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,360
"adding sugar between one of the layers."

396
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,000
Does that mean one of the layers each of the three times,

397
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,760
or just one of the layers?

398
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,200
One layer or every layer?

399
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,800
I think the sugar between one of the layers.

400
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,040
So the sugar is going in this one. I reckon it's not the last layer

401
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,440
and it's not the first layer, it'll be the middle layer.

402
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,640
What I've done is I've divided my sugar into three...

403
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,000
And you're adding the sugar between one of the layers.

404
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,680
Every time. So I know that's the right amount of sugar.

405
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,640
- But which layer?
- I don't think it matters, to be honest, because...

406
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,920
- You don't think it matters?! 
- Don't tell Paul that!

407
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,960
It's this sort of precision upon which a technical bake rests.

408
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,520
You know what he's like, he'll be thumbing the dough

409
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,000
and he'll be saying, "The sugar's in the wrong layers."

410
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,200
Hey, wouldn't it be awful if this were salt? No, it's not.

411
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,280
I've made a guess and put it on the last time.

412
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,960
At least this way I'll have a defined bit of sugar through.

413
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,360
Who's done it right and who's not done it right, though, do we know?

414
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,200
Apparently the thing you have to do is put the sugar in last,

415
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,760
and I think Richard and Martha have done that.

416
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,520
Problem is, if you put sugar in while you're folding,

417
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,280
it melts with the butter. Put the sugar in last, it still...

418
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,680
Don't tell me it arrests the rise. Don't do that to my face!

419
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,800
I'm going to chill it one more time

420
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,200
for another 20 minutes and then I'm going to

421
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,480
get it out and do the final cutting and filling of the tins.

422
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,800
Bakers, you've got one hour to go

423
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,560
on these fiendish little kouign amann things

424
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,760
that no-one's ever really heard of.

425
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,800
Place the dough squares into a muffin tin,

426
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,760
gathering the corners at the centre.

427
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,120
You can see a few layers in there.

428
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,000
They need to prove now for as long as they can.

429
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,480
I'm going to do it in the fridge.

430
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,080
I'm proving them at room temperature for...as long as I can, really,

431
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,480
before I think I have to put them in the oven.

432
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,640
I'm just going to keep an eye on them

433
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,720
and when they look as though they've doubled, I'll put them in the oven.

434
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,080
I want it to prove in a cool environment.

435
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,280
I've done it differently to every single other person in the room.

436
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,560
Don't want to get deep vein thrombosis, you got to walk around.

437
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,440
So this is where working outside doesn't work in my favour.

438
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,280
- I don't like sitting down for long periods of time.
- It's all good.

439
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,640
I don't like this waiting malarkey.

440
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,400
Makes you think too much. I'm better when I've no time to think.

441
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,000
This could be the new sort of mindfulness meditation.

442
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,680
Just do one of Paul's bakes,

443
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,760
which basically is like going on holiday for a couple of weeks.

444
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,160
- Kouign amann.
- Kouign amann.

445
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,320
- Kouign amann.
- Kouign amann. Do you know which country it's from?

446
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,160
- Breton.
- Breton isn't a country.

447
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,000
Well, it used to be a whatever it was...a...

448
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,680
- Province? 
- Province, thank you.

449
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,800
They used to have amazing sort of lace,

450
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,280
and they would wear Breton coiffes, which are stiff...

451
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,000
Sorry, there's something happening over there.

452
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,320
Stiff lace hats and they would do special dancing.

453
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,520
- Hello, Martha.
- Hello!

454
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,800
You know this isn't a life-drawing class, don't you?

455
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,360
Are we boring you with this technical challenge, or is this

456
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,600
- the calm before the storm? 
- Little bit.
- Are you a little bored?

457
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,680
- Well, we can... 
- Three and a half hours!

458
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,320
It's quite long for a bake with six ingredients.

459
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,920
- So how long have you got left now? 
- I don't know.

460
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,560
Nor do I. I'm sorry I can't help you.

461
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,560
It's around about 35 minutes, something like that, I'd say.

462
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,840
OK, I'm going to put them in the oven.

463
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,560
They don't look as puffy as some people's.

464
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,600
I've no idea what I'm looking for. I don't know

465
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,800
whether they're the right shape, the right height, the right size.

466
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Hopefully they'll taste nice, though.

467
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,760
It doesn't say how long to bake. It says "bake until ready" -

468
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,360
I'm thinking longer is better.

469
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,200
I don't really know what I'm looking for.

470
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,680
It's really hard to know, because they all look

471
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,840
quite different around the room and I don't know which one is right.

472
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,720
Because I've never seen one or heard of one.

473
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,440
My only thing was that about the sugar and that's it.

474
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,160
What I'm thinking is that I should have added it in one or two layers,

475
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,400
- not three. 
- They're coming out.

476
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,720
Whoa, look at you! Those smell mighty fine.

477
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,800
I just don't know whether they've had enough cooking.

478
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,880
Bakers, you've got five minutes left...

479
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,520
IN A FRENCH ACCENT: ..with your little pesky Breton friends.

480
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,760
They're a nice colour.

481
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,800
They should be even-sized, not got even size.

482
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,680
Ouchies.

483
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,920
I imagine they probably should have been a bit more puffed up,

484
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,800
but that's my decision to refrigerate, possibly.

485
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,440
- OK, bakers, our most languid challenge to date is over.
- Come on!

486
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,160
Step away from your Bretonese little pastries.

487
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,240
Paul and Mary are looking for 12 identical pastries

488
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,160
which are well proved and crispy, with distinct layers.

489
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,080
You've all got good, strong colour, but we're going to try and find out

490
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,680
who's added sugar in every layer and who's added sugar at the end.

491
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,000
- What was the right way, Paul? 
- Adding sugar at the end.

492
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,360
They've gone down in the middle.

493
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,160
They have, you can see there's not many layers in there.

494
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,160
Pretty sweet.

495
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,760
Normally you'd expect to have a bit of sugar on the top.

496
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,760
I think there's sugar on each level. Has a few issues, that one.

497
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,120
This looks as though it's got attempted layers,

498
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,280
but the problem is it's quite bready as well.

499
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,120
I think I'd struggle with the prove on that one.

500
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,960
Now this one is pretty good - nice and high, good lamination.

501
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,800
Nice caramel colour on the top, all pretty much the same size.

502
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,920
You can definitely see the layers here.

503
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,320
It's a decent pastry.

504
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,680
That's good. That's really good. Just perfect.

505
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,400
Moving on to number four here, huge irregular size difference.

506
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,600
There are layers, you can see them on the top and on there.

507
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,080
It looks as though it's been well made,

508
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,760
but just needed that much longer to rise.

509
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,560
It's a nice flavour.

510
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,280
Flavour's good.

511
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,480
I think this one's had a problem with the sugar -

512
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,720
sugar's gone on every level, it's struggled.

513
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,640
And some of these are really over-baked.

514
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,520
Yeah, they are. Moving on to the last one.

515
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,360
There's an attempt at lamination here.

516
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,240
And they are a pretty uneven size.

517
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,400
It's got a good balance of flavour. But it is massively under-proved.

518
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,080
- Good flavour. 
- It's got a good flavour.

519
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,120
Paul and Mary will identify who has managed to produce the best version

520
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,240
of this completely unknown Breton pastry.

521
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,480
So in sixth place, who's this?

522
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,480
- A little over-baked, and we didn't get the lamination.
- OK.

523
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,000
And in fifth place is this one - whose is this?

524
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,360
- Luis, was there sugar on each level? 
- There was.

525
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,760
- It just tasted a bit too sweet.
- OK.

526
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,200
And in fourth place?

527
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,120
These were multi-sized...

528
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,240
- Yeah. 
- But we did get some of the layering.

529
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,920
And in third place is this one.

530
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,600
You can see they've got layers. Nice colour, just needed more proving.

531
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,520
And in second place, who is this?

532
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,680
Some of these were really very good.

533
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,840
And in first place, well done!

534
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,280
- Well done, Richard. 
- APPLAUSE

535
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,400
Good layers, you didn't put the sugar in throughout the whole thing.

536
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,920
- Close to mine - very, very good, well done.
- Thank you.

537
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,880
To get praise, especially after having a couple of dodgy weeks,

538
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,880
to have big twinkling smiles and, "Aren't you good, Richard?",

539
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,560
it's lovely, it's really, really nice.

540
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,680
Looking back, it is frustrating

541
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,200
because the clues were in the recipe. I did it the way I read it.

542
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,680
What can you do with that?

543
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,160
You get it right or you get it wrong and I got it right

544
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,680
in the morning and I didn't get it right in the afternoon.

545
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,360
There you go.

546
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,760
So the bakers are about to go into their Showstopper day

547
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,920
and after a difficult week last week,

548
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,720
Richard is now flying high, wouldn't you say?

549
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,200
Absolutely. He's been top in both challenges.

550
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,440
So who else is doing well this weekend?

551
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,360
I think Martha's done fairly well,

552
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,960
she was there on technical.

553
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,280
Someone like Nancy could go up or go down.

554
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,800
Chetna did well on the signature.

555
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,240
Yesterday, she was sixth in the technical, though,

556
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,240
- she was at the bottom. 
- Which leaves us with Luis and Kate.

557
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,480
I think Kate's signature, the pastry was massively underdone,

558
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,000
it was really pale.

559
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,160
And the filling that she made, it really wasn't well-seasoned.

560
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,520
Luis's signature, when you look at it, when you try it,

561
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,840
you think it's pretty good, but that was almost

562
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,840
the tried and tested recipe for me.

563
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,640
Kate and Luis are essentially in trouble

564
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,240
going into the final Showstopper?

565
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,240
I would go along with that and also put Chetna in there, as well,

566
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,600
you don't come bottom of the technical challenge.

567
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,760
If she has a bad day today... she has to be consistent.

568
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,640
She's been SO consistent up to now, though.

569
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,920
But you could say that about a lot of them.

570
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,120
Good morning, bakers.

571
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,320
Now, this morning, for your final challenge of the weekend,

572
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,720
Paul and Mary would very much like you

573
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,080
to bake some showstopping eclairs.

574
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,640
Now for the mathematics bit. You've got to make 24 eclairs,

575
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,120
two different flavours, so that's 12 of each.

576
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,400
Now these eclairs should be made from choux pastry, obvs.

577
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,480
They should be eclair-shaped, please,

578
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,720
but that is where the restrictions end.

579
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,000
- It's freestyle after that, OK?
- Wow.

580
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,720
You can decorate them any way in which you wish.

581
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,040
- No way?
- Yes, you can!

582
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,240
- Way?!
- Absolutely! 
- It's like the '60s all over again!

583
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,200
- Absolutely, second summer of love! 
- It's free eclair love! Good lord!

584
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,160
You've got four hours to create this Showstopper, so on your marks...

585
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,600
- Get set!
- Bake!

586
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,400
It's certainly nice to be doing a Showstopper

587
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,360
and not panicking like I have done for the past few weeks.

588
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,840
Tricky one today, really -

589
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,600
I think the choux pastry is difficult at the best of times.

590
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,920
I think there is a lot more pressure now to do more interesting things,

591
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,680
which is why I've taken a bit more of a risk.

592
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,640
They've got four hours in this particular Showstopper challenge

593
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,280
to produce 24 eclairs - that's plenty of time to see

594
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,880
some great innovation and fantastic creativity.

595
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,640
If they can't produce a good eclair in that time,

596
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,600
they shouldn't be in that tent.

597
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,240
Choux pastry, of course, is unlike any other pastry

598
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,320
because it's cooked in a pan.

599
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,760
The all-important part is the baking.

600
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,640
That perfect eclair has a dry inside as well as looking perfect outside.

601
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,520
Pushing the boat out, Kate, Luis and Chetna

602
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,960
have chosen to flavour their choux pastry.

603
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,880
- Morning.
- Hello, Chetna.

604
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,640
So it looks as though you're making a chocolate choux.

605
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,040
Yes, just to add a bit of colour

606
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,160
and it does give a tiny bit of flavour to it.

607
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,800
With the yellowy mango filling in it,

608
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,680
on top I'm making a caramel chocolate icing,

609
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,040
and then I'm going to have little pieces of mango

610
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,760
and then on top of that

611
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,680
I'm going to have a little shake of caramel sugar.

612
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,200
To accompany her complex chocolate choux,

613
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,160
Chetna will make lemon meringue eclairs.

614
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,680
So I'm doing a lemon curd and then I'm going to mix it with

615
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,720
some cream and then I'm going to make Italian meringue.

616
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,920
And then raspberries, I'm debating whether to put it underneath

617
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,680
the lemon curd so that when you bite it, you can taste the raspberry.

618
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,680
You're being very ambitious, you've got rather a lot going on.

619
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,960
- Yes.
- Good luck. 
- Well done, Chetna, see you.

620
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,320
I'm making a Neapolitan eclair,

621
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,920
so I'm doing a chocolate choux with a strawberry mousse inside.

622
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,320
You can't use too much cocoa in the choux,

623
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,120
because it prevents it rising so well.

624
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,560
Like Chetna, Kate's also making flavoured choux -

625
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,560
chocolate choux for her Neapolitan eclairs

626
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,920
and basil choux for her lemon meringue ones.

627
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,160
So I'm using Greek basil, which is a bit punchier in flavour.

628
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,640
I'm making a lemon curd mousse filling for the lemon meringue.

629
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,080
There's a lot to do, I really need to get a wiggle on.

630
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,800
- Hello, Nancy.
- Morning.

631
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
Can you tell us about your two eclairs, please?

632
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,680
Yes, I'm going to do a salmon and horseradish eclair,

633
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,120
- topped with sesame seeds.
- It'd be lovely to have something savoury.

634
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,320
I've got smoked salmon and poached salmon

635
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,040
and then I've got some fresh horseradish.

636
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,840
Can I have a look at the horseradish?

637
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,920
I've never seen horseradish like that. Did you grow that, Nancy?

638
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,840
Brought the horseradish from my garden.

639
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,320
Nancy is the only baker to attempt both a savoury and sweet eclair.

640
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,360
She will stir a home-made raspberry jam through creme patissiere

641
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,880
to create the filling for her raspberry ripple eclairs.

642
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,200
Are you using the same choux for both or are you changing it round?

643
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,120
I've tried a savoury choux and a sweet choux, one for each.

644
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,040
And to be honest with you, I couldn't tell the difference.

645
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,160
So I'm making one batch of pastry and I'll use it for both.

646
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,720
Thank you very much, Nancy.

647
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,120
So I've just added the flour

648
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:18,000
and cocoa powder to the butter-water mixture.

649
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,080
And I have to just beat it for two minutes

650
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,360
so the rawness of the flour will get cooked.

651
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,720
So that's made like one ball now.

652
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,960
So I'm going to pour that into a bowl.

653
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,600
The main challenge for a choux pastry is knowing when it's done.

654
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,640
In the words of my dad, not too thick and not too wet, basically.

655
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,800
And you've got to do it by eye.

656
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,040
If you pick it up on a spatula and drop it

657
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,240
and you get a V then that's when it's meant to be done.

658
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,160
Today, I am making some lavender and blueberry eclairs,

659
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,920
and some rose and raspberry eclairs.

660
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,080
You get a little bit more adventurous, really.

661
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,680
I wouldn't have made lavender custard this time last year.

662
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,040
'In addition to lavender, Richard will make a rose custard.

663
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,200
'He's hoping that he can nail those delicate floral flavours.'

664
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,320
- Hey, Richard, how you doing? 
- Not bad, not bad.

665
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,840
I can't help but notice, Richard, that you've brought

666
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,800
a little bit of your day job on to today's bake.

667
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,680
- Oh...yeah. 
- Are you advertising?

668
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,200
I was a bit bored, so I thought I'd build a set of stairs.

669
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,680
- So this is your first eclair stair? 
- Yes, the eclair stair.

670
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,120
It's actually going to be recycled into a chicken stair

671
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,160
when I get home.

672
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,560
My dad keeps chickens and I'm going to turn it into a chicken ladder.

673
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,960
Making them walk upstairs to bed? Don't they have wings?

674
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,040
Can't they just fly?

675
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,320
- Hello, Martha.
- Hello.

676
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,640
So have you made eclairs much before?

677
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,440
For my AS coursework, we did a whole portfolio on desserts.,

678
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,560
we had to pick one and then develop it.

679
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,040
And I chose profiteroles, so it's the same pastry.

680
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,800
So I've written about 8,000 words about different developments

681
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,760
of profiteroles, which is just ridiculous.

682
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,360
- You wrote a dissertation on choux? 
- Pretty much, yeah.

683
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,040
What are you doing for your eclairs? What are your two eclairs?

684
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,480
I'm doing a rhubarb and custard eclair with some candied rhubarb

685
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,440
on the top and a creme pat and rhubarb compote in the inside.

686
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,440
And then I'm doing a maple syrup and bacon eclair.

687
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,920
Martha's American breakfast theme eclairs

688
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,120
will be filled with maple syrup creme patissiere

689
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,080
and topped with nougat and bacon sprinkles.

690
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,640
Sometimes you get quite an overwhelming flavour of bacon,

691
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,080
- which... 
- It shouldn't be overwhelming,

692
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,600
it should just be a little...

693
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,120
It's basically it's a maple and pecan eclair with little bits of

694
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,560
- candied bacon just for saltiness. 
- OK.

695
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,200
So I'm going to let it cool in the bag

696
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,520
so that it holds its shape when I pipe it.

697
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,000
Oh, gosh, it's so important for me to do well today,

698
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,480
very, very important.

699
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,560
So I'm going to pipe them and then they're ready for baking.

700
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,280
I'm just spraying them with a bit of sunflower oil,

701
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,640
because I think it helps them rise a bit more evenly.

702
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,000
Water just creates a bit of steam when you first put them in.

703
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,760
There's one that's wide, and the rest are fine.

704
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,440
You've just got to look at them - if they grow then they're done.

705
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,200
If they don't then they're not.

706
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,040
A good eclair, for me, would be not doughy.

707
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,160
Light and airy and lots of space inside to fill.

708
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,480
I think they're fairly uniform. Apart from that one.

709
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,680
Halfway through, and with two hours remaining, the bakers need to

710
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:05,280
leave their choux to cool and focus on fillings.

711
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,520
I'm doing a maple syrup creme pat and just a custard one

712
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,000
for the custard and rhubarb ones,

713
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,400
because obviously creme pat is custard.

714
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,200
I'm just measuring out my rose water for my second custard.

715
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,760
It's another one you have to be really sparing on,

716
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
because once again I'm doing another custard

717
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,960
that could taste like soap if I put too much in.

718
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,120
Luis, Nancy and Richard are making fruit jams

719
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,920
to cut through the flavour of their sweet fillings.

720
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Luis, what are you up to at the moment?

721
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,640
I'm just making different fillings -

722
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,880
one of them is going to be blueberry cheesecake,

723
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,000
so the bottom of the eclair has got a strip of blueberry jam in.

724
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,760
And the other one is going to be peanut butter and Jell-o,

725
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,600
and it's a strawberry jam running underneath it.

726
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,480
Luis will decorate his American-themed eclairs

727
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,680
with candied pecans and peanut brittle.

728
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,640
Now your blueberry jam there,

729
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,720
it looks as though it's a blueberry jelly. Have you sieved that?

730
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,320
I have sieved it a little bit, yes, it is smooth.

731
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,200
I have to see how the flavours go together,

732
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,920
there are quite a lot of them.

733
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,400
- All right, mate, good luck. Interesting flavours.
- Cool.

734
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,640
I'm reducing down my raspberries and my blueberries at the moment.

735
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,520
I think the fruits work quite well with the rose and the lavender.

736
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,600
I'd like to think I'm traditional, but with a contemporary twist.

737
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,400
THEY LAUGH

738
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:29,120
- That's all right, in't it?! I am! 
- You DEFINITELY are.

739
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,400
The bakers' eclairs will all need a clever twist

740
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,200
to catch the eye of the judges.

741
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,560
We do have a big variety of eclairs set out for us today,

742
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,200
and they are...four hours is quite a long challenge.

743
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,960
We expect to see something that's going to really stand out.

744
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,520
Three of them are doing chocolate,

745
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,200
that's going to be fascinating to see.

746
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,280
Kate's doing the same thing as Chetna as well,

747
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,400
they're both doing that lemon meringue eclair.

748
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,240
Can't believe Chetna's making the same one as me.

749
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,200
Unusual, because it's such an unusual thing,

750
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,640
I've never seen it anywhere.

751
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,640
The race is now on to assemble their showstopping eclairs.

752
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,120
So that I get the same in each one, I'm weighing the filling

753
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,560
as it goes in, because you just can't see what's going on.

754
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,280
My creme pat is a bit too runny

755
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,240
and I don't really know what to do about that.

756
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,320
I think I might have left it out of the fridge for a bit too long,

757
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,440
or maybe it wasn't thick enough to begin with,

758
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,720
or maybe I put too much cream into it.

759
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,000
This is the strawberry mousse.

760
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,360
So I'm taking strawberry,

761
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,960
I am mixing it into the cream.

762
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,440
Do you suffer in any way, Chetna, from tinnitus?

763
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,360
- What's that?
- Ringing in the ears.

764
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,840
- SHE LAUGHS 
- Yes or no.

765
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,840
- No.
- Good, because I'm about to shout.

766
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,680
Bakers! Half an hour left, thank you!

767
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,040
- God, is it half an hour left?! 
- Yes! Look at you go.

768
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,720
- Shall I shout again so you go even faster?
- No, I can't!

769
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,360
15 minutes to go, bakers!

770
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,640
- No, stop!
- I'm joking, I'm just playing with you.

771
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,160
I might make a maple cream instead,

772
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,880
cos it's too runny for me to put inside.

773
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,680
It's just going to ooze out. I really don't want that to happen.

774
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,920
The creme pat dilemma has really made me pushed for time.

775
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,080
I think I was going to be pushed for time anyway

776
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,080
and it's made it really... It's going to be really difficult for me

777
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,680
to finish on time, I think.

778
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,920
Bakers, you've got ten minutes left to polish your choux.

779
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,920
Come on, shard, please.

780
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,200
Richard, honestly, I haven't even filled them yet.

781
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,160
I feel under a massive amount of pressure.

782
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,360
Argh!

783
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,800
I keep misplacing my things. Scissors, scissors, scissors...

784
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,400
- Richard?
- Yeah.

785
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,520
Can you break up my nougat into small squares?

786
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,240
It's on right there. Oh, my goodness, these are awful.

787
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,160
Looks a total mess.

788
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,080
Nothing like putting a hot strawberry in chocolate.

789
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,520
What do you want where?

790
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,720
One on each is fine, thanks so much, you guys.

791
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,600
OK, bakers, this choux-stopper is over.

792
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,840
That's enough, move yourselves away, shoo!

793
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,240
Terrible, absolutely terrible, I'm a goner. I'm so a goner.

794
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,440
I think the flavours are all right. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed.

795
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,760
Nancy, do you need a hand?

796
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,880
No, I'll be fine.

797
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,520
I think the whole presentation is simply beautiful,

798
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,240
and you take immense care in what you do.

799
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,000
Let's start with savoury.

800
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,160
It's very light, delicate and crispy.

801
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,040
I must say I'd like a little more seasoning, but it is very good.

802
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,080
Baked well, great filling.

803
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:51,000
So this one, bit soggy underneath, but it's holding itself quite well.

804
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,280
I do like them. They're a bit sickly.

805
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,240
You've got a lot of sweetness on the top.

806
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,600
Yeah, you're that far from perfection.

807
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,840
Exactly, it's just the adjustment of the filling.

808
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,040
I think they've got a decent shine on them,

809
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,240
I just think the topping's let you down a bit.

810
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,600
They look to me, every one the same size, which is quite a feat.

811
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,960
I think we'll try the blueberry one first.

812
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,760
It's packed full of filling,

813
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,800
got a nice shell around the outside - a good bake.

814
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,880
You haven't over-lavendered.

815
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,560
Let's have a look at the raspberry and the rose.

816
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,440
It's got a nice crisp again.

817
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,600
I think the rose is perfect, the hint of the rose is good,

818
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,000
it's not overwhelming.

819
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:49,560
I hope I've done enough to survive, but my gut feeling is it's 50/50.

820
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,400
Do you know, looking at those, it's a party.

821
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,480
You've managed to get them all an even length, six inches.

822
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,280
You're very good with precision.

823
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,880
- I think, Luis, they look amazing. 
- Thank you.

824
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,760
There's so much going on, but it's clean, it's sharp.

825
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,880
Let's start with this one.

826
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,240
- I think it's incredible. 
- Wow, thank you.

827
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,080
You were going for the peanut butter and jam and you've got that.

828
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,400
It is different - I like that, I like different.

829
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,880
Let's try this one, shall we?

830
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,160
You've really cracked it. It's very difficult

831
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,880
to keep the jam from making the base soggy,

832
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,240
and you've achieved that.

833
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,920
You have nailed it on all counts. Well done, Luis.

834
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,520
I'm flattered, thank you very much.

835
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,680
It's all right, but it's not perfect.

836
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,520
And I had to do perfect today.

837
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,760
- We'll try the lemon meringue one first.
- OK.

838
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,800
Got a good amount of filling in there.

839
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,080
The lemon filling's very good. I wouldn't know there was basil there.

840
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,480
- Oh, really? It comes very late on. 
- I've got the basil.
- Yay!

841
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,920
It's interesting with that wave of basil at the end,

842
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,840
- it works quite well.
- I've had a second piece and I can't get it.

843
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,920
Couple of hours' time, you'll be on the bus on the way home, Mary.

844
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,760
The chocolate ones are a mess from start to finish, really.

845
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,640
Some of them are baked more than others,

846
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,480
the shard hasn't really worked, the result looks a little bit messy.

847
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,640
- I totally agree. 
- The strawberry filling is too runny,

848
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,760
it's coming out as a runny, whipped cream.

849
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,800
- It does all work together, it just looks a mess.
- Yep, thank you.

850
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,640
I think they look a lovely display.

851
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,280
You've got 13 as well.

852
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,880
- Have I?
- Oh, good.

853
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,720
Thanking you!

854
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,280
That's my wages sorted.

855
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,120
It's got a nice sharpness to it.

856
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,240
I think the eclair probably could have done with

857
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,920
a couple more minutes, but I'm being picky, that's what I do.

858
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,720
The flavour inside is fantastic,

859
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,000
and the Italian meringue on top is lovely.

860
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,480
Now, chocolate one.

861
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,480
The actual choux pastry with the chocolate is very good.

862
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,480
- It really is.
- So unusual to have mango and chocolate,

863
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,120
you feel it's very indulgent.

864
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,560
But overall, two different types of eclairs,

865
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,320
very well thought out and well-executed.

866
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,880
- Well done.
- Thank you. 
- Thank you, Chetna.

867
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,680
The last ten minutes were just crazy.

868
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,120
I thought at one point I wouldn't get anything on plates.

869
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,000
Where do I start? I don't think they look good at all.

870
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,160
Let's see what they taste like. Let's try this one.

871
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,840
It falls apart very, very easily.

872
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,720
The flavour of the rhubarb and custard's coming through.

873
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,680
It tastes of rhubarb and custard, and it's good.

874
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,280
And these little twirls, I do like the inventive idea.

875
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,080
Right, let's try one of these.

876
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,320
Yeah, I was going to make a maple creme patissiere,

877
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,520
but I think again it was too much cream and it was too runny

878
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,840
to put in, so I just whipped up a maple cream very quickly.

879
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,520
The filling's too weak, it needs to be stiffened up.

880
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,640
The bacon, it should crumble, it doesn't go.

881
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,360
It doesn't really work for me.

882
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,480
- Chin up.
- It's fine.

883
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,120
So in front of me here are these amazing American-style

884
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,080
almost like hot dog eclairs that Luis made.

885
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,520
He pulled himself right back up, didn't he?

886
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,400
I think Luis did phenomenally well.

887
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,720
The flavour, the texture, the rise.

888
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,280
He was seriously down there, in serious trouble,

889
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,320
and I think he's done extremely well.

890
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,040
Mary, do you think he's done enough?

891
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,480
I think he's done enough, and it was a spectacular finish.

892
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,960
He had a great day at the office.

893
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,880
Unfortunately Martha experienced the reverse, didn't she?

894
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,840
She was doing all right with the signature,

895
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,520
she came third in the technical, so she was sitting quite comfortably.

896
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,920
And then today, she comes up with that, which is a disaster.

897
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,320
The icing, the bacon, so there was a lot of issues with it.

898
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,120
But... She wasn't in danger but I think she certainly

899
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,440
put herself into a little bit of trouble.

900
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,880
Do you think Chetna's safe, Mary?

901
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,240
I think Chetna's safe, her chocolate eclair there, very special.

902
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,280
And her lemon meringue tasted so good.

903
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,000
Kate didn't fare particularly well in either the signature

904
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,320
- or the technical.
- She always seems as though she's confident,

905
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,240
she's full of smiles, but it wasn't so good today.

906
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,960
I mean, her lemon meringue, I couldn't taste the basil

907
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,000
- and I still can't taste the basil. 
- Still nothing?
- Nothing?!
- Nothing.

908
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,240
And the chocolate one as you bit it, it dropped all over the place.

909
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,680
I think she struggled this weekend, when you look at the whole picture.

910
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,080
And I think she's in a bit of trouble, yes.

911
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:15,280
What about Nancy? You said she was quite close to perfection.

912
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,680
The amount of flavour that's gone into that salmon,

913
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,600
she needed the seasoning just to lift it up.

914
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,520
So she was very close from getting it absolutely bang on.

915
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,560
She needs to taste her bakes, doesn't she?

916
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,280
- I think so.
- As she goes along. 
- Has this put her up a notch?

917
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,240
She came from second in the technical,

918
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:33,200
and based on that, being up there again too, I think she's quite safe.

919
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,720
Richard had a cracking start yesterday.

920
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,360
How did today compare, Mary?

921
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:41,040
Over the years of Bake Off, we've had real problems with lavender

922
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,920
and rose, and he got those subtle flavours, er...

923
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:49,440
but the decoration isn't exactly dazzling, is it?

924
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,080
- He came first in Technical. 
- First in Signature.

925
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,400
- Yeah, he did the first one-one. 
- He did very well.

926
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,080
So the bakers are all very, very good -

927
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,600
is it hard to distinguish between them at this point?

928
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:04,040
One SINGLE mistake can get you crashing out of Bake Off,

929
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,080
which, really we've never been in that situation before,

930
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,840
when the whole group are so good.

931
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,040
And when they do make a mistake, it's highlighted.

932
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,880
Do you know who might be going?

933
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,280
- Mmm.
- Mmm. I do.

934
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,880
- And do you have somebody in mind for Star Baker?
- Yes.
- I do.

935
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,440
Well, we'll leave you be. You can discuss that.

936
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,080
- We'll reconvene. 
- Ooh, I've just got basil!

937
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:47,880
Bakers! Who thought choux could be so emotional?

938
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,360
I'm delighted to say that today's Star Baker

939
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,000
is not just a pastry perfectionist,

940
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,680
but also makes a bespoke mitred stepladder

941
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,680
upon which his best bakes can rest.

942
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,600
The inventor, the pioneer of the eclair stair,

943
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,320
today's Star Baker is Richard. Well done.

944
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,120
APPLAUSE

945
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,600
I feel a bit like the angel of doom today, I'm afraid.

946
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:19,840
It gets very difficult, and Paul and Mary said that there's

947
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:26,440
so little between you now, this has been a very, very tricky decision.

948
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,360
But I'm afraid we have to say goodbye to somebody

949
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:34,760
and the person that won't be joining us on Bake Off next time is...

950
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,280
Kate. We're very sorry to say goodbye.

951
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,120
Mel-Sue sandwich.

952
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,560
You've been magnificent. Magnificent.

953
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,160
Gutted, absolutely gutted.

954
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,320
I'm overwhelmingly pleased to have done it.

955
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,640
I'll never stop baking, obviously I'll never stop baking,

956
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,200
but I might not bake tomorrow.

957
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,600
And I might not even bake the next day.

958
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,080
Kate was in a very difficult position coming into

959
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,560
today's challenge and I thought that overall,

960
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,440
Martha was in a much stronger position,

961
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,840
certainly coming into today,

962
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,720
and I think she just did enough, and that's why Kate had to go.

963
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,280
I'm so surprised - I cannot believe I'm still here.

964
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,680
I think it must have been the closest decision yet.

965
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,360
Obviously, I've always cared about it but I never thought

966
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,960
I would care about it to the point where I would cry over an eclair.

967
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,920
It's quite strange. But I did, I did cry over an eclair!

968
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,320
Do you think your chickens need stairs?

969
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,160
They do, I treat them well.

970
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,280
It really is very unusual at this stage

971
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,360
to be Star Baker three times over. But Richard's done it.

972
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,400
I like making my family proud.

973
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,440
It's always nice to go home and tell the kids that Daddy won.

974
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,800
I just got to try and not let it get on top of me, really,

975
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,640
so yeah, lots and lots of fun but lots and lots of practice this week.

976
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,880
'Next time, it's the quarterfinals.'

977
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,480
It takes, like, one bad bake to make you go home.

978
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,920
It is absolutely raw.

979
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,960
'And the bakers are risking their all in a fruity signature.'

980
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,160
It's a dangerous thing to do.

981
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,680
'Stretching themselves in the technical.'

982
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,440
We're getting good length, aren't we?

983
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,280
How much length do you want?!

984
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,640
'And hitting the spot with their showstopping doughnuts.'

985
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,720
Oh-ho-ho!
