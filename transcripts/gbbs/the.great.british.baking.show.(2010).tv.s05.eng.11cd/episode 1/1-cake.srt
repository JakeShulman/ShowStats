1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,160
- Hey.
- Come this way.
- This is good, this is very good.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,920
We have got 12 oven-fresh bakers raring to get into the tent

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,240
with just a mere 30 challenges between them and the title.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,200
Plus two meticulous judges - Queen Mary Berry and that angry man

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,200
with the expensive blue contact lenses - can't remember his name.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,920
- Welcome... 
- BOTH: To The Great British Bake Off!

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,520
Thousands of people applied, hoping to reach the Bake Off tent.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,280
It's been quite a while coming - now, today, it starts.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,720
Just 12 have made it through, and over the next ten weeks...

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,400
I'm just most excited about being in the tent.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,680
To walk in there, have your station, see your ingredients,

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,040
see your recipe.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,360
Their baking will be scrutinised, whatever their experience.

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,160
'I've been baking for 60 years.'

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,040
I suppose I'm having my chance at last, aren't I?

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,240
'The thing that worries me the most is probably opening the oven'

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,280
and realising I've burnt everything.

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,000
The Bake Off judges, Mary and Paul...

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,080
I don't know how she's going to recover that.

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,480
..have prepared 30 brand-new challenges.

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,760
'Been aware of Mary Berry for a long time,'

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,480
so quite looking forward to having her taste my wares, if you like.

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,880
'If I'm given the opportunity,'

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,840
I will give Mr Hollywood a run for his money I think.

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,560
Each new challenge has been carefully designed...

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,080
Fill your boots.

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,800
..to reveal who is a brilliant baker...

28
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,680
See what everyone else is doing.

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,600
..and who had the judgment...

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,520
Come on!

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,880
..to deliver perfect cakes, breads, biscuits and desserts.

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,320
Do you like my offcuts?

33
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,760
You've got one of the best-tasting offcuts in the business.

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,920
Those who fall short will be asked to leave.

35
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,960
Those who excel...

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,080
I think it's all right. Miracle!

37
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,920
..will be named Star Baker.

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,080
I've got the shakes!

39
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,280
But who will make it through...

40
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,440
Absolutely no idea.

41
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,000
..and be crowned the winner...

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,720
Come on, Diana. High-five me!

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,920
..of the Great British Bake Off?

44
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,520
Are you worried about this?

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,920
This year we've travelled to the Royal County of Berkshire.

46
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
We've rowed down the River Lambourn,

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,520
unloaded the mixing bowls

48
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,800
and pitched the Bake Off tent among the hidden gardens of Welford Park.

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,640
It's already time for a lie-down.

50
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,560
So, the definition of cakes. Well, they can be large or extra-large.

51
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,440
- They can be plain or fancy. Light or fruity. A bit like us.
- Mmm.

52
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,960
And they can also be kept in a hermetically sealed box

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,400
for up to three days.

54
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,360
Unlike us because we can only really do two before we go off.

55
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,760
- Don't put me in a box.
- It's either that or the love dungeon with Paul.

56
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,920
- I'll take the box.
- Me too.
- Yeah.

57
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,080
The first of this week's three challenges involves the ultimate

58
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,760
in cake-based gymnastics.

59
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,680
Bakers, welcome to the Bake Off tent!

60
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,880
Today, you've got your first ever signature challenge,

61
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,320
and Paul and Mary would love you to make your very best swiss roll.

62
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,360
Now there are two ways to make a swiss roll -

63
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,800
first of all you push Roger Federer down a hill,

64
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,440
secondly a lovely thing involving sponge and jam.

65
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,880
Indeed. But the crucial feature

66
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,440
is the very tight roll, which creates the swirl.

67
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,880
That signature swirl. There's a mime for you.

68
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,720
OK? You've got two and a half hours, very good luck everybody.

69
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,040
- On your marks...
- Get set...
- Bake!

70
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,560
# It's only a cake, it's only a cake

71
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,120
# Keep telling myself it's only a cake! #

72
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,720
Baking. We know how to bake, don't we?

73
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,160
We do. Only thing we know!

74
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,040
'brand-new year, 12 new bakers.'

75
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,560
I can't wait to see what they're all like.

76
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,800
I've been baking for a really long time but I'm still learning

77
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,560
and do you know, I learn from our bakers

78
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,120
so I shall be there seeing what I can absorb too.

79
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,240
Swiss rolls are a great first Signature Challenge.

80
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,480
The key thing is - choose your filling carefully,

81
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,120
whether you're going to put coffee in it, or a buttercream,

82
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,320
make sure your filling is not too wet.

83
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,240
Then the whole thing together as you roll up will be perfectly

84
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,040
aligned and you'll get that symmetry

85
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,120
when you cut down through your swiss roll.

86
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,280
This swiss roll was the Sunday treat at home.

87
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,520
No matter what, we had to be home for Mother's swiss roll.

88
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,640
Diana joined the WI when she was just 13.

89
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,280
Three years later, she met her husband Malcolm.

90
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,120
They live in Shropshire and have been married for 53 years.

91
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,840
Her mum's simple tea swiss roll is filled with lemon curd.

92
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,760
My daughters said, "Keep calm, Mother!" So...

93
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,800
"Treat it as if you were in a school exam and read all the question."

94
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,280
SHE LAUGHS

95
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,040
Good morning.

96
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,080
Hello. You all right?

97
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,120
Morning, Luis. Tell us about your swiss roll.

98
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,720
I am making a Spanish swiss roll.

99
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,880
The sponge is orange and aniseed flavoured

100
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,840
cos my mum used to make a lot of baking with aniseed, being Spanish.

101
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,600
And I've also got honey from my bees,

102
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,560
- which I keep bees.
- Your own bees! 
- Yes.

103
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,640
Luis trained as a graphic designer and lives in Stockport.

104
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,360
His wife Louise gave him his first beehive eight years ago.

105
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,640
He now has four in his garden, four in his allotment

106
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,160
and one at his caravan.

107
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,440
His honey will be whipped into the cream

108
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,600
that will top his orange and aniseed roll.

109
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,520
How much aniseed are you going to put in?

110
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,720
- Only about 15 grams. Just enough. 
- And are you going to be careful?

111
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,240
Aniseed is such a pungent flavour.

112
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,040
- It is and you don't want it numbing your mouth too much.
- Exactly.

113
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,640
- I don't want to feel as though I'm in a dentist.
- No. So...
- OK.

114
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,360
The cardamom seeds, I'm just trying to make them a little bit

115
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,160
and make them a tiny bit of powder and when this is ready,

116
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,400
I'm going to put it in.

117
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,040
I love to eat these but I have never made them.

118
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,240
It was a learning curve.

119
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,600
Chetna lives in Broadstairs in Kent with her husband Gurav,

120
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,080
four-year-old son and six-year-old daughter.

121
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,800
They've all tried her cardamom, pistachio and coffee swiss roll -

122
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,000
the first she's ever attempted.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,880
In India, most sweets would have a touch of cardamom

124
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,360
so I'm just using what I've grown up eating.

125
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,000
Home cooking, if you can say.

126
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,680
A swiss roll is traditionally a fatless sponge

127
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,080
made of a basic mix of sugar, flour and eggs.

128
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,080
I'm just whisking up my egg whites with caster sugar in

129
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,080
for the base of my swiss roll sponge.

130
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,360
And I need these in peaks, which I think I'm nearly at.

131
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,640
But not quite. Come on!

132
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,720
Claire lives in Cheshire with her husband Carl,

133
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,560
and their bull mastiff Trevor.

134
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,400
Her chocolate orange swiss roll is filled with orange jelly

135
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,800
and decorated with a milk chocolate orange tree.

136
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,560
- CLAIRE:
- My dad absolutely loves orange-flavoured chocolate.

137
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,320
Every Father's Day, that's all he gets.

138
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,640
We did try to be more creative,

139
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,240
but now we just throw him some orange-flavoured chocolate!

140
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,040
So it's kind of inspired by my dad really.

141
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,960
My swiss roll is going to be a pistachio praline sponge with

142
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,440
a strawberry jam and pistachio cream through it.

143
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,320
There's a lot of flavours going on.

144
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,200
It's mainly pistachio and strawberry just in as many different

145
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,640
guises as I could get them.

146
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,600
Has it got that colourful sort of green, nuclear kind of tang to it?

147
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,920
I'm going to extra-green it.

148
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,400
Richard's a builder.

149
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,960
Born and raised in north London,

150
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,160
he's the fourth generation in the family business.

151
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,520
The outside of his pistachio and strawberry swiss roll

152
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,360
is a tribute to his daughters.

153
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,320
I've just mixed up a pink mixture of my main sponge.

154
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,840
I'm very lucky to have two daughters,

155
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,320
so everything in our house has become pink.

156
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,640
So, yeah, I'm well-versed in flowers now.

157
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,120
Richard isn't the only one attempting to pattern his sponge.

158
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,640
I am baking my design into the Swiss roll.

159
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,320
It's a Japanese thing traditionally called...

160
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,520
..Kawaii?

161
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,240
Jordan lives in Nottingham with his girlfriend Bonnie

162
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,840
and works for a fruit machine company as an IT manager.

163
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,160
His Japanese-inspired kawaii swiss roll

164
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,880
will be filled with strawberries and creme patissiere.

165
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,360
What I found out at home is that too much pink

166
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,320
takes many, many hours to freeze,

167
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,600
and the only time I've got it to look beautiful at home

168
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,640
was either when I used a tiny amount of pink

169
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,400
or when I freeze it for about four hours!

170
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,920
As I've got two-and-a-half hours, that's not enough time.

171
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,800
Freezing should ensure that the pattern

172
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,280
keeps its shape during baking.

173
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,360
I'm just going to pop this in the freezer.

174
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,080
But one baker is heading straight for the oven.

175
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,720
There we go, three minutes in the oven.

176
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,640
Who wants to do some sugar?

177
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,960
CHILDREN: Me!

178
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,480
Enwezor is a business consultant and lives in Portsmouth

179
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,440
with his wife Karen and their four children.

180
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,000
And one more, I think.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,960
Their favourite Swiss meringue buttercream

182
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,680
will fill his floral swiss roll.

183
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,200
PAUL: How big is this going to be?

184
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,280
I've got to be careful.

185
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,200
- I've done it in the past but put too much in, because I'm greedy.
- Yeah.

186
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,920
And I can't put too many raspberries in

187
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,680
or else it makes it too big as well, so...

188
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,520
There is no such thing as too big, not in my world.

189
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,080
You've got to get the spiral in the middle in proportion to the

190
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,240
sponge - if you've got too much in the middle, you don't

191
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,680
get the lovely Catherine wheel.

192
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,960
It should be balanced, you should see some layers.

193
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,640
Fingers crossed, fingers crossed.

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,560
The delicate thin sponge of a Swiss roll bakes in just minutes.

195
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,600
So tempted just to watch it for the whole time whilst it's baking!

196
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,240
TIMER BEEPS

197
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,280
Go.

198
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,240
I never use a timer at home.

199
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,560
SHE INHALES DEEPLY

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,440
It's such a small range

201
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
where you can go over so easily,

202
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,160
and I have burnt some.

203
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,800
Kate is a furniture restorer and lives in Brighton

204
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,680
with her five-year-old daughter Eloise.

205
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,000
Her red velvet swiss roll is filled with white chocolate buttercream

206
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,720
and topped with white chocolate flowers.

207
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,840
It's different ovens. You never know.

208
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,720
So I've given myself between six and ten minutes.

209
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,840
Not ready.

210
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,600
The sponge for a swiss roll requires a texture like no other cake.

211
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,880
Nothing else to do.

212
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,800
I'd be gardening at home and forget about it.

213
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,880
It must be only just baked -

214
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,440
any more, and it won't be moist enough to roll without cracking.

215
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,440
So I've done it for ten minutes and I've found that it's overdone,

216
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,000
but less than that, it's raw.

217
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,840
Done. We're ready.

218
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,160
It's just on the edge, yeah. It's literally a few seconds.

219
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,480
You can smell the aniseed.

220
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,920
- Ah-h!
- Anise!

221
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,280
That's one very sexy sauna.

222
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,640
Thank you.

223
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,960
Still going to give it half a minute.

224
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,480
It kind of springs back when I touch it, which is good.

225
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,200
And now I'm going to roll it up when it's hot.

226
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,440
At just 17, Martha is the tent's youngest ever baker.

227
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,720
She's had to juggle practising for the Bake Off

228
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,320
with studying for her AS levels.

229
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,960
Her tiramisu swiss roll is topped with a row of macadamia nut brittles.

230
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,640
I think if you roll it when it's hot,

231
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,440
it's less likely to crack because of all the different proteins

232
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,840
and stuff are still hot and they all move around,

233
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,520
whereas when it's cold, it's more likely to crumble,

234
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,680
which is why I roll mine up when it's hot.

235
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,240
But it's really hot!

236
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,840
The judges are looking for a tight and clearly defined roll.

237
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,680
They'll be appearing any second now.

238
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,440
Half of the bakers have decided to pre-roll straight from the oven

239
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,920
before adding any fillings.

240
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,960
I'm just going to make a little slash, then it draws tightly.

241
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,320
One baker likes it even tighter.

242
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,440
Why have you done that?

243
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,560
Because if you score it, it prevents it cracking,

244
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,680
I think, when you roll it.

245
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,440
- I want to see you do this then. 
- OK, right.

246
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,880
We're not standing here for the next ten minutes, Mary.

247
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
This is a new theory to me. I haven't seen this.

248
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,240
- God, you're doing multiple scoring. 
- Oh, yeah.
- Iain, it's not a squid!

249
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,760
Iain grew up in Belfast but now lives in London

250
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,560
and is a construction engineer.

251
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,000
His apricot and basil swiss roll

252
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,880
is filled with a mascarpone and white chocolate cream.

253
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,040
This is one of the most monitored rolls

254
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,120
in the history of swiss roll making.

255
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,560
Mmm!

256
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,720
Mary, don't be inscrutable - be loving!

257
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,880
- Leave him alone. Thank you very much indeed.
- Thank you.

258
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,280
You've got one hour left to roll yourself to Switzerland.

259
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Sorry!

260
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,680
The bakers' next hurdle is perfecting their filling.

261
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,840
Just preparing a morello cherry jam. It's a Black Forest roll.

262
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,920
I can't say it's a Black Forest swiss roll

263
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,480
because the Black Forest is not in Switzerland.

264
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,640
It's in Germany.

265
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,760
It's in Deutschland, like where my dog comes from!

266
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,560
Norman's a retired merchant navy radio operator

267
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,360
who lives in Buckie in the north-east of Scotland

268
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,760
with his wife Iris and his schnauzer Lucy.

269
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,400
Not only is he a passionate traditional baker,

270
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,040
but he's also a keen potter

271
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,480
and today Norman's Black Forest swiss roll

272
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,240
will be presented on something never seen before on Bake Off.

273
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,120
- Don't tell me you made it. 
- I did, yes.

274
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,560
- Let me have a look at that. 
- That's a skateboard.

275
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,840
What do you normally do, a sponge on a segway?

276
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,480
Do you always serve things on a...

277
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,320
I've done it on a segway, yes, now and again.

278
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,600
The idea of the flavours of a Black Forest in a swiss roll

279
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,040
ticks all the boxes for me.

280
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,120
Will you be wearing lederhosen when you serve it

281
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,640
- to complete the full effect?
- Jawohl.

282
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,240
A traditional swiss roll is rarely decorated...

283
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,320
I'm going to make the brittle.

284
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,680
..something most of this year's bakers are planning to ignore.

285
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,760
- Those look smart.
- Oh, no. Don't pick them up. They're setting.

286
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,280
I'm just making a simple syrup.

287
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,880
I've got nuts in the oven, but once the sugar's melted

288
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,280
I've got to drop the nuts in and then reheat it.

289
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,320
And then it should go nice and toffee and golden,

290
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,720
or it might go white and crumbly and horrible...

291
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,240
..which has happened...

292
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,560
..more than once.

293
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,640
Nancy lives in Lincolnshire

294
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,400
and has five children and eight grandchildren.

295
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,720
Baking keeps her hens very busy.

296
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,280
She plans to top her family's favourite coffee swiss roll

297
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,560
with chewy caramelised hazelnuts.

298
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,720
- It's gone a bit dry, Nancy, hasn't it?
- Dry nuts.
- Dry nuts.
- Yeah.

299
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,040
- Should it be...
- That should be like toffee!
- Nuts in a liquid.

300
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,320
So what I'm going to do, this is just between you and I.

301
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,280
- Yes, no-one else will know.
- They don't need to know, those other two.

302
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,800
I'm going to blitz that to a powder.

303
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,000
What I'm loving, Nancy, is you don't seem remotely worried about this.

304
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,520
Are you worried about this?

305
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,680
OK, bakers.

306
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,800
That's quinze minutes or zwanzig Minuten on your swiss rolls,

307
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,960
depending on which part of Switzerland you're in.

308
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,760
Ta-da!

309
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,880
Right, here's the tricky bit, where I'm going to try

310
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,280
and roll it in one piece.

311
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,120
I'm just going for it!

312
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,240
This is the momento!

313
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,200
It's cracking a bit.

314
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,080
Looking all right so far.

315
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,880
There we go.

316
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,280
Ta-da!

317
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,280
Are there going to be any cracks? No! I'm happy with that.

318
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,640
It's split a bit.

319
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,200
HE GROWLS

320
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,480
HE SIGHS

321
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,520
I've just had this crack, which is not helping at all.

322
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,880
Oh, well, a bit of cream on top?

323
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,200
Oh, no, it's split!

324
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,280
Yeah, looks quite good. I'll have a taste of it in a minute.

325
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,120
By my Swiss watch, one minute precisely -

326
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
one minute to go on this challenge!

327
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm going to dust it with sugar so it gives, erm, stripes.

328
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,240
No-one will ever know...

329
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,480
- Stop the shake.
- Sorry.

330
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,680
Stop the shakes, OK. It's looking good.

331
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,560
- Oh, no, it's falling out!
- It's looking good, no, it's looking good.

332
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,160
Left them too long!

333
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,760
I've got the shakes!

334
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,640
Covering up the cracks.

335
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,080
OK, bakers. Time's up. Well done, your first challenge is over.

336
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,760
I hope you all win, I'm maintaining strict Swiss neutrality.

337
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,880
My goodness.

338
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,840
I'm a little bit nervous about what the judges are going to think,

339
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,360
just because it's Paul and Mary!

340
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,200
The bakers will now have their creations judged by Paul

341
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,920
and Mary for the very first time.

342
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,480
- Hello, Martha.
- Hello!

343
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,040
So, I love the decoration, I think

344
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,120
the actual shape of the swiss roll is good.

345
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,400
Not much of a roll though, there's not much of a swirl in there.

346
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,720
SHE CHUCKLES

347
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,160
So mean.

348
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,200
The sponge has an excellent flavour, and it's beautifully soft.

349
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,000
The flavour of the alcohol coming through is perfectly balanced

350
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,240
with the flavour of the cream and the sponge.

351
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,360
- But, overall, that tastes fantastic. 
- Yeah.

352
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,120
I like the decoration on it.

353
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,160
It looks a little bit under-baked,

354
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,480
and the raspberry is bleeding into the sponge.

355
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,960
Therefore, you're not getting the definition.

356
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,200
So beautiful.

357
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,200
The flavours are good, the cardamom doesn't come through till

358
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,160
you've just finished and it's just the right amount.

359
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,720
I love what you've done

360
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,800
to the strawberries on there, I think it works.

361
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,360
It's very trifle-ly.

362
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,720
It is just so moist, everything is running into each other.

363
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,280
It looks as classic as I can remember.

364
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,520
It hasn't been rolled quite tight enough,

365
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,200
and if you'd put the lemon curd with some cream it would give you

366
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,880
- just a little bit more hold together.
- Yes, yes.

367
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,880
HE COUGHS

368
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,920
The orange is coming through, the cream is a little bit nondescript.

369
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,720
I quite like the cream. LAUGHTER

370
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,920
You stand up for what you think's right. You're wrong, but I'll tell you what it is.

371
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,240
- A matter of opinion! 
- The orange is so strong that no matter what you put with it...
- Yeah.

372
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,440
..it's going to get kicked into touch.

373
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,440
- You know where you went wrong. 
- Yes.

374
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,080
Your theory of putting all those cuts across...

375
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,120
- All the way along, yeah.
- ..I don't think it helps one little bit.

376
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,960
- It actually makes it into a fold rather than a spiral. 
- Yeah, it does.

377
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,440
A bit of a spiral there!

378
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,320
It's pretty good, isn't it? I like that.

379
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,640
The crunch of the nuts on the outside with the coffee

380
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,320
and the sponge together works extremely well.

381
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,120
Sponge is lovely. The flavour of the cherry has come through.

382
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,840
It's just a bit bold, and a bit fat, and a bit big.

383
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,360
- Bold, fat and big, Norman. 
- It's for men.

384
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,080
Oh, my days.

385
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,040
This one's got a nice swirl. It does look good.

386
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,200
You've got that tartness coming from the oranges, that honey,

387
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,000
the aniseed, I think it works phenomenally well.

388
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,440
It's got wonderful decoration.

389
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,600
The swirl that you've got is probably one of the best ones

390
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,880
we've got here today.

391
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,960
- It's too dry.
- It is dry.
- Is it?

392
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,960
Hmm. Huh!

393
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,080
It's too dry and that's why it's cracked.

394
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,280
- Yeah. Yeah. 
- You left it in there too long.

395
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,120
I think what you've done with the decoration is impressive. What's your job?

396
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,720
- I'm a builder.
- Right, OK.

397
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,800
- I laid...
- The structure of it looks pretty good -

398
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,400
- I like what you've done with that. 
- You've got a lovely spiral here.

399
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,200
That...

400
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,600
- ..is fantastic.
- Whoa. Oh, my God.

401
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,160
The sharpness coming through, the sponge, the pistachios, the decoration.

402
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,120
- You've got a winner there.
- You're a builder? You're in the wrong job, mate.

403
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,720
You're seriously in the wrong job.

404
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,800
- Thank you so much.
- Very, very lovely.

405
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,600
I'm near the bottom I would say,

406
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,960
because things have to taste good and a dry sponge is NEVER good.

407
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,640
Oh, I could do with a lie-down.

408
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,320
It was so stressful in the lead-up,

409
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,440
and just to get nice comments was just a real joy, it was lovely.

410
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,880
The game plan now is a bit more focused.

411
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,640
I think it was a bit too laid-back.

412
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,240
I'm just really disappointed with myself.

413
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,760
I don't know why I'm crying over cake.

414
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,360
Everyone was able to plan and practise for their first cake.

415
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,200
The second is a complete mystery.

416
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,280
This is your first technical challenge.

417
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,280
It's cake week so, of course, it's going to be a Mary Berry recipe.

418
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,880
Now, Paul and Mary are going to judge this blind,

419
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,040
so with the greatest respect - tatty byes.

420
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,040
Good luck and do your very best!

421
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:45,280
Right, your very first technical challenge is Mary's classic

422
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,160
cherry cake.

423
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,160
You need the cherries suspended throughout,

424
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,000
drizzled with some icing and some lovely toasted almonds on top.

425
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,680
You have got two hours to pop Mary's cherry in the oven

426
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,640
- and bring it out again! On your marks...
- Get set...
- ..bake!

427
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,720
Oh, God!

428
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,280
SHE CHUCKLES

429
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,280
Technical challenge. This is how it feels!

430
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,120
The bakers have been given the same ingredients and Mary's basic recipe.

431
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,200
The recipe is sparse.

432
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,880
Not that difficult, I didn't think.

433
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
Mary - cherry cake.

434
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,080
Why have you picked this as the first technical challenge?

435
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,240
It's a Great British classic,

436
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,240
but it's quite tricky to get absolutely right.

437
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,520
Sometimes, the cherries all go to the bottom.

438
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,200
So they've got to do the right preparation of the cherries.

439
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,520
Just look at that all the way down.

440
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,360
That's what you're looking for, isn't it? Suspended cherries.

441
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,280
And also if you get the icing too runny, it will run off.

442
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,160
It's got to just gently trickle down.

443
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,160
It's the bakers' first technical challenge. First impressions last.

444
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,280
They'll be very nervous. It's only the second thing that they've made.

445
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,880
This is gorgeous this, Mary.

446
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
Is this better than your mum could ever do?

447
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,000
I think it is, really! Don't tell her.

448
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,280
Well, it says "prepare the cherries".

449
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,040
We don't know what "prepare" means.

450
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,880
Does she mean wash? Does she mean cut?

451
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,520
I'm going for cut.

452
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,680
I'm just going to cut the cherries in half rather than quarters,

453
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,920
so you want a bit of chunky cherry, don't you?

454
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,600
I remember reading somewhere that you have to dry cherries

455
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,240
before you add them to a mix, because otherwise they sink.

456
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,960
See what everyone else is doing.

457
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,640
Need to wash them and then you need to coat them in flour,

458
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,000
because if you don't, they'll sink to the bottom of the cake.

459
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,680
How much caster sugar? 175?

460
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,680
To make the cake mix, Mary's only instruction is to beat all the

461
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,080
ingredients together.

462
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,880
I usually whip the butter and the sugar first, do it all separately.

463
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,840
But let's stick to her rulebook instead of mine!

464
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,440
And she hasn't told them what consistency it needs to be.

465
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,680
Just keep beating it well.

466
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,280
I was going to use a machine but it's not worth plugging it in

467
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,480
and getting it going just for that, so I'll do it by hand.

468
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,360
It's a bit of exercise as well!

469
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,920
It's quite a thick mixture which is quite good, because I was worried that

470
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,640
if it was too runny the cherries would just sink straightaway.

471
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,240
I'm just folding in the flour,

472
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,320
which I know would be easier by machine but I just like to feel it.

473
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,360
90 minutes to go.

474
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,920
I just want to make sure there is a good spread of cherries,

475
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,720
because I just don't want all the cherries to be clumped together.

476
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,200
Okey-dokey.

477
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,880
SHE SIGHS Timer.

478
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,560
Mary's recipe states an oven temperature but no baking time.

479
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,800
BEEPS

480
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,920
I don't know how long to bake it for so...

481
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,080
once it's reached 35 minutes, I'm going to keep checking it.

482
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,640
I'm reckoning it's going to be nearer the 45.

483
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,320
I feel like I've missed something.

484
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,560
LAUGHTER

485
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,160
Have you got the cherries in?

486
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,840
Yes. I haven't saved my five for the top, though.

487
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,360
I didn't leave enough cherries to decorate

488
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,960
because I didn't look at the recipe and see "five cherries to decorate".

489
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,240
I saw "icing" and "lemons" and "almonds" and...

490
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,520
Fantastic!

491
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,040
..and my brain just completely skipped over the awful

492
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,680
ingredient of cherries.

493
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,160
Oh!

494
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,760
I think it's ready to come out.

495
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,920
Right, I think I'm going to take mine out.

496
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,200
I think it's all right. Miracle!

497
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,160
The hard bit is the turning out.

498
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,880
(That's OK.)

499
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,560
Hang on...

500
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,160
I can't see my cherries like yours!

501
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,760
That's probably a good thing, mine are all at the bottom.

502
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,320
HE LAUGHS

503
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,040
Oh, no, it's all right. Mine looks like King Luis'.

504
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,840
Yeah, I'm pretty pleased with it.

505
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,800
The cherries look well-dispersed from what

506
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,480
I can see from the outside, so...

507
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,560
I don't know. We'll see what it's like when they cut into it.

508
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,400
If the cake isn't completely cool before decorating,

509
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,280
the icing will melt into the sponge and disappear.

510
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,280
- Norman, I'm loving your fanning action.
- Good. Yes.

511
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,360
Please continue. Your Black Forest swiss roll went down really well.

512
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,520
Oh, yeah. It's a blast from the '70s.

513
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,760
Always.

514
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,400
Yeah. You know, we used to go out for a steak supper

515
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,240
and finish off with a Black Forest gateau and ice cream.

516
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,160
And I bet you sported some quite good flares, Norman.

517
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,440
- Oh, aye. Aye. 
- And some big old chops?

518
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,520
I could never get used to the, er... the platform shoes, though.

519
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,360
- I did buy a pair, but... 
- Did you wear platforms, Norman?

520
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,080
Once. I just said, "No, I'm not wearing that again."

521
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,840
- Now, listen. Have we fanned enough? 
- Let's see. Oh, yeah.

522
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,080
Some of the best fanning I've seen this week.

523
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,520
(Thanks very much.)

524
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,200
LAMB BLEATS

525
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,680
OK, bakers. That's 30 minutes of your technical challenge remaining.

526
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,360
Remember, no conferring. I'll class that as "cherry aid".

527
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,960
I don't mean any harm.

528
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,120
I'm picking perfect shaped almonds.

529
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,280
I don't normally bake like this, but...

530
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,000
because it's Mary Berry...

531
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,920
I'm just toasting the almonds at the moment,

532
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,360
because I thought, "Get them done and let them cool down."

533
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,960
Make sure the pan doesn't get too hot.

534
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,200
If you over-toast them, they can become bitter.

535
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,520
So you've got to keep a watch on that.

536
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,120
I can smell something burning.

537
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,960
- Yeah. Yeah.
- No, something's burning.

538
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,280
- Really.
- OK.

539
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,640
Oh! It's mine! OK, do that again, then.

540
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,840
Thank you!

541
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,520
Right, this is the juice from the lemon and the icing sugar.

542
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,600
It should make a fairly, fairly runny icing.

543
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,760
I'm just checking the consistency of the icing,

544
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,760
because I want it to just fall off in places.

545
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,200
I don't want it to completely cover the whole thing.

546
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,120
It needs to be able to stay on the cake

547
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,880
but not be a solid lump of icing blobbed in the middle, is it?

548
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,440
HE LAUGHS

549
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,520
OK, bakers. Ten minutes to dust, glaze and decorate.

550
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,040
Right.

551
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,520
Hmm. Well, I've just made that up on the spot.

552
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,240
I'm thinking spider's web.

553
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,720
SHE LAUGHS

554
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,720
This is where you let gravity take control

555
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,600
and just let it run off the sides.

556
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,160
The glaze, I don't think, should be really thick.

557
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,560
I could be completely wrong.

558
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,840
But you've got to go with your instinct.

559
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,440
Oh, yeah, that looks nice.

560
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,000
Can't believe I'm putting almonds on one by one.

561
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,120
OK, bakers, that's it.

562
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,320
It's time to say cherry-o to this particular technical challenge.

563
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,480
Come on, Diana. High-five me.

564
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,920
So, if you'd like to bring those magnificent rings up to the

565
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,000
altar and place them behind the photo of yourself. Thank you.

566
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,680
'Mary and Paul will be looking for a golden brown sponge,

567
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,040
'an even distribution of cherries and a thick coating of lemon icing.'

568
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,800
OK, Mary? Shall we start with this one?

569
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,080
The cherries are on the top, the almonds are there,

570
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,480
the icing looks about right.

571
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,840
Good distribution, actually, with the cherries.

572
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,200
- They are all the way through, aren't they?
- Mm-hm.

573
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,960
Good bake. Good icing.

574
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,480
Some of these nuts have been caught a bit.

575
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,640
Slightly overbaked, but very good distribution

576
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,800
of the cherries.

577
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,360
- Little bit dry.
- Mm. 
- Little bit overbaked.

578
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,040
Right, the next one.

579
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,600
Icing just a little bit runny.

580
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,480
Distribution's not bad, though, is it?

581
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,680
A little bit dry, and slightly overbaked.

582
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,200
Where are the cherries?

583
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,840
Let's just cut down here again.

584
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,280
Yeah, they are there.

585
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,000
They've decided to move to one side.

586
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,680
It's got a very nice finish,

587
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,440
and they've caught the icing just at the right time.

588
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,720
It hasn't dripped down on the bottom here.

589
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,800
Nice distribution of the cherries there.

590
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,840
The icing here is just a bit too runny.

591
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,280
The nuts are slightly overbaked again.

592
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,880
The colour of this one looks OK, although the icing is very weak.

593
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,400
Nice bake.

594
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,680
But the cherries are whole.

595
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,720
And when you do keep them whole, they do stay at the bottom.

596
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,240
I think the colour could be a bit lighter.

597
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,960
Again, the cherry pieces are very big. See? The size of these.

598
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,000
Now, this one's boldly decorated.

599
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,600
The icing's got a good colour.

600
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,000
And, also, so has the actual bake. It's a nice, light colour.

601
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,800
This one lost its cherries.

602
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,800
I think this person's forgotten to keep back some cherries.

603
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,240
Where are the cherries?

604
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,440
I really don't know where those cherries have gone.

605
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,280
There's no cherries on the top, they have to be in there somewhere.

606
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,560
- There's a couple. 
- There are very, very few cherries.

607
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,000
I don't know where they've gone.

608
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,840
A lot of them have sunk down to the bottom, haven't they?

609
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,640
Nice finish to it. Nice bold icing.

610
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,200
The flaked almonds on top perfectly browned.

611
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,760
The cherries have dropped to the bottom, haven't they?

612
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,480
Which is a shame. This one, I like the icing on this one.

613
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,040
The cherries, you can see...

614
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,720
The icing shows that this person can do things with precision.

615
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,520
It is a nice bake. Nice flavour, too.

616
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,440
Well done, guys, on the whole.

617
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,160
MEL: 'Mary and Paul will now reveal

618
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,360

PAUL: In last place is...

620
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,800
this one. Couldn't find the cherries.

621
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,480
I think I chopped them so small, they evaporated into thin air.

622
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,000
You're probably right.

623
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,680
11th place...this one here.

624
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,480
The outside was just a bit dry.

625
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,080
Tenth place is...this one.

626
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,360
The cherries are whole.

627
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,080
- Icing was a bit weak.
- Yeah.

Lovely icing. Nicely browned.

634

this one. Well done.

635
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,080
That's a very nice cherry cake.

A lovely texture, even distribution of the cherries, perfect nuts.

Wow. To be commended on your nuts by Mary Berry.

640
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,120
You've had a great day, Nancy.

641

- Thank you.
- Well done, Nancy.

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,240
It's going to make me want to try harder tomorrow.

649
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,600
And I will put in that wee bit of extra effort,

650
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,080
and I might have one pint less tonight.

658

How do you get those skills at that age?

659
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,280
When you look at the bottom end -

660
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,680
Claire's down there. Enwezor's down there.

661
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,400
I think Jordan is down there.

662
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,360
Iain came fourth in the technical,

663
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,960
but actually his swiss roll sort of missed a beat somehow.

664
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,320
Norman, he came very low down in the technical.

665
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,080
- Second to last.
- Second to last. He needs to lift himself up a bit.

666
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,240
For me, the man who serves food on a skateboard can never be in danger.

667
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,240
I think that's a quote from Confucius.

668
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,840
MEL: I think we're looking at a Norman conquest quite soon.

669
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,080
That's why you're sitting there, you two, isn't it?

670
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,560
MEL: Good morning, bakers. Welcome to your Showstopper day.

671
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,560

choice of British cake.

Sounds easy, doesn't it? Ha-ha!

674
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,880
Ha, ha, ha!

675
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,560
But they would like you to bake in perfect miniature.

676
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,320
We want 36 miniature cakes.

677
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,320
But they have to be identical and beautifully decorated.

678
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,600
You've got three and a half hours. On your marks...

679
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,240
- Get set...
- Bake!

680
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,360
Right, here we go.

right, because you get loads of air into it, and if you add the egg

698
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,720

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,720
If you want mini time, that's 3,600 seconds!

851
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,400
- JORDAN:
- I've got the shakes, which is not good for cake!

852
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,400
KATE: I'm pleased they're not horribly dry.

853
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,120
Oh, Claire, look what you've done.

854
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,320
Absolutely no idea.

855
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,880
Let's leave them in.

856
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,920
Poor Claire. She's having real trouble with her chocolate cakes.

857
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,320
The recipe's not right.

858
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,360
PAUL: It could be that the mixture's too wet.

859
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,360
When you get that almost volcano eruption,

860
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,200
it normally points it to that.

861
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,400
I don't know how she's going to recover that.

862
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,400
I am making some lighter chocolate and cherry cake

863
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,360
that I can cut out into circles that will

864
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:41,080
hopefully cook a bit quicker, cos it's going on a tray.

865
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,760
And then I'm going to sandwich it with some of these, then cover them

866
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,560
with chocolate and some sprinkles, and hopefully the decoration.

867
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,000
You've got half an hour left on your bakes.

868
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,760
Half an hour, guys!

869
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,520
I really have to speed up.

870
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,640
Get faster, to make this challenge.

871
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,920
So, I've made all the sponges. Got the cream ready.

872
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,160
So I'm just going to make 36 pieces of each size.

873
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,120
MEL: 'Those who haven't baked their miniature sponges separately

874
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,520
'need to cut them into individual pieces,

875
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,320
'which could dry out the edges.'

876
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,520
They look extremely neat and uniform.

877
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,080
They're not dry. I'm going to get my other thingy.

878
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,440
- Yeah. And I'm going to... 
- Eat. Do eat!

879
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,560
- ..tidy up some of these. 
- Do eat! Please do.
- Mmm.

880
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,400
My God, I can do it!

881
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,760
Two, four, six,

882
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,440
eight, ten, 12...

883
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,560
13, 14, 15, 16...

884
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,280
17, 18, 19, 20, 21,

885
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,480
22, 23, 24...

886
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,960
25, 30, 35, 36.

887
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,440
The honeycomb has not gone very well.

888
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,560
So, I'm thinking on my feet. I'm making a caramel.

889
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,960
I've toasted some more nuts.

890
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,160
I'll put the caramel on the nuts, wait for it to set.

891
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,080
Blast it, turn it into a praline. Put THAT on top.

892
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,320
It's just annoying, because they're not as neat as I wanted them to be.

893
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,680
DIANA: I'm ganaching my buns.

894
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,000
SHE LAUGHS

895
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,200
Some of them are a bit dicey-looking, but I've got 36.

896
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,760
- SUE:
- Word's got out about your offcuts.

897
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,560
Oh!

898
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,120
You like my offcuts?

899
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,880
You've got one of the best-tasting offcuts in the business.

900
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,120
SHE LAUGHS

901
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,360
Frantically running out of time.

902
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,040
I'm having to work really fast.

903
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,720
To the wire.

904
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,200
- DIANA:
- They wouldn't sell those in a patisserie in France, would they?

905
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,760
Ten, nine, eight,

906
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,640
seven, six, five,

907
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,960
four, three,

908
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,520
two, one!

909
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,920
THEY LAUGH

910
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,480
HE SIGHS

911
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,760
Wow.

912
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,280
That's brilliant!

913
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,720
No, it's horrible. Absolutely horrible.

914
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,120
- Happy, Martha?
- Sort of.

915
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,440
THUNDER RUMBLES, RAIN POURS

916
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,880
- SUE:
- 'It's judgment time.'

917
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,680
MEL: Chetna, do you want to bring yours up, please?

918
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,320
PAUL: I think they're too tall.

919
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,800
It looks like an upside-down ice cream cone.

920
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,600
MEL: They look gorgeous.

921
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,320
It's a very good sponge. Not overbaked.

922
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,040
I love the lemon curd in there.

923
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,520
I think a less layer.

924
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,120
But the flavour's OK and the bake's good.

925
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,400
Looking at that, it doesn't wow me.

926
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,800
They do look a mess. I think you've been slightly overambitious,

927
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,320
certainly with the honeycomb,

928
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,920
- which is why you resorted to the praline.
- Mm-hm.

929
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,000
I think that blueberries and lemon,

930
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,680
the flavour's going to be drowned.

931
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,080
If I close my eyes, it's a lemon drizzle.

932
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,440
It's a bit of a shame.

933
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,360
- You've already had quite a bit of mousse.
- About a kilo or two.

934
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,480
I did wonder if I'd ever get it back, to be honest.

935
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,920
Chocolate mousse, chocolate sponge, chocolate ganache. Tick, tick, tick.

936
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,760
- Just concentrate a bit more on the way it looks.
- I will.

937
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,760
It's a good bake, you know.

938
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,280
They are very thin sponges.

939
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,960
Proportionally, it looks perfect.

940
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,160
In my book, that's absolutely scrumptious.

941
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,520
Thank you.

942
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,520
- SUE:
- I love that you've got your pen behind your ear, as if you're about

943
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,440
- to give an estimate. 
- Sorry, I forgot!
- No...

944
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,480
LAUGHTER

945
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,120
PAUL: I've never seen them individual before.

946
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,440
I think it's very cute.

947
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,320
I can't get the two flavours as being sort of different.

948
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,960
- I think the coffee could have been a lot stronger.
- Stronger.

949
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,600
But I think you've done very well

950
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,640
to think of something that I've never seen.

951
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,320
PAUL: Very tricky to do. Well done.

952
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,560
Great. Thank you very much.

953
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,280
PAUL: The overall appearance is a bit bland.

954
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,160
It's the colours. It needs something more to it.

955
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,120
For me, the sponge is good.

956
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,680
It's beautifully baked, but I need more flavour in the middle.

957
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,400
- You want to put the liquid in there, Mary?
- Yeah.

958
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,000
MEL: Ooh, I like that action.

959
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
- SUE:
- Drizzle mezza. 
- Until it's empty.
- Drizzle away!

960
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,800
Mmm, good sort of boozy fug. Great.

961
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,760
I just think... The lemon flavour's coming through.

962
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,600
I'm not getting that raspberry coming through in the sponge.

963
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,760
PAUL: I think, overall, the idea's good.

964
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,360
I like pipette, it's very novel.

965
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,000
Exposure of sponge, though, I would disagree with.

966
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,200
Because it will dry out. That's what it wants to do.

967
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,680
But I think you've just got away with it.

968
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,040
- SUE:
- Iain, you're up next. Do you need a hand?

969
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,520
No, that's OK. Thank you.

970
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,520
PAUL: Giving that to somebody as a miniature cake...

971
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,880
It's a good portion.

972
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,880
It is. But, it's too much.

973
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,520
You've thought individually, and not as a whole.

974
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,120
You haven't achieved an even bake.

975
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,440
We've got all different colours of bake.

976
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,520
Struggling to get some flavours.

977
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,760
In fact, even the light one is overbaked.

978
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:39,640
When I put my fork into there, it went through like butter.

979
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,720
Beautifully soft, not overbaked.

980
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,760
It's creamy.

981
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,800
The mascarpone, the lemon curd, the crispiness on the top, the sugar,

982
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,440
that is very good.

983
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,520
I mean, it looks a bit clumsy.

984
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,440
- Yes.
- If I'm honest.
- That's fine.

985
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,840
- They're both dry.
- OK.

986
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,440
Chocolate, you sort of get.

987
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,680
And then the little decoration on the top, you get this crunch...

988
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,840
Hmm.

989
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,120
What perfection. A sheer joy to look at.

990
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,280
And your little gadget for cutting them in half,

991
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,920
I think it's worked really well.

992
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,960
Every one is exactly right.

993
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,400
The sponge is very light.

994
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,080
The moisture of the cream and the orange comes through well.

995
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:09,600
It is very, very good. Well thought out. Well done.

996
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,760
- Well done, Nancy.
- Congratulations. 
- Are you taking it back with you?

997
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,200
Otherwise we will eat it.

998
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,040
Norman, they look like a row of soldiers.

999
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,440
It is simple, but it's got to taste as well.

1000
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,840
To me, that is absolutely scrumptious.

1001
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,600
You've baked each one perfectly.

1002
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:53,480
Not easy to get every single one the same colour, the same size.

1003
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,880
The flavour of that almond, married with the raspberry

1004
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,400
and the fresh cream, I think you're on a winner all the way.

1005
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,520
What did you think of the jam?

1006
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,200
- Loved it.
- Was it good jam? 
- Yeah. Well done.

1007
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,720
- Splendid. Thank you. 
- Well done, Norman.
- Ten. Well done.

1008
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,480
Mary and Paul must now decide who's going home

1009
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,440
and who they'll crown this year's first Star Baker.

1010
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,480
For me, there was three people who stepped away - Martha...

1011
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,120
- Yeah.
- Nancy...

1012
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,560
- Yeah.
- ..and Richard.

1013
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,480
The lemon drizzle, she made it perfectly.

1014
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,760
And it isn't easy to get the flavours all the way through.

1015
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,560
And I liked very much Richard's - so neat and so moist.

1016
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,600
And Nancy's looked perfect, didn't it?

1017
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,200
Oh, Nancy's piece de resistance. Nancy's was perfect.

1018
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,560
OK. We've sung some praises, now let's do a little bit of lamenting.

1019
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,160
Who didn't come up trumps today?

1020
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,640
Poor Claire. She had a very bad day.

1021
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,440
She was in pretty much chaos.

1022
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,520
What about Iain's massive three-in-one tower?

1023
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,440
I think that was a major mistake, that Showstopper.

1024
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,240
But, having said that, Jordan's looked awful.

1025
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,240
You can push the boat out and try something,

1026
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,360
but you've got to be able to come up with the goods.

1027
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,960
Well, good luck, Paul and Mary. It's over to you now.

1028
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,480
- Let us know your decision.
- We await.

1029
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,440
SHEEP BLEATS

1030
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:39,440
Bakers, one hell of a first weekend. Congratulations to you all.

1031
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,360
I'm delighted with my job today,

1032
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,400
because I get to announce the very first Star Baker.

1033
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,240
What you need to know about this person is, they are ruthless.

1034
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,960
They'll take a sponge, and they'll just chop its head off.

1035
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,560
Our Star Baker is Nancy, with her guillotine.

1036
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,720
So, it falls to me to do the slightly more difficult job.

1037
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:05,200
I'm afraid one of you will not be joining us on our Bake Off journey.

1038
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:12,840
And the person that it's very sad to say goodbye to this week is...

1039
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,480
..Claire.

1040
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:27,240
- We're so sorry, Claire.
- Claire, come and have a massive sandwich.

1041
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,120
Like a big, big, Mel and Sue sandwich.

1042
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:34,520
Oh, you'll be very missed, love. You're a real cracker, you are.

1043
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,800
When they did say my name, obviously I was a bit like, "Oh."

1044
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,600
Because I think there's a little glimmer.

1045
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,440
There's a little pinprick in your mind that thinks, "Maybe not."

1046
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,800
You know, "Maybe not."

1047
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,720
Unlucky. Unlucky.

1048
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,840
Could anyone have taken that better? You're still laughing.

1049
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,600
Claire had some good ideas,

1050
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,880
but, unfortunately, there was a few mistakes made,

1051
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,040
you know, during the whole weekend.

1052
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,840
- And you'll still keep baking?
- Yeah.

1053
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,920
She couldn't really finish the challenge that she'd set herself.

1054
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,520
I think she was just in a panic,

1055
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,600
because everything went wrong for her.

1056
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,880
Oh, my! That was so much harder than I thought.

1057
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,880
I was 100% certain I was the one going,

1058
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,800
so this week we'll be practising... lots.

1059
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,880
Well done. High hopes.

1060
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,720
High hopes. You'll be fine.

1061
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,800
You'll be fine.

1062
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,880
It means a lot still to be here, because I really want to show

1063
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,840
that I'm a good baker, because this weekend I haven't.

1064
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,240
Well done, Nancy. Congratulations. Well done.

1065
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,440
Star Baker. Absolutely amazing.

1066
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,720
Because there's some really clever people in there

1067
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,000
and I'm thinking, "Well, maybe I must be quite good, then!"

1068
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,600
Next time...

1069
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,640
I am up to the wire.

1070
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,520
..it's biscuits!

1071
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,840
OK, we'll give it a throw.

1072
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,320
We discover the dirty secret behind the ice-cream cone.

1073
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,520
All the fun, none of the typhoid.

1074
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,040
And the bakers tackle signature savoury treats...

1075
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,280
I'm literally down to the moment now.

1076
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,560
..technically perfect Florentines...

1077
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,920
- That looks as if you have done that correctly.
- Do you think?
- Yes!

1078
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,320
..and monumental three-dimensional Showstoppers...

1079
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,200
There's going to be skyscrapers, there's going to be a monster,

1080
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,160
there's going to be a plane flying.

1081
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,320
..but who will be crowned Star Baker...

1082
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,520
- That's it. 
- That one's so wobbly!

1083
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,200
Everything's gone wrong.

1084
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,880
..and who'll get the message to leave the Bake Off?

1085
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,360
- It's B.
- B.
- A.
- A.

1086
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,080
- K.
- K.

1087
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,680
And E.

1088
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,120
You just made that one up!
