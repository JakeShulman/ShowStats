1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,480
As the weeks passed in the Great British Bake Off tent,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,800
the temperature started to rise for Britain's top amateur bakers.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,560
Am I showing a bit?

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,120
Their non-stop quest for excellence to impress judges Mary Berry

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,560
and Paul Hollywood continued.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,080
It is spectacular. It's what I call a showstopper.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,680
I certainly think the challenges this year have been tricky,

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,840
very tricky.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,240
Oh, no! It's slipping off!

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,960
There is a plumbing issue here.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,960
They have to be good at everything, now that is a real challenge.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,960
But now the tent is an oasis of calm,

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,400
as Mary and Paul share their years of knowledge.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Now it's down to Paul and I

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,080
to show you our interpretation of this year's bakes.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,520
We're not only going to show you the technical challenges

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,040
and how they should have been done,

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,600
but also the signature bakes and the showstoppers.

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,760
Coming up - Mary Berry makes a Chocolate Orange Tart

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,520
that could take centre stage in any patisserie.

21
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,520
And a majestic Swedish Princesstarta.

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,280
Paul Hollywood shows his savoury side with some top-end

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,080
sausage plaits and bakes sweet Kouign Amann pastries.

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,240
Finally, Mary goes caramel crazy with a spectacular Hungarian

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,520
showstopper - a tiered Dobos Torte.

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,840
As the bakers hit the halfway mark, they faced Pies and Tarts week.

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Morning, bakers, and welcome back to the tent.

28
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,320
For the signature challenge today, Paul and Mary would very much like

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,360
you to make a family-sized custard tart.

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,920
Mmm, custard.

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,320
You can decorate them in any which way that you like.

32
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,880
You've got two and a half hours on the clock, on your marks...

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,080
Get set, bake!

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,880
Some were looking forward to this challenge more than others.

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,840
I love custard tarts. I normally make a custard tart on its own.

36
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,720
I like eating pastry. I just don't enjoy making it, out of all

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,080
the things that you bake, this is probably my least favourite one.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,720
I love making pastry,

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,800
and rather than do a sort of bog standard custard tart,

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,400
I want to experiment a bit.

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,680
Mary's tart is also a bit different, with swirls of light

42
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,560
and dark chocolate in a thin pastry case.

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,040
I love a good tart. So what are you doing with your tart, then,

44
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,160
what's the filling?

45
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,560
It's a very rich chocolate filling,

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,360
and then it's got little swirls with an orange and white chocolate on top.

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,680
And the pastry has to be really, really thin,

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,280
and the secret is when you're baking it and you take it out,

49
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,320
it's got to have that wobble so it just sets.

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,160
It's really a perfect ending to a special meal.

51
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,560
So what do you need from me?

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,480
For the pastry, I need 100g of plain flour.

53
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,280
100g of plain flour coming up.

54
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,360
Add 50g of cubed unsalted butter, and 50g of icing sugar.

55
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,520
I use this pastry for all sorts of flans and tarts.

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,360
It holds its shape well and it's crisp.

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,520
Pop that in like this. Now you could do it by hand if you prefer.

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,680
It's important to get all the butter to a breadcrumb consistency,

59
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,760
otherwise you'll get lumps of fat in.

60
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,160
Let's have a look at that.

61
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,480
That is, if you just look at it, it looks just like fine breadcrumbs.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,480
Beat an egg yolk with a tablespoon of water

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,080
and add it to the dough mix.

64
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,760
And then work it.

65
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,520
Get it so that it's just coming together.

66
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,960
If you go on working it,

67
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,480
rather like if you go on kneading it, it doesn't do it any good.

68
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,040
There we are. Just turn it out onto that...

69
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,400
you can see it's quite sticky,

70
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,480
and then just work it together, a bit more flour there.

71
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,720
So the pastry's too soft to roll out, now I'm going to put it in the fridge

72
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,760
to firm up. That'll just take about half an hour or so.

73
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,240
So you notice I'm flouring the actual rolling pin.

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,680
I love a rolling pin with no sort of knobs at the end.

75
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,080
A long plain one is the best.

76
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,640
Then I'm going to roll this so that it stays in a round.

77
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,040
So it's a matter of moving the pastry round and keeping it round.

78
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,320
And the idea is to roll it out, obviously, to just a bit bigger

79
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,560
than the actual case.

80
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,560
That's it, and then I'm going to slip that underneath,

81
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,680
and because the pastry is so thin I can see where the actual base is.

82
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,560
To transport it, I was taught to roll it round the rolling pin.

83
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,760
Often it falls off, it breaks in half,

84
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,760
and a safer way is to pull that in like that

85
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,760
and then just put that in...

86
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,160
..and pull the bits up all the way round.

87
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,360
With this very delicate pastry, this thin, thin pastry,

88
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,120
if you rush it you'll poke your finger through the side.

89
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,280
And then take the rolling pin and just go over that.

90
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,400
And you've really got to go round pushing the pastry in

91
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,840
so that you know that it fits tightly.

92
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,800
I'm going to prick the base because it would balloon up

93
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,400
and we don't want to.

94
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,280
- Or docking, docking the bottom. 
- Is that what you call it, docking?

95
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,840
And don't you have, as a baker, you have a gadget?

96
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,560
- We have a docker. 
- Like nails?

97
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,880
Yeah, that's right, you just run it along the pastry.

98
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,120
Well, we all have a fork in the drawer,

99
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,400
so that's absolutely fine and then it does need chilling at this stage

100
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,240
because it will harden up the butter.

101
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,320
Put the pastry case in the fridge to chill for 15 minutes.

102
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,920
This will help prevent it from shrinking in the oven.

103
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,280
There it is!

104
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,120
It's a beautiful colour because, of course, it's the egg yolk

105
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,720
- that makes it that colour.
- OK.

106
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,760
Then for baking blind, over the years I've always used foil in there

107
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,800
but I've tried using clingfilm and surprisingly it doesn't melt

108
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,120
in the oven and you can get it tucked in to the actual corners.

109
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,080
Right to the edge like that.

110
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,720
Then you come to filling it, you can put baking beans,

111
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,840
that's what our bakers use.

112
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,320
At home, I've got a jar of macaroni that I keep using,

113
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,680
in fact it's dark brown now.

114
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,240
Just put those in like that, even there.

115
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,040
Then just turn the clingfilm in, don't let it hang over

116
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,480
because it will stick to the baking sheet.

117
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,760
And that goes into the oven at 180

118
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
and it goes in for about ten minutes.

119
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,480
It's really one of those occasions when you keep your eye on it.

120
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,680
What I shall be looking for is for the edge to be a pale golden brown.

121
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,560
After ten minutes the ceramic beads are removed from the case,

122
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,600
then it's placed back in the oven

123
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,080
to bake for a further five to seven minutes.

124
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,840
Another few minutes in there and the outside would have been too brown.

125
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,920
So that's fine.

126
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,640
Then we come to the chocolate filling,

127
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,440
it's a dark chocolate filling.

128
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
Melt 75 grams of butter

129
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,280
and 115 grams of dark chocolate over a pan of hot water.

130
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,160
I'm doing it in a bain marie, which is the really safe way to do it.

131
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,800
You can do directly on the heat, but you've really got to watch it.

132
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,680
Weigh up 55g of plain flour and 115g of golden caster sugar.

133
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,400
Why golden caster?

134
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,600
It's a natural sugar and it's the best,

135
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,840
but you can use ordinary caster if not.

136
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,040
Off the heat, and if we just tip all that in in one go

137
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,160
and beat that in.

138
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,200
Without the flour it will sometimes separate.

139
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Gradually add four whole beaten eggs until you have a smooth mixture.

140
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,040
So that's absolutely smooth and perfect.

141
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,400
Now, the next thing is for me to do the white chocolate mixture.

142
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,280
Now white chocolate really is tricky to cook with.

143
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,200
What are you looking at me like that for? Have I forgotten something?

144
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,680
No! I like white chocolate.

145
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,360
I love white chocolate and I'm watching how much goes in there.

146
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,280
I knew it was coming.

147
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,360
- Want some? White chocolate. 
- White chocolate.

148
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,280
Melt 25g of butter and 50g of white chocolate.

149
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,640
It's a very good thing that I'm not making two tarts today

150
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,560
- cos I wouldn't have enough, would I?
- Not anymore.

151
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Give us a bit, then, because I like it, too.

152
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,840
- You have that one. 
- Thank you.

153
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,160
Finely grate the zest of a whole orange,

154
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,160
and add 35g of caster sugar and 25g of plain flour

155
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,480
and then mix them into the white chocolate.

156
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,400
Add two egg yolks.

157
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,160
That's it. Beat that in until it's smooth

158
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,920
and it's sort of a thick almost a pouring paste.

159
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,000
So, we have two mixtures here - we have the rich dark chocolate

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,800
- main filling and then we're going to put that in on top.
- OK.

161
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,920
Pour the dark chocolate mix into the pastry case

162
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,560
and then pipe the white chocolate and orange in a large swirl on top.

163
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,480
Aim is to use all the mixture...

164
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,000
..and then you can take a cocktail stick, you can take a skewer

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,440
and then you just sort of move it.

166
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,320
That's it. Now to the baking.

167
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,200
It needs to go into the oven at 180 fan

168
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,720
and it is only going to take ten minutes.

169
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,880
That looks OK. Now, the most important thing is that wobble.

170
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,000
- Look, can you see that? 
- Yeah.

171
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,880
It's got a wobble and that means that

172
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,480
it is cooking with the residual heat.

173
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,200
So you leave that to get just between cold and lukewarm

174
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,000
and then you can serve it and you leave it in the tin to firm up.

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,640
This looks very professional.

176
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,720
I like that word "professional." You don't often say that about me.

177
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,200
I do. All the time.

178
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,000
This is my orange chocolate custard tart.

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,200
- Are you ready for a taste? 
- Absolutely. More eat, less talk.

180
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,000
This should still be soft.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,400
Can you see that just holds its shape?

182
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,080
And the pastry is beautifully thin.

183
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,440
- Can you taste the orange? 
- Mm.

184
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,640
You don't need a very big slice, it is very indulgent, very rich.

185
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,760
It's delicious. It really is delicious. Nice one, Mary.

186
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,800
And now Paul's top tip for shaping bread rolls.

187
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,760
I'm going to show you how to make three simple shaped rolls.

188
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,400
First of all, divide your dough into three equal pieces.

189
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,520
And again divide those in half to make six pieces.

190
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,480
Place your four to one side

191
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,960
and work on these two. We're going to make round rolls.

192
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,560
Make a cage over the top and simply spin it onto the bench.

193
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,240
Notice I have no flour,

194
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,000
because I get grip off the table.

195
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,960
If you put flour on the table it just skids.

196
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,920
So just roll it, and there you have two beautiful rolls.

197
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,520
The other two roll, them out as if you're making an iced bun,

198
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,920
into fingers.

199
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,560
Grab one, roll that one out,

200
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,840
taper the ends slightly turn it into a knot.

201
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,640
Repeat the process with the next one, just roll it out,

202
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,960
taper the ends slightly

203
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,200
and simply turn it into a knot.

204
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,200
The third one is a little bit more complicated.

205
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,520
Start off the same way with the knot, roll it out to a finger,

206
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,880
and then roll this one out slightly more than you did with the knot,

207
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,440
just taper the ends out,

208
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,880
the letter C with the tail,

209
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,280
in through the hole, twist, and out the other side again.

210
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,400
Same again with the other one, just roll it out, taper the ends,

211
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,120
the letter C with a tail,

212
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,600
in through the hole, twist, and out the other side.

213
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,240
And there you have it. A basic round roll,

214
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,080
two knots and two one-stand plaits.

215
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,880
Family Favourites made way for European Epics in week six.

216
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,960
Mary and Paul would like you, please, to make a Swedish traditional cake

217
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,560
called Princesstarta, which means "Princess Cake."

218
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,480
Princesstarta is a very complex cake,

219
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,160
so complex, in fact, that ABBA wrote SOS shortly after sampling it.

220
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,960
I do believe we have two and a quarter hours. On your marks.

221
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,520
- Get set... 
- And bake!

222
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,040
This was one of the toughest Technical Challenges

223
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,600
of the series so far.

224
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,440
Oh, my goodness.

225
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,280
I've never heard of it, I've never seen it, I've never eaten it.

226
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,080
Not a clue, not a Scooby-Doo.

227
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,000
SHE EXHALES

228
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,120
That is quite something.

229
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,160
The simple elegant facade of Mary's Princesstarta

230
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,600
belies its complex interior.

231
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,080
So, Mary, this was your Technical Challenge, the Princesstarta.

232
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,280
Now, why did you pick that as a challenge?

233
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,080
It's an interesting cake. It's a Genoise

234
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,200
and you cut it in three layers and you have interesting fillings.

235
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,760
They start off with creme patissiere and raspberry jam,

236
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,360
and then you have layers of cream mixed with a creme patissiere

237
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,920
and then a dome of cream and then over the top, marzipan.

238
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,240
But not marzipan as we know it,

239
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,760
it's a beautiful pale green.

240
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,080
And usually in the centre - a rose, a moulded rose, and that's where

241
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,040
you come in because I know you're very good at moulding roses.

242
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,000
OK, so where do we start then?

243
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,240
We start by making the creme patissiere.

244
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,400
Warm 600mls of milk in a pan.

245
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,000
Then scrape out the seeds of a vanilla pod

246
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,880
and add them to the milk along with the pod.

247
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,440
Also, you can use vanilla paste,

248
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,360
you can use vanilla extract...

249
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,200
Separate six egg yolks.

250
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,280
I've got a double yolker here, Mary. Are you classing that as two?

251
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,520
I think, yes, take it as two. That's very lucky.

252
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,160
And weigh up 100g of caster sugar and 50g of cornflour.

253
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,080
You just tip that straight into the egg yolks.

254
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,080
We've got the six egg yolks, the sugar, the cornflour

255
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,320
and I'm going to put those on fast speed

256
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,920
to just get a bit of volume going.

257
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,400
The colour of that, it's a thick creamy mixture and I'm going to add

258
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,800
the hot milk here that's beautifully steamy and hot.

259
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,800
One thing I've got to do is just gently to fish out that vanilla pod,

260
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,880
and I'm going to pour that down the side.

261
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,880
Now, I've put the hot milk

262
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,880
into the cold eggs and sugar and cornflour.

263
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,800
If I'd done it the other way round,

264
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,400
I could well have overcooked the egg.

265
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,880
Then into the pan...

266
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,160
..and what I've got to do now is to cook off the cornflour

267
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,600
and I've got to be fairly gentle to do that.

268
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,720
Stirring all the time,

269
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,480
I can feel it now getting much thicker.

270
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,800
Nearly there.

271
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,280
When it's thickened, stir in 50g of butter.

272
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,480
I wouldn't normally add butter, either.

273
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,920
It just enriches it and it's lovely.

274
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,200
So that's it, the butter's just melting into it.

275
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,200
I'm going to pour it into a bowl, cover it.

276
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,520
Cover it with this I've just made you, Mary.

277
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,600
Thank you very much for that. I would normally put clingfilm

278
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,680
and let it touch the actual creme patissiere,

279
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,600
and then it wouldn't get a skin, but I'm certainly going to use yours.

280
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,560
And as you'll see it's the most lovely consistency.

281
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,600
Now, pop your lid on there.

282
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,080
- The next thing to make is the jam. 
- Right.

283
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,920
Weigh up 200g of fresh raspberries

284
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,080
and 175g of jam sugar.

285
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,520
- That has added pectin if you've got it.
- There you go.

286
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,200
Heat gently until the sugar has melted and the fruit has softened.

287
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,120
Add about two tablespoons of water and bring to the boil

288
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,880
until it's a jam consistency.

289
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,880
Then pour it into a bowl and allow it to cool and set.

290
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,640
That's it, I've now got to make a Genoise sponge.

291
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,800
Whisk up 150g of caster sugar with four large eggs.

292
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,320
Then weigh up 75g of cornflour and 75g of plain flour.

293
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,160
That has whisked up into a lovely foam.

294
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,960
So that just leaves an impression

295
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,520
and it then quickly sinks back in there.

296
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,080
Add one level teaspoon of baking powder to the flour.

297
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,600
That goes in there.

298
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,600
..and sift it into the mix.

299
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,280
And around the outside and cut through the middle.

300
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,280
When the flour is incorporated, pour in 50g of butter.

301
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,800
The butter is melted but it's absolutely cold.

302
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,000
You'll see it's still quite thick.

303
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,160
What I do is I pour it round the edge,

304
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,680
and then again with a gentle folding action it will go in.

305
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,480
If you do it when it's warm, it'll drop.

306
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,000
If you put it in too quickly, it'll drop.

307
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,680
I've lined the tin

308
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,440
and that's a 23cm greased tin lined with non stick paper.

309
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,280
I don't do it from a great height

310
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,760
because we would lose the air bubbles, and so down there..

311
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,240
And I've set the oven for 160 fan

312
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,640
and this will take about 25 or 30 minutes.

313
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,080
COW MOOS

314
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,760
Now, can you make a me a rose out of some paste?

315
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,520
- You can now buy this sugar paste. 
- OK.
- Tell me how you do it.

316
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,280
You basically get your sweet paste,

317
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,240
roll that out in a ball in your hand, flatten it down into a circle

318
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,040
and then you simply roll it up to make a little coil for the middle

319
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,920
and then you put all the petals around that and you build it all up.

320
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,480
You need to get gradually bigger as the flower opens up

321
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,760
so it starts to look a bit more like a rose.

322
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,640
It is simple but just a bit fiddly.

323
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,600
- And, of course, you can get it in all colours now, can't you?
- Absolutely.

324
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,960
So this is for a petal?

325
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,440
This is for a petal. Just roll it into a ball in your hands,

326
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,320
make sure it's nice and smooth.

327
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,040
Pinch it until it's thin, it's got to be thicker at the bottom,

328
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,440
thin at the top.

329
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,080
And then find out where your last one finished, which is there,

330
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,840
overlap it slightly, and then pull it round.

331
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,600
They always look so professional. I haven't done much modelling.

332
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,640
Right, I've got some cream here

333
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,440
and 600ml of double cream,

334
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,960
and whisking that until it's whipped.

335
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,360
You've really got to be very careful when whipping cream,

336
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,800
it's got to just hold peaks.

337
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,480
If you overwhip it you get butter.

338
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,160
Making all the individual elements had sent our bakers into a spin

339
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,160
but the main challenge was yet to come.

340
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,080
"Spread a thin layer of creme pate..."

341
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,960
"Over the base of the first sponge."

342
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,360
It's just not going to happen, is it?

343
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,160
- Pipe a border around it. 
- The border looks good.

344
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,880
Looks like a circular border.

345
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,680
- Any enjoyment in this, Luis? 
- No, not really.
- OK.

346
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,680
I'm quite far behind. "Fold half of this into that."

347
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,000
Certainly haven't got time to measure.

348
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,120
"Spread a third of this mixture over the jam."

349
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,040
This is such a complicated recipe.

350
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,800
It says put the third sponge on top.

351
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,960
Oh, no! No, it's just slipping off.

352
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,960
"Cover the sides with cream."

353
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,880
"Smooth into a domed top."

354
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,000
Nice princess-y curve there.

355
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,840
I'm going to make a dome and freeze the top layer.

356
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,200
Am I showing a bit?

357
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,680
I won't have time to finish it, to be honest.

358
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,480
With Mary's step by step instructions,

359
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,680
the final assembly needn't be quite so daunting.

360
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,720
Got my creme patissiere, jam - which has set beautifully -

361
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,360
and I've got the whipped cream.

362
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,720
There's my Genoise, absolutely stone-cold.

363
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,400
Ideally at home make it the day before.

364
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,120
Take a long serrated knife and carefully cut the sponge

365
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,160
into three even slices.

366
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,000
Place the first slice on a serving plate, and spread a thin layer

367
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,720
of the creme patissiere on top.

368
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,920
Then pipe a ring around the outside.

369
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,840
Putting a ridge round the outside

370
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,120
means that the jam doesn't run over the side.

371
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,760
Spread the jam within the creme patissiere border.

372
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,600
It is quite a thick layer of jam.

373
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,560
Take half of the whipped cream,

374
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,360
fold it into the remaining creme patissiere,

375
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,240
and then take a third of the mixture to cover the jam.

376
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,880
Perfect.

377
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,320
Then we need the next layer and it's always easier to sort of get

378
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,320
it level at the edge there, on top like that.

379
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,600
Spread the remaining creme patissiere and cream mixture

380
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,320
over the cake, before laying the final sponge.

381
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,520
Now we've got to cover the sides and the top with cream.

382
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,400
Smooth a thin layer of cream on the sides before piling the rest on top,

383
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,280
carefully shaping it into a dome.

384
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,080
I quite like having you on your knees.

385
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,840
Are you happy with that?

386
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,760
I'm very happy with it and thank you for giving the finishing touches.

387
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,200
- Into the fridge? 
- Into the fridge.

388
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,480
- Time to make the marzipan. 
- OK.

389
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,080
So, if you can start to weigh out 400g of ground almonds.

390
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,120
Then add 150g of caster sugar

391
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,080
and 250g of icing sugar.

392
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,920
Icing and caster, that's unusual.

393
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,400
Well, it gives it a very nice texture.

394
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,440
Add two beaten eggs.

395
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,480
Then a teaspoonful of almond extract.

396
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,080
It gives a really lovely flavour.

397
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,360
And all you do is work it until everything has come together.

398
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,720
Add a touch of green food colouring,

399
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,880
and work it into the marzipan.

400
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,960
For our bakers, creating the smooth, flawless blanket of marzipan

401
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,000
should have been the final hurdle.

402
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,680
But in some cases it was the last straw.

403
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,680
I think if I try and cover it all in one go it'll just squidge,

404
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,280
so I'm going to wrap this round the side.

405
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,800
Does it look like a hat?

406
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,560
This is a shame.

407
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,120
But with a little bit of know-how,

408
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,080
this penultimate stage isn't so intimidating.

409
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,080
I took the precaution of actually measuring the amount I would need

410
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,000
on a piece of string to go over the top of the dome

411
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,080
- and down the other side. 
- OK.

412
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,120
But even so I shall make it that much bigger.

413
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:44,760
It's very easy to cut it off at the bottom but it's not easy to mend it.

414
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,880
- Do you want me to do it, Mary? Are you all right?
- Yes, please.

415
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,880
While you're just finishing that,

416
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,520
- I'm going to get the cake from the fridge.
- OK.

417
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,720
How we doing? That must be about right now, isn't it?

418
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,840
- I think we're all right.
- OK.

419
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,440
Carefully lay the blanket of marzipan over the whole cake...

420
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,120
If I put it that way...

421
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,520
..and gently smooth it over the dome.

422
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,960
Cut off the excess and then, using more whipped cream,

423
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,480
pipe little rosettes around the bottom.

424
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,680
This just smartens the whole thing up.

425
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,280
There we are, now we come to the chocolate decoration.

426
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,040
Some nice little swirly bits round the top

427
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,080
and that's just melted chocolate, nothing else.

428
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,320
Now we need the rose.

429
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,200
- Here, if you want to mark where you're going to put it.
- Please, yeah.

430
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,120
Make a little hole for it to go in.

431
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,200
That looks lovely. I think I can say it's OUR princess cake.

432
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,280
- That's nice.
- Thanks for your help. 
- Good joint effort.

433
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,920
- This is our princesstarta. 
- I think it looks great,

434
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,880
- looks really good. 
- Go on, get your knife in.

435
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,760
Like a hot knife through butter.

436
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,600
Whoa-oh!

437
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,160
- Are you thinking...? 
- Is that big enough?
- Yes!

438
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,880
Once the tarta is made, it should be kept in the fridge,

439
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,560
because all that cream needs to firm up,

440
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,840
and, once you've taken a few slices out of it, back in the fridge.

441
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,560
- What do you think? 
- Mmm, delicious. The...

442
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,400
The jam, the creme pat, the cream, the marzipan, hello!

443
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,120
- The almond that it brings to that... 
- Mmm.
- ..is just delicious.

444
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,880
I'm off to Sweden this Christmas, Mary,

445
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,600
if all the cakes are like this.

446
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,440
Week 7 was all about pastry.

447
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,280
Now Mary and Paul would like you to bake, please,

448
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,320
some savoury pastry parcels.

449
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,480
You've got an hour and three quarters.

450
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,320
- Very much on your marks... 
- Get set...
- Bake!

451
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,480
Each baker went for a slightly different pastry.

452
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,280
I'm using ghee instead of butter or oil.

453
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,400
And it just kind of makes it slightly flaky.

454
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,640
From the familiar...

455
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,520
For this one, I'm making a puff pastry, just because...

456
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,520
I think it's nice, it fills out.

457
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,520
It looks lovely when it comes out the oven.

458
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,240
- ..to the more unusual.
- I don't know what this pastry comes under.

459
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,360
It's a pastry made specially for this.

460
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,440
Paul's savoury parcels are a lattice of puff pastry

461
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,680
filled with mushrooms, black pudding and sausage meat.

462
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,080
Savoury parcels, do you remember that challenge, Mary?

463
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,960
- The Signature Challenge? 
- I do indeed.

464
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,720
A few of them did do rough puff and a lot of them did shortcrust pastry.

465
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,000
Now, I'm going to be using a cheat's puff pastry

466
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,480
and I'm going to be making MY sausage plait.

467
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,320
You can look at it from two angles, really.

468
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,760
It's either a poor man's beef Wellington

469
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,960
or it's a posh sausage roll.

470
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,360
I would go for a posh sausage roll any time.

471
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,360
To make the pastry dough, weigh up 600g of plain flour.

472
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,760
- You're making quite a lot of pastry, aren't you?
- Yeah.

473
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,600
100g of unsalted butter and a pinch of salt.

474
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,000
I'll just break this in. While I'm doing that, Mary,

475
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,480
could you pop to the fridge for me and bring me out 200g of cold butter

476
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,160
- to be...
- In excess to that? 
- To be grated.
- OK.
- Yes, please.

477
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm just going to crumb this down and rub this into the flour.

478
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
- Er, it's in the freezer, Mary, sorry.
- I thought you said fridge.

479
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,080
I did say fridge, I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

480
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,720
Don't rub it in, like I'm doing with the butter into the flour.

481
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,880
It's not very often that you make... Well, it's not very often that

482
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,200
- you ADMIT to making a mistake. 
- That's very true.

483
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,520
Right.

484
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,200
That's 250 there and I actually need 200g of it.

485
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,200
So if you just grate most of it and we leave a little bit back.

486
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,920
Now what I'm going to add to this now is some liquid.

487
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,240
So pour some water in, get my hand in there.

488
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,320
- KNIFE SLAMS Oh!
- Easy.

489
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,960
- It's frozen solid! 
- I know, I said grate all of it,

490
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,960
and we'll just leave a little bit of it back.

491
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,160
Right, I'm going to add some more water.

492
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,640
Now, you can see at the moment,

493
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,320
but I've still got quite a bit of flour there to work in.

494
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,200
A little bit more water to pick up the last of that flour,

495
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,360
tip it onto the bench.

496
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,800
Just going to bring it together.

497
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
Do you know one of the little secrets I used to do

498
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,640
- when making puff pastry...? 
- I'm all for your little secrets.

499
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,280
Don't tell anybody, we used to put our flour in the freezer

500
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,640
- before we made the puff pastry, or indeed the fridge.
- That's clever!

501
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,760
It keeps the dough really cold, so, when you add the butter,

502
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,080
it remains colder for longer, so you can laminate more, fold more.

503
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,840
That is a really good tip!

504
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,040
And it helps to speed it up and make sure...

505
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,640
And get Mary to grate it, cos it's a jolly difficult job.

506
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,960
- Yeah, you do need a Mary in the kitchen, though.
- Yeah.

507
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,280
- How cold is that butter? Is it really cold?
- How cold is it? Listen.

508
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,200
- LOUD TAPPING 
- Good! Well, in that case,

509
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,240
I'm going to put it straight into the dough.

510
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,720
Now I'm going to roll this into a rough rectangle...

511
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,760
..and the pastry's just been brought together, so it's still quite loose.

512
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,920
It's short, it breaks quickly, it hasn't got all the gluten

513
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,960
been worked in it even though it is plain flour.

514
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,440
- Have you finished that yet, Mary? 
- There you are, look.

515
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,640
What have you got there? Lovely, I'll take that. Thanks very much.

516
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,040
So you covered two thirds of the dough and then what you do is

517
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,360
you fold over half of the butter with the dough.

518
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,360
Flatten it down and I tend to pinch the sides a little bit as well

519
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,200
just to stop it spewing out too much and then over again.

520
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,960
OK? Just pinch it down a little bit, rub it in the flour,

521
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,280
now just tap it, because what that does is

522
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,360
equalise the butter inside the dough.

523
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,080
And again, you want to roll it to around 10-12mm thick.

524
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,280
Lovely, the butter's just softening up now.

525
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,160
Now I'm happy, that's out of one initial ten and then a second.

526
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,760
- So is that two?
- Yes.
- What I do...

527
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,280
- You put your knuckles in, don't you?
- I do. I do that.

528
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,800
- You've ruined my dough now, Mary. 
- You might forget

529
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,440
that you've done it twice, you might think it's more.

530
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,320
Now, in 2014, there's an easier way.

531
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,040
You just go like that.

532
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,360
Well, I haven't always got a waterproof pen to hand.

533
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,280
- Don't you? 
- My knuckle is always here.

534
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,640
- Well, that's true. 
- Put that in the fridge.

535
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,600
Now I've got my dough in there.

536
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,720
- We're going to leave that to chill down.
- Right.

537
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,640
Right, in the meantime, we're just going to work on the filling now.

538
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,240
Now, I've got mushroom lined underneath the sausage meat.

539
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,600
So over there, I've got some chestnut mushrooms.

540
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
If you could pass them over to me, please.

541
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,200
And I've got a little bit of thyme there as well.

542
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,400
Place 300g of mushrooms,

543
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,960
a handful of thyme and pinch of salt in a food processor

544
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,000
and blitz until finely chopped.

545
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,720
The thing is, with the mushroom, it carries a lot of moisture.

546
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,400
Now that's going to be sitting at the bottom of my puff pastry.

547
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,480
I don't want any soggy bottom on my pastry.

548
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,200
So I'm going to tip all this mixture into a dry pan

549
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,000
and just dry this mixture up, OK?

550
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,280
While the mushrooms are cooking, thinly slice two red onions.

551
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,840
And I don't want any comments how you can do this

552
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,800
ten times quicker than me. I do have all my fingers.

553
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,360
Turn the cooked mushrooms onto a plate

554
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,040
and, in the same pan, add a splash of sunflower oil,

555
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:23,720
a knob of butter, two teaspoons of brown sugar and the onions.

556
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,320
Cook on a low heat for about 20 minutes

557
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,240
until they are soft and sweet.

558
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,880
Once the unions have caramelised,

559
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,240
add about a tablespoon of sherry vinegar,

560
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
then take them off the heat to cool.

561
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,720
Can we prepare 300g of sausage meat, please, Mary?

562
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,720
Now, I love a good pork sausage, but if you want to use venison,

563
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,760
or you want to use any other type of sausage, you can.

564
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,000
- There they are.
- Thank you.

565
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,440
You need to take all the skin off and pop it in the bowl,

566
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,160
because into that we're going to add 100g of black pudding,

567
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,160
which I'm just going to cut up into rough cubes.

568
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,600
- You've taken the skin off that? 
- The skin's already come off, yeah.

569
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,880
There's the black pudding in there as well, that richness coming

570
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,680
from the black pudding is going to be delicious with the sausage.

571
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,080
So what I'd like to do now is give my puff pastry a few turns.

572
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,000
The secret to a good puff pastry is to keep it cold.

573
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,080
The chilled, thin layers of butter stay separate from the dough,

574
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,320
which allows the pastry layers to puff when baked.

575
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,960
If you keep the folds all the same thickness,

576
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,920
it means your lamination will all be equal.

577
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,480
Now, wrap this up, let this chill down for another half an hour.

578
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,400
And we should be able to prepare

579
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,000
- a little sausage plait, Mary. 
- Good, good.

580
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,200
Now I've folded this... Here we go. ..four times.

581
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,400
- That says three.
- OK, four.

582
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,040
You've just stabbed all the lamination on there!

583
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,080
In the fridge.

584
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,720
This is the beautiful dough that we've made.

585
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,840
It's nice and cool.

586
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,600
I'm going to take it out.

587
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,320
Quite long, so I can get my 12 sausage plaits from this.

588
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,800
Divide the dough into a dozen rectangles.

589
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,760
It's important to keep them cool,

590
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,000
so put half in the fridge whilst working on the first six.

591
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,600
Start with the filling.

592
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,760
Put a little bit of that mushroom down the middle.

593
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,320
Use a spoon, if you wish.

594
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,160
You like doing things with your hands.

595
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,680
I do, my dad always said, if he saw me using one hand for instance,

596
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,400
doing rolling a dough of any description, he'd say,

597
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,000
"Son, I'm only paying half your wages this week."

598
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,960
"Why?" "You're only using half your hands."

599
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,720
- I've seen you do the rolls like that two at a time.
- That's right!

600
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,440
Next, divide the sausage meat and black pudding mixture equally,

601
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,560
and place on top of the mushrooms.

602
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,680
And we'll put a little bit of the onion on the top.

603
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,880
This is the easy bit.

604
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,800
I tell you what, you're doing the plaiting, I'm not.

605
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,840
PAUL LAUGHS

606
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,160
To start each plait,

607
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,120
first remove a small wedge of pastry from each corner.

608
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,400
- So you take out that little V, leaving a fin at each end.
- Yeah.

609
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,040
- That's right, so the fin goes over...
- Right.

610
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,080
- ..and over, like so.
- Right.

611
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,840
So then you cut them all the way down, same on the other side.

612
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,600
- Right up to the sausage.
- As close as you can get to the sausage meat.

613
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,080
- Right.
- And then, basically fold over the edges...

614
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,920
- Oh, I see. 
- ..all the way as far as they can go.

615
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,960
So it'll hold it in place, and, again,

616
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,880
the last couple, and that one on top of that one.

617
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,720
Seal it down and you end up with something

618
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,960
that looks like it's been plaited or lattice work

619
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,640
all over the top.

620
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,320
Once you've plaited them all,

621
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,920
brush with a beaten egg and scatter them with sesame seeds.

622
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,040
Drizzle that all over the top.

623
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,000
No need to use toasted ones,

624
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,440
cos those are going to be toasted in the oven.

625
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,480
So there you have it -

626
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,000
12 little soldiers going to go straight into the oven.

627
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,640
- What temperature? 
- 180, 180 fan.

628
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,440
- How long will they take? 
- About half an hour.

629
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,240
- We'll keep an eye on them. 
- Absolutely, I'm starving.

630
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,440
While Paul plaited his parcels,

631
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,680
most of our bakers chose a different technique.

632
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,920
That's one hell of a twist you've got going on there.

633
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,080
You're going to do the twist and it goes like this.

634
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,040
- You are the king of crimping. 
- Ha-ha! Thanks, Mel.

635
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,480
Senor Luis, how do you say "to crimp" in Spanish?

636
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,520
- Crimpar?
- Crimpar! 
- Crimpar?!
- Crimpara!

637
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,040
Look at them, Mary.

638
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,960
A bit hot still, so they need to just rest on there for a bit.

639
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,920
And then, we'll pop them onto a tray and we'll try them a bit later.

640
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,040
- I love the way the sausage is peeking out of the corner.
- Mmm.

641
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,240
They haven't bled too much, they've bled a little, but that's normal.

642
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,920
- They look wonderful. 
- Mmm, smell delish.

643
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,280
So there you have it, Mary!

644
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,920
A sausage plait made with my cheat's puff pastry.

645
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,840
Oh, yes!

646
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,400
See the black pudding inside there? A little bit of caramelised onion,

647
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,800
then you can see that mushroom underneath.

648
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,000
Mmm!

649
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,200
All these flavours coming through!

650
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,760
Sheer heaven, I'm going to have another bite.

651
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,240
You can taste the thyme as well, can't you?

652
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,080
I liked your description of it.

653
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,400
It's a poor man's beef Wellington or a posh sausage roll.

654
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,640
Whatever it is, I like it.

655
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,680
It's delish.

656
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,760
And now, Mary has a nifty little tip to show you.

657
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,920
Here's a very quick way

658
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,120
of separating the yolks and the whites of an egg.

659
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,840
It's so simple, you won't believe it.

660
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,040
You just take a bottle and this is a clean water bottle

661
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,160
and squeeze it, so that the air comes out,

662
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,760
then put it on top of the egg and suck it up.

663
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,920
So squeeze out, then put it on top of the egg

664
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,280
and it slips up there like that.

665
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,960
And then, you just put it into the bowl.

666
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,920
And it works every time. To get it out, sometimes,

667
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,320
it needs to give it a little push, so again.

668
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,560
And to the last one.

669
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,240
That's it! In the bottom.

670
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,440
So, for people who are nervous about separating eggs,

671
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,240
this couldn't be an easier way.

672
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,280
Having survived the pastry signature,

673
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,160
the technical challenge pushed the bakers' knowledge to its limits.

674
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,840
Now, Paul and Mary would like you to make...

675
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,800
- a kouign amann. Yeah, we don't know what it is either.
- No idea!
- OK.

676
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,320
- Apparently, it's a traditional Breton pastry.
- Oh!

677
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,760
They want you to shape 12 individual kouign amann

678
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,040
and you've got 3½ hours on the clock to do that.

679
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,920
- All the very best. 
- Kouign amann!

680
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,520
- On your marks...
- Get set...

681
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,440
- SHE SQUEAKS:
- Bake! 
- DEEP VOICE: Bake!

682
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,600
With only a few basic ingredients, this little-known pastry

683
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,960
is as technically challenging to make as it is to pronounce.

684
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,840
It's called "coug-an aman", is it?

685
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,760
- Yes, yes, yes! 
- SHE LAUGHS

686
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,720
How do you pronounce it? Koi?

687
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,200
- Queen-a-man. 
- Queen-a-man!
- Queen-a-man.

688
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,200
Queen... Queen-a-man, queen-a-mon?

689
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,720
Paul's kouign amann are perfect muffin-sized folds

690
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,640
of yeasted pastry, butter and sugar.

691
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,080
That was a difficult technical challenge.

692
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,440
Kouign amann, I'd never heard of them.

693
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,560
It was picked as a technical challenge,

694
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,800
because we wanted to find out if the bakers knew about lamination.

695
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,720
It's the putting the butter in the dough and folding it

696
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,280
and folding it and folding it.

697
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,480
But I'll show you how to do it properly.

698
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,640
Could you weigh me up 300g of strong bread flour, please?

699
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,360
- 300g?
- Yes, please. Did you like them, Mary?

700
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,640
I thought they were absolutely delicious.

701
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,720
Could you give me 5g of the instant yeast, please?

702
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,360
- I've put that on one side. 
- Keep that to one side,

703
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,720
so it doesn't come into contact directly with the salt,

704
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,080
cos it can retard the dough.

705
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,680
- That's it. 
- And 5g of salt as well, please.

706
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,160
- On the other side? 
- On the other side, thank you.

707
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,080
Now, I've got 25g of melted butter.

708
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,400
- Now you should have some water over there, Mary.
- I have.

709
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,520
Well, I'm going to put 200ml in to this dough.

710
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,640
So I'm going to start off with the melted butter inside,

711
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,400
put a little splash of the water in there straight from the tap.

712
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,640
- Wouldn't most people use warm water? 
- Most people would,

713
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,160
but this goes back to books written, you know, in 1840,

714
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,240
the Good Housekeeping guides, which always says, when making dough...

715
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,040
- HIGH-PITCHED: 
- "You must use warm water."

716
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,760
And then, in 1840, it was quite...

717
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,600
most people didn't know really how bakers baked.

718
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,560
You know, when you brought your first book out(?)

719
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,600
No comment.

720
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,320
So, at this stage, it's a fairly simple dough?

721
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,880
This stage, basically normal dough with a little bit of butter in it.

722
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,040
Now, a little bit of flour,

723
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,480
and then, you've just got to knead this for about four, five minutes.

724
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,200
So, you've got to work through the dough to build up the gluten,

725
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,320
cos, if you look at that, it looks slightly mottled. So what you do

726
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,600
is work through that until the dough becomes nice and smooth

727
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,640
and it'll get smoother and smoother and smoother.

728
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,040
Pop that in there,

729
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,480
and this is just going to be rested outside in ambient temperature.

730
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,720
Realistically, it has to be above 18 degrees.

731
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,480
So this is just going to be put to the side and left to rest.

732
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,440
Even at this early stage,

733
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,200
the bakers were struggling to understand the recipe.

734
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,800
I just don't really know what it's meant to be like.

735
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,160
My dough feels quite sticky.

736
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,440
I've never made a pastry with yeast before. First time for everything!

737
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,960
My instinct is that I shouldn't work it too much.

738
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,520
Looking for stretchy elastic dough

739
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,480
and the wetness will go the more you...the more you knead it.

740
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,560
And any frustrations the bakers might have been feeling

741
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,680
were unleashed on 250g of butter.

742
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,280
I think a bit of butter bashing reduces the tension, doesn't it?

743
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,240
This is Paul Hollywood if he hates my kouign amann!

744
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,080
- SHE GIGGLES 
- It'll be him if I come last!

745
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,240
Now look at that, Mary.

746
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,000
That's my risen dough.

747
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,600
And you see the way it's ballooned?

748
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,960
The yeast has basically been active.

749
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,080
Munching on all the goodness inside the dough, and then

750
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,960
releasing carbon dioxide, which is why it balloons up like that.

751
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,800
So what we're going to do is release this.

752
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,000
A little bit of flour...

753
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,120
I'm going to roll this out into a square.

754
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:04,080
Once the dough is squared off, add the 250g of cold, flattened butter.

755
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,440
Into the square at diagonals, OK?

756
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,360
Now I've got this extra bit of dough here. So they're going

757
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,200
to be folded into the middle. It looks a bit like an envelope.

758
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,560
Tapped down, this way, up and down.

759
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,320
You're just going to roll out the dough and fold it.

760
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,520
Turn, over a third, and then over a third.

761
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,120
Now that needs to go back into the fridge to chill down,

762
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,280
to harden that butter again, cos it's so thin, it's softened up.

763
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,520
Just like Paul's puff pastry recipe,

764
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,880
the folding begins to build up layers within the dough,

765
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,760
a process that needs to be repeated twice more,

766
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,720
chilling the dough thoroughly between each stage.

767
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,480
If getting to this point had perplexed some of the bakers,

768
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,080
the crucial stage in Paul's recipe was still to come -

769
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,400
when to add the sugar.

770
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,600
Part seven of the method is a little bit ambiguous.

771
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,520
Adding sugar between one of the layers.

772
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,080
Or every layer? Being one?

773
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,680
I don't know, it's really confusing.

774
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,320
I reckon it's not the last layer,

775
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,000
and it's not the first layer, it'll be the middle layer.

776
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,080
- I don't think it matters, to be honest.
- You don't think it matters?

777
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,960
- Don't tell Paul!
- It's this precision upon which a technical bake rests.

778
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,600
- Is this your last one?
- This is it. We're going to put the sugar in now,

779
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,920
fold it for the last time and then we can use it.

780
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,200
So would you mind, while I'm rolling this out,

781
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,840
weighing up 100g of caster sugar, please?

782
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,760
If you put sugar in too early,

783
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,600
the sugar basically just melts straight into the dough,

784
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,600
which is why you put it in now and not any earlier.

785
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,640
Sprinkle the sugar down the middle.

786
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,120
Run the rolling pin over the sugar,

787
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,240
then fold the dough for the third and final time.

788
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:03,120
Roll it out to a 40 x 30cm rectangle and then divide it into 12 squares.

789
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,480
What I've got here is the muffin trays that we gave

790
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,120
all the bakers, which are basically just greased.

791
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,440
What we're going to do is fold over the corners first into each other,

792
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,440
and then in, and then pick up the parcel like that

793
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,200
and basically just drop it into

794
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,840
the tin, like that. OK?

795
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,560
Obviously if you're going to make these at home you have to

796
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,560
use them straight away cos of the sugar in there

797
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,440
but you could fold and then freeze it,

798
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,960
and when you want to use it, bring it back to temperature.

799
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,320
Then sugar it and use it straight away.

800
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,320
You don't want the sugar to melt.

801
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,520
Leave them to rest at room temperature for half an hour

802
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,040
and then sprinkle with sugar and bake at 200 degrees fan

803
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,680
for 30-40 minutes until golden brown.

804
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,040
- Ooh, can you smell them, Mary? 
- What a colour!

805
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,120
They've all really puffed up, haven't they?

806
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,800
They look absolutely delicious.

807
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,680
We'll leave them in there for a couple of minutes and release them

808
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,120
- and pop them on a wire. 
- Ooh! Can't wait.

809
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,320
There they are, Mary - Kouign Amann.

810
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,320
Oh, look at the pastry inside, it just flakes.

811
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,880
- Talk about crisp!
- I know.
- Oh, lovely.

812
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,080
Worth all that extra work, I think, of cooling and chilling

813
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,400
- and folding.
- They are beautiful.

814
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,520
- And it's a matter of getting sugar in the right place.
- Yeah.

815
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,960
- Bit more tea I think, Mary.
- Mm.

816
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,480
- You bring them, I'll put the kettle on.
- Done.

817
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,240
The final challenge each week was the Showstopper,

818
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,200
where the oven gloves came off and the bakers didn't hold back.

819
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,760
Now, I have to say, today is pretty epic.

820
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,120
Mary and Paul would very much like you, please, to create

821
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,400
a contemporary version of the Hungarian dobos torte,

822
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,240
which is traditionally

823
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,120
- a multi-layered sponge cake topped with caramel slices.
- Mm.

824
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,720
So we'd like you to make a cake of at least two tiers,

825
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,280
with the emphasis on sugar work and all things caramel.

826
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,800
- You've got five hours.
- On your marks...
- Get set...
- BOTH:
- Bake!

827
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,880
This rather lengthy challenge

828
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,920
allowed the bakers' imagination to run wild.

829
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,840
From caramel castles and chocolate chess,

830
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,320
to the more abstract.

831
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,320
Mary's dobos torte is no less impressive.

832
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,800
12 layers of sponge covered in caramel buttercream

833
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,520
and praline pieces.

834
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,160
It's a caramel extravaganza.

835
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,240
Dobos torte was one of the most difficult Showstopper challenges.

836
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:50,360
Traditionally dobos torte is one tier - we made it double tier.

837
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,160
- It really is a showstopper. 
- OK, better get cracking, then.

838
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,480
I'm going to start off by making the caramel buttercream.

839
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,120
Can I have 800 grams of granulated sugar?

840
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,200
Can be caster but most people have granulated.

841
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,480
That's lovely. And 100ml of water.

842
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,200
It doesn't matter if it's a bit over,

843
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,920
it just means that you've got to do a bit more evaporation.

844
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,720
So in goes the water and then the sugar as well.

845
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,640
Now, this does take time, but the whole idea is to dissolve the sugar.

846
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,840
You do it very, very slowly. When it's all dissolved and clear

847
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,720
and there's no sort of gritty bits at the bottom,

848
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,800
then you boil it until... You don't need a thermometer,

849
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,040
you just need to look at it

850
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,080
until it's a deep straw colour.

851
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,720
The key to making caramel is a pan that's spotlessly clean.

852
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,560
Any impurities might make the sugar solution crystallise.

853
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,960
And for perfect results, it's best to use a heavy

854
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,280
stainless steel pan for even heat distribution.

855
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,680
So I'm stirring this all the time so that it's not bubbling,

856
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,680
until the sugar has naturally melted out.

857
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,920
It's a long job.

858
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,680
Now that has become clear, there are no gritty bits at the bottom,

859
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,080
so that is now bubbling away gently

860
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,320
and it's got to be the right colour.

861
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,840
It should be a deep straw colour.

862
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,120
That's ready, that's caramel, and I'm going to pour that...

863
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,440
Whoops! We'll do it right here.

864
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,480
Now, that is a heatproof bowl.

865
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,640
- If you put it in anything else, it could crack.
- Yep.

866
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,480
In goes 400ml of cream.

867
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,320
In that goes, and it goes bubbling up...

868
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,280
..and that cools it down.

869
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,880
Then give that a stir so that it's all beautifully smooth.

870
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,160
And it is very, very hot. Keep children out of the way.

871
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,600
And you leave that to get quite cold.

872
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,440
Time to make the sponges.

873
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:56,640
I've got to make six large ones, that's 20cm, and six 15cm small ones.

874
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,080
And so I've marked them out on non-stick paper,

875
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,000
put them ready on the baking sheets.

876
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,280
And I do six at a time because the oven has got three shelves

877
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,080
and I can do them at that time.

878
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,400
For the sponges, crack eight eggs in a bowl

879
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,600
and then weigh up 350 grams of caster sugar

880
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,480
and mix them together until ribbon stage.

881
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,880
So, whisked until it will leave an impression.

882
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,400
On it goes.

883
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:28,000
Takes much longer when you've got a large amount of mixture in.

884
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:37,160
Then gradually sift in 300 grams of self-raising flour.

885
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,000
Wait a minute, not all at once. That's it.

886
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,240
If you put it all in at once, you can't get it in smoothly.

887
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,440
- Bit more, please. HIGH-PITCHED VOICE:
- So you're going round the outside

888
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,320
- and cut through the middle! 
- You're absolutely right, come on.

889
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,600
And preferably in the bowl, not round the outside!

890
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,240
- I'm doing it!
- Right, that's it.

891
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,640
You just need to go on mixing until you see no little pockets of flour.

892
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,160
So that looks absolutely fine to me.

893
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,720
Ladle the cake mix onto each of the templates.

894
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,080
It's got to go just inside the ring

895
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,760
cos it does spread slightly.

896
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,800
And you continue doing this, as I say, three trays at a time.

897
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,480
Most ovens you can get three in.

898
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,520
Tiny bit more round the edge there.

899
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,040
It's got to be level, otherwise you'll find that you'll burn the side

900
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,920
or there will be a little bit browner.

901
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,280
It needs great precision with baking, it's going to be baked

902
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,360
180 degrees fan, 8-10.

903
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,560
But really it's a good idea to keep looking towards

904
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,560
the end of those last minutes.

905
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,120
I put the top layer in last

906
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,640
cos that's the hottest position in the oven.

907
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:57,160
Freeform batch-baking calls for precision and accuracy...

908
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,120
See, you have to get a bit of a production line going of a layer in.

909
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,840
They bake very, very quickly and they can get a bit crisp.

910
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,280
A batch out. You need, obviously, a lot of layers to make a cake.

911
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,960
Cut them, get the next ones in...

912
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,320
..which Luis took to another level.

913
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,000
- This is like your in-tray of sponge, isn't it?
- It is.

914
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,640
- In-tray, out-tray. You like all this, the organisation bit, don't you?
- I do.

915
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,840
- You do.
- I do.
- I know you do!
- I know!

916
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,400
Six of them are still in the oven. The ones that we did earlier

917
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,320
are over there behind you. Let's get those out.

918
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,720
They should be with very little colour and a nice even colour.

919
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,800
They're not perfectly round. We're going to trim them

920
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,280
to be absolutely round. Leave those just to get cold on the paper,

921
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,280
and then we come to the buttercream.

922
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,560
We started off by making the caramel, which should be cold by now.

923
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,080
- It is.
- And we've got to incorporate the butter.

924
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,240
Beat 450 grams of butter...

925
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,400
..add the caramel cream and mix it in stages.

926
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,000
That's it. It's a lovely smooth consistency,

927
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,080
just perfect for spreading all those layers.

928
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,560
Next on the agenda is the praline, which I'm going to make

929
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,280
from almonds and caramel.

930
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,920
Weigh up 75 grams of flaked almonds

931
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,800
and scatter onto a non-stick surface.

932
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,520
And we'll just pour the caramel over that.

933
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,240
For this second caramel, gently heat up 300 grams

934
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,320
of granulated sugar with six tablespoons of water.

935
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:41,080
I'm going to dip hazelnuts into the mixture.

936
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:47,000
The safest way to do this is to push a cocktail stick into each nut.

937
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,120
You're not eating THOSE nuts as well?

938
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,440
- I love nuts, Mary.
- I know that.

939
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,160
That looks perfect to me. How about you?

940
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,120
- That looks good.
- And then...

941
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,080
tip that over the top.

942
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,360
I'm keeping this last little bit, and then you take these

943
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:09,520
and you dip them in like that and then stand them up on here.

944
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,600
When working with so much caramel,

945
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:17,360
it was inevitable that the bakers had the odd sticky moment.

946
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,560
- KATE:
- You have to wait till it gets to exactly the right temperature.

947
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,440
- NANCY:
- Me pulled nuts are rubbish!

948
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,760
Argh! It's totally...

949
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,880
OK, I need another saucepan.

950
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,600
And some bit off more than they could chew.

951
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,080
I think it's going to look a little bit slapdash but something is always better than nothing.

952
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,240
Now we come to the assembly.

953
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,840
So I find it best to do it actually on the dish.

954
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,160
I've got my caramel buttercream here.

955
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,680
I've got a little job for you while I'm doing this.

956
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,880
- Remember we made that praline? 
- Yep.

957
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,240
It needs to be broken up into small pieces

958
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,440
because as I'm assembling the two tiers,

959
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,440
- I'm going to put round the outside of each broken up pieces of that.
- OK.

960
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,440
So I'll start to assemble this.

961
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,160
On top of the first sponge,

962
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,680
spread over an even layer of the caramel butter cream.

963
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,120
Then add another disc of sponge and more buttercream,

964
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,840
building up the cake layer by layer.

965
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,880
There we are, we're nearly there!

966
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,120
One tier, all right?

967
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,720
Yeah.

968
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,840
Repeat the whole process for the second tier

969
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,600
and smother the outside with buttercream.

970
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,800
That looks pretty good to me.

971
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,440
Then decorate the sides with the praline pieces.

972
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,440
Around the edge of the first tier,

973
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,600
pipe 16 rosettes with the remaining buttercream

974
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,600
and place a caramel hazelnut on each one.

975
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,600
- Then I have to do eight on top. 
- Lovely.

976
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,560
Paul, we're on the homeward straight.

977
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,680
- Just the caramel to make. 100 grams...
- Another caramel?

978
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,120
Another one. It's only our third(!)

979
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,760
100 grams of sugar, so this is quicker to make, smaller amount.

980
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,280
And a couple of tablespoonfuls of water.

981
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,760
- Are you going to have a lie-down, then?
- Yup!

982
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,880
- Bread takes longer to make than this, you know.
- I know.

983
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,640
You only have to work at it for a couple of minutes at a time.

984
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,360
I know, but I've kept you busy.

985
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,360
When the caramel is ready, pour it over the final sponge.

986
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,000
Trim the edges with an oiled knife

987
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,120
and divide into eight pieces to decorate the top.

988
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,400
We then put them in like that,

989
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,120
standing up all the way round.

990
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,960
That looks pretty good, that, Mary.

991
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,120
That's a nice showstopper, that.

992
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:42,200
It does take time to do but it's very worthwhile,

993
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,200
and, remember, at home you can just do one tier

994
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,200
like the traditional dobos torte.

995
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,600
It's worth a go.

996
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,840
Let's see if I can get this knife through those 12 layers AND caramel.

997
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,840
Is that big enough for you, Mary?

998
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,640
I think maybe we should share it. Wow! Look at those layers!

999
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,320
- Can I give you a little bit of this? 
- I'll take the top bit, yeah.

1000
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,440
It's delicious, the moisture coming from that sponge.

1001
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,720
But the caramel lifting it all up as well. I think it's amazing.

1002
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,000
Well worth it.

1003
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,960
Fantastic cake.

1004
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,400
I really do hope that people actually go ahead and bake some of these bakes that we've done today.

1005
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,480
They're quite involved but hopefully they've learnt a few of the tips

1006
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,360
and tricks that we've tried to teach them over the last hour.

1007
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,840
And next time we've got a load more.

1008
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,800
- Oh, yes. Onward and upward, Mary. 
- Quite right.

1009
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,760
Next time, Mary and Paul share their favourite bakes

1010
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,600
from the final few weeks of the series.

1011
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,040
This is the last of our masterclasses this year,

1012
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,200
and the bakes that Mary and I have chosen

1013
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,480
I think are a little bit challenging.

1014
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,280
They look pretty good, don't they?

1015
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,560
- Look at that. 
- That is sheer perfection.

1016
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:05,640
Judging is one thing, but at heart, I love showing people how to bake

1017
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,040
so they can achieve the same results at home.

1018
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:13,720
Join us next time for The Great British Bake Off Masterclass.

1019
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,400
- I think it's a great way of going out on a high, Mary.
- Exactly.
