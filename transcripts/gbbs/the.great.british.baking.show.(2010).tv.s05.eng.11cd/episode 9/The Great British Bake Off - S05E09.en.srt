1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Welcome back to the Bake Off. This is the semifinal, oh, yes,

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,360
- and four bakers remain.
- You could cut the atmosphere with a knife.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,200
In which case I recommend serving it with a raspberry bavarois,

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,480
candied kumquats, and a crushed nut brittle.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,120
- BOTH:
- Welcome to the Great British Bake Off.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,960
- Last time... 
- That is one hell of a snake.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,280
..the bakers tackled the most tricky Technical to date.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,840
- Presumably the wow is when you cut into it.
- It is absolutely raw.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,120
Chetna and Luis impressed...

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,400
Nice bit of chocolate work on the top.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,240
Cheers, good health, good health.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,520
HE LAUGHS

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,280
..but Richard won Star Baker for a record-breaking fourth time...

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,120
Pretty surprising!

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,320
..and it was Martha who had to leave the Bake Off tent.

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,200
- Now, the four semifinalists... 
- Oh, God.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,880
..face the most exacting challenges so far.

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,600
This is all about top-notch patisserie.

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,920
- 20 layers?
- Is he going to count all 20 in all of them?

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,880
Don't have time.

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,120
I think I've messed up here.

22
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,840
That is bone dry.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,160
But who will prove they're worthy of a place in the final?

24
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,640
That looks stunning when you cut into it.

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,080
Flipping 'eck.

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,320
I've seen pastry chefs crumble at making these things,

27
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,280
let alone the bakers in the tent.

28
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,800
- FRENCH ACCENT:
- Zis week we have many layers.

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,800
- It is good French, very intense. 
- Very complique, I love it.

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Like the filo pastry, I will peel away ze layers.

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,720
Do not filo me, there is an injunction, don't touch.

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,360
- It's patisserie week.
- Oh, yeah.

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,040
It's their ninth week in the Bake Off tent and only four bakers remain.

34
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,400
Luis has been praised for his ingenious designs.

35
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,320
It is spectacular, it's what I call a Showstopper.

36
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,400
It's the semifinal and the judges are going to be super critical

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,280
because when you're at this stage and you're fighting for a place

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,160
in the final, then it's going to be tough.

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,960
Chetna's sensational flavours have won her a place in the semifinal.

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,240
It's really aromatic.

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,600
The flavour - gorgeous.

42
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,760
I think I've earned this place, so I am feeling confident, yeah.

43
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,520
I really can't wait to get in and bake.

44
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,840
Nancy was the first Star Baker of the series, and week after week

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,800
she's impressed with her precision...

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,360
What perfection.

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,200
..and all-round baking knowledge.

48
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,920
Exceptional.

49
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,800
One side of me is saying "Do you know, I've done really well,

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,560
"and it wouldn't be too bad if I left."

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,360
There's another side saying, "Get a grip. I want to be in the final."

52
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,840
Richard's natural flair for baking...

53
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,000
Now, that's what I call a sauce pudding.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,720
- ..has won him Star Baker four times. 
- Amazing.

55
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,400
I'd hate to kind of fall at the final hurdle.

56
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,800
I think it's graft that's got me here.

57
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,160
We'll see how long I can keep going for, really.

58
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,360
Good morning, bakers, and welcome to your semifinal.

59
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,600
- Good to see four Brits in a semifinal of anything, isn't it?
- Yeah. Or just

60
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,160
even get through to the qualifiers.

61
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,320
So, for your Signature Challenge today,

62
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,080
Mary and Paul would like you please to make baklava.

63
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,680
They would like you to make two different types of baklava,

64
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,760
- 24 portions in total.
- Lovely.

65
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,440
They can be rolled, folded or shredded in any way that you like

66
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,960
to create different designs

67
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,320
and you can use whatever flavours that appeal.

68
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,000
You've got three and a half hours to do this. On your marks...

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,040
- Get set...
- Bake!

70
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,920
Baklava is a sweet pastry which originated in the Middle East.

71
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,440
Traditionally it's made with filo dough, chopped nuts

72
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,720
and soaked in honey.

73
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,520
I live in north London, we've got quite a big Turkish population.

74
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,680
So, yeah, many shops have got baklava in it. I eat a lot of it.

75
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,480
That's no indicator that mine will be any good, though.

76
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,280
What we're looking for in a good baklava is a fantastic filo pastry

77
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,480
with a gorgeous syrup that binds together a beautiful filling.

78
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,000
If any one of those elements is not there, for me it's a no-go.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I think a filo is one of the most difficult pastries to make.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,960
The most important thing is getting those wafer layers

81
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,520
one on top of the other, butter in-between each one.

82
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,520
This is all about top-notch patisserie -

83
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,200
difficult for a professional, let alone amateurs.

84
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,120
Who makes filo? Nobody makes filo.

85
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,200
It's just a pain because you have to get it really, really thin,

86
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,760
and how much ever you try

87
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,320
you can't get it as thin

88
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,320
as the ready-made because they're done by machines.

89
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,600
Thing is, you read most recipe books and they all say

90
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,440
"open your pack of filo up"...

91
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,320
..so there's probably a reason behind that.

92
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,160
Home-made filo is made from just water, flour, vinegar,

93
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,440
and a little oil.

94
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,480
The key to achieving the paper-thin pastry is a stretchy dough.

95
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,400
You need to give it quite a heavy kneading just to stretch the gluten,

96
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,040
so hopefully it will go out into a lovely beautiful

97
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,480
very, very thin sheet.

98
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Because I'm mixing it for ten minutes, the gluten will build up

99
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,560
anyway and the water will be absorbed.

100
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,840
What I'm looking is for the bowl to be clean, really,

101
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,120
so there's not much sticking around, so it should be pretty much

102
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,760
a self-contained ball of dough.

103
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,960
Chetna is the only baker who's added an extra ingredient to her dough.

104
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,160
- Good morning, good morning.
- Chetna, what's your twist on baklava?

105
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,920
I'm doing two types of baklavas. One is brown filo with cocoa in it.

106
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,840
Using cocoa and chocolate in the pastry to turn it brown,

107
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,400
how do you know when it's actually baked?

108
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,560
Because obviously baklava's all about the flake and the crispiness.

109
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,040
Yes, yes. By eye.

110
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,120
Sometimes your eyes can kid you.

111
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,480
- Don't be taken in by it, just go on.
- No, absolutely.

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,400
Chetna's cocoa filo will be filled with pistachios and dark chocolate.

113
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,920
She's also making masala chai baklavas coated with syrup,

114
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,640
infused with Indian spiced tea.

115
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,600
I think you've been very inventive and I can't wait for the results.

116
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,520
- Good luck, Chetna.
- Thank you.

117
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,800
- WHISPERING:
- Maybe I made a mistake.

118
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,240
SHE SIGHS

119
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,400
Oh, well.

120
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,920
Can't think about that right now.

121
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,360
- Good morning, Luis. 
- Good morning, all right?

122
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,560
So, what have you decided to do for your baklavas?

123
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,520
First one is a rose and barberry flavour.

124
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,800
I'm actually making them in small muffin trays

125
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,560
and I'm using a star cutter to cut out my filo, so I'll be making

126
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,280
four stars for every hole, and the filo comes out

127
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,560
and you keep rotating them and you get like a flower,

128
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,760
and they're a container for the syrup.

129
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,480
So I've just put a slight slant on it.

130
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,200
As well as his flower-shaped baklavas, Luis is rolling cashews,

131
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,080
almonds and grated carrot in pastry drizzled with saffron syrup.

132
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,280
How many layers are you putting into that?

133
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,440
Well, I do a strip of filo about 33cm long.

134
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,400
- One strip?
- About.

135
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,720
And because you roll it you end up with lots of layers inside.

136
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,320
You're all very organised, you've got your four lots here.

137
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,280
- That is for my filo pastry. 
- Get pulling!

138
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,440
Wow, that's Mary's motto.

139
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,920
Thank you very much.

140
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,680
I'm off to keep an eye on her - she's in pulling mode.

141
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,040
Traditionally, baklava fillings are dry

142
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,400
but Nancy has never been one for tradition.

143
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,240
I make muesli, anyway,

144
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,040
and I thought muesli might go into baklava quite nicely.

145
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,080
I've had to soak the oats first which makes it a bit sticky

146
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,240
but if I don't soak the oats it's nearly inedible.

147
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,760
- Morning.
- Morning, Nancy.
- I know you've been practising filo pastry

148
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,720
but is it part of your regular repertoire?

149
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,920
No, I can't say it is, no.

150
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,840
I really think that nobody has made it before.

151
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,360
- I didn't really know what baklava was.
- That's all right, we're honest.

152
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,960
- It's something you wear when you're doing a bank job.
- Yeah.

153
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,040
But anyway, one I'm going to call a breakfast baklava,

154
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,080
the other one, I've called this coffee and chocolate.

155
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,920
Nancy's adding honey to her coffee and chocolate baklavas,

156
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,880
then orange syrup. She's drizzling apple syrup

157
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,760
on her breakfast baklavas.

158
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,680
It's interesting what you've picked,

159
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,680
but it comes down to the shape and the carrier of how you're going to

160
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,680
bring those flavours through. So what shapes are you going to be doing?

161
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,680
- This lot is going to be layered and then cut into triangles.
- OK.

162
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,520
This one I'm going to roll and then squash up

163
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,200
and then cut those into 12.

164
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,200
- So, you're going to bake them in there concertinaed up?
- Yes.

165
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,480
All right, lovely. sounds interesting.

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,240
- Hello, Richard.
- Morning.
- Morning.

167
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
So, what stage are you up to with your baklavas?

168
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,320
I'm just preparing my fillings. I'm chopping some crystallised ginger

169
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,920
to go into one of mine. I've also toasted some nuts off.

170
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,400
And your second one?

171
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,280
- My other one is going to be a pistachio and rose one.
- Classic.

172
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,360
To complement his pistachio and rose baklavas, Richard's making

173
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,040
walnut and almond ones, with a cinnamon and orange syrup.

174
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,120
You're doing the concertina baklava

175
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,360
and then you're doing the straight round?

176
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,480
Yep, I'm going to make a great big long tube with blitzed pistachios

177
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
and whole pistachios in it as well.

178
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,440
Yeah, it's all about getting that... very thin layers,

179
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,120
that's what baklava is all about, and a good bake.

180
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,960
Be truthful, have you ever made filo before?

181
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,000
I've never made filo before. All of my friends, they all thought

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,520
I was mad when I said I was making filo, they all use shop-bought.

183
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,000
Good luck, Richard.

184
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,320
SHE MUTTERS TO HERSELF

185
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,960
..50 grams of chocolate chips.

186
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,640
I'm fascinated to see the diversity we've got in flavours,

187
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,040
and I think baklava is one of those things which can be very tricky.

188
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,720
How many people actually make filo pastry?

189
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,920
Chetna is the only one who's doing two different filo pastries.

190
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,040
I'm a bit unsure about the chocolate one, how it's going to turn out.

191
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,240
I think it alters the dough and it alters the bake.

192
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,800
I think Chetna's very brave. Now, Richard's gone down the classic route

193
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,760
but he's doing the concertina one which you scrunch up.

194
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,480
You've got to make sure all the little creases are equal,

195
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,080
it's quite tricky to do.

196
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,240
Moving onto Nancy, I'm not sure what muesli's going to bring to the party.

197
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,720
It'll be rather interesting.

198
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,040
I think it'll get good texture from the oats.

199
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,480
Luis over there, he's cutting out stars

200
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,960
so that he gets a sort of flower-like effect.

201
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,600
The question is, is it baklava? I'm not sure.

202
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,320
I quite like the idea and for me I think I'm going to enjoy it.

203
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,040
We've got four fantastic semifinalists,

204
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,720
it's going to be a fascinating one.

205
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,040
It is very quiet.

206
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,960
Everyone's just got their heads down

207
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,120
trying to get on with this, to be honest.

208
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,720
The key to a fine and flaky baklava is wafer thin pastry,

209
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,080
but it needs to be handled with care.

210
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,400
I'm looking to get four squares that size, out of this piece.

211
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,840
And the trouble is the thinner you go, the more delicate it gets

212
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,120
and soon splits.

213
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,360
I'm aiming to get this flipping massive,

214
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,320
I think is the technical term.

215
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,520
You just start to see the worktop through it

216
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,880
and I think that certainly is as thin as I can get it, anyway.

217
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,000
- Goes like skin, doesn't it, after a while?
- Yeah.

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,360
I could just pop this on my face and I'd look 20 again.

219
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,480
Do you know how much I want to pop this on my face now?

220
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
I am. I'm not going to. I am...

221
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,080
not going to.

222
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,560
OK, bakers, halfway through. Halfway through.

223
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,320
It's starting to dry.

224
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,920
I need to move a bit faster.

225
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,320
The fragile sheets of filo can be stacked, folded

226
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
or rolled around the filling.

227
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,920
This is looking all right, isn't it? I'm quite happy with this one.

228
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,680
These flowers are really intricate.

229
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,280
I could have probably made something simpler but I chose not to.

230
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,680
I'm obviously building up my layers of filo and then layering each layer

231
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,800
with butter, so that's one, two, three, yep.

232
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,280
With less than two hours left,

233
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,400
the semifinalists need to crack on with the next 12.

234
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,320
12 done, 12 more to go.

235
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,720
This is the second batch. The carrot just gives them

236
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,880
a bit of sweetness and also a bit of moisture inside.

237
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,840
This is chocolate and coffee. I'm just putting some honey in it.

238
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
So, I'm working with my chocolate filo.

239
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,520
When I made these baklavas at home, it was slightly more difficult

240
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,000
to roll it really, really thin.

241
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,440
I'm slightly intrigued, and if I'm honest,

242
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,000
a little bit worried about how you're going to roll this.

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,520
Luckily, I've got myself a sheet to roll it with,

244
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,720
so hopefully I'm going to get it started by hand

245
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,520
and then pick the sheet up and it should roll up perfectly.

246
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,040
Oh, nice. Good work with the gingham! That is beautiful.

247
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,120
Ta-da!

248
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,000
What are you making?

249
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,040
In no way is that legal.

250
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,400
In no way can we allow that to be shown on television.

251
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,480
It's going to be cut up into little pieces.

252
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,680
In what way does that make it better?

253
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,720
Bake-lavas, you've got an hour on your baklava.

254
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,800
They're probably OK.

255
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,480
Those are nicely brown.

256
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,520
while the final batch bakes, the next stage is the syrup

257
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,720
which binds together the pastry and the filling.

258
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,120
I'm looking for a fairly thick pouring syrup because too thin

259
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,720
and it just drenches the pastry and makes it soggy.

260
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,840
Oh, it smells amazing, the masala chai.

261
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,120
I have got strong flavours but they should like it.

262
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,600
I think I've messed up here.

263
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,240
The honey and the chocolate have sort of boiled up

264
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,920
and come up through the middle. Nightmare.

265
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,000
Some baklava you find is very pale, some has got a lot of colour on it.

266
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,040
I'm sure that there will be a colour card that you have to put on

267
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,240
and Paul will know what it is and I don't. I'll find out soon.

268
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,920
I'm warming to that young man.

269
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,480
I don't know who he is or why he keeps turning up to the tent

270
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,120
but there's something about him.

271
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,760
Inscrutable.

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah, I'm really happy with these, yeah.

273
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,960
But I'm worried about the other one.

274
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,920
I'll be all right if I can get this done

275
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,120
in the next ten minutes or so, should be OK.

276
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,280
I'm a little bit worried about this second batch.

277
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,040
My only saving grace is that they've got to be gooey anyway,

278
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,680
and they need a crispy top.

279
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,200
I've got a crispy top.

280
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,960
OK, bakers, one minute to complete your sheets.

281
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,800
Oh, God, I'm making a right pig's ear of this.

282
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,240
They don't look too bad, do they?

283
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,720
Just slightly on the edge of delirious at the moment.

284
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,920
They lack finesse.

285
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,080
OK, bakers, that's it.

286
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,000
Move away from the baklavas, please. Chet, stop drizzling.

287
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,240
Luis! Luis!

288
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,680
HE LAUGHS

289
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,800
I'm done.

290
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,720
They look very pale.

291
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,480
Traditionally, it should be quite a rich golden brown.

292
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,080
Go for the muesli first.

293
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,760
It's holding itself quite well,

294
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,840
the syrup is binding everything together.

295
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,080
I like that the moment the knife touched that,

296
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,520
you got the crisp crunch which I expect from baklava.

297
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,560
I think it tastes good, the texture is there, you've got the crisp

298
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,040
on the bottom and the top and the middle. Right.

299
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,680
Those look a little bit soggy,

300
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,880
but you do want that nice sticky glaze on top.

301
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,160
You can see a couple of layers in there.

302
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,360
It's a really nice strong coffee taste to it.

303
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,640
I think the flavours are good. Overall, you've got what baklava is.

304
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,280
- And you have been very original. 
- Thank you.

305
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:15,040
- Now, these baklava cups...
- Yes. 
- ..as opposed to baklava.
- They are.

306
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,960
The question is, is it baklava?

307
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,600
I looked up lots of different baklavas and I had seen ones

308
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,160
like that where they'd used the filo to make a container for the filling.

309
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,040
When I initially look at it, it doesn't look like baklava.

310
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,960
But it's meticulously done.

311
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,600
- That is bone dry.
- OK.

312
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,080
And I'm not actually getting all the layers, either.

313
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,280
Right, let's look at these.

314
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,400
You should have several layers of the very, very thin filo

315
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,840
- before you roll it up.
- Sure. 
- You've just got one layer

316
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,880
and it looks a little bit on the thick side.

317
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,280
- The flavours are great, but the pastry is just wrong.
- OK.

318
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,960
They look the classic baklava shape.

319
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,160
Let's have a look at this one on the top, then.

320
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,360
It cut well there.

321
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,320
You've left sensibly the pistachio nuts in nice big pieces.

322
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,600
Now, I like that.

323
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,920
The flavour is delicious, very traditional, you've got it bang on.

324
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,800
I think that's a winner and I love all the layers.

325
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,400
Right, let's have a look at this one.

326
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,920
You have got the great concertina, great flavour.

327
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,640
It's under-baked slightly, such a shame,

328
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,800
because the flavour of both of them are excellent.

329
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,480
- They look a bit heavy.
- OK.

330
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,960
But they are all perfectly formed.

331
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,400
The colour's good.

332
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,480
I'm missing the layers because normally when you eat baklava

333
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,160
you've got all this syrup oozing out and I've just got the syrup

334
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,960
on the top which in turn makes it a little bit dry.

335
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,160
It's because the pastry layers are so thick that it can't penetrate.

336
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,560
Now, moving onto the chocolate ones. Interesting for a baklava.

337
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,600
- It's predominantly filling.
- OK.

338
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,320
I'm not getting the layers.

339
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,040
- The taste of it is delicious but the layers are just not there.
- OK.

340
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,120
I just feel so proud to be here and whatever happens, no,

341
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,680
I do not want to go home.

342
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,000
I like things to look nice but I thought it was a bit like

343
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,760
trying to display 12 bread rolls.

344
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,000
That's how it felt for me,

345
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,240
in that they weren't a thing of beauty, particularly,

346
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,000
and I don't really like it, baklava, at all.

347
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,520
I was expecting tough judging and I got tough judging.

348
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,120
So, as long as I feel as though I've done my best and I've presented

349
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,480
something that looked good, you know, then that's a positive for me.

350
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,760
I feel happy with where I've got to, not to say that I'm complacent

351
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,160
and I'm happy to go, but I feel pretty vindicated.

352
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,840
I came in here thinking I was all right at baking and, yeah,

353
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,440
I think I probably am all right at baking, aren't I?

354
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,760
After a rocky morning, the pressure is on each semifinalist

355
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,600
to excel in the next bake.

356
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,200
Hello, bakers, welcome to your semifinal Technical Challenge.

357
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,600
Now, this is one of Paul's recipes.

358
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,520
- Paul, any words to say for the bakers?
- Good luck.

359
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,840
- Thank you. And now go. 
- Are you going to keep me?

360
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,000
No, Mary, I'd like to keep you but the traditions and conventions

361
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,280
- of the show say we must now turn you away.
- Off she goes.
- Off she goes.

362
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,720
So, bakers, you will be baking a Schichttorte.

363
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,760
- What?
- A Schichttorte.

364
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,960
- Well, they might make a good one, you don't need to say that.
- I know.

365
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,640
Listen, it's a little German tricky patisserie, OK?

366
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,160
We don't know anything about it, we don't know how to make it

367
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,800
but all I do know is thus -

368
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,840
you have two hours in which to make your Schichttorte.

369
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,120
- On your marks... 
- Get set... BOTH:
- Bake!

370
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,040
As usual, it's something that we've never heard of...

371
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,600
I've never heard of, anyway.

372
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,720
Schichttorte. Schichttorte.

373
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,280
A Schichttorte is a German layered cake and there are a lot of layers.

374
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,400
20 layers?!

375
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,640
SHE LAUGHS

376
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,320
Only 20 layers to do.

377
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,760
The number of layers isn't the only unusual thing about a Schichttorte.

378
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,440
"Preheat the grill..."

379
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,040
It's a grilled cake. That's going to be the tricky thing.

380
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,240
I've never ever grilled a cake.

381
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,760
Gosh.

382
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,680
What the bakers have got to do is make a simple batter,

383
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,200
and then inside the tin put a layer of the sponge in there,

384
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,160
and then they pop it under the grill.

385
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,360
We've asked them to do light, dark, light, dark, all the way through.

386
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,360
What we're testing them on is a bit of concentration skills.

387
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,960
Cos don't forget there's 20 layers.

388
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,040
And that's an hour of watching a grill.

389
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,360
- Would you like to see inside? 
- I would like to.

390
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,320
- Now, that cut through like butter. 
- It does indeed.

391
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,400
That is quite amazing. They're wafer thin.

392
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,560
And that's what we're looking for, we're looking for something

393
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,000
that screams consistency.

394
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,520
You can see aeration in each layer even though the layers are

395
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,320
so thin, it's not heavy in any way.

396
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,040
I do hope that they achieve the same as this.

397
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,120
It's a fairly standard cake mix.

398
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,400
It says to cream together the butter and sugar, so that's what I'm doing

399
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,520
and while that's happening I'm just separating my eggs.

400
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,320
"Add the lemon and vanilla." Got those.

401
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,040
"Add the egg yolks, add the flours and add the egg whites."

402
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,800
So I'm just making sure that'll be whisked up, then I'll do those.

403
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,400
Should work.

404
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,480
"Now add the egg whites."

405
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,800
Don't want to knock too much air out. I'm not going to mix any more

406
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,000
because this seems quite a good batter-y consistency.

407
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,160
That's it.

408
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,040
- WHISPERING:
- I think that looks all right.

409
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,200
I don't know what anyone else is doing.

410
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,320
This looks OK.

411
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,120
- She's a bit competitive, is old Chetna.
- What?

412
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,000
HE LAUGHS

413
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,680
I've mixed up my mixture. Very wet, isn't it?

414
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,840
I'm going to work out exactly how much each individual pancake weighs

415
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,040
and hope for the best, really.

416
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,400
50 grams a layer, that's not much.

417
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,000
That can't be right, can it?

418
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,720
I don't know, love. It doesn't look enough, does it?

419
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,320
Well, that's better.

420
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,520
Spread it out with the old spatch.

421
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,840
Such a small amount of batter.

422
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,080
Bit like making a pancake, I suppose.

423
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

424
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,480
"Grill until light golden,

425
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,560
"add more mixture and grill until dark golden."

426
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,760
So that's how you've got to go light, dark, light, dark.

427
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,240
Paul's recipe doesn't state what temperature

428
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,040
or for how long the bakers should grill each layer.

429
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,160
I've just put it on high.

430
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,920
Because I think if it's about browning the top,

431
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,920
there's no thickness in it at all.

432
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,720
I'm not timing it, to be honest, on the layers.

433
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,440
I'm just doing it by eye.

434
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,040
It's not golden. Maybe they need longer than we think.

435
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,880
I don't know what the temperature of the grill should be or...

436
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,560
SHE SIGHS

437
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,160
I've got the grill on full whack,

438
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,760
so it should be pretty hot in there.

439
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,400
We'll see. Crikey.

440
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,240
I think that's sort of golden.

441
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,960
It's cooking, it's cooking. Yes!

442
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,440
"Add more mixture and grill until dark golden."

443
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,240
So I've done the light golden, now I'm going to do dark golden.

444
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,000
"Continue until you have 20 layers alternating in colour."

445
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,480
OK, that's done.

446
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,360
It's taking ages to cook and at this rate

447
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,840
I'm never going to do it in time.

448
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,400
I've done the first layer for five minutes

449
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,800
so what I'm going to do is do the second layer for seven minutes.

450
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,280
So I should get a darker brown.

451
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,680
SHE EXHALES

452
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,520
Dark golden.

453
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,320
I think that's number three.

454
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,240
I'm just writing down which layer I'm on

455
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,880
because it's 20 layers, light/dark, light/dark,

456
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,280
and if you didn't write it down you'd just completely lose track.

457
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:20,360
Light, dark, light, dark, light, dark.

458
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,600
So that's number three, right. So this is number four.

459
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,040
That's light.

460
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,640
- GERMAN ACCENT:
- OK, my little darlings, you have one hour left

461
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,760
and you will be very punctual because we are so efficient!

462
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,400
You have one hour.

463
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,680
I'm going to have to get my skates on.

464
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,960
That's going to take ages, 20 layers.

465
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,080
Should I whack up the temperature?

466
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,080
Schichttorte might be a new concept to our bakers in the tent,

467
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,880
but it actually comes from a very old tradition in Germany

468
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,400
called Baumkuchen, which is the pride and joy of one small town.

469
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,120
Hansestadt Salzwedel is known for beautiful buildings.

470
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,720
It's part of Germany's Timber-frame Road which stretches nearly 3,000km.

471
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,120
But it's also known as Baumkuchen Town.

472
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,320
Baumkuchen is the most difficult of the traditional German cakes to make.

473
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,760
The name itself means "tree cake"

474
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,520
and it's the ultimate test of a German baker's skills.

475
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,480
Unlike the domestic version of this,

476
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,080
which the bakers are struggling with under a grill,

477
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,440
Baumkuchen are cooked on a spit.

478
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,840
This bakery uses an original recipe from 1807 with a batter mixture

479
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,880
of flour, butter, sugar and around 40 eggs per cake.

480
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,000
This is a great place to be,

481
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,640
sandwiched between two beautiful Baumkuchen,

482
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,160
here in the nexus of Baumkuchen production,

483
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,000
where patisserie meets rotisserie in a very beautiful way.

484
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,040
Oh, this is the Queen of Baumkuchen, Saskia I.

485
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,560
I think she'd make a lovely bride for Prince Harry, don't you?

486
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,400
Hennig's Bakery produce around 20 Baumkuchen a day.

487
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,440
Head baker Maik Suske has been making them since he was 15.

488
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,000
- Will you show me how to make one, Maik?
- Yes.

489
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,680
- You make four of these.
- OK.

490
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,440
And the fourth. OK.

491
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,520
Brilliant. Oh!

492
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,920
- You must...
- Right, so it's ready to start.

493
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,480
So, those original rings make the shape of the Baumkuchen, OK.

494
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,600
- Shall we try together, Maik?
- Yes.

495
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,800
Brilliant. Sideways.

496
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,800
This is very much like Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore in the film Ghost.

497
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,640
Something quite beautiful going on here.

498
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,520
Nice, it's like a dance. Baumkuchen dance.

499
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,120
Amazing.

500
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,720
The cake takes 24 hours to cool down

501
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,640
and then is covered in fondant icing or chocolate.

502
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,160
Now, Maik, I've eaten a lot of cake in my time but I think even 11 kilos

503
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,720
might be a bit too... Actually, no, we'll get it in hand luggage.

504
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,960
Come on, to the airport.

505
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,680
Back in the tent, time is running out to complete the Schichttorte.

506
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,520
I am panicking because I've got half an hour left.

507
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,880
I've got still ten layers to go.

508
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,480
I am up to number 16.

509
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,920
I've lost count of layers.

510
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,640
I'm trying to get ahead so I'm trying to work in-between

511
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,960
these layers. All right, get these glazes done, then.

512
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,600
I've just read the instructions for chocolate glaze

513
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,600
and they're quite clear, it says "make the chocolate glaze".

514
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,720
SHE GIGGLES

515
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,080
Very precise.

516
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,720
I think the term for making a chocolate glaze is winging it

517
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,160
because...just throw it all in and hope it turns into a glaze.

518
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,600
Because it's got butter in it and golden syrup,

519
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,640
it's probably a pouring glaze that you pour... Oh!

520
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,160
That you pour over and then it'll set.

521
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,440
But if the glaze isn't cooled to the correct temperature, it won't set.

522
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,400
I remember reading somewhere, if you're doing a glaze, it's usually

523
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:30,280
around 30 degrees when you pour it on and it's just nagging me at the

524
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,760
back of my head, so if it's nagging me I need to listen to the voice.

525
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,800
TIMER BEEPS

526
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,200
I think the layers are going to be determined by how much stuff

527
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,920
I've got left but, strictly speaking, I've got four left to do

528
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,880
but I don't think I'll have enough.

529
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,880
This is number 19.

530
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,720
Don't have a lot of time.

531
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,400
I might not get 20.

532
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,720
Who's counting?

533
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,400
As if. He's going to be counting, all right.

534
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,720
I don't think he's going to take it apart.

535
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,640
He'll cut it, Richard.

536
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,240
If he cuts it, he won't see 20 layers in mine.

537
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,720
- Luis, I'm excited.
- 20.
- 20!

538
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,240
- We're in, we're done, let's get it in there.
- Boom!

539
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,000
I may as well do 18 and then have time to glaze it and stuff.

540
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,920
I've got 17 minutes left, so now I've got six layers to go.

541
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,960
Don't have time.

542
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,720
- Good, that looks great.
- That will do.

543
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,360
Look at that, it rises very much just to nearly

544
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,040
the top of the tin in a perfect way.

545
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,480
Right.

546
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,760
It's pretty good, isn't it?

547
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,160
Oh, dear. I know how it feels.

548
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,880
That's what happens to me every night

549
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,280
after I take my trousers off, thank goodness for that.

550
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,600
So you've got 20 layers?

551
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,480
No, I haven't got 20, I've got 18.

552
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,680
Are you worried that you haven't got the last two?

553
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,800
I can't really help it, I've got no time.

554
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,600
No, just go with what you've got, absolutely.

555
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,160
For the chocolate to sit smoothly on the top

556
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,920
the cake should be sealed with an apricot glaze.

557
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,800
This is apricot jam, usually used for sticking stuff on cakes.

558
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,920
I'm hoping it'll be used for sticking the...

559
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,720
sticking the glaze on.

560
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,880
You coat it in the jam and I think it stops crumb coming out

561
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,400
and affecting your glaze.

562
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,000
Funf Minuten, meine lieblings. Five minutes.

563
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,760
The temperature, I wouldn't say is ideal for decorating. I'd more

564
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,320
say it was an absolutely atrocious temperature for decorating.

565
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,440
It's probably a cake that you actually don't do the sides,

566
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,680
but there you go.

567
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,880
SHE SIGHS

568
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,320
It's gone very quiet.

569
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,920
There's so much to do, who's going to talk?

570
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,800
One minute on the Schichttorte.

571
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,400
End it! Das ist alles.

572
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,440
Please bring the 20 layers up to the gingham.

573
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,760
Mary and Paul are looking for 20 alternate layers,

574
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,760
a glossy glaze and decorative vanilla icing.

575
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,640
We're going to start with this one.

576
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,880
It's got a lovely shine on the icing.

577
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,480
The vanilla looks OK. There's not much chocolate down the side here.

578
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,680
You can definitely see the layers. Right.

579
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Oh, he's actually counting them.

580
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,680
Is he going to count all 20 in all of them?

581
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,080
I need to brace myself.

582
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,880
18 layers on that one. Chocolate hasn't quite set.

583
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,120
It's a good taste.

584
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,200
Still warm, that's why the icing is dripping down a little bit.

585
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,520
Let's move onto number two. I like the decoration on the top.

586
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,080
Its got a lovely glaze, it's a good height,

587
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,600
I think it's a very professional finish.

588
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,280
Let's have a look inside.

589
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,640
Very, very good layers.

590
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,280
And, of course, they have got the light

591
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,440
and the dark all the way up which looks very beautiful.

592
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,080
It's got 20. I just hope it tastes good.

593
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,320
Nice flavour.

594
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,760
Very impressive.

595
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,200
Now, this one's had some issues.

596
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,600
Lop-sided, not much chocolate down the side.

597
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,560
I'm getting 17 on that one.

598
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,440
The bottom sponge is a hard crust.

599
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,680
See how over-baked it is there?

600
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,200
The flavour's OK

601
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,560
but I think there was issues with the sponge on that one.

602
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,160
Right, finally the last one.

603
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,960
I quite like the webbing on the top.

604
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,200
Lovely shine on that.

605
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,200
Interesting alternate layers.

606
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,560
There are 20 but they are very, very thin.

607
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,400
And that is in mixing the cake.

608
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,840
But the layers are there and it's got a nice shine on it.

609
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,160
In fourth place, is this one. Who's that?

610
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,240
Me.

611
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,440
It was dropping to one side

612
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,000
and I think we only had about 17 layers.

613
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,360
In third place is this one.

614
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:48,280
You didn't get the required layers, you just never got the height.

615
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,880
And in second place, who's that?

616
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,200
That was nearly up there,

617
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,880
we reckon there were 20 layers there, well done.

618
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,960
Thank you.

619
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,640
In first place, Luis.

620
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,520
Well done. The layers were all there, nice and even.

621
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,000
And the decoration on top was good, pretty faultless.

622
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,280
Thank you.

623
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,160
That just shows you that anything can happen here.

624
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,200
Never heard of it, never made one before, came first.

625
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,480
I've never baked a cake under a grill before.

626
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,040
No idea.

627
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,720
'I've only done toast under a grill.'

628
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,000
So, yeah, I'm quite pleased with the outcome, actually.

629
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,880
Cor, it was a bit of a chore, wasn't it?!

630
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,480
'Yeah. I'll take second'

631
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,480
and run away happily and never ever cook that ever again.

632
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,520
'I am worried because'

633
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,720
my morning didn't go to plan and, you know,

634
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:45,880
I came fourth right now, so everything really rests on tomorrow.

635
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,040
I won't be sleeping well tonight.

636
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,480
After a good afternoon for the men,

637
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,680
the women have some catching up to do.

638
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,200
Everything rests on the Showstopper.

639
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,840
Good morning, bakers. And welcome to your last bake before the finals.

640
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,360
Now, today Paul and Mary would like you to make entremets.

641
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,640
They're very, very small

642
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,680
and fine cakes that would grace the window of a French patisserie.

643
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,640
The judges would very much like you to make two different types,

644
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,120
12 of each.

645
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,280
You've got five hours on the bakery clock. On your marks...

646
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,880
- Get set.
- Bake.

647
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,520
This complex bake will test the semifinalists on their design

648
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,080
skills and their time management.

649
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,120
It is top-end stuff, and it does look amazing.

650
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,160
If I can do it.

651
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,320
This is really the high-end of patisserie.

652
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,840
I want to see how many skills and techniques they can show us.

653
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,080
Each entremets has to be a work of art,

654
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:02,040
it just has to have such a polish and a finish, that is

655
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,800
better than they've done in any challenge before.

656
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,520
We're looking for precision, we're looking for beauty,

657
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,800
we're looking for elegance in beautiful small cakes.

658
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,680
I've seen pastry chefs crumble at making these things,

659
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,640
let alone the bakers in the tent.

660
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,000
For each little entremets, the bakers need to use a variety of

661
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,320
techniques to create layer upon layer of different textures and flavours.

662
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,360
- Morning, Luis.
- Morning.

663
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,520
Luis, what have you chosen as your two entremets?

664
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,440
I'm making a pomegranate and pistachio cake which is pistachio

665
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,240
sponge and it's got a layer of a pomegranate molasses cream inside.

666
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,920
The second one I'm doing a cherry and chocolate entremets, and when you

667
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,320
cut through it you'll see the cherry centre perfectly in the middle.

668
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,880
The cherry centre will be surrounded with chocolate mousse

669
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,200
on a shortbread base.

670
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,840
To top his pistachio cake, Luis is creating a novel pomegranate jelly.

671
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,600
You've got a long time to do this

672
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,680
but where do you see the problems are going to be for you?

673
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,200
Jellies are tricky, trying to get them from the mould

674
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,600
perfectly onto the top of a round cake is a bit fiddly.

675
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,840
Working with mousse is fiddly as well, especially in a hot tent.

676
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,680
- All right, buddy, good luck.
- All right, cool. Thank you very much.

677
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,760
- Good luck, Luis.
- Thank you.

678
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,360
Nancy is also incorporating jelly into her entremets.

679
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,640
So the first thing I've got to do is get the jellies made,

680
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,320
and then get both of these in the freezer

681
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,120
and then I can concentrate on the mousses.

682
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,200
Good morning, Nancy.

683
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,560
Morning, Paul. Morning, Mary.

684
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,480
Tell us about both of them.

685
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,880
Right, I'm doing a lime mousse with a chocolate biscuit at the bottom,

686
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,000
passion fruit jelly.

687
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,480
- Oh!
- And then the raspberry one is almond sponge at the bottom,

688
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,680
then a layer of mousse, then a layer of verbena jelly,

689
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,400
then another layer of mousse and then a dark chocolate glaze.

690
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,880
Nancy's adding mint to her verbena jelly

691
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,800
and decorating with raspberries.

692
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,560
Her lime and passion fruit entremets are coated

693
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,360
with a white chocolate glaze.

694
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,880
I always find that slightly disappointing

695
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,800
because you've got the chocolate, the green and the yellow.

696
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,160
Actually, the colours would look quite fascinating

697
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,840
but you've covered the whole thing in white chocolate.

698
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,200
Yep.

699
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,240
Are we seeing the layers?

700
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,160
No, the whole thing will be glazed.

701
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,520
I thought, for me, entremets is when you cut through,

702
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,040
when you see the layers.

703
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,520
From the outside you don't see anything.

704
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,640
You should, yeah... Well, I dunno.

705
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,480
Those glazes are going to be difficult, particularly

706
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,600
the white chocolate one because it's temperamental and it's a warm day.

707
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,160
Kermit in a liquidiser.

708
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,640
HE LAUGHS

709
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,680
These will be dots on the sponge,

710
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,280
then I'm going to cover it with another colour of sponge, as well.

711
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,040
- Hi, Richard.
- Hi, Paul.

712
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,680
What is that?

713
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,160
This is the sponge layer for one of my entremets,

714
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm doing a grapefruit almond and vanilla one.

715
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,840
This will be the sponge that encases a grapefruit mousse.

716
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,200
- Grapefruit.
- Yes.

717
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,040
Interesting flavour, can be quite refreshing, you can

718
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,920
lose the flavour though quite quickly.

719
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,760
I know, you lose the flavour out of the mousse quite easily.

720
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,800
I've had to boost it up quite hard but I've done this as a kind

721
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,640
of comparison to my other entremets which is a hazelnut latte one.

722
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,760
Richard's making chocolate sponge and Italian coffee buttercream for

723
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,520
his hazelnut entremets.

724
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,320
His grapefruit ones have a grapefruit mousse, topped with grapefruit jelly.

725
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,000
Here you've got the natural outside of your lovely spotted sponge,

726
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,800
are you putting anything round the sides of your other one?

727
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,360
No, hopefully, I'm going to leave them open so you can see some

728
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,040
lovely crisp layers as you go... Hopefully they'll be crisp.

729
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,080
- Good luck, mate. I want to see that grapefruit come through.
- Me, too.

730
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,480
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

731
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,160
- Good morning, Chetna. 
- Morning, Chets.

732
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,520
Morning.

733
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,120
So, what are you up to?

734
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,320
I'm doing my first entremets first. It's chocolate, orange

735
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,920
and hazelnut entremets.

736
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,560
So in the bottom I've got a hazelnut dacquoise,

737
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,560
then on top of that is feuillantine praline paste, chocolate.

738
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,960
Then there's a milk chocolate cream, then there's an almond sponge,

739
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,360
then there is an orange custard.

740
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,560
- Anything else?
- And then there's going to be caramelised oranges.

741
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,600
Hang on a minute, can we just start from the bottom?

742
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,440
I'm losing the will here.

743
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,680
Chetna's ambitious chocolate and orange entremets have six layers.

744
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,040
She's also making cappuccino cakes with a cocoa sponge,

745
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,360
coffee syrup and coffee flavoured cream.

746
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,640
- I think you have a lot going on. 
- Yes, lots going on.

747
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,200
I hope you remember which layer goes where because I'm a bit muddled.

748
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,000
It sounds good but it's all about getting those layers set.

749
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,880
- Good luck, Chetna.
- Thank you.

750
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,400
Mary and Paul are testing the bakers' ability to juggle numerous

751
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,280
techniques, under intense time pressure.

752
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,400
I think there's 10 or 11, if I've got enough time,

753
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,400
different processes.

754
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,160
So it'll be fairly difficult.

755
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,240
Too many things going on.

756
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,240
But I knew that when I chose it so it's not like...

757
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,880
I knew what I was getting into.

758
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,040
Running the two entremets hand in hand at the moment

759
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,680
so while one thing's doing, the next one's setting up cooling or...

760
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,240
Yeah, I'm just trying to keep up with both of them.

761
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,760
How many processes? You got a mousse?

762
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:42,600
Two mousses, biscuits, sponge, two glazes, two jellies,

763
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,160
chocolate pieces.

764
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,440
Out of fingers, done, done. We're done.

765
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,600
All right, raspberry mousse.

766
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,880
Three sheets of gelatine.

767
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,360
The bakers need to prioritise the layers which need to set.

768
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,080
My mousse is egg yolks whisked over a hot bath,

769
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,080
and then fold in chocolate, fold in cream

770
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:05,360
and I add gelatine, as well, to set it because it's so hot in here.

771
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,520
You've got a danger of it melting when you push it out of its mould.

772
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,040
This is quite runny, but I've had to put

773
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,280
a lot of grapefruit into it to achieve the grapefruit flavour,

774
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,800
so it'll set, it's just whether or not it makes the sponge go manky.

775
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,920
When the mousse is set, it'll be quite robust,

776
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,040
you'll be able to cut through it and it'll hold.

777
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,560
I'm just going to whack these in the freezer now, just give them

778
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,040
half an hour.

779
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,200
OK, bakers, halfway through.

780
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,240
This is the orange cream and I'm going to let it set

781
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,960
because that's one done.

782
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,960
Are you staying on time?

783
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,960
Am I on time? I don't know.

784
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,320
I don't know whether I'm Arthur or Martha this afternoon.

785
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,680
- That's it.
- That's got a nice colour on it.

786
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,680
Ah!

787
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:59,600
Silly. Yep, it's done.

788
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,560
It's ridiculous but that green makes me so happy. I can't even tell you.

789
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,240
I feel like I should rub some calamine lotion onto this.

790
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,240
Yeah, they look a bit angry, don't they?

791
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,560
To soothe the pox.

792
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,640
With two hours to go,

793
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,680
Luis is making the top layer for his chocolate mousse.

794
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,720
Chocolate and cherries are one of my favourite things to put

795
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,240
together, so that was always a good starting point.

796
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,320
Nancy's concentrating on the bottom of her raspberry ones.

797
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,200
These are my sponges, and I'm handling it really

798
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:39,000
when it's a bit too hot but I've got to, cooling time is a luxury.

799
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,440
I'm making the creme cappuccino which is a custard mousse.

800
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,480
So I'm making like a coffee custard.

801
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,040
Everything's got cream of some shape or form,

802
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,920
so with the heat, that's my worry.

803
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,480
Richard is making buttercream for his hazelnut mocha entremets.

804
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,760
There's a lot of butter goes into this.

805
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,440
I'm hoping that it will become nice and glossy and smooth and I'll

806
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,640
be able to spread it on my entremets with no particular problem.

807
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,560
SHE EXHALES

808
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,840
I'm just assembling one of my entremets.

809
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,160
I just overheard Luis say he's assembling one of his entremets.

810
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,040
Nowhere near there.

811
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:40,400
Nancy's the only baker ambitiously making two different glazes.

812
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,600
This is a white chocolate glaze, so I've got white chocolate,

813
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,520
condensed milk, gelatine, sugar water and glucose.

814
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,640
And this makes a thick pouring glaze.

815
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,280
I think my biggest stress is going to be my glaze has not been

816
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,440
cooled enough.

817
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,320
If they're too warm, they'll probably just run off.

818
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,120
Creme cappuccino is ready so I'm going to pipe it.

819
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,720
Then put it in the fridge to set. It does need some time to set.

820
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,920
Right, into the freezer.

821
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,520
FRENCH ACCENT: Bakers, you have ze demi heure left for ze entremets.

822
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,600
Half an hour left on your entremets.

823
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,240
I'm really pleased with these

824
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,880
because the stress of trying to get a mousse to set... Flippin' 'eck!

825
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,680
It is not set.

826
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,680
Nope, it's not set.

827
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,160
I should put them in the freezer.

828
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,240
This is the mascarpone cream stage. It's all gone on,

829
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,640
it's looking fairly flat. I might just scrape a few edges off.

830
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,240
That is beautiful.

831
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,280
Oh! It's a pure calorie soup.

832
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,320
Mmm!

833
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,680
Look, my hands are shaking.

834
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,160
I'm feeling the pressure of cutting them right, damn right I am.

835
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,880
What you have to do with the jellies is to get them out of the mould,

836
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,080
it's just heat the case of the mould to just loosen them.

837
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,640
If you leave it in the hot water too long,

838
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,880
the jelly will completely go back to liquid form.

839
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,160
If it's not in there long enough it won't come out the mould.

840
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,600
Are you happy, Chets?

841
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,680
I am happy, but I've just opened the other one

842
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,040
and that's not set so it's gone back in the freezer.

843
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,040
- And they're the ones coming out of the moulds, aren't they?
- Yes.

844
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,560
And they can't go "pfft!" on a semifinal Showstopper?

845
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,760
I'm just going to stick this back in the fridge,

846
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,320
I don't want this melting too.

847
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,120
This is done and dusted.

848
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,640
There's chocolate going everywhere! Oh, dear.

849
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,120
Dear, dear, dear.

850
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,920
Bakers, one minute to go,

851
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,320
one minute to go on your semifinal Showstopper.

852
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,240
OK, that's it, the bake's over, bakers.

853
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,680
Step away from your entremets s'il vous plait.

854
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,160
Chocolate everywhere.

855
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,880
It takes a lot of guts to be able to show all the layers.

856
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,280
Thank you.

857
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,400
I think the finish is very good, can't wait to get inside.

858
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,000
Right, we'll try the hazelnut.

859
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,040
I can see every layer, every flavour.

860
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,640
It's delicious, chocolate works well,

861
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,640
the nuts coming through there are beautiful.

862
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,440
That is extremely good.

863
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,480
I love that crisp base, it really is very exciting to eat.

864
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,240
Let's have a look at the dotted one.

865
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,800
Very neat, very subtle colours.

866
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,560
I could do with a little more flavour in the mousses.

867
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,280
Grapefruit is very difficult to convey in something like that.

868
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,120
But your consistency is perfect.

869
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,280
What a professional selection you've done for us.

870
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,920
These are interesting.

871
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,800
- There is a problem with the chocolate not going all the way down to the bottom.
- It's too warm.

872
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,880
Yep. These, I'm not so sure about.

873
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,560
I think the decoration's not particularly striking,

874
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,000
so what we'll do is we'll start with this fella.

875
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,280
That looks stunning when you cut into it.

876
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,480
I do like that little square, looks pretty good.

877
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,720
It's a lovely texture, you've balanced it beautifully.

878
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,400
It's refreshing, and I think you've done well with that.

879
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,440
- Thank you.
- Right, let's have a look at this one.

880
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,360
The chocolate and the lime really work well together.

881
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,760
The sharpness of the fruit comes through. I just think

882
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,520
the appearance on both of them has fallen a bit low for your standard.

883
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,480
Luis, I think they look really sensational.

884
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,920
They look very elegant.

885
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,720
Right, I think we'll start with the pomegranate.

886
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,040
You've got your definite layers there.

887
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,360
I love the flavour.

888
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,320
The pomegranate jelly is delicious, I would have liked to have

889
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,440
seen the sponge a little bit thinner, it works, though.

890
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,960
Right. Let's try the cherry and chocolate.

891
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,400
The rich chocolate married with the sourness of the cherries, works.

892
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,200
That's a very, very good little entremets.

893
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,520
Thank you very much.

894
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,520
You've got a perfect glaze on the top, I think just well done.

895
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,720
Thank you very much.

896
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,800
Now, these I'm looking forward to.

897
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,200
I like your chocolate work on the top,

898
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,880
they look bulbous with the weight of the top.

899
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,360
Wow, that's got a kick to it, hasn't it?!

900
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,840
It's the most beautiful cappuccino, lovely.

901
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,280
It is very good, could have been a bit neater

902
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,640
but the flavours you've got in that are fantastic.

903
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,640
- Well done.
- Thank you. 
- This one looks all right.

904
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:14,120
I would have liked a lighter colour. As you see your layers,

905
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,000
I'm missing some because the colours is all blended.

906
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,600
It's quite split on the top.

907
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,600
I was expecting tons and tons of flavour.

908
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,440
There is a tang of orange right at the end

909
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,760
but then it's more like a chocolate cream sponge.

910
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,240
I'm losing the orange because what I'm getting is a chocolate cake

911
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,000
mixture all the way down and you're so good on your flavours normally.

912
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,400
What a cracking semifinal. I mean, what results.

913
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,480
Who has impressed you, then, this weekend?

914
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,760
I think Luis has done some amazing flavours.

915
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,480
The Showstopper, he did all right actually, that sour cherry

916
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,720
and chocolate was delicious. I thought

917
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,560
the sponge on the larger one was too thick.

918
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,080
When you look at it in comparison with Richard's where he's

919
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,640
gone to the trouble of putting the polka dot all the way round

920
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,080
the outside of the sponge, that's the sort of thing which

921
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,320
really sends it off the rails and makes it exquisite.

922
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:12,680
I think that Richard has done perfection over there,

923
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:17,960
I mean, his layers are so clear and distinct.

924
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,320
So the men have done well,

925
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,720
do you think the ladies have matched them this semifinal?

926
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,240
Nancy was third on the Technical

927
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,360
so she let herself go slightly on the Technical, and these

928
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,560
really don't look as good as they should and she said that herself.

929
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,320
They do look a little bit uneven.

930
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,280
I thought Chetna missed it slightly on the Showstopper.

931
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,360
I was disappointed in the chocolate and orange

932
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,640
because you're not getting layers.

933
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,920
It's the semifinal, one of them will be sadly leaving us

934
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,640
today and at the moment you're looking at Nancy

935
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,360
and Chetna in a bit of trouble.

936
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,800
Bakers, I've got the great job this week, because they did

937
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,800
finally, after much wrangling, manage to pick a Star Baker.

938
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,760
Now, this week's star baker, well, it's such a new experience

939
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,120
to say this, I don't even know how I'm going to phrase it.

940
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,000
But let's just say this person

941
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,840
knocks the spots off everyone else this week.

942
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,880
Richard, congratulations, well done, you're Star Baker.

943
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,800
- Fifth time.
- Well done.

944
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,920
I feel really sad to have to do this,

945
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,760
losing somebody in the semifinal is always awful for all of us.

946
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:36,080
And I'm really sorry to say that the person who will not be

947
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,880
joining us next week is...

948
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,000
..Chetna.

949
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,600
'I will take away so much,'

950
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,560
such amazing memories and friends

951
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,880
and so much knowledge.

952
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,640
'It's one of the best experiences of my life.'

953
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,600
Chetna's a very good baker but she didn't quite find her form this

954
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,720
'week and today she just didn't have'

955
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,880
the panache that the others had.

956
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,240
She was, unfortunately, the weakest one but in a very strong pack.

957
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,640
Richard's attention to detail is the reason why he got Star Baker.

958
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,760
'You can hardly believe those builder's hands have produced'

959
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,240
such delicate results.

960
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,680
I wasn't expecting to be Star Baker, I was expecting to not go.

961
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,800
'Finish line's in sight, I reckon I've got'

962
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,600
a chance of winning.

963
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,240
'I'm a finalist,'

964
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,280
me!

965
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,080
'I am absolutely speechless, I can't get my head round it.'

966
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,040
And I keep crying and I don't do crying.

967
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,200
'Never in my'

968
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,480
wildest dreams.

969
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,160
Sorry.

970
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,600
My family are going to be...gosh...so excited that

971
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,240
I've got to the final.

972
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,040
Next time, it's the final.

973
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,800
You only get one go.

974
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,480
I'm not happy with that.

975
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,520
And the three remaining bakers...

976
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,880
- Not putting you off, am I? 
- No not at all.

977
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,560
..face their last three challenges.

978
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,600
It's just one panic after another, isn't it?

979
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,880
But who will bake their way to glory?

980
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,240
I would vote for Richard.

981
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,000
That's this weekend up the Swanee.

982
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,800
I'd put my money on Luis to win.

983
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,400
I've definitely gambled with time.

984
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,480
If I had to choose one, I'd definitely pick Nancy.

985
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,840
My hands won't keep still because they're too nervous.

986
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,680
Who is it going to be?

987
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:29,640
The winner of the Great British Bake Off 2014 is...
