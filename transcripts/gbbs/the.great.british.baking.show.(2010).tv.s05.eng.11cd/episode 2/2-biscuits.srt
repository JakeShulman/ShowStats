1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,240
Welcome to our second visit to the Bake Off tent.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,600
Last week we did cake.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,520
Who knows what Paul and Mary have up their little sleeves this time.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,840
- I'm not sure I would like to eat anything that has been up Paul's sleeve.
- No, no way.
- No.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,360
Inside that tent we have 11 bakers raring to go

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,560
and three fantastic challenges ahead of them.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,920
It can only mean one thing - welcome...

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,000
BOTH: To The Great British Bake Off.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,880
Last week, 12 new bakers entered the tent for the first time.

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,600
We know how to bake, don't we?

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,040
We do. Only thing we know.

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,480
While there was success for some...

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,680
That taste - fantastic.

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,400
..there was misery for others.

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,120
Oh, no, it's split.

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,880
Nancy executed exemplary miniature cakes...

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,160
What perfection. A sheer joy to look at.

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,520
..and was crowned this year's first Star Baker.

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,920
APPLAUSE

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,080
But Claire had one disaster too many.

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,960
Absolutely no idea.

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,000
'And she was the first to leave the Bake Off tent.'

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,880
You'll be very missed, love. You're a real cracker, you are.

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,880
This week it's biscuit week.

25
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,360
Please can you say to me, "That's a cracker".

26
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,760
- That's a cracker.
- Good.

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,680
'The bakers face savoury biscuits...'

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,440
Essentially this is a biscuit iron maiden.

29
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,240
'..an exacting technical...'

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,400
I thought, add up ingredients, divide by 18. Does that make sense?

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,240
'..and a Showstopper in need of a very steady hand.'

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,840
Ah-ha.

33
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,880
Yes!

34
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,120
Right, er...

35
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,640
Oh, it says, "Time to bin your comedy partner,

36
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,720
"she's only dragging you down'.

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,160
Ah, "Beware of the middle-aged lady on your right eating biscuits."

38
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,800
It's biscuit week.

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,240
Welcome back, bakers. It's your second weekend in the tent.

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,440
Jordan, don't look worried yet. Now, welcome to biscuit week.

41
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,280
Paul and Mary would love you to make...

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,320
# Savoury biscuits I'm going to sing it

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,520
# Savoury biscuits... #

44
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,840
Sorry. 36 savoury biscuits, please, ladies and gents.

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,760
You can make any biscuit you like. Any flavour you like.

46
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,200
It's got to go with cheese. Underneath cheese. Atop cheese.

47
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,680
Alongside cheese. I don't care.

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,920
It's got to be cheesier than an ABBA tribute band at a fondue all-night bash.

49
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,280
- So, you've got two hours. On your marks...
- Get set...
- Bake!

50
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,840
These are big sunflower seeds!

51
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,680
It's one thing making, you know,

52
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,200
three or four biscuits for a dinner party.

53
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,880
When you've been asked to make 36, that is very tricky.

54
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,160
Because each biscuit has to be consistent.

55
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,880
So not only the size has to be consistent,

56
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,800
but also the bake and the colour.

57
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,360
If it's digestive biscuit, it should have a nice crumble.

58
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,520
If it's a sort of water biscuit, it should snap and be firm.

59
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,880
It has to be the best of its type, because we are very fussy.

60
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,360
I've got a commanding view this time.

61
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,560
Last time, I was at the front last week. Better here.

62
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,440
I can see what's going on.

63
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,680
- Good morning, Jordan. 
- Good morning. How are we all?

64
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,680
Your savoury biscuits - what have you decided to do?

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,040
I'm going for a sourdough chilli cheese.

66
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,080
Yorick is my sourdough yeast.

67
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,760
As in, "Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio"?

68
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,640
Horatio. Yes, indeed.

69
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,320
- Can I have a quick look? 
- Feel free. He's potent.

70
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,800
- You love Yorick, don't you? 
- I have a great passion.

71
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,120
You're very close to Yorick.

72
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,280
He's a friend who provides far more than pretty much everyone else.

73
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,840
Jordan's an IT manager and has been baking for seven years.

74
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,240
He loves to experiment with flavours

75
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,960
and his fiery biscuits

76
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,800
combine three different chillies -

77
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,360
Arbol, Cascabel and Chipotle.

78
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,840
I really, really like Mexican food.

79
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,800
I sort of get a bit obsessive over my chillies.

80
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,520
I have tried various different chillies at home,

81
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,520
because I was worried about scaring Mary Berry.

82
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,240
My husband said to me the other night, "What's for supper?"

83
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,080
I said, "Well, I thought about steak and ale pie

84
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,720
"but you're having rye and fennel biscuits."

85
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,960
Nancy's family regularly enjoy the fruits of her baking.

86
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,680
Today she's making a crumbly rye flour and fennel biscuit.

87
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,440
- I'm a little bit worried about the fennel.
- Yeah.

88
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,000
When I practised at home, I used three heaped teaspoons

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,560
and that was spot-on.

90
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,320
But think it was probably out of date.

91
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,280
Right. Does that make it...?

92
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,840
- That makes the taste weaker, though, if it's out of date?
- Yeah.

93
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,600
And it loses its colour. I bet yours is grey.

94
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,280
Yeah. My herbs are all grey. Sell-by 2002, most of them.

95
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,240
Today I'm baking za'atar and fig biscuits.

96
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,720
Za'atar is like a Middle Eastern blend of spices and herbs.

97
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,000
Iain's exotic bakes go down well on his construction site.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,840
Today he's adding oatmeal and fig to his za'atar biscuits.

99
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,480
Fig tends to be quite chewy, so would you expect it to bend or snap?

100
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,680
A bit of both. It does bend and does...

101
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,280
- You're covering yourself. 
- Cover the bases.

102
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,720
That's handy.

103
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,840
- It is chewy, erm... 
- It's a bendy snap.

104
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,320
..but it does have a bit of a snap.

105
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,960
Not like a cracker.

106
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,120
Please can you say to me, Iain, "That's a cracker"?

107
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,520
- That's a cracker.
- Good.

108
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,560
Biscuits usually have a short texture and so don't require

109
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,040
much kneading, but Enwezor's is an unusual biscuit.

110
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,800
It only takes five minutes to develop the gluten so it doesn't tear so much.

111
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,720
Enwezor manages to make all his bakes with his four young children.

112
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,320
His healthy pumpkin and sunflower seed cracker biscuits

113
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,680
are made using three types of flour.

114
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,600
It's half-white flour, half-rye and wholemeal flour.

115
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,640
It's not quite as elastic as white flour but it has a lovely flavour.

116
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,480
I'm just kneading it gently for 30 seconds.

117
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,520
It matters hugely how much you knead it for,

118
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,600
because if you work it too much it can be very tough.

119
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,920
Kate bakes at home with her five-year-old daughter Eloise.

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,120
Her signature shortbread biscuits are flavoured with Parmesan and apple.

121
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,720
The biscuits are baked with the apple on top,

122
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,480
but they're very thin otherwise they add too much moisture to the biscuits.

123
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,000
- Hello.
- Morning. 
- Hello, Luis.
- Hi, are you all right?

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
What are you up to right now?

125
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,040
At the moment I'm just bringing my dough together,

126
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,600
which is quite a crumbly dough.

127
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,840
Is this because you're re-rolling it?

128
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,720
No, it's crumbly by nature.

129
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,040
It's more of an oat and wholemeal biscuit, so...

130
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,840
- Ooh, we haven't had any of those yet.
- OK, cool.

131
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,560
Luis grew up in Stockport,

132
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,400
but his Spanish heritage influences his baking.

133
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,320
His oatmeal biscuits are flavoured with sweet paprika,

134
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,880
rosemary and black olives.

135
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,560
Were they olives in oil or brine?

136
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,480
Brine, yeah.

137
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,880
Because I don't want to add oil to my mixture, so...

138
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,160
And I really dried them as well, you know,

139
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
so the mixture doesn't go too sticky.

140
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,360
Rolling the dough to an even thickness

141
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,600
is essential to ensure a consistent bake

142
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,600
across all 36 biscuits.

143
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,760
I'm exhausted!

144
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,360
Ooh, a lovely smell here, Chetna. Tell us about your savoury biscuits.

145
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,880
I'm making fenugreek and carom seed crackers. Like water biscuits.

146
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,080
Chetna grew up in India and her traditional family recipes

147
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,320
influence much of her baking.

148
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,040
Her spice-infused crackers are each rolled individually.

149
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,240
Is this something that's been passed down?

150
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,520
Yes, these are my mum's recipe.

151
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,680
She always has a box of these at home.

152
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,360
Once one goes the other just magically appears.

153
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,400
You're confident they're all going to be equal size and shape?

154
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,960
Yes, I am, yeah.

155
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,720
Diana is the only baker not making a traditional biscuit dough.

156
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,360
Instead, she's using a pastry mix.

157
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,480
I've chosen to make Parmesan and chive triangles.

158
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,840
Because it's something I do make on quite a regular basis.

159
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,800
Diana's been baking for her family for 60 years.

160
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,600
Today she's adding home-grown chives to her Parmesan pastry triangles.

161
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,880
It seems a simple thing, but I didn't realise how much time

162
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,320
it was going to take with the restings.

163
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,240
You have thyme in there as well? Hey! You see!

164
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,720
That's probably the worst pun we've ever had on this show,

165
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,440
and that's saying something.

166
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,840
OK, bakers, you're halfway through your cheesy challenge. Gouda for you!

167
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,400
Cut out some biscuits now.

168
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,040
Norman is the only baker bravely not adding any flavour at all to his biscuits.

169
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,920
If you opt to bake something simple I think it has to be good.

170
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,400
These might be at the bottom of the list as far as taste is

171
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,200
concerned, but I like them.

172
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,080
Norman's farthing biscuits are made simply with flour, butter and lard.

173
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,320
He learnt to bake at school

174
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,120
before joining the Merchant Navy at the age of 17.

175
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,600
You have an air of calm about you.

176
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,200
Do you think that's related to the fact you've had...

177
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,880
It's all a bluff.

178
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,400
- ..military training?
- No, no.

179
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,680
It's not gone unnoticed you have been doing a little bit of semaphore in your free time.

180
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,200
- I was teaching them last night. 
- So, how would you semaphore "bake", for example?

181
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,400
- It's B...
- B.

182
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,440
- A...
- A.

183
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,480
- K...
- K.

184
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,920
and E.

185
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,720
You've just made that one up!

186
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,240
- No, I didn't! 
- Absolutely made that one up.

187
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,200
It's so long since I learnt it. I was 15 when I learnt this, you know.

188
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,840
But K is the same as E. Hang on. B, A...

189
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,760
That's when they used to tell me, "Straighten your arm out!"

190
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,360
And it never straightened, you see, because I broke it.

191
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,480
HE LAUGHS

192
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,720
My dog has actually eaten a whole tray of these.

193
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,320
I left them on the side, went out of the kitchen,

194
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,200
came back in and they're all gone.

195
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,400
And my dog was just sat there like...

196
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,440
Martha is just 17

197
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,520
and lives with her mischievous dog, Alfie,

198
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,200
and her sister, mum and dad.

199
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,560
Today she's making caramelised onion

200
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,360
and goat's cheese sandwich biscuits

201
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,600
- Sandwich biscuits?
- Yes.

202
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,720
- You've got to therefore make an awful lot.
- I know.

203
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,160
72.

204
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,480
- 72 biscuits.
- And so it won't be crisp-crunch if they have got a filling.

205
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,920
No, because it's going to have a cheese in the middle.

206
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
I've got some softer goats' cheese in the middle.

207
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,240
I work on a cheese counter in a supermarket,

208
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,640
so I have to spend my Saturday afternoons just staring at cheese.

209
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,600
These crackers are my father-in-law's favourite crackers.

210
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,320
He is a real cheese eater.

211
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,080
Richard works in the family building firm,

212
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,200
and his colleagues have been enjoying

213
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,400
his poppy seed and rosemary crackers.

214
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,400
- What I love is you've still got that as well. 
- I don't even notice any more.

215
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,400
- Just in case someone comes along and asks you for a quote. 
- Someone might need measuring up.

216
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,000
I need measuring up, but wait till I'm at fighting weight.

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,720
I don't need my measurements now, they'd frighten me.

218
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,280
I'm just stabbing all the biscuits with my fork.

219
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,400
If you have holes in a biscuit they're less likely to puff up.

220
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,200
What the hell is that?

221
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,040
- I commissioned this this week. 
- Who did you commission it from?

222
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,200
My husband again.

223
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,040
I said, "I need something to make them look professional."

224
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,440
Essentially this is a biscuit iron maiden.

225
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,320
Right I'm going in with my biscuits.

226
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,240
OK.

227
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,480
For every different type of biscuit there's a different

228
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
baking approach.

229
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,120
Now we watch these like a hawk,

230
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,520
because 30 seconds, they will go from not done enough to far too done.

231
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,240
OK, bakers, ten minutes to go. That's the way the cookie crumbles.

232
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,800
They've cooked rather quickly underneath.

233
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,440
I don't know why that is, so...

234
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,520
Anyway, they haven't got a soggy bottom, have they?

235
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:15,280
They are not baking evenly, so I'm having to take out odd ones.

236
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,480
All 36 biscuits should be identical.

237
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,520
I'm not happy with them. They're going back in for another minute.

238
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,320
I'm cutting out the crackers now after they've actually baked

239
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,960
on both sides.

240
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,000
Perfectly round.

241
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Maybe another minute. I will turn them round.

242
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,440
Bakers, that's 30 seconds. 30 seconds left on this challenge.

243
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,240
I'm up to the wire.

244
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,760
33, 34, 36.

245
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,600
36.

246
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,440
I think I'm just going to pop it on top of there.

247
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,080
That's it.

248
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,880
- That's it, bakers.
- Well done.

249
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,400
Sorted.

250
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,480
HE LAUGHS

251
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,520
One challenge down.

252
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,920
Which biscuits will stand up to the judges' scrutiny?

253
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,280
They certainly have a lovely snap.

254
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,080
I think that's a very nice,

255
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,160
flavoursome biscuit to go with cheese.

256
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,920
It's not overpowering in any way.

257
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,840
The rosemary, you know, can be quite soapy if you use too much of it.

258
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,840
But the balance with the biscuit itself is really good.

259
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,880
Thank you.

260
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,840
You've got the balance of your chilli right.

261
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,080
My issue is it tastes burnt.

262
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,720
It's burnt?!

263
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,000
Like something has caught.

264
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,040
Ah!

265
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,520
It is slightly over-baked, but it still doesn't put me off the biscuit.

266
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,400
These are really aromatic. They're great, aren't they?

267
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,400
The flavour from that carom seed as well, gorgeous.

268
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,280
I think you've got a very uniform bunch.

269
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,240
And I love the idea of olives in the biscuit.

270
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,440
I think the flavours are lovely, they really do work together.

271
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,480
But I think you are three minutes away from perfection.

272
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,160
What we've got here

273
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,480
is a lovely colour on that side,

274
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,440
and then when you twist them round...

275
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,680
- Yes.
- ..They're pale.

276
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,360
It is irregular. It's not quite evenly baked.

277
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,040
The idea was good, but it wasn't executed well.

278
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,920
They look so uniform, like a line of soldiers.

279
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,560
You've managed to retain a good snap.

280
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,360
- Very original. I think it's great fun.
- Thank you.

281
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,480
- Well done.
- Thanks.

282
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,640
It looks so perfect. But for me,

283
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,360
it is a bit soft underneath.

284
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,680
The moisture of the apple goes into that Parmesan biscuit,

285
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,280
- giving it a slightly under-baked look.
- Yeah.

286
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,520
I'm debating whether I like them or not.

287
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,320
- I'm not getting a lot of apple coming through.
- Oh!

288
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,560
I don't know that those flavours go well together.

289
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,440
I'm questioning the za'atar blend. It is very, very pungent.

290
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,240
I just think it's gone slightly overboard with those powerful flavours.

291
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,640
The uniformity is there, because obviously you cut them.

292
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,720
It's carrying flavour.

293
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,080
It's not very strong.

294
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,320
It probably could have done with more of a kick to it,

295
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,920
but the texture of it is bang-on.

296
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
A very even, pale bake.

297
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,440
It's breaking like a sort of digestive biscuit.

298
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,160
The texture is there, the colour is there.

299
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,880
You've got that exactly right for me.

300
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,560
It looks a lovely texture when you open it.

301
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,600
I like that. I like that biscuit a lot. It's very professional.

302
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,920
I think the recipe, the way you've approached it...

303
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,520
You could sell those tomorrow.

304
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,160
I really believe you could sell them tomorrow.

305
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,760
At a farthing each.

306
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,760
THEY LAUGH

307
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,040
I'm very pleased.

308
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,760
I'll be even more pleased when I talk to my wife

309
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,520
tonight as she says, "They won't like those biscuits.

310
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,400
"They're not good enough."

311
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,200
She'll have to eat her words, and the biscuits.

312
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,440
I thought the comment about them being over-baked was a bit strange.

313
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,720
I disagree.

314
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,120
HE LAUGHS

315
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,600
I could have done better. I could have done a lot better.

316
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
There we go. Onward and upward.

317
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,080
You might think of the classic British biscuit as

318
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,960
the kind you dunk in your tea.

319
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,520
But what about the unsung hero of the seaside?

320
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,080
In the early 19th century, at the end of the Napoleonic Wars,

321
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,440
many Italians moved to British cities

322
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,080
in search of a better life

323
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,240
and settled in areas like Ancoats in Manchester.

324
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
They brought with them

325
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,880
a technique from making Italian ice cream known as gelato.

326
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,760
Now, that involves boiling milk so that the sugars dissolve.

327
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,120
You then put it into kind of a wooden basin and hand crank it,

328
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,680
and it produced the most amazing, smooth, delicious ice cream.

329
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,480
So the streets were reverberating to the sound of these

330
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,240
sort of dairy mangles being cranked...?

331
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,160
"Gelato, gelato." Yes, exactly.

332
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,120
'The cold cellars of the terraced houses were ideal

333
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,760
'for churning out this speciality.'

334
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,720
So how exactly were these ice creams sold?

335
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,000
The sellers would go round the streets pushing round these

336
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,280
carts, and they would put it in something called a "penny lick".

337
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,520
The person who was buying it would lick every last bit, give it

338
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,520
back to the ice cream seller, who would then sell it to somebody else.

339
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,520
A penny lick off the street doesn't sound like the most hygienic thing in the world.

340
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,640
No, there was a dark side to this wonderful craze for gelato,

341
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,680
and that was the spread of diseases.

342
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,480
Which is why, in 1899, they were banned.

343
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
- No-one wanted cholera gelato.
- No.

344
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,080
'With the penny lick outlawed, ice cream sellers

345
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,360
'needed a new way to serve their product.'

346
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,600
It took an enterprising Italian from Ancoats by the name

347
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,400
of Antonio Valvona to come to the rescue of the gelato industry,

348
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,040
bringing a new product to the streets of Manchester that

349
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,800
would revolutionise the way that ice cream was sold.

350
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,680
What do you have to do to get a gondola round here?

351
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,880
'While travelling in Belgium, Valvona

352
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,520
'saw that instead of being served in penny licks,

353
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,360
'ice cream was sold in edible cups,

354
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,280
'so, from his basement in Manchester,

355
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,080
'he invented the twist cone,

356
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,200
'a rudimentary version of the cones we know and love today.'

357
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,120
I've spotted a flaw in the early twist.

358
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,200
Indeed.

359
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,480
Yeah. That's a nightmare for people.

360
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,080
A lot of the early versions of the cones had holes in the bottom

361
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,400
because they were doing it so quickly.

362
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,040
But ice cream didn't last long enough for it to run down the hole.

363
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,760
No. It certainly doesn't in my house.

364
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,720
'Valvona's twist cone was made from flour, water and treacle batter,

365
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,600
'poured onto cast-iron plates which were flipped for an even bake.'

366
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,440
What did they use to shape the twist?

367
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,200
They used to use a wooden peg, which was maybe a chair leg,

368
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,920
anything they could get their hands onto.

369
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,600
Papa's on the old griddle.

370
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Grandma's working the chair leg, getting that down to a fine point.

371
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,560
If you'd like to open that up for me...

372
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,200
SHE GROANS

373
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,920
Round the chair leg.

374
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,160
And that's why it was called a twist cone,

375
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,200
because it twisted round the wooden peg.

376
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,320
As it cools, it hardens.

377
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,080
So you'd be left with a small cone.

378
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,200
Mm-mm. Who needs ice cream on top of that?

379
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,160
That's going to be delicious. Mm, that is good.

380
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,960
All of the fun, none of the typhoid.

381
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,760
'For the second biscuit challenge,

382
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,000
'the bakers face one of Mary's technically tricky recipes.'

383
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,160
Bakers, welcome to your biscuit technical challenge.

384
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,320
Now, it's one of Mary Berry's recipes - she's the one in the

385
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,680
Blake's 7 jacket just there.

386
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Right, Pussy Galore, Paul Hollywood, if you would like to leave the tent.

387
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,200
See you later, Pussy.

388
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,840
So, today we would like you to make 18 Florentines.

389
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:29,080
OK. Mixed reaction. You've got one hour and a quarter.

390
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,640
On your marks...

391
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,240
BOTH: Get set and bake!

392
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,080
ALARM BELL RINGS

393
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,520
One hour and a quarter. Jeez.

394
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,840
I've eaten plenty of Florentines but I've never made one so, yeah.

395
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,920
We'll see what happens.

396
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,760
I've never made Florentines before. Not made much fancy stuff, really.

397
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,360
More bread and pies.

398
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,080
Florentines. Mary, good choice!

399
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,080
Well, they're pretty tricky to make, really.

400
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,680
To get absolutely perfect like that.

401
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,920
They should have a sort of lacy appearance, be delicate.

402
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,880
The bake should be even,

403
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:31,560
and then the chocolate should be evenly distributed.

404
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,440
It's got a lovely marking underneath. It feels...

405
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,040
It feels lovely, actually.

406
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,000
If they have got the chocolate on at the right temperature,

407
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,880
it doesn't leak through.

408
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,680
I think it's got a beautiful caramel flavour with the cranberry

409
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,440
and with the nuts as well.

410
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,040
As a whole biscuit, I think that's delicious.

411
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,160
They give you basic instructions, but they don't give exactly

412
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,920
how much to chop them, how finely to chop the nuts and cranberries.

413
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,000
Never in my life have I chopped nuts one at a time.

414
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,200
HE LAUGHS

415
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,000
But this is Mary Berry's recipe

416
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,440
and we do not want to upset Miss Mary Berry.

417
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,480
Mary's Florentine recipe is made by adding fruit and nuts to a caramel dough.

418
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,560
I've never made caramel with golden syrup which is...

419
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,240
SHE LAUGHS

420
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,640
I'm dissolving the sugar and the syrup and the butter together,

421
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,200
but it mustn't boil.

422
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,440
It says, "Spoon them by spooning the mixture onto the trays," so...

423
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,440
I am using a spoon. Which is a good start, isn't it?

424
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,080
HE LAUGHS

425
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,720
There isn't much mixture, which is a bit scary.

426
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,680
If you were making them at home it wouldn't matter

427
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,120
if you had 12 or 22, but they specify 18 so we have got to get 18.

428
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,920
Before I start baking them, I need to work out what I'm going to do.

429
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,200
I'd have thought you cut them out.

430
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,240
This is where you get your maths wrong.

431
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,600
I thought, add up ingredients, divide by 18 - does that make sense?

432
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,240
15 grams.

433
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,040
These are going to spread a bit, I'm sure, as they bake.

434
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,920
But it would be really nice if they spread in a nice circle shape.

435
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,840
OK. We'll give it a throw.

436
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,280
Into the hands of fate we go.

437
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,040
Mary's recipe says, "Bake until golden brown,"

438
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,200
but doesn't stipulate a baking time.

439
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Seven minutes? Seven minutes.

440
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,560
Why not?

441
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,160
Due to the high sugar content,

442
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,600
the Florentine mixture can burn easily,

443
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,560
so the bakers need to be really vigilant.

444
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,640
Just wait and watch, really.

445
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
I don't know how long to bake it for.

446
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,360
What do you reckon, Richard?

447
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,600
Keep looking at them.

448
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,200
I've no idea when they are or aren't done. If they're black, they're overdone.

449
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,240
They're already golden brown.

450
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,360
I know, I was going to say it's really difficult

451
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,080
because the colour is already quite...

452
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,520
Oh, look, that one's moving!

453
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,680
So hard to know when they're ready.

454
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,960
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

455
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,080
I think they might be over.

456
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,560
I hope not.

457
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,400
Shall I try it? Try and get a round one.

458
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,880
Trying to make them all perfectly round.

459
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,280
Not sure if that's right or wrong,

460
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,080
but I've started so I have to finish.

461
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:28,840
Bakers, you have got venti minuti, which is Florentine for "20 minutes," to go.

462
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,320
(Pretentious.)

463
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,360
Quick breaking of chocolate.

464
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,520
All you can see is the timer of the task ticking down.

465
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,400
Gosh.

466
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,880
What I'm attempting to do now is temper chocolate.

467
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,160
So I need to melt this first, get it up to a temperature of 53

468
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,360
degrees, then I need to put the other chocolate into it.

469
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,320
The slower you cool it, the more shiny it is.

470
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,640
I've never really fully understood it.

471
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,760
I'm trying to learn on the job.

472
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,000
It says, "Spread one side of each with chocolate

473
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,080
"and then decorate in classic zigzag," and I'm

474
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,760
wracking my brains trying to think what the hell does that look like.

475
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,360
It's really hard to put the chocolate on

476
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,600
because it's got holes in the biscuit,

477
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,960
so it's kind of running through a little bit on to my hands.

478
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,200
The way I'm putting the chocolate seems fine, I think.

479
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,280
But I'm not 100% sure, let's say that, yeah.

480
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,040
OK, bakers, five minutes.

481
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,600
We're just taking off Mary's manacles and she's on her way.

482
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,400
'The chocolate needs to be slightly set

483
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,760
'for the zigzag pattern to work.'

484
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,200
This is my interpretation of a zigzag.

485
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,680
I think it should be done with a fork

486
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,600
and it makes a wiggly on the back of it.

487
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,840
I think that's what I've seen before,

488
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,200
so it's what I'm going to go with.

489
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,000
I don't know whether it's piped on top or whether it's with the fork.

490
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,000
Can't be the fork. I'm just going to go with my instinct.

491
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,320
Keep those under wraps though...

492
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,600
- OK.
- ..Because, to me, that looks as if you have done that correctly. 
- Do you think so?

493
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,080
Yes! It's with a fork! Don't tell anyone!

494
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,680
I just thought I saw it one time, so I thought I'd recreate it.

495
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,440
Yes that's exactly it! You've got the ridges!

496
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,040
Bakers, you've got 20 seconds left.

497
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,120
That's it. You are out of time!

498
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,960
Bakers, please bring your Florentines on their plates

499
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,120
up to your photo.

500
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,920
Thank you very much.

501
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,240
Mary and Paul are looking for lacy biscuits

502
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,160
with an even spread of fruit and nuts,

503
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,320
topped with tempered chocolate and a perfect zigzag.

504
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,360
Right, well, here we've got a good-size Florentine.

505
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,720
Yep.

506
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,400
We haven't got the classic zigzagging on the bottom.

507
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,160
Nice and crisp.

508
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,120
The reason why these are crisp is because they're nice and thin.

509
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,120
You have got a good amount of ingredients on the top,

510
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,200
which is nice.

511
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,520
Beautifully crisp. Some of them have got a nice forking.

512
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,480
- Yeah.
- We've got a lovely zigzag on the bottom here,

513
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,520
but they are a bit small.

514
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,080
They're not as crisp.

515
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,200
Bit clumsy on the top. Chocolate's all right underneath, though.

516
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,360
But they have got the pattern.

517
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,640
Even though these are small, they must be crisp.

518
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,440
And these ARE crisp.

519
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,760
Somebody has used a cutter...

520
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,240
Mm.

521
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,120
..and stamped them out, because they've lost their laciness.

522
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,480
They should have a sort of lacy pattern.

523
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,800
These are fairly uniform. Nice bit of chocolate.

524
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,320
I can hear the crunch as you're eating them.

525
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,120
Mm. That's not bad that one at all.

526
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,360
You should turn the Florentine upside-down,

527
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,920
and that's where you put the chocolate.

528
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,120
And this one's had the chocolate put on the top.

529
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,000
They need a bit longer, actually.

530
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,560
There's no lace in that at all.

531
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,680
Probably needs to spread it out a little bit more.

532
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,200
Now, these are minute.

533
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,680
We haven't got any zigzag pattern on the bottom.

534
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,200
Looks slightly overdone.

535
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,800
Over-baked. Over-baked.

536
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,840
Yeah. Yeah.

537
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,400
It's not a bad colour. The size is a bit small.

538
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,960
A very thick layer of chocolate.

539
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,640
Spread on the top. Bit chewy.

540
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,840
Mine is thinner. So not all exactly the same size.

541
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,080
Inconsistent, then.

542
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,000
A bit of chocolate. Could have done with a bit more.

543
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,400
Mm. Crispy. But it's a pity the pattern hasn't gone through.

544
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,480
They look quite nice.

545
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:53,240
If they had spread a little more, they would be a little crisper.

546
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:59,400
It's now time to find out who has produced the best and the worst biscuits.

547
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,280
Number 11. These were a little bit over-baked.

548
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,120
You tried with the decoration, top and bottom.

549
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,040
But just a bit small.

550
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,600
Number ten is this one. Chocolate bleeding all the way through.

551
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,960
And number nine.

552
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,240
You cut yours out with a cutter and we lost some of the laciness.

553
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,920
Next is Chetna,

554
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,320
Diana,

555
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,680
Jordan,

556
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,120
Martha,

557
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,160
Kate, then Luis.

558
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,840
Number two is this one. Well done.

559
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,240
And you'll have worked out who number one is. Well done, Richard!

560
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,320
They are the proper size.

561
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,520
They were lacy, crisp, and that's how they should be.

562
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,160
Well done, Richard.

563
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,600
Congratulations.

564
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,480
It feels pretty brilliant to come first.

565
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,760
It doesn't get any worse. There is only 11 people there.

566
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,280
I started the day by saying I just didn't want to come last.

567
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,760
I really didn't want to come last. I haven't come last! Wahey!

568
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,320
I'm kicking myself, because they were actually fine.

569
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,080
But I cut all the best bits off with my cutter.

570
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,520
Only one challenge to go before Paul

571
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,640
and Mary decide who will be Star Baker

572
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,400
and who will be going home.

573
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,400
I think we have a group of bakers here who are bakers in their hearts.

574
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,400
They've been baking at home for many, many years.

575
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,320
I think Richard did extremely well.

576
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,600
His biscuit was fantastic.

577
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,840
But I think you can throw in there Nancy, Luis, Martha.

578
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,560
- Chetna.
- Chetna.

579
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:52,320
The ones that are lower down the scale are Iain and Diana.

580
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,800
Iain struggled in the technical. I don't think his biscuits worked.

581
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,880
And then you look at Enwezor,

582
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,840
when he came to the technical he was ninth.

583
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,520
But, you know, they can pull themselves up. We've seen it happen before.

584
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,120
They are all very good,

585
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,240
but there is a rather fiendish little Showstopper coming.

586
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,160
So, that might just ginge things up a bit.

587
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,880
- This'll sort them out. 
- Yeah. I think it might.

588
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,720
Good morning, bakers. Welcome to this, your Showstopper day.

589
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,680
Now, today, Paul

590
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:33,200
and Mary would like you please to create a 3D biscuit scene.

591
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,280
A funfair, a wedding,

592
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,040
a swimming race in the Leatherhead Leisure Centre.

593
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,680
Anything you want, but it must be made out of biscuit, please.

594
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,080
All we ask is that they stand up, OK?

595
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,640
They've got to stand up, which is frankly more than can be

596
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,320
said for the four of us this evening in the hotel bar.

597
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,720
Keep your biscuits erect. You've got four hours to do so.

598
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,520
- On your marks... 
- Get set!
- Bake.

599
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,360
Just getting all of the ingredients together. Sugar.

600
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,160
This is a strange challenge.

601
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,600
The biscuits themselves,

602
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,160
the major requirement is that they need to be architecturally sound.

603
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,240
It's down to picking the correct biscuit - you want

604
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,720
something that is going to be quite rigid.

605
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,760
But something that tastes good, too.

606
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,600
We don't want to see anything bought in,

607
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,920
we want it all home-made.

608
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,800
Good morning.

609
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,680
Good morning, Paul. Morning, Mary.

610
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,240
What is your biscuit?

611
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,920
It's gingerbread dough.

612
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,520
Any others or just ginger?

613
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,880
Just gingerbread. I think I've got, like, 80 biscuits to cut out.

614
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,080
80?

615
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,480
And 80 fondant cut-outs as well to kind of intersperse stuff

616
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,600
with as well, so...

617
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,280
Are you making your own fondant?

618
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,480
No. No, I'm not. No.

619
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,680
Enwezor is stacking fondant and gingerbread discs

620
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,240
to create his space-age biscuit scene.

621
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,080
This is where you need to be really strong.

622
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,480
Typically I do this on the floor because it gets so stiff.

623
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,120
I'm not sure if I'm allowed.

624
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,520
Hello, Martha.

625
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,560
Hello.

626
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,080
So, Martha. What have you got in store for us?

627
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,880
I'm making a ski village mountain scene, and flavouring

628
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,640
it with different things that you see in the mountains.

629
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,160
- Or get.
- Prince Charles.

630
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,920
So things that you drink.

631
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,280
So I've got a coffee biscuit, a hot chocolate biscuit,

632
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,480
- a mulled wine biscuit. 
- That's a nice idea.

633
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,000
Martha's snowy scene includes a ski chalet,

634
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,120
ski mountain,

635
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,520
and a suspended chairlift on a bed of marshmallow snow.

636
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,880
Will they be able to stand up and hold up?

637
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,640
They should be able to stand up.

638
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,960
I've made it once and they stood up then,

639
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,120
so hopefully they will stand up again.

640
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,040
It's important not to overwork it, really.

641
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,080
You don't want the flour to be worked too much.

642
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,680
This is the gingerbread mix.

643
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,000
I've decided to do a 3D biscuit scene of Hansel and Gretel.

644
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,120
I'm doing the house, Hansel and Gretel, the wicked stepmother

645
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,280
and the father, and 14 trees, and two birds,

646
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,720
and a path into the woods, and logs in the log store.

647
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
Is that crazy or what?

648
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,560
IF she gets it all done,

649
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,520
Nancy will use brandy snaps and green tea and orange-flavoured

650
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,600
gingerbread to create different textures and colours.

651
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,080
Iain's also given himself the task of making three different biscuits.

652
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,680
I'm rolling out the first biscuit, which is

653
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,600
like a wholemeal, oatmeal biscuit.

654
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:47,120
I need a good structure in the biscuit just for it to hold together.

655
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,480
I don't want to get any cracks in it.

656
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,960
Iain is hoping his Wild West scene,

657
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,200
made with chocolate and chilli and pistachio and rose biscuits

658
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,080
will stop him from being outlawed.

659
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,200
I think I'm right at the bottom after the first two challenges.

660
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,080
So I think have to do something miraculous to stay in.

661
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
The key to success in this challenge is precision.

662
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,400
If I concentrate now, I will be smiling later.

663
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,960
The bakers have chosen to use templates to cut out shapes in their dough.

664
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,640
So I've made one of you, I've made you, and I've made a plane.

665
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,960
Yeah!

666
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,280
But for Jordan it's a new experience.

667
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,760
This is the first time I've worked to templates, actually.

668
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,800
Fortunately, unlike the skyscrapers, the monster,

669
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,960
as long as the base is straight, doesn't have to be as accurate

670
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,120
as everything else because if he's a bit wobbly, he's a monster.

671
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,000
Inspired by his love of Japanese comics, Jordan's

672
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,680
turning custard and bourbon biscuits into a monster attack!

673
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,040
I have been trying to decide what he is called... Oh, alas.

674
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,160
Going to have to roll him out again.

675
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,520
Calm down, Enwezor.

676
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,600
Richard, every now and again just tell me to calm down.

677
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,400
- Calm down, Enwezor.
- Thank you.

678
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,440
Settle yourself.

679
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,680
Basically, there's seven different shapes I have to cut out.

680
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,480
I made templates but also made my own aluminium cutters to cut

681
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,840
out the shapes.

682
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,120
Norman's creating his fishing boat scene

683
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,000
from just one simple biscuit dough.

684
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,200
It's basically a shortcake biscuit.

685
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,840
Plain flour, caster sugar, and butter.

686
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,880
And just a tiny drop of vanilla essence.

687
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,240
And black food colour, and brown food colour.

688
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,400
So that's going to be the size of the...

689
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,560
Each individual boat will be this size?

690
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,040
- That size. With the sails on top. 
- Like a convoy of ships?

691
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,840
This thing is more about the actual display.

692
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,720
I'm not going to hold my head up and say they're going to be

693
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,240
the most fantastic tasting biscuits you've ever had...

694
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,600
They better had be!

695
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,520
That's very important, Norman.

696
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,400
I'm making the roof of the carousel.

697
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,400
These are the biggest biscuits so they take the longest to cook.

698
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,360
Chetna's constructing her ambitious seaside scene

699
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,240
from vanilla biscuits and royal icing.

700
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,440
Does the carousel have a roof on it or...?

701
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,560
Yes, a roof.

702
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,720
So how is the carousel staying up?

703
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,440
This carousel one of the most extraordinary things...

704
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,240
- One pillar.
- One pillar? And what's that?
- Biscuit.

705
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,760
- It's a biscuit pillar with a roof this big?
- Yes.

706
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,520
This high? With one pillar?

707
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,240
Yes. Not this high, this high.

708
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,720
How many times have you practised your carousel?

709
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,200
Once in the week gone.

710
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,040
My daughter came inside in the kitchen and she said, "Wow, Mummy.

711
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,400
"Now will this turn?" I said, "No!"

712
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,560
Come on, biscuits!

713
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,000
Kate and Diana are the only bakers attempting to bake their biscuits

714
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,800
in their finished shape.

715
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,960
The most challenging is getting that to hold as a tube for the main

716
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,200
part body of my engine.

717
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,880
Diana's classic steam train will feature

718
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,640
four different types of biscuits.

719
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,640
Gingerbread, tuile,

720
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,240
shortbread and pinwheels.

721
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,880
Let's see you make the pinwheels.

722
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,600
I knew you were going to say that.

723
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,000
This is very stressful. Having the laser-beam eyes of Mary Berry focused on you

724
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,760
- while you get...
- Look, she is being very clever,

725
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,680
like making a Swiss roll - a nice neat bit to start with,

726
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,920
so you get a Catherine wheel sort of effect.

727
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,040
Slowly does it. There's no rush, particularly of course in the train industry(!)

728
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,120
- Now you've got it. 
- Now you've got it.

729
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,000
Look at that. That is perfect.

730
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,960
So they are going to be the wheels?

731
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,800
They're going to be the wheels.

732
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,200
On this sheet we have got three boys.

733
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,200
Just in case one boy's legs break off.

734
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,080
Kate's boys are made from lemon-and-lime biscuits

735
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,160
and join her family tea-time scene.

736
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,920
Right. Oh, that oven's hot!

737
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,920
I thought I was having a hot flush, it's the oven.

738
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,360
In we go.

739
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,600
Baking different-sized biscuits is a real challenge.

740
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,720
The bakers must keep a constant eye on the clock.

741
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,600
17 seconds to go. Next tray comes out. Next cuts to do.

742
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,800
More dough needed.

743
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,360
This is going to go in the oven.

744
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,240
OK, bakers. You are halfway through your 3D biscuit challenge.

745
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,360
Two hours gone, two hours to go.

746
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,880
That seems OK.

747
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,080
- That looks good.
- I'm going to have a soft mountain.
- And you put those little foil...

748
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:49,200
- I made little hats for the little tops so they don't burn underneath. 
- Ah, sweet!

749
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,840
Welded.

750
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,360
What happened, love. Clearly they've stuck, but what's the reason?

751
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,440
At home I don't put baking paper down.

752
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,320
- But if you can get it off ,it's really tasty.
- I'll bet it is.

753
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,680
Is this OK? I'm going to make another skyscraper now.

754
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,000
To de-stress, do you have any good sort of techniques?

755
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,720
Do I have any good techniques?

756
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,080
Yeah, bake properly is probably the best technique.

757
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,400
This looks interesting.

758
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,920
I'm making George and the Dragon.

759
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,720
I've done two types of dough, so everything to do with

760
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,440
the dragon is smoky - slight hint of chilli and chocolate.

761
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,960
Everything else is made out of an orange-and-cardamom dough, which is this one.

762
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,280
Luis is hoping his graphic design skills

763
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,320
will help his fiery George and the Dragon biscuits stand up to the test.

764
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,040
All my biscuits are interlocking,

765
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,800
so they should all free-stand with nothing, really.

766
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,720
So you won't need much glue at all?

767
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,840
There is no glue. I'm not making any.

768
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,840
I'm looking forward to this 3D effect.

769
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,000
I think it has been well thought out.

770
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,080
But it comes down to the flavours, too.

771
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,840
- That biscuit has got to taste good. 
- Absolutely.

772
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,160
Richard also plans for his characters

773
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,760
to stand up by slotting the shapes together.

774
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,720
When you cook the gingerbread it swells,

775
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,480
so you have to open up your interlocking.

776
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,560
Richard's gingerbread boat and peanut butter island

777
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,280
form his very precise pirate ship scene.

778
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,920
- Can I just say, this is your pirate mould?
- Yes.

779
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,880
It looks like Long John Silver has mated with Shrek.

780
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,360
Yeah, he is the fat pirate.

781
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,200
He has also got two legs, which is

782
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,840
frankly one more than the piratical standard.

783
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,960
- I have a pirate captain with one leg as well.
- Oh, you are a marvel. There you go.

784
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,720
I'm constructing the main body of the rocket at the moment.

785
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,800
I've kind of lost a little bit of track of which discs go where.

786
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,560
Oh, God, they don't stand.

787
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,200
Yes!

788
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,640
It's a massive marshmallow mountain.

789
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,920
The different flavours the young people are using,

790
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,760
it really has been quite noticeable.

791
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,720
SHE LAUGHS

792
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,920
I'm traditional - traditional flavours and traditional baking.

793
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,560
I think this last fortnight has proved that

794
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,640
I am a bit old-fashioned.

795
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,120
It's sort of half-spaceship, half-cone headed puffin.

796
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,400
HE LAUGHS

797
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,440
It's a super-duper spaceship, you know. Streamlined, you know.

798
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,760
You're going to go places on this spaceship.

799
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,160
- Do you reckon?
- Yep, yep.

800
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,200
You promise a lot to a girl, you promise to take me places.

801
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,240
Bakers of the 3D biscuit challenge.

802
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,880
In terms of time dimension, you've got 30 left.

803
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,200
30 units of time.

804
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,200
Each unit being a minute, in dimensional terms.

805
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,920
I'm a bit of an amateur when it comes to decorating.

806
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,440
Once I drew a dinosaur for my daughter. It was so bad,

807
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,640
when I finished she started crying.

808
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,240
It's just lots and lots of piping now.

809
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,280
I could probably pipe for a few days and still not be quite finished.

810
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,760
Now, these are extraordinary. These remind me of 1988.

811
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,160
They will make you feel ill if you look at them too long.

812
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,440
I know. I'm thinking it's the old glow stick.

813
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,440
Second summer of love.

814
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,480
- There will be some left over later on, you know.
- Good!

815
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,040
It's quite difficult decorating,

816
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,480
when you are up against the time pressure.

817
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,600
It's the sort of thing you'd usually take a bit longer over.

818
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,160
- Does this feel like, sort of, art as opposed to baking?
- Er, yeah.

819
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,760
You are the sort of van Gogh.

820
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,520
It might be to do with the beard.

821
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,440
Possibly the colour of the beard.

822
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,080
You are the Vincent van Gogh of this competition.

823
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,560
OK, get the arms on Granny, the scales on your dragon,

824
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,520
and the chaps on that incredibly nude cowboy, Iain.

825
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,720
You've got ten minutes. Ten minutes.

826
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,920
HE PUFFS

827
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,640
I always get really nervous towards the end. My hands start shaking.

828
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,640
Come on, benches. That one's so wobbly.

829
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,520
I am pushed for time.

830
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,640
This is going to be really, really tight.

831
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,680
This has not been a good morning for Jordan.

832
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,480
I'm just going to eat it. What can a man do?

833
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,600
Where has the time gone?

834
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,120
How precarious is that?

835
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,680
I really expect to get a Blue Peter badge for this.

836
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,920
Bakers, that is it. Time's up.

837
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,680
Stop fiddling with your pirates.

838
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,880
Move away from your cactus, Iain, please.

839
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,320
Look at me!

840
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,880
THEY CHUCKLE

841
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,480
Mary and Paul will now judge the 3D biscuit scenes

842
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,320
before deciding who will be Star Baker and who will leave the tent.

843
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,920
- Ian, do you need a hand up with your cowboys?
- That's all right.

844
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,160
So the Wild West is coming to us.

845
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,080
It's supporting itself. Everything is standing up.

846
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,800
I love the way you've done the horse as well.

847
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,520
Nice snap of the oatmeal.

848
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,800
Quite sweet. Good crunch.

849
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,760
It's a nice biscuit, that.

850
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,160
Terrible colour, but you have to use that colour for that.

851
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,760
- Yeah, for the cactus.
- Exactly. But it tastes good.

852
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,440
I might take one of these.

853
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,040
Ah, don't break the wagon!

854
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,080
- Very nice chocolate biscuit. 
- I think you've done well.

855
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,600
Your three flavours are distinct and sharp enough.

856
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,680
And then the display is well thought out,

857
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,960
and actually very well executed. Well done.

858
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,800
SUE: Well done, Iain. Congratulations.

859
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,200
I do like it. I do like it. I mean, it's a bit lopsided.

860
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,160
The engine is beautifully round.

861
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,960
You did it round a tin, that was clever.

862
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,160
Shall we go for a little bit of the tuile on the top?

863
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,760
Gosh, they're quite difficult to do. And you've caught them just at the right moment.

864
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,040
That's just perfect. It's lovely.

865
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,080
Good.

866
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,200
It's quite difficult to do pinwheel biscuits and get them

867
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,560
absolutely tight like a Swiss roll in the middle.

868
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,240
- It could have been a bit neater, is my only argument.
- Yes.

869
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,960
I think it's absolutely ingenious.

870
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,440
You've done all sorts of skills - a bit of piping...

871
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,520
The techniques that you've got going on in here -

872
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,800
that's complicated to do. That's like a puzzle all on its own.

873
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,160
- Oh, the mermaid! 
- You've knocked the mermaid over!

874
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,320
Not the mermaid!

875
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,880
Oh, it's melt in the mouth. Melt in the mouth.

876
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,920
Gorgeous. The peanut flavour comes through.

877
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,360
Now to the gingerbread.

878
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,400
Lovely flavour. Very crisp.

879
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,000
That is absolutely fantastic. Well done.

880
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,560
Thank you.

881
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,240
Were we going to have an aeroplane?

882
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,600
You were. Both an aeroplane and a building...

883
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,880
He ate his plane, Mary.

884
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,640
To be honest, it looks a bit of a mess.

885
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:52,160
The bourbon biscuit tastes very, very good. Very delicate flavour.

886
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,320
- Thank you.
- Your custard biscuits, again, are delicious.

887
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,320
Unfortunate about the display.

888
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,360
What fun it is. We really worried

889
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:10,360
about this huge roof. But of course you've made a very good structure.

890
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,200
Flavour's OK.

891
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,240
But it is... It is burnt.

892
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,080
- It is burnt.
- Oh!

893
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,560
- But that design is spectacular. Well done.
- Thank you.

894
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,240
- Well done, Chetna.
- Well done.

895
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,320
I love the base.

896
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,240
- I love what you've done for the trees.
- I think it's enchanting,

897
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,360
and I love the brandy snaps on the roof.

898
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,640
Scrumptious. Delicious.

899
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,880
- Well thought out. And, in fact, well baked.
- Thank you.

900
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,000
I think you've been very clever,

901
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,840
the way you've baked those sitting people on the seats.

902
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,480
- That's a good lime biscuit. I can taste the lime.
- Oh, good.

903
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,960
The bake is excellent. I think the flavour is good.

904
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,200
But the design is bold and very clever.

905
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,200
Very pretty. Well done.

906
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,520
I didn't realise it was going to be biscuit on top of biscuit.

907
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,200
I was expecting some sort of building, you know. Flat sides.

908
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,160
- Is this fondant between those? 
- Yes.
- Did you make the fondant?

909
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,200
No, I didn't.

910
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,240
OK.

911
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,920
The middle is soft. That means that it needs a little bit more cooking.

912
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,520
You can almost bend it. See?

913
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,480
That, for me, is an issue for a biscuit.

914
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,640
You're very good at design, aren't you? Good at measuring.

915
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,680
- Good on graph paper, I think. 
- Thank you.

916
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,640
I think I'll take the horse. Very clever horse.

917
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,800
So crisp, that is. Lovely flavour.

918
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,960
Beautifully cooked.

919
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,080
The heat coming from the dragon is beautiful. It hits your palate.

920
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,600
It doesn't go bang, it just slowly comes in.

921
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,320
Both of the biscuits together and the theme and the characters,

922
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,440
- it's unbelievable. I'm running out of superlatives for that.
- Thank you.

923
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,960
- Well done.
- Flattered. Thank you.

924
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,720
It's quite simplistic, for the boat itself.

925
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,920
I'd liked to have seen some piping round, maybe on the sail itself.

926
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,440
You've one basic biscuit mixture?

927
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,320
Yes, with the different colour.

928
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,760
It's a good butter biscuit, but very, very simple.

929
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,640
You could have shown us another skill

930
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,560
with a different type of biscuit.

931
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,960
Yeah, it does look like Verbier.

932
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,200
I'll give you that.

933
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,720
SUE: Oh, I thought it was more of a Courchevel(!)

934
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,280
As soon as you bite into it - beautifully crisp.

935
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,480
The coffee hits you, not too strong.

936
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,360
Now, I'm into the mulled wine.

937
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,640
- She'll be on that for a long time. 
- SUE: Surprise, surprise.

938
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,440
It's ingenious. I love the idea,

939
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,640
to get the flavours in your biscuits as well.

940
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,400
Creativity is superb. Well thought through, Martha.

941
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,320
- Well done, Martha.
- Thank you.

942
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,480
Paul and Mary will now decide who will be crowned

943
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,440
this week's Star Baker and who will be going home.

944
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,320
So, Paul and Mary,

945
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,240
after the Showstopper it seems that there are various people who

946
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,400
were doing quite badly, now suddenly seem to have risen from the ashes.

947
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,040
I think Iain has, sort of, phoenixed himself.

948
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,320
Considering where he was - he was last in the technical.

949
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,240
I think he has really pulled it out the bag.

950
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,760
And then Diana with her train.

951
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,240
She made the engine, didn't she?

952
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,280
Baked the water cooler for the engine. And that's very clever.

953
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,920
Jordan as well.

954
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,760
Bit messy, you said, but the taste of both biscuits...

955
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,760
Those biscuits were some of the best out there.

956
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,680
I think the stars today in the Showstopper - for me, anyway -

957
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,040
- were Luis...
- Yeah.
- and Richard.

958
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,080
- They were so original.
- Yeah.

959
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:59,800
Those two guys, with the flavours and the design - unbelievable.

960
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,320
Who are the people that have slipped down to the bottom?

961
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,880
- I would say Norman...
- Norman.

962
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,760
And I would say Enwezor as well.

963
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,360
Norman - his biscuits on the first challenge,

964
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,000
they were absolutely superb.

965
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,720
Today, we got almost a repeat of those biscuits.

966
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,200
I would have liked to have seen something different.

967
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,200
And what shocked me with Enwezor's design

968
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,080
is that it was just a stack of biscuits.

969
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,560
He used a bought sugar paste.

970
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,280
If he'd made that, I would've been a little bit more impressed.

971
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,040
But worse than that, the biscuit itself, you could bend.

972
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,280
So do you know who you'd like to give the title of Star Baker to this week?

973
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,000
- I do.
- I do, yeah.

974
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,680
Do you know who we're going to be saying goodbye to this week?

975
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,200
I think Mary and I need to have another chat alone

976
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,280
together about that, because it is tight. Very tight.

977
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,200
Bakers, I've got the joyful task this week

978
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,160
of telling you who is Star Baker.

979
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,880
Quite simply, if they were to phone me and ask me to sail away

980
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:14,080
in their gingerbread boat, I would go to the secret peanut island.

981
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,520
Richard, you are Star Baker. Well done.

982
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,840
APPLAUSE

983
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,360
I have the horrid job.

984
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,840
And I have to tell you, this week it was so close.

985
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,920
It's taken an awful lot of deliberation.

986
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,520
The person, very sadly, who's leaving us today...

987
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,280
- ..is Enwezor.
- (Oh!)

988
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,520
I'm so sorry, I'm going to have to come

989
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,680
and give you just a giant, slightly porky Susan hug.

990
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,160
- It's a Mel-Sue sandwich. 
- In you come.

991
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,680
It is a bit of a shock.

992
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,560
But what an experience, you know?

993
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,840
I would love to have stayed on a bit longer.

994
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,240
But that's the way it goes.

995
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,040
- Well done. Your family will be very proud.
- Thank you.

996
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:08,000
I can't feel any shame about, or disappointment about going out now,

997
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,320
when I've given it everything I had.

998
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,760
When it came to Enwezor's tower, all we saw was one biscuit

999
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,320
and sadly that one biscuit was not baked well.

1000
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,400
It's unfortunate to see Enwezor go, because there was some style there.

1001
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,040
You don't get inside that tent unless you are a good baker,

1002
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,080
and he is a very good baker.

1003
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:32,840
- Norman. Bit more next week. 
- Oh, yes. Absolutely.

1004
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,640
'I'm a very simple baker.'

1005
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,200
I did speak to Paul, and he says,

1006
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,200
"You're going to have to raise your game".

1007
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,520
'He may well be surprised next week.'

1008
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,000
Well done you, though. Well done.

1009
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,720
Oh, I can't believe it, Star Baker is fantastic.

1010
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,240
It's not something I ever thought I'd get.

1011
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,760
I can't wait to tell the kids. I can't wait to tell my wife.

1012
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,000
She'll go ultrasonic on the phone when I speak to her.

1013
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,800
Oh! Gee whiz. Is it going to be like that every week?

1014
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,920
Next time - the bakers get a work-out in Bread Week.

1015
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,160
I have big muscles, Mary. Look at that.

1016
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,240
Who will get Paul's seal of approval?

1017
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,360
Pure alchemy.

1018
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,520
And who will survive the pressure?

1019
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,160
I've got to keep in the zone.

1020
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,080
