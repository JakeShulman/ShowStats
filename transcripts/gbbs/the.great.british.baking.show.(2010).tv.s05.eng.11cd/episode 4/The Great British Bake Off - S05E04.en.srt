00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,240
It's week four of baking mayhem. We've had bread, cakes, biscuits.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,880
That tent is seriously hotting up.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,680
I think it's the friction from Mary's sateen bomber jacket.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,880
Welcome to the Great British Bake Off.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,760
'Last time, the bakers took on bread.'

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,080
- Rise!
- Oh, it's so stretchy!

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,320
- 'The remaining nine bakers...'
- Ooh!

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,160
'..had something to prove.'

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,720
My last chance to rise to the challenge.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,760
Perfect.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,160
Pure alchemy.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,800
'Luis's inventive creations won him the title of Star Baker...'

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,520
Thank you.

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,360
Nice idea, but unfortunately it's not been executed that well.

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,200
'..and Jordan became the third baker to leave the Bake Off tent.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,120
'Now the remaining bakers face the sauciest Signature Challenge yet.'

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,560
Oh, no, it's all bubbling!

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,760
Now that's what I call a sauce pudding!

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,760
'A Technical where precision is paramount.'

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,320
Don't make a mess.

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,560
It's so hot.

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,440
'And a Showstopper which leads to meltdown in the tent.'

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,000
- Argh!
- Freezer, freezer, freezer, please, freezer!

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,440
Argh!

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,720
I think that's sort of unacceptable.

26
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,080
'The nine bakers have three demanding challenges ahead.'

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,280
Morning, bakers and welcome to your just deserts...

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,520
It's dessert week!

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,240
And for your Signature Bake,

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,320
Paul and Mary would very much like you to make a self-saucing pudding!

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,320
- Oh!
- Oh!
- BOTH: Self-saucing!

32
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,760
I'd never heard of it,

33
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,920
but apparently it's a pud that produces its own moisture.

34
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,280
The judges would like you, please, to make eight individually portioned

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,640
self-saucing puds, and you can decorate them in any way you choose.

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,760
You can use any flavours that you choose,

37
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,320
but they must be... BOTH: Self-saucing!

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,440
So, bakers, you've got two hours on the clock today, on your marks...

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,720
Get set...

40
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,000
BOTH: Bake!

41
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,400
'The key thing is, when making one of these puddings,'

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,720
is keep your sponge nice and light,

43
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,760
something that'll bake in very, very quick time.

44
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,040
The sauce, they want to melt, but the outside you want to bake.

45
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,520
Timing is everything.

46
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,720
- MARY:
- 'They can make two sorts of puddings,

47
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,920
'a classic fondant or a sponge

48
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,160
'which creates its own sauce at the bottom.'

49
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,880
The sauce has got to be the right consistency,

50
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,320
and, for me, it's got to have some texture to it.

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,800
Puddings are definitely not my strongest area,

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,400
so I am fairly worried about the outcome of them.

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,480
I think because you're putting fluid with sponge, anything could happen.

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,440
'Most of the bakers are attempting

55
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,720
'the classic melt-in-the-middle fondant.'

56
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,720
In my house we love peanut butter, peanut butter in everything,

57
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,960
so I thought it'd be nice to put it in the fondant.

58
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,720
I'm going to try and get a peanut butter centre in the middle,

59
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,800
which, if it works, will be really cool.

60
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,680
Martha's peanut butter centre will be encased in a chocolate sponge

61
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,480
and decorated with caramelised peanuts.

62
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,480
- Good morning, Martha!
- Hello!

63
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,040
- How are you? 
- Very well, thank you.

64
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,960
How much of the filling is going to be soft in the middle?

65
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,520
A lot of the filling should be soft,

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,760
it should be liquid when you break into it.

67
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
And do they hold up once they come out?

68
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,680
- They have done so far.
- Good.

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,320
What's more stressful, Martha? This or doing your exams?

70
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,080
Last week's exams were OK, but next week's will be more stressful

71
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,560
cos I've got maths and chemistry.

72
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,320
So this is a bit of light relief for you.

73
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,520
- It's relaxing.
- Amazing! See you, Martha!
- Thank you!

74
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,400
This is the chocolate mix for the centre of my pudding.

75
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,520
This is the sauce, if you like.

76
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,440
And I'm mixing this one first

77
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,080
because I want this really quite well chilled,

78
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,680
so that when it goes into the centre of the pudding,

79
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,760
it's colder than the outside.

80
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,080
Nancy is planning an ambitious layered fondant

81
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,160
with chocolate and pistachio sponges surrounding the chocolate centre.

82
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,560
About how much runny sauce are you going to get in the middle?

83
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,320
My ideal is that when you cut into it, the green sponge is cooked

84
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,600
and all of the brown runs out.

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,960
I've had it once.

86
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,120
- Once?!
- Out of how many times, Nancy?

87
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,800
- Ten?
- Ten...

88
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
The thing is... OK, I won't say, but...

89
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
- Go on, say it. 
- No, no, no, it takes guts,

90
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,920
I like people that push the envelope a little bit...

91
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,960
I do do a fondant quite regularly

92
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,840
and I thought I need to up my game a bit.

93
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,520
No, good luck, I hope it comes out.

94
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,920
'The bakers need to allow enough time to chill their saucy centres,

95
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,920
'so that, in the oven, the middle stays molten

96
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,560
'while the sponge batter turns into a cake-like crust.'

97
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,480
I'm making chocolate puddings with a molten salted caramel middle.

98
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,760
HOPEFULLY molten. That's the idea.

99
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,800
So I'm just putting it in the freezer to set a bit.

100
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,960
Kate's chocolate and salted caramel fondants

101
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,840
will be topped with toasted almonds.

102
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,240
I need to get a wiggle on, I need to get a wiggle on.

103
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,800
It is ambitious in two hours, when timing isn't my forte.

104
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,880
It's just raspberries, and some sugar

105
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,440
and it's going to be the raspberry compote inside the fondant.

106
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,480
Iain's flavouring a dark chocolate sponge with lime

107
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,200
to encase the raspberry compote.

108
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,320
How are you getting the raspberry mixture in the centre?

109
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm going to pipe it in, so I've got the mould,

110
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,640
I'm going to put half the mixture in, the chocolate mixture,

111
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,240
and then pipe in, say, a teaspoon of it.

112
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,800
OK, I love lime and chocolate.

113
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,960
Are you going to finish it with anything?

114
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,440
Yeah, I'm going to paint some mint leaves with chocolate

115
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,960
and chill them and peel a leaf off

116
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,280
and stick the leaf in the top, with the raspberry.

117
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,640
OK, have you got time for that?

118
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,600
I don't know, I've given myself an hour to make the fondants.

119
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,080
All right.

120
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,840
- Good luck!
- MEL: Good luck, Iain!

121
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,240
'The filling has to be supported by the sponge.

122
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,520
'It needs to be light enough to bake quickly...'

123
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,920
Job's a good 'un.

124
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,080
'..but strong enough to encase the sauce.'

125
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,040
Good job I've got these big, broad shoulders, is it?

126
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,520
I love a bit of fondant, anything sticky and full of chocolate,

127
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,120
I'm all over it, I'm happy with that.

128
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,000
Richard's fondants have a cherry coulis centre

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,520
in a chocolate sponge,

130
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,360
served with chocolate coated cherries.

131
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,400
The family get stuck into these.

132
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,000
I think, after this week,

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,200
it's not so much of a family favourite any more,

134
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,600
just due to the volume they've had to eat.

135
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,360
But, yeah, we like them.

136
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,840
I've just finished poaching the pears,

137
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,520
so I'm just taking them out and then I keep the liquid

138
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,760
because that'll be the sauce for the puddings.

139
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,440
'While most of the bakers are making fondants,

140
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,880
'Chetna, Norman and Luis are trying a different technique.'

141
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,440
I'll be pouring the sauce on top of this next,

142
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,760
and, during the baking, the sponge inflates and goes above the sauce

143
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,880
and the sauce drops to the bottom and starts to soak into the sponge,

144
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,480
which gives you a moist, hopefully moist, sponge.

145
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,560
Luis is using the cinnamon and almond poaching syrup

146
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,840
to create a spicy sauce at the bottom of his poached pear puddings.

147
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,200
Luis, you're piping pears!

148
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,520
I am piping pears today.

149
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,960
Are you sort of insulating them?

150
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,640
They've got little party hats.

151
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,120
So they don't get sunburnt?

152
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,640
Just so they don't get radiation burn from aliens and...

153
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,760
It's a cross between a wizard and a dunce.

154
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,920
I think last week was overload of Indian flavours,

155
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,120
so everybody thought, "That's it, she can't do anything else."

156
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,840
So I'm glad to be here to show that I can do other flavours too.

157
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,320
Chetna's turned to summery British flavours for her puddings -

158
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,880
strawberry, raspberry and rhubarb - with caramel butterflies to decorate.

159
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,680
It just seems so simple, but it's actually not

160
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,600
because it's self-saucing so some of them, actually,

161
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,600
it'll become sponge if it's left too long,

162
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,320
and mine, the sponge will just soak all the pudding back in, so...

163
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,240
Very tricky, yeah.

164
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,840
I'm making a sauce from the water, butter and sugar

165
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,440
and a little drop of vanilla essence.

166
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,360
The judges last week thought I was just a bit plain and simple,

167
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,920
but maybe it's fairly simple but I'm hoping it'll be good.

168
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,840
Norman's adapted his mother's sticky toffee pudding recipe

169
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,280
to create treacle sauce at the bottom of the dish.

170
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,520
How much sauce are we expecting to see underneath?

171
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,320
Underneath? About 60ml.

172
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,400
ABOUT 60ml?! It could be 65, Norman, if I'm honest(!)

173
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,360
Well, yeah, if I'm feeling generous, you might get a wee bit extra.

174
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,600
Right. The key thing, with these sort of puddings,

175
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,480
is not to dry out the inside too much.

176
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,920
- Oh, yes, aye.
- Good luck, Norman. 
- Good luck, Norman.
- Thanks.

177
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,400
'The only baker doing a traditional surprise pudding is Diana

178
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,080
'who's mixing all her ingredients together.'

179
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,480
It's looking OK! So far, so good.

180
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,280
'She's incorporating her orange and lemon sauce into the sponge batter.'

181
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,560
It's Diana's take on the classic lemon surprise pudding.

182
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,720
In the oven, the syrup should drop to the bottom

183
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,200
to create a citrus curd.

184
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,600
Being on Bake Off is a culmination of a lifetime baking.

185
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,720
It'll be the biggest thing I've ever done

186
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,600
apart from, you know, giving birth and all those...weird things.

187
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,320
'Next, all the bakers

188
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,240
'have to combine the sauce with the sponge batter.

189
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,800
'The five fondant bakers put their chilled centres

190
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,600
'in the middle of the mix...'

191
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,800
That's so good it's wrong.

192
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,480
I've got my green mixture then I've put chocolate sauce

193
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,160
and then I'm topping them up so that each pudding is identical.

194
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,920
'..while the other bakers trickle their sauce over the sponge.'

195
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,440
It's best poured over the back of a spoon, it spreads it out evenly.

196
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,320
It's a little bit more in that one.

197
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,920
Bakers, you've got half an hour left.

198
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,280
They're going in!

199
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,480
My god!

200
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,720
Now is the vital part, the baking.

201
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,160
And the sauce.

202
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,240
That's all!

203
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,800
I'm always suspicious of people

204
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,200
who turn their noses up at dessert menus.

205
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm sure the marvellous people of Paignton would entirely agree.

206
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,080
Paignton has a reputation for its beaches, but also for its puddings.

207
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,920
Since the 13th century, they've had a tradition

208
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,040
of making enormous puddings for special occasions.

209
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,640
When the railway came to Paignton in 1859,

210
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,680
they wanted to mark the occasion,

211
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,960
and they thought they would make a huge pudding.

212
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,840
They did it in sections so it was like a pyramid.

213
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,840
How heavy was the pyramidal pudding of 1859?

214
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,560
That was one and a half tonnes.

215
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Big cake, big mixer, let's go.

216
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,560
Sort of bottomless pit of ingredients, isn't it?

217
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,720
So I'm going to mix this together now.

218
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,080
When I look at the ingredients, it's saying to me,

219
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,720
"Massive spotted dick."

220
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,440
I mean, essentially, that's what you've got.

221
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,520
Yes, it's a traditional syrup pudding.

222
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,600
But done on the most grand of scales.

223
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,080
OK, now, you're telling me this is a TENTH of the size?

224
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,760
It is, yes.

225
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,080
I wouldn't know where to begin with that.

226
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,120
'This beast of a pudding was brought out to a huge crowd

227
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,360
'of eager townsfolk, all wanting a slice of the action.'

228
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,560
Describe the scene.

229
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,000
If you imagine this hot August day and an expectant crowd here,

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,960
waiting for the pudding, but washed down with local cider.

231
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,760
Did it turn out to be a civilised affair?

232
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,560
- I'm afraid not.
- You surprise me!

233
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,160
The crowd became so excited and so keen, really,

234
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,680
to get their share of pudding, at the ensuing riot...

235
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,560
- There was a riot?!
- A riot, yes.

236
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,280
I've elbowed a few people for puddings,

237
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,000
but I wouldn't have gone into full riot, I don't think.

238
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
- I think 18,000 people...
- 18,000! 
- ..on the green...

239
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,200
My local football team doesn't get that many people supporting it!

240
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,440
A feast like this was a great treat, it was a great occasion,

241
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,760
the highlight being this wonderful pudding with raisins and lemons

242
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,640
and nutmeg and sugar

243
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,160
and all sorts of ingredients they wouldn't have had.

244
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,400
- So, shall we see? 
- The proof of the pudding.

245
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,440
Do you know what, I don't know if I'd fully riot for it,

246
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,160
- but I'd certainly skirmish a little. 
- I think I would, too.

247
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,040
Oh, no! It's all bubbling!

248
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,760
'If the bakers leave their puds in the oven a fraction too long

249
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,800
- 'the sponge will be tough...'
- Oh, no!
- '..and the sauce could solidify.

250
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,240
That's not good. That is really annoying.

251
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,040
'Not long enough and the batter won't be baked.'

252
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,080
Bakers, ten minutes left on your self-saucing, ooh!

253
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,720
It has a nasty habit of disappearing, the sauce,

254
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,160
so time will tell.

255
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,280
I like them, they probably won't be fancy enough for the judges,

256
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,480
but there we go.

257
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,320
They're still a bit wobbly, but it's got a thin crust,

258
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,960
which means that when I turn them out,

259
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,200
fingers crossed, they won't just collapse.

260
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,840
That's a bad one.

261
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,200
I've got some leakers.

262
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,720
Come on, you, out you come.

263
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,760
Perfection.

264
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,320
Oh, no!

265
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,320
That looks like my face before they get to work with the foundation.

266
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,840
Garnish and move on.

267
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,000
OK, bakers, just two minutes!

268
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,840
Ah... Stay!

269
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,160
Fingers crossed there will be lemon and orange curd in the bottom.

270
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,840
Bakers, the saucing must stop.

271
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,520
Step away from your sauce.

272
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,800
Phew!

273
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,240
Urgh...

274
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,160
Drop through, lovely.

275
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,960
Cock-a-leekie!

276
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,920
Now that's what I call a sauced pudding.

277
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,800
I can't wait to try this.

278
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,040
It is very, very chocolaty, I think it's really, really good.

279
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,960
It's well balanced, the whole thing together, it's very complicated.

280
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,880
But exceptionally baked.

281
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,920
Thank you!

282
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
It's a beautiful sponge.

283
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,800
I would like a little more sauce.

284
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,200
The look of it is fantastic, the flavours are DELICIOUS,

285
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,840
but definitely more sauce.

286
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,920
More sauce, OK.

287
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,200
Oh, dear!

288
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,480
In your favour, there looks a lot of sauce,

289
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,600
and this has got to be a saucy pudding.

290
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,360
- PAUL SNIGGERS 
- Em...

291
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,720
It's welding my mouth shut,

292
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,600
the peanuts in there need diluting down a little bit...

293
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,840
- OK.
- ..because it's so dry.

294
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,000
Maybe just a little bit less of the peanut,

295
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,240
but such a beautiful light sponge round the outside.

296
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,280
- So we're expecting... 
- Sauce at the bottom.

297
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,520
- A sort of... Yes, a subterranean river, is that it?
- Yes.

298
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,360
We have got sauce at the bottom, there it is.

299
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,600
It's more a sort of poaching liquid you've got there.

300
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,760
Poaching liquid, yeah.

301
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,400
- I think the sponge is very, very claggy.
- OK.

302
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,520
Eating that sponge on its own is not very enjoyable,

303
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,280
- especially with that almost wet liquid just sitting on it.
- Sure.

304
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,920
Deep breath, deep breath.

305
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,600
Oh, gosh! Can I look the other way?

306
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
- We have asked for a sauce.
- Yeah.

307
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,760
It's a lovely soft middle, but it's not quite a sauce.

308
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,000
I think the flavour's exceptional. However...

309
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,440
for me, it's over-baked.

310
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,240
That outside sponge is dry.

311
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,120
They're very, very chocolaty

312
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,880
and I like the raspberry sauce in the middle.

313
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,520
Raspberry and chocolate go really well together,

314
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
it's a marriage made in heaven.

315
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,200
The consistency of it is very good as well.

316
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,800
They taste lovely.

317
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,440
They look great, I like the nuts on the outside, the chocolate.

318
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,560
I mean, the darkness, that richness of the colour

319
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,600
from the chocolate, I think it's a great idea.

320
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,640
It would have oozed.

321
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,480
- Ah, we can see that. 
- SO would have oozed!

322
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,080
It's nice and soft.

323
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,160
Yeah, I agree, I think the sauce is bang on.

324
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,640
The sponge itself is delicious.

325
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,240
Perfectly baked, well done.

326
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
It does look a little bit untidy,

327
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,120
but we've got a proper sauce underneath that tastes beautiful.

328
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,680
I think that was my aim.

329
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,200
I think the sauce is great,

330
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,280
I just don't think it looks very attractive.

331
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,360
I think that looks fun,

332
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,400
I love the presentation like this.

333
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Diana, the flavour of it is absolutely gorgeous,

334
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,320
the combination of the flavours is perfect

335
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,120
and, actually, I think that is beautiful.

336
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,080
A good pudding but not a saucy pudding.

337
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,120
- I think it's fine. 
- Oh, that's fantastic!

338
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,040
I tell you what, I shall walk out of here on air!

339
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,680
I'm just delighted. you never know with those puddings

340
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,160
what on earth's going to be inside, to be honest.

341
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,800
I think it's worked out quite well.

342
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,720
That is a result, that is a result

343
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,440
on a sunny, beautiful day in the Bake Off tent.

344
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,600
Couldn't be better.

345
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,160
I don't think they were dry. I mean, they were puddings

346
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,080
so you can eat them in two minutes anyway,

347
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,360
they don't get time to go dry.

348
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,280
It's not like it's a cake, so I don't agree with him.

349
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,840
I feel a bit gutted, really, they didn't go to plan,

350
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,560
but I try and be a tough cookie. Sometimes it's a bit hard

351
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,400
and the cookie has to crumble, but I've done my best.

352
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,720
Sticky toffee pudding's not meant to look beautiful,

353
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,440
it's a bit like some people -

354
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,120
they're nice looking on the outside but rotten in the middle,

355
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,960
and my puddings are the opposite of that.

356
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,640
They don't look much on the outside,

357
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,960
but absolutely delicious on the inside.

358
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,880
'The bakers now face the feared Technical Challenge.'

359
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,480
Bakers, I can see by your faces that you are raring to go!

360
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,520
Now, Mary and Paul, as you know, you're not allowed to see

361
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,240
- who bakes what for this challenge, so tatty-byes!
- Goodbye, goodbye.

362
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,240
Right, now they've gone, I'm delighted to tell you

363
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,200
that for today's Technical Challenge, we would like you to make

364
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,920
Mary's...

365
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,720
tiramisu cake, an adaptation of the classic.

366
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,160
Two and a half hours you've got

367
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,440
to make this marvellous, marvellous dessert.

368
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,160
- On your marks...
- Get set.

369
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,400
- BOTH:
- Bake!

370
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,920
'Mary and Paul want to test the bakers' precision

371
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,240
'and, to make it even harder, the instructions are minimal.'

372
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,560
I've never made this before, no. I couldn't even spell it.

373
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,680
Last time I did a test like this was going back to school,

374
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,560
but I've forgotten about that horrible time.

375
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,480
I think I'm the only person who's made it before in the whole room,

376
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,520
and I'm the youngest by far.

377
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,360
This is complicated!

378
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,960
Look at that, Mary!

379
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,760
It is quite tricky to make.

380
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,800
What I'm looking for is every layer to be soaked evenly

381
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:55,120
in the coffee and brandy, and even layers of the creamy mixture.

382
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,280
What you do notice immediately is that blend of the chocolate,

383
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,480
the mascarpone and the coffee

384
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,320
all coming together as one hit.

385
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,520
We certainly don't want one layer dry

386
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,800
because they haven't got the coffee evenly distributed.

387
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,640
The first stage of making the sponge I'm quite happy with,

388
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,000
so I'm going to just luxuriate

389
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,560
in knowing what I'm doing for a little bit.

390
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,280
I'm going to fold in the flour, which I've weighed out

391
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,280
and I'm going to sieve it over

392
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,880
when this is leaving a trail, I think.

393
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
That's what I've learnt at school!

394
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,840
'The flour should be sifted and folded gently into the mixture...'

395
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,760
Nice, holding its form...

396
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,800
'..which should create a smooth and silky batter.'

397
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,320
It's all lumpy, I sieved the flour and all.

398
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,400
A few spots of flour here and there, but you always get that.

399
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,240
Right.

400
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,120
In the oven.

401
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,320
I'm just trying to line it properly

402
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,320
so that, when it comes out, it comes out neatly.

403
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Some people have used paper, and some people have used clingfilm.

404
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,520
I think it's clingfilm...

405
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,640
..but I don't know.

406
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,120
Deep breaths!

407
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,720
The OCD's kicking in nicely, so things have to fit perfectly.

408
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,160
Having a design agency, everything you do has to be precise.

409
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,800
I think it is ready, but...

410
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,960
One minute off, I reckon.

411
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,960
I've got to slice that horizontally, it should be all right.

412
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,360
How the hell are you supposed to cut that horizontally?!

413
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,840
Really hard, this knife's really aggressive,

414
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,760
so, yeah, it's really difficult.

415
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,600
It hasn't risen enough.

416
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,320
I suspect I didn't whip up enough and get enough air into it,

417
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,800
so, yeah, bit disappointed with that.

418
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,640
Oh, dear, starting again.

419
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,720
I think the sponge is a bit flat.

420
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,760
IAIN INHALES SHARPLY

421
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,200
IAIN GROWLS

422
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,960
I'm going to have to do the sponge again.

423
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,640
So far, so good.

424
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,240
But don't make a mess.

425
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,920
Don't make a mess.

426
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,400
'The finely sliced sponges should be assembled

427
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,360
'in, er, neat layers?'

428
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,840
I am cobbling together my sponges, which isn't ideal.

429
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,040
Well, I think the important thing is four layers of sponge,

430
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,480
but if I try and hack that any more, I'm going to make a mess of it.

431
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,160
So I'm going to keep that as a layer and then this layer

432
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,800
is, em...remnants.

433
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,560
'The bakers must flavour the sponges with a coffee and brandy mixture,

434
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,600
'but the recipe doesn't say how much to use.'

435
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,600
I wouldn't do too much, you don't want to soak it completely,

436
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,360
you just want the flavour in it.

437
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,040
Might be some left for a wee nip, you never know.

438
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,560
I've divided this by four because there's four sponges,

439
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,080
so I know how much to soak into each one so you don't overdo it.

440
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,200
I'm using a brush to kind of get it more even over the whole thing,

441
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,520
cos otherwise I think one bit will be really soggy

442
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,600
and the rest of it won't have anything on it.

443
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,280
'A stiff layer of mascarpone between each sponge

444
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,240
'SHOULD stop the cake from collapsing.'

445
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,160
There's a lot of mascarpone.

446
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,480
- Luis!
- Hi, Mel. 
- What have you got here?

447
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,360
- LAUGHING:
- That's my diagram of cake.

448
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,120
Now, basically what you've done, Luis,

449
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,800
is you've done a sort of beehive and it just says,

450
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,360
"Sponge, cream, sponge, cream, sponge, cream, sponge, cream."

451
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,760
So, basically, if you were going to do that by eye,

452
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,920
you've done cream so you kind of know it's going to be sponge next...

453
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,320
It was helping me calculate

454
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,400
how many layers of sponge and cake there were.

455
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,520
I know, it's been a long day.

456
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,920
This is sponge number two, I'm going to have to make extra great effort

457
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,840
to cool it down to be able to chop it, but, yeah, looks prettier.

458
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,800
Come on, come on.

459
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,280
'While their tiramisu cakes are chilling,

460
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,440
'the bakers need to temper chocolate for decoration,

461
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,360
'but one vital piece of information is missing.

462
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,760
I can't remember exactly the temperature that it should be.

463
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,320
I know it has to go up to the 50s and come down to the 30s,

464
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,640
but I can't remember the exact temperature.

465
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,160
Something like...42 degrees or something?

466
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,440
'Just a few degrees out, the chocolate will lose its shine

467
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,440
'and be difficult to work with.'

468
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,240
I like giving a bit more height to the cake,

469
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,160
but it's a hot day so hopefully they won't melt in one second.

470
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,480
It looks a lot nicer, actually. Could have been a bit thicker,

471
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,680
but certainly better than the other disaster.

472
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,160
OK, bakers, 15 minutes, please, 15 minutes.

473
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:06,160
It's very slack, needs a lot more time in the fridge, really.

474
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,480
Urgh!

475
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,360
Hopefully, I have enough time.

476
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,880
I will remain hopeful until all hope is lost, I think.

477
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,040
Hmm!

478
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,280
My layers of mascarpone are uneven. They're going to notice that.

479
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,440
Done.

480
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,080
These are just melting as it's so hot in here today.

481
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,080
Just be very careful.

482
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,920
Bakers, I can hear the gentle pad of lady moccasins! Berry approaches!

483
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,240
One minute, just one minute!

484
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,640
One minute?!

485
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,000
I just want to get the chocolate on.

486
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,480
It looks OK, doesn't it?

487
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,720
I'm surprised at how good it looks, yeah. I've surprised myself, there.

488
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,520
Bakers, all tiramisu twiddling must now stop.

489
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,320
Voila! There you go.

490
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,600
Please move away from the bakes.

491
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,200
Iain, step away!

492
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,560
Nice, nice.

493
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,920
It's leaking.

494
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:52,200
So, we're looking for precision, even layers and finesse.

495
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,160
So, we'll start with this, then, Mary.

496
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,200
We've certainly got definite layers.

497
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,360
Good bit of tempering with the chocolate.

498
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,840
And I do realise that today is very warm,

499
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,760
so the fact that the chocolate is falling over a bit,

500
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,960
that's fine by me.

501
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,280
Lovely sharp edges to it and every sponge is evenly soaked.

502
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,720
There's a good distribution of flavour in there, as well.

503
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,320
The piping's interesting in this, they've tried to be clever

504
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,760
with the little bubble piping round the outside.

505
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,840
Because the sponge layers were just a little bit varied,

506
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,040
some of the coffee mixture has leaked out.

507
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,120
But the overall appearance is better,

508
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,800
though a little bit irregular, it's a neat-looking tiramisu.

509
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,600
They've gone a bit OTT with this,

510
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,800
haven't they, with the piping round the outside?

511
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,400
You can see where they've collapsed in the middle, as well.

512
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,000
The actual sponge itself, we haven't got a very good rise to that,

513
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,280
therefore it hasn't absorbed all the coffee mixture

514
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,200
and that is dripping down on the table in front of us.

515
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,800
Now, this one has got a very good rise,

516
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,200
however, we haven't got clear lines between each of the layers,

517
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,520
it's a little bit messy.

518
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,760
I never got any coffee in that one at all.

519
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,440
If it had been well soaked, it would have changed colour.

520
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,000
Interesting decoration on this one.

521
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,160
There is a little bit of definition in the lines, too, which is good.

522
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,360
Good chocolate work in two different designs.

523
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,920
Nice lines, nice layers, they're all equal.

524
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,040
OK, this one, it's not even with the sponge, is it,

525
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,200
the cream and the mascarpone?

526
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,520
It's a bit messy. Fairly thin sponge.

527
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,960
- Coffee's not strong enough.
- No.

528
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,680
Each layer should be evenly soaked with the coffee mixture.

529
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,320
That's a shame.

530
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,480
Now, this one's quite neat. I like the decoration, very classy.

531
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,120
The lines are quite stark, you can see all the sponge.

532
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,720
I can see chopped chocolate, which gives a lovely texture.

533
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,840
The mascarpone is nice and soft, nice flavour.

534
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,720
Nice flavour, yeah, it's a good, balanced flavour.

535
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,840
Nice bit of chocolate on the top.

536
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,720
The layers are very thick, aren't they?

537
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,440
Thick and thin all the way through.

538
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,360
The top layer there is not soaked at all.

539
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,560
Nice flavour, though.

540
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,920
Now, this one seems to be just mascarpone,

541
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,400
and the lines have been lost.

542
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,280
We're losing the coffee, the bottom layer there hasn't got any at all.

543
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,120
'The cakes will be ranked from worst to best.'

544
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,920
In ninth place...

545
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,720
I think, because the sponge was a bit thin, it all ran through.

546
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,240
In eighth place is this one.

547
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,200
Couldn't find the coffee, Norman, if I'm honest.

548
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,040
Very irregular on the cuts as well.

549
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,160
And in seventh place,

550
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,040
little bit messy and not very evenly soaked.

551
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,040
In sixth place is this one.

552
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,280
Very irregular, couldn't see much coffee in there.

553
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,080
'Richard is fifth, Nancy fourth

554
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,440
'and Chetna third.'

555
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,080
In second place is this one.

556
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,640
- Well done, Luis.
- Thank you.

557
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,720
That's a nice-looking tiramisu, the lines are all the way through.

558
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,240
- That is a great-tasting tiramisu, well done.
- Thank you.

559
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,800
And this is number one.

560
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,200
We were all about precision,

561
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,520
even layers and the flavour was perfect.

562
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,960
Well done!

563
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,360
- MARTHA:
- 'I am elated!'

564
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,200
I had no idea that was coming,

565
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,920
I even thought that it wasn't as good as everyone else's,

566
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,760
which is ridiculous, looking back,

567
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,880
because they really, really liked it.

568
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,880
'I couldn't believe it, when the judges were going through the count

569
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,360
'up to number one, it kind of got'

570
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,920
to five, then four, and I'm thinking, "Wow,"

571
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,880
so, yeah, I'm totally delighted.

572
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,360
I think I'm a home-baker

573
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,200
and I think it's showing up in certain places, yeah.

574
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,800
So maybe...maybe that's my downfall.

575
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,120
I came eighth today, which I suppose is one better

576
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,720
than coming last at ninth,

577
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,520
so it just makes me realise I've got to try a bit harder.

578
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,720
'A brand-new day in the Bake Off tent

579
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,200
'and, with the sun already blazing, the competition is heating up.'

580
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,960
Morning, bakers, and welcome to your Showstopper Challenge.

581
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,360
Now, Paul and Mary would like you to make something fabulously retro -

582
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,040
it's a baked Alaska.

583
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,920
We're talking sponge, frozen centre, meringue coat.

584
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,080
Weird.

585
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,240
Now, you've got four and a half hours

586
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,120
to create this baked Alaska, so on your marks...

587
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,000
Get set...bake!

588
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,280
And freeze.

589
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,520
Not... Not literally freeze. LAUGHTER

590
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,360
Four and a half hours making ice cream, my god!

591
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,240
I'm OK with today's task, it's a sponge base and ice cream,

592
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,720
so what can possibly go wrong?

593
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,120
There's many things that can go wrong in a baked Alaska.

594
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,640
The sponge texture has to be thought through.

595
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,120
There's joconde, there's Victoria, there's genoise,

596
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
but it's got to be baked perfectly.

597
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,000
Then you've got to think of the ice cream,

598
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,960
something that they can churn within the set time that we've given them.

599
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,400
Finally, the meringue.

600
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,760
I want to see decoration on that meringue, I want it to stand out.

601
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,680
There are a lot of elements to get right.

602
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,120
One thing wrong and it'll be total disaster.

603
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,280
This is the hottest day of the year so far

604
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,400
and they're going to have to keep their cool.

605
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,400
Love this weather, love the summer.

606
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,760
The trickiest bit today is how hot it is in here.

607
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,120
I think we need to get the ice creams

608
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,680
freezing as quickly as possible.

609
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,600
'The bakers are making ice cream from scratch

610
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,880
'by adding a range of flavours to a basic custard.'

611
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,280
How retro is this?!

612
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,800
In my teenage years this would have been quite popular,

613
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,480
which was an awful long time ago!

614
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,400
Diana's bravely attempting a swan-shaped Alaska

615
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,240
with raspberry ripple ice cream on a joconde sponge.

616
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,680
The thing is, if you play it too safe,

617
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,760
it doesn't really win many prizes, does it?

618
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,600
I wanted to keep it very simple and straightforward

619
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,880
for the first two or three episodes.

620
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,320
Now that I've got used to this atmosphere here,

621
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,440
I feel capable of upping my game a bit.

622
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,720
Norman needs to woo the judges with his surprise strawberry coulis

623
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,120
in the middle of his classic vanilla ice cream baked Alaska.

624
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,160
I haven't had...eaten a baked Alaska for a long time,

625
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,840
so I'm looking forward to having a bit of this one.

626
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,160
Martha, tell us all about your Alaska.

627
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,040
I'm making a key lime pie inspired baked Alaska.

628
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,600
Oh! Well done and you've won, goodbye!

629
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,640
Well, it'd be nice, wouldn't it?

630
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,000
MEL: Martha's twist on an old favourite

631
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,760
combines a biscuit base, genoise sponge, lime curd

632
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,480
and a coconut ice cream, all topped with meringue.

633
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,600
What sort of piping are you going to use for that?

634
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,000
I think I'm going to pipe roses onto it, or little swirls.

635
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,240
Yes, because it's not complicated enough as it is,

636
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,240
and you definitely need another element(!)

637
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,680
- You've got a lot to do, so I think we'll leave you.
- I know.

638
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,400
Good luck. Thank you, Martha.

639
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,160
I did learn ice-cream making from my mum.

640
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,560
She made loads of ice creams at home.

641
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,600
Chetna's baked Alaska layers mango and raspberry ice cream

642
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,880
on top of a coconut cake covered with piped meringue.

643
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,080
All these flavours, it just reminds me of home.

644
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,680
The sign of summer would be mangos.

645
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,640
And they would be, em... there the whole of summer.

646
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,200
I've got toasted black sesame seeds and honey.

647
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,480
I'm just making a paste, this is to flavour the ice cream.

648
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,720
It might not look very appetising,

649
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,920
but it makes a nice ice-cream flavour.

650
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,840
Always one for unusual flavours,

651
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,440
Iain's offsetting his black sesame seed ice cream

652
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,920
with a cocoa sponge and a French meringue.

653
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,640
- Hello, Iain!
- Hello, morning.

654
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,520
- How are you? That looks revolting! 
- It does.
- Can you tell us...?

655
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,600
Always start with the positive, Iain, that's a mantra of Paul!

656
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,120
- It's a mess, a disaster, it's revolting...
- Mushroom soup?

657
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,640
So, what have we got?

658
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,480
It's black sesame seed ice cream.

659
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,920
- Nice! OK.
- Yeah!

660
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,960
The 100%, sort of, cocoa sponge idea,

661
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,240
blended with that could be fascinating.

662
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,680
It doesn't look an exciting colour, but we'll see whether that flavour

663
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,360
will come through with the strong chocolate, we'll see.

664
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,080
- Thank you, Iain.
- Thank you.

665
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,840
I'm sure there's enough time,

666
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,880
it's just that we've got a really hot day

667
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,440
and the freezers are going to have to work really hard.

668
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,840
Nancy's ambitious summer pudding Alaska

669
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,080
has two ice creams, a vanilla parfait and an almond sponge,

670
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,520
all topped with a berry rippled meringue.

671
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,120
So, when we cut through it,

672
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,560
it'll be like a football jersey and three stripes?

673
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,720
I'm hoping it will be like a rainbow.

674
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,000
Are you doing it in different bowls, or what?

675
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,920
I actually figured that if I do three thin ice creams,

676
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,960
they would probably set better than trying to do one big one.

677
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,040
How high are we expecting this to be?

678
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,520
So a handy dessert for one.

679
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,640
LAUGHING: Yeah.

680
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,280
When I get my ice cream in the ice-cream maker,

681
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,800
I'll feel a lot happier.

682
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:30,240
I'm keeping fingers crossed that the ice cream will set.

683
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,000
And I am making a very kitsch Alaska

684
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,600
for my fellow Brightonians.

685
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,080
I'm camping it up.

686
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,840
Kate's glittering meringue tops her pistachio ice cream

687
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,480
and chocolate sponge.

688
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,360
Time's OK today, it's more about getting this ice cream made

689
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,560
so it's got a good three hours to set.

690
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,680
Ah, that's better!

691
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,920
The ice cream now has a lot more volume.

692
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,360
I just want to get it into the freezer and so it freezes solid.

693
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,360
Superb! Absolutely superb!

694
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,280
I could have been born in Italy!

695
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,720
Definitely ice cream, innit? Lovely.

696
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,440
Richard's making a baked Alaska version

697
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,720
of yesterday's Technical Challenge - tiramisu.

698
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,840
His coffee ice cream is layered with lady fingers

699
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,320
and plastered with a thick layer of meringue.

700
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,400
I do worry a little bit that tiramisu followed by tiramisu

701
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,080
might get a bit boring, but I think mine's different enough

702
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,240
to the one Mary did for it to not necessarily be compared.

703
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,080
Let's hope not anyway!

704
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,520
- So, this is the mango?
- Yes.

705
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,160
That is amazing!

706
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,240
If you keep providing things like that for us,

707
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,680
the love gets ever stronger.

708
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,160
I'm so glad you like it, I'm so, so glad!

709
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,680
Now, hopefully, this will set.

710
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,240
Yes, you go and set it.

711
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,280
I will, thank you.

712
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,800
Saw that!

713
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,280
'While the bakers leave their ice creams to, hopefully, set,

714
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,320
'they crack on with the next stage.'

715
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,240
OK, let's get on with said sponge.

716
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,440
I'm making the sponge at the moment,

717
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,280
and this here is the raw chocolate and that's the flavour for it.

718
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,040
The sponge is almost exactly the same as yesterday's,

719
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,200
except mine's got chocolate and vanilla in it

720
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,880
rather than just plain,

721
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,000
so hopefully that will add another element of flavour, you never know.

722
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I am making an almond bottom sponge.

723
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,840
Bakewell tarts are my favourite,

724
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,400
I love the flavours of anything to do with Bakewell,

725
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,120
so I thought it'd be a good translation into this Alaska.

726
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,040
Luis's inventive Alaska

727
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,120
layers raspberry, frozen yoghurt and apricot sorbet

728
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,840
on a frangipane sponge, decorated with cherry-topped meringue.

729
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,560
Everything's multi-tasking today, there's just so much going on.

730
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,800
You've kind of got the ice creams, the sorbet going on,

731
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,960
the sponge, so it's a bit frantic.

732
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,040
Sponge is done, stick it in the oven.

733
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,200
OK, you are halfway through this baked Alaska challenge,

734
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,240
two and a quarter hours remaining.

735
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,520
It's just like liquid. Is yours?

736
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,560
Good heavens!

737
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,880
Is it frozen, Norm?

738
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,920
It's frozen, but it's melting very quickly.

739
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,560
It's the waiting game

740
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,000
because there's very little time left that the ice cream's set.

741
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,040
It's been in half an hour!

742
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,600
Oh, mine has, yeah.

743
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,760
It's not frozen!

744
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,840
You're joking!

745
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,040
Good, good!

746
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,160
It's really good.

747
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,480
That beard, by the way, it's almost like an extra centimetre...

748
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,160
I want you to stay in this competition for so many reasons.

749
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,560
Not least because you will be

750
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,280
a russet Gandalf by the time we finish this.

751
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,240
- I'll see you later.
- Thank you.

752
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,440
'With just an hour left, the bakers start their meringue.

753
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,000
'Diana's the only baker making Swiss meringue.

754
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,200
'The eggs are cooked over a bain-marie,

755
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,120
'which makes the meringue firmer,

756
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,200
'ideal for constructing a swan.'

757
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,240
Bit like me, calm on top and paddling like billy-oh underneath.

758
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,400
Diana, you are pushing the boat out with the old swan, aren't you?

759
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,720
Yeah, I am.

760
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,280
Is it going to wilt?

761
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,360
- No.
- Good.

762
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,640
It must not be a dying swan, Diana.

763
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,560
Don't let it be a dying swan.

764
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,560
I'm making Italian meringue. I prefer this one

765
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,000
because you don't have to stick it in the oven to cook it.

766
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,680
This one cooks by pouring this very, very hot molten sugar into it.

767
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,600
A year ago I didn't know what an Italian meringue was.

768
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,840
I know now.

769
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,080
I can't wait to see Luis's meringue.

770
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,160
Two-mixers Luis! Two-mixers Luis.

771
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,800
This is multi-tasking!

772
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,600
Bakers, half an hour left on this bake. Half an hour left.

773
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,640
That was Melanie Giedroyc reporting for Baked Alaska News.

774
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,160
- 'With the clock ticking...'
- Voila!

775
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,840
'..and the temperature rising...'

776
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,200
It's so hot!

777
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,400
'..the bakers must assemble the sponge and the ice cream.'

778
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,400
The aim is to get the Alaska in the freezer as quickly as possible.

779
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,760
Oh, no!

780
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,800
Argh!

781
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,280
I'll have to work fast here now, it's pretty warm in here

782
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,000
and the ice cream's melting quickly.

783
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,680
The middle one has not set at all.

784
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,480
I think probably when they cut into it, that bit's going to collapse.

785
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,400
Unless some miracle happens.

786
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,080
I'm just going to bang it back in the freezer.

787
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,240
I need to go in the freezer. Freezer, freezer...

788
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,800
'It's 25 degrees...'

789
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,680
Can I put this in the freezer?

790
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,480
'..and the bakers need to keep their Alaskas cold

791
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,280
'while they get the meringues ready for piping.'

792
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,840
Who's is this?

793
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,240
Iain's, I think.

794
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,320
- LAUGHING:
- Argh!

795
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,160
I just need to get this on really quick.

796
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,600
OK, bakers, 15 minutes, please, 15 minutes.

797
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,280
IAIN: Where's my ice cream?

798
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,800
- It's here, sorry, Iain! We...
- Argh!

799
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,560
Well, you've got your own freezer, haven't you?

800
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,160
Someone's took it out the freezer, and this is all melted.

801
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,920
Why would you take ice cream out of the freezer?

802
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,200
What's wrong?

803
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,480
How's it looking?

804
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,360
- Look.
- It's soup.

805
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,520
The only reason why it's stayed there is

806
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,560
because I put the tin round to hold the caramel in.

807
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,800
IAIN EXHALES

808
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,600
IAIN GROANS

809
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,160
OK, all right, let's think about how we're going to present that.

810
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,640
That's not...

811
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,680
- I've got a serving suggestion. 
- Oi-ah! Oh!

812
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,120
No, no, no, no!

813
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,040
Iain, Iain, Iain... you have to...

814
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,280
Look at it, I can't present it!

815
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,160
He threw it in the bin!

816
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,400
- Iain had to throw his in the bin. 
- He didn't?!

817
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,520
Bakers, buckle up, you've got five minutes to go

818
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,120
on this baked Alaska ride.

819
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,920
Scream if you wanna go faster.

820
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,560
- CHETNA:
- My hands are shaking...

821
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,840
..because I'm in such a rush.

822
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,120
Well, they've just broken, they're broken.

823
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,880
And they didn't do that at home.

824
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,080
It'll be all right, it'll be all right.

825
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,520
Now it's all melting, the whole thing's melting.

826
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,200
'With time running out, there's only one finishing touch.'

827
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,560
You've got one minute left!

828
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,520
'The blowtorch.'

829
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,120
I can feel it melting with every inch more of blowtorching.

830
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,760
I'm having to work so quickly on this.

831
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,920
Ladies and gents of the baking fraternity,

832
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,200
we have arrived at our destination, Alaska.

833
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,080
I'm sorry the flight was a little bit...turbulent.

834
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,520
Iain, are you OK?

835
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,960
Yeah, I'm fine.

836
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,640
My fear is that the knife will go into that Alaska

837
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,320
and it will just be runny.

838
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,680
It looks so pretty, I can't wait to get in there.

839
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,000
I think the overall look is very professional,

840
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,680
the piping is excellent.

841
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,560
Very precise all the way around.

842
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,840
I can see the parfait, as well, right in the middle.

843
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,760
It's melted but it's still there.

844
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,040
It's a lovely summer fruit flavour.

845
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,120
The sponge, the jam, with the meringue, very professional

846
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,840
and in these conditions, exceptional.

847
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,840
The ice cream tastes absolutely delicious,

848
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,240
and the meringue, I think, turned out very well.

849
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,680
I can't think that they'll find anything wrong with what I've done.

850
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,720
I like the piping down the side, I think that's pretty, it's different.

851
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,720
I think I would have liked quite a few more strawberries.

852
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,600
The ice cream itself is a good ice cream,

853
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,640
but I could do with a little more vanilla.

854
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,560
The whole thing together... Break it down - the sponge is good,

855
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,960
the ice cream is good, the meringue is pretty good.

856
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,120
However, you're missing the point sometimes.

857
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,720
You're playing it so safe that actually you're beginning to fail.

858
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,760
Well, in the end I sort of resurrected my swan,

859
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,320
have a debacle of it breaking and...

860
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,560
That didn't do that at home, you know!

861
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,240
Isn't that a pain in the butt?!

862
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,600
I actually think it looks pretty good, actually.

863
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,520
- Impressive!
- Thank you.

864
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,640
I think it looks most exciting.

865
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,600
The sponge is delicious and the ice cream is quite delicate.

866
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,760
I think you should be very proud of yourself,

867
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,040
- you always come to us with your head down.
- Sorry.

868
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,720
You need to start holding your head a little further up.

869
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,960
- Like a swan would.
- Yes.
- Well done.

870
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,760
It had frozen, it looked lovely, I could actually manage

871
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,840
the piping work, but it didn't make it to the freezer.

872
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,440
And you've still got a smile on your face, which is what it's all about.

873
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,000
Well, you know... Yes.

874
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,680
I was worried about the mango and cardamom

875
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,320
but, actually, that's gorgeous.

876
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,840
The sponge is great as well.

877
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,600
The marriage of the flavours with the sponge

878
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,800
and the ice cream is absolutely lovely.

879
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,320
The fact that it looks a bit messy, I'd forget about that.

880
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,320
It just is stunning when you eat it.

881
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,640
Great piping, looks like little roses, looks very attractive.

882
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,280
The lime curd is sharp, it's a beautiful sponge.

883
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,320
Great interpretation of a classic key lime pie in a baked Alaska.

884
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,320
Gosh, when you look at that, we can only say, "Well done!"

885
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,360
The actual bake is good. Mmm, scrumptious!

886
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,920
The meringue is very, very good,

887
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,880
that marshmallowy feel which you always get

888
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,840
from the Italian meringue is fantastic.

889
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,720
The sponge is good and the raspberry flavour's excellent, as well.

890
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,400
My presentation could be nicer, obviously

891
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,760
no-one wants to get baked Alaska swimming in melted ice cream,

892
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,080
but hopefully it tastes like a tiramisu.

893
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,120
I like the way you've done all those swirls

894
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,320
all the way around the outside, looks very festive.

895
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,040
Those layers look good, the Italian meringue is nice and strong.

896
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,040
That's all right for me!

897
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,840
All aspects of that are excellent

898
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,360
because the flavour of the coffee ice cream is delicious,

899
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,880
the sponge is just softened slightly, as well, between.

900
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,880
It's almost like the Technical Challenge...but better!

901
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,440
Oh, thank you!

902
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,760
I think, overall, the design is very good,

903
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,680
I think the piping is excellent.

904
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,680
I can clearly see the layers

905
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,320
and I like the proportion of sponge to the ice cream.

906
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,600
The yoghurt and sorbet together work really well.

907
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,840
I like sharp flavours, it's almost cleansing, you know.

908
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,680
The almond sponge is very good. Well designed,

909
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,760
well thought through and well done!

910
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,880
Iain, if you'd like to bring your bake up, please.

911
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,360
'I threw it in the bin because I didn't want to present it.

912
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,400
'I didn't want them to judge the way it came out,

913
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,200
'so I'd rather present nothing.

914
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,400
'Gutted.'

915
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,440
Can you tell us about your baked Alaska, please?

916
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,560
I had some issues with the ice cream.

917
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:05,360
And I let the frustration of that get the better of me.

918
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,200
- OK. Did you have a problem with your sponge?
- No.

919
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,240
- Did you have a problem with your meringue?
- No.

920
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,320
- Did you have a problem with the ice cream?
- Yes.

921
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,640
So, where's your sponge? In there?

922
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,640
We could have tested that.

923
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,480
I know, I didn't cope with the situation very well.

924
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,720
I think you know that it got the better of you,

925
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,560
it was just a moment of your life

926
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,560
that you want to forget, is that right?

927
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,200
It is, I regret it.

928
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,800
Because we all make mistakes and we would have liked to see that sponge.

929
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,040
- Thanks, Iain. 
- MEL: Take your bin away.

930
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,840
IAIN: Sorry I didn't present anything.

931
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:45,520
I don't think we've ever seen this tent so intense.

932
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,440
They all had problems, but they all coped.

933
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,760
Well, except for one person.

934
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,680
Let's look at Star Baker.

935
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,280
Oh, I think Kate. She's done very well today.

936
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,560
She did drop it slightly in the Technical, down to seventh,

937
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,880
but her Signature Bake with the almonds round it

938
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,840
and the chocolate was very, very good.

939
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,360
What about Richard?

940
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,840
He's a good precision baker,

941
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,600
which you'd never expect that from a builder, but he's so delicate.

942
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,960
Luis didn't start off well, but he did extremely well

943
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,320
- in the next two challenges, didn't he?
- He did indeed.

944
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,440
Now, Norman.

945
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,840
I thought his baked Alaska was OK.

946
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,680
But, again, very safe and pretty boring, if I'm going to be honest.

947
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,480
The ice cream itself lacked flavour.

948
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,920
Now, somebody we haven't yet mentioned today is Iain.

949
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,880
He was sailing along quite nicely for one of the first weeks ever

950
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,720
and then this happened.

951
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,520
It's a very, very difficult position he's put us in.

952
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,720
I know he did it at the spur of the moment,

953
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,080
but I think that's sort of unacceptable.

954
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,400
So, now you've got a choice.

955
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,440
You've got two people who have put themselves in trouble -

956
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,400
by their bakes and then by their actions.

957
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,280
And you have to work out at the end of the day what's more important.

958
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,000
Well, bakers, I've got the happy task of announcing Star Baker.

959
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,240
Now, if you sliced this person across like a stick of rock,

960
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,480
you would see the words written "consistency" and "quality".

961
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,760
I'm extremely pleased to announce that the award for Star Baker

962
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,040
this week goes to...

963
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,880
..Richard, for the second time!

964
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,640
- Ooh, well done!
- Well done, Richard.

965
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,240
I get the less than pleasant job,

966
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,280
and it's never nice,

967
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,880
and this week it's particularly difficult

968
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,440
because we have to send someone home

969
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,200
who's an extremely good baker

970
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,200
who had a moment of madness.

971
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:46,840
Iain, with such a lot of sadness, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

972
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,160
Let me feel your beard, Iain, just for the last time.

973
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,000
Feel the beard. Touch the russet.

974
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,880
No, it is onwards and upwards from here.

975
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,160
I love to bake, but I just have to learn to deal with my frustrations

976
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,720
in the baking and I'll try and not throw as much in the bin.

977
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,080
Do you know, Iain is a remarkable baker.

978
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:09,280
What a sadness because if he doesn't present something for us to taste,

979
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,440
how can we let him stay?

980
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,760
It shows he had passion, he cares about his bakes,

981
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,880
that's why he erupted in the way he did.

982
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,440
But you can't do that.

983
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,080
- Well done, Richard.
- Cheers, Paul.

984
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,840
Star Baker was Richard, AGAIN!

985
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,480
This guy is becoming the one to beat.

986
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,400
I'm going to take Star Baker and run for the hills with it.

987
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,720
It's wicked to win it twice.

988
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,600
Makes you stand out, I suppose, doesn't it?

989
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,640
I was probably quite close to getting sent home,

990
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,000
so maybe I should put a wee bit of pressure on myself

991
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,200
and ask myself to produce the goods next week.

992
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:51,360
I'll try to walk tall. I won't promise, but I'll try.

993
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,480
Gutted, absolutely gutted.

994
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,200
I've learnt never to throw my bakes in the bin.

995
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,560
KATE LAUGHS

996
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:01,720
'Next time, it's pies and tarts...'

997
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,560
I've got it as thin as I dare.

998
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,960
Ooh, not making this look easy!

999
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,720
'..with a Signature to make even the steadiest hand tremble...'

1000
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,160
- Whoa...
- Well done, well done.

1001
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,280
'..a Technical which gets them in a twist...'

1002
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,360
Argh!

1003
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:19,240
'..and a Showstopper which takes pies to new heights.'

1004
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,000
Ooh, there it goes!

1005
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,280
Oh, my goodness! There is a plumbing issue here.
