1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Welcome back to Bake Off, where 12 bakers have become three.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,480
They have survived 27 challenges and have lived to tell the tale.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,600
Whereas we can't even get off this boat. Help us.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,720
BOTH: Welcome to the final of The Great British Bake Off.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,200
- Oh!
- Just pull it. 
- Oh, it's me rowlocks.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,560
'Thousands of people applied to take part in this year's Bake Off.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,320
'Just 12 were chosen to bare their baking souls

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,320
'at the gingham altar.'

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,080
- We know how to bake, don't we? 
- We do. The only thing we know!

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,640
'Some reached for the stars...'

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,080
Come on, Diane. High-five me.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,800
MARY: A sheer joy to look at.

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,360
That is absolutely fantastic.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,960
It's what I call a Showstopper.

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,680
'..others crashed to Earth.'

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,920
Everything's gone wrong.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,560
- 'There were burnouts...' 
- Absolutely no idea.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,200
'..there were meltdowns...'

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,760
No, no, no, no, you can't...

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,040
'There were triumphs, trials...'

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,520
- What's in that egg white? 
- Lavender.
- Lavender?!

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,120
'..and disasters...'

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,120
I don't know why I'm crying over cake.

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,480
'..along the way to last week's semifinal...'

25
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,840
Flippin' heck.

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,640
This is looking all right, isn't it? I'm quite happy with this one.

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,600
'..when it was Chetna, the queen of flavours,

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,960
'who didn't quite make it to the bitter end.'

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,440
It's one of the best experiences of my life.

30
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,520
'Now it's a final festival finale

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,160
'as friends and family gather to find out

32
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,040
'if Richard, Nancy or Luis

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,400
'will be crowned the winner of The Great British Bake Off.'

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,960
- It feels like home. 
- THEY CHUCKLE

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,880
Just three bakes remain for Nancy, Luis and Richard.

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,800
Richard's positivity and precision

37
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,680
have seen him break a Bake Off record.

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,240
He's been Star Baker an unprecedented five times.

39
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,200
How can you compete against somebody

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,280
that's had Star Baker that many times?

41
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,000
You know what I mean? He's just been on a complete roll.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,600
As the weeks have gone on, he's grown from strength to strength.

43
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,360
Nancy is the queen of consistency.

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,720
Since her Star Baker turn in cake week, her wealth of experience

45
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,680
and cool head have kept her near the top of the pack.

46
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,040
I don't think she's had a bad weekend

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,840
in the whole time we've been doing this.

48
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,560
When we're trying each other's bakes,

49
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,200
her bakes are the ones I go to, and that's the best compliment

50
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,320
I can pay her, because I love her baking.

51
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,240
Luis' ideas have seen him excel.

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,360
Despite winning Star Baker just once,

53
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,320
his imagination and artistry have produced some of

54
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,800
the most stunning bakes ever to grace the gingham.

55
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,560
The brief this week is bold, in your face, and that is Luis.

56
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,040
I think Luis's had his eye on the prize since week one.

57
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,080
HE EXHALES

58
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,680
Good morning, bakers.

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,840
It's the final! Congratulations for making it.

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,680
Now, for your last Signature Challenge,

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,520
Paul and Mary would very much... Hello.

62
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,200
..would very much like you to make Viennoiserie.

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,720
Now, these can include things like pains au chocolat,

64
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,400
Danish pastries, whatever you fancy.

65
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Paul and Mary would like you to make two different types

66
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,640
of Viennoiserie, please. You've got three-and-a-half hours.

67
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,600
- On your marks...
- Get set...

68
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,960
BOTH: Bake!

69
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,040
It does feel weird that this is the last Signature I'll ever do.

70
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,680
I just saw the Bake Off as a bit of a challenge, really,

71
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,440
but, crikey, you never think you're going to get here.

72
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,080
It's really weird that there's only three of us in the tent,

73
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,520
so I pretend that the tent's full and everybody's in here,

74
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,760
and they're all behind me.

75
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,800
It's all very well practising at home,

76
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,440
but you get here on the day of the final, the tension,

77
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,280
the worry, with the other two either side of you, the pressure's on.

78
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,160
Viennoiserie is something

79
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,760
that was part of my professional career for over 30 years,

80
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,440
and actually to master is extremely difficult.

81
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,840
If they're going to go for a pastry like a pain au chocolat

82
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,120
or a croissant, they've got to get the lamination,

83
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,400
they've got to get the flake.

84
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,320
If they're going to go for an enriched bread,

85
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,080
they've got to get the bounce inside that beautiful little roll.

86
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,440
- Morning.
- Good morning, Luis.

87
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,200
Tell us about your Viennoiserie.

88
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,600
I'm making chaussons, which are apple, walnut,

89
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,640
raisin and a sprinkling of Cheshire cheese.

90
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,880
- What's the other one?
- I'm doing a pain au...white chocolate.

91
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,240
I love that.

92
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,960
- FRENCH ACCENT:
- "Pain au..." 
- CASUAL ENGLISH:
- "..white chocolate!" 
- I can't do French!

93
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,600
- Chocolat blanc.
- Chocolate blanc.

94
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,520
Luis' chaussons will be shaped like mini pasties,

95
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,960
and his pains au...white chocolate will be filled

96
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,840
with fresh raspberries and cream cheese.

97
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,720
I'll put a block of white chocolate in there, do the first roll,

98
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,880
then I pipe a row of cream cheese, put a row of raspberries on

99
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,320
and do the second roll,

100
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
so you end up with two cores running through it.

101
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,480
So the raspberries are cooked within the dough? That sounds interesting.

102
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,800
- You've got to nail it. 
- OK, I'm going to try.

103
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,400
- Good luck.
- Good luck, Luis. 
- Great, thank you.

104
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,760
I let the machine do as much work as I can

105
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,000
because I just haven't got the power to pummel it around,

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,840
and then I just finish it off to make it look smooth.

107
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,120
- Morning, Nancy! 
- Morning, how are you?

108
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,960
- I'm your male judge.
- Yes.

109
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,440
Can you tell me about your Viennoiserie, please?

110
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm going to do an almond and raspberry croissant,

111
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,520
and I'm doing a lemon and apple kite.

112
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,120
It's a fairly classic Danish pastry, that one,

113
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,840
but it's the filling that's different.

114
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,720
The filling... I'm doing a frangipane disc at the bottom

115
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,080
and then very thinly sliced apple with the skin still on.

116
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,720
Bit like a Normandy apple tart in a Danish pastry.

117
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,400
Yes.

118
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,760
Nancy's apple-filled kites will be drizzled with lemon icing,

119
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,240
and her croissant will be flavoured with freeze-dried raspberry powder -

120
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,240
a new departure for Nancy.

121
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,640
Christmas time, because you make a batch of croissants,

122
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,680
there's no point making them other times, because they don't get eaten.

123
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,920
How do you have time at Christmas to make croissants?

124
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,120
Now I can do them in three-and-a-half hours, it's not a problem.

125
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,520
Unlike Luis and Nancy's Viennoiserie,

126
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,680
which can be formed with the same mixture,

127
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,840
Richard's require him to make two different doughs.

128
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,320
- MARY:
- What are you up to?

129
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,640
- I'm doing pains au laits. 
- MEL: What are pains au laits?

130
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,440
- Milk breads.
- Oh, pains au lait! FRENCH ACCENT: Pains au lait.

131
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,200
- Sorry, I speak French a bit London. 
- It's good.

132
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,000
They were the reason why I first wanted to get into baking as a kid.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,120
We used to have them on holiday in France.

134
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,440
They might be a bit simple for a final day

135
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,280
- but I really just wanted to do the thing that I love the most. 
- It's a Signature Bake.
- Exactly.

136
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,320
Richard's also making a laminated dough

137
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,800
to create pains au chocolat with candied pears.

138
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,000
His humble pains au lait will be sprinkled with pearl sugar.

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,600
This is very simple. Too simple, maybe.

140
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,160
We'll have to wait and see,

141
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,840
but it has to be absolute perfection.

142
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,240
- It's a dangerous thing to do in the final.
- Yeah.

143
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,880
You see, these men have got lots of muscles and things,

144
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,440
and they can pummel dough around,

145
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,960
so I think I should be given an extra half hour.

146
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,840
As all the finalists' doughs contain yeast,

147
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,880
they'll need to be kneaded well to build up the gluten.

148
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,080
In essence, I'm making a bread dough.

149
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,720
So, you can start to see through it when you pull it out,

150
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,320
and that's the gluten activated.

151
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,360
It's almost there. I mean, it feels nice and tight now.

152
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,040
Right, that's that done.

153
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,520
The doughs will then need plenty of proving time to develop the layers.

154
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,520
This needs to rise to the top of the bowl,

155
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,080
so I'm going to put it in the proving drawer for 20 minutes.

156
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,360
His dough proving, Luis can start to prepare the vital ingredient

157
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,360
of laminated pastry - butter.

158
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,360
Get all the frustration out on this today, I think.

159
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,960
I need to get it out to a rectangle so I can use it in the dough.

160
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,160
Luis and Nancy are folding in their cold butter

161
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,280
the traditional way, as a single sheet.

162
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,440
You want the dough slightly bigger than the butter

163
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,280
because you need to seal it in.

164
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,800
And then cut the butter...

165
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,440
That up there and then fold that over.

166
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,160
So, that's the start of lamination.

167
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,240
You've got dough, butter, dough, butter.

168
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,520
But to make his pains au chocolat, Richard thinks he's found a shortcut.

169
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,440
Normally, if you make this sort of pastry, you do it overnight,

170
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,120
but because we're limited for time,

171
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,000
I didn't think I'd be able to do it with frozen or really cold butter,

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
so I've creamed it instead, so I can move it about.

173
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,160
I think the idea that he's brushing butter on between each turn

174
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,200
and chilling it down could make it too bready for me.

175
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,560
Hopefully, I'll get away with it, and Paul will be over the moon.

176
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,080
Now I've got to do a series of turns

177
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,560
but they have to rest in between each one.

178
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,440
Bar Richard's pains au lait, it's all about the layers.

179
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,680
Realistically - final, Signature? They all have to be perfect.

180
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,920
I'm just giving it one last fold before I end up shaping it.

181
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,720
I'm just trying to make sure my layers don't lose their layeriness.

182
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,480
There, so that can sit now.

183
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,520
Normally, you'd leave it for 30 minutes between rollings,

184
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,120
so I'm just whacking mine in the freezer for ten minutes,

185
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,520
just to firm up the butter,

186
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,800
because you don't want melted butter oozing out the edge.

187
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,360
One hour remaining.

188
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,680
Cor, that is going down, innit?!

189
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,600
Pastry rested, Richard, Luis and Nancy can start to shape

190
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,960
and fill both batches of their Viennoiseries.

191
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,160
This is freeze-dried fruit powder.

192
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,040
Real fruit, it's far too wet. You couldn't work with it,

193
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,040
because if you have a wet filling around where a dough cooks,

194
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,560
it stays waxy.

195
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,880
It's not a good day to have a disaster, I don't think.

196
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,080
I must admit, pains au chocolat aren't my speciality,

197
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,160
but they don't look too bad, do they?

198
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,040
Not putting you off, am I?

199
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,480
No, not at all. You're trying to learn from me, aren't you?

200
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,960
Oh, yeah.

201
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,680
- Is this man bothering you?
- Yeah.

202
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,600
Right, Paul, we've told you,

203
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,320
there needs to be a metre between you and all the contestants.

204
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,200
Remember the legal ruling?

205
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,040
The tricky bit now is getting them to prove quickly.

206
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,560
They're actually very cold,

207
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,600
so I need them to get back up to temperature

208
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,080
and get the yeast working.

209
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,000
If the butter in their pastry melts, the lamination will be ruined,

210
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,760
so Luis and Nancy are proving theirs at room temperature.

211
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,800
They need about 25 minutes to cook,

212
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,960
so I'm just going to let them prove as long as I can

213
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,600
before I put them in the oven.

214
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,360
But for his pains au chocolat,

215
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,280
Richard is opting for the warming drawer.

216
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,480
We've had to find a way of laminating them in under a day.

217
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,960
While I'm sure that way exists, and Paul knows exactly what it is,

218
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,080
the rest of us have got to try our best.

219
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,800
Having committed to their proving method,

220
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,440
all Richard, Luis and Nancy can do is wait.

221
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,200
Baker finalists, you've got half an hour left on your Vienno...isariaez.

222
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,200
- SUE LAUGHS 
- Have you got Viennoisierrhea?

223
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,720
I've got some cream for it.

224
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,720
I'm just preparing my pains au lait.

225
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,680
They're getting egg washed, they're getting cut.

226
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,560
The cutting is a classic style, it gives it a bit of room to grow.

227
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,480
These could have done with a bit longer to prove.

228
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,080
Do or die.

229
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,120
They have risen quite well, they're nice and big.

230
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,960
I'll be just within time, I think. These don't take too long to cook.

231
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,400
OK, bakers, 15 minutes!

232
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,120
They look fine.

233
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
I'm not hugely happy that they were connected.

234
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,800
Can't change them now, though.

235
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,560
Some are cooking quicker than others,

236
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,240
so I'm going to start pulling them out as I think they're ready.

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,200
Why am I doing that?! It's ridiculous.

238
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,880
I think seconds do make a difference when you're doing these.

239
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,400
It doesn't take much to take them from nice and brown to horrible and black!

240
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,040
They won't win a beauty contest, will they?

241
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,480
Get hasty with your pastry! One minute, bakers, one minute!

242
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,880
Bakers, that's it. Your last ever Signature Bake's over.

243
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,920
Step away from those hot, melted, laminated treats!

244
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,560
They look beautifully uniform.

245
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,480
Some of them are baked more than others.

246
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,560
You have got some attempt at flake there,

247
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,040
but because of the weight of the raspberry,

248
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,440
it begins to soak down,

249
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
so you end up with a soggy bit there.

250
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,720
But...let's have a taste.

251
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,200
Raspberry and cream cheese, for me, inside that? No.

252
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,480
Really?

253
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,480
Because the cream cheese adds a chalkiness

254
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,240
- to an already dry pastry.
- OK.

255
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,200
- Right.
- Chaussons.

256
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,280
Like the look of these. Great bake.

257
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,960
Uniformity.

258
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,000
You've got a nice bit of flake going on there, as well.

259
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,600
You started with a circle and you folded it over,

260
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,040
you've therefore got a double layer to get more flakes.

261
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,880
I think your chausson works.

262
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,000
I like the flavour, the butteriness, the flake.

263
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,320
- That, for me, is a winner. 
- Brilliant.

264
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,440
- But that doesn't go for me at all. 
- OK.

265
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,560
Now, looking underneath - good bake.

266
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,080
You see where it's collapsed in there?

267
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,680
- That's to do with the proving. 
- Right.

268
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,920
You nearly got it, you nearly did.

269
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,040
It's a bit doughy in the middle,

270
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,640
but the raspberry is delicious.

271
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,200
Let's move on to the next one. They do look OK.

272
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,360
I think the pastry was a bit too thin.

273
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,480
They could have been a little bit thicker,

274
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,800
which would have made the ridges slightly higher,

275
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,400
but nevertheless, you can see good layers in there, as well.

276
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,680
Mmm!

277
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,360
Absolutely top marks for flavouring.

278
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,920
It's a beautiful flavour.

279
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,280
I'm not too worried about the size and the thinness of the pastry,

280
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,280
but it would be better with a few more layers.

281
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,000
- Yes, I take that. 
- Thank you, Nancy.
- Thank you.

282
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,400
Pains au lait. It's very basic.

283
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,320
I think the colour looks good,

284
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,080
however, when I see that, that annoys me.

285
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,120
They should not be touching. This isn't a batch bake.

286
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,320
A batch bake is when they're joined together.

287
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,720
That shouldn't be there.

288
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,640
I expected them to be absolutely perfect

289
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,840
and they're not.

290
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,920
Great bake, great texture.

291
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,000
That's a nice morning roll, that.

292
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,160
It's just that I'm upset about the joining.

293
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,920
- It shouldn't be like that. 
- Will you get over it, Paul?
- No.

294
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,640
- I don't... I won't get over it. 
- Now...

295
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,240
- did you put these in the proving drawer?
- I did, briefly.

296
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,800
Because you haven't left it to grow naturally,

297
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,320
and by rushing it in a prover, all the butter floods out,

298
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,320
- so what you've got now left is a buttery roll.
- Yeah.

299
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,360
Pear and chocolate go really well together.

300
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,360
- We're not getting the layers, though, are we?
- No.
- Shame.

301
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,040
Yeah, great feeling.

302
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,880
If you're getting some positive feedback in your Signature, job's a good 'un.

303
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,920
I was a bit disappointed that things were not perfect,

304
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,520
but, you know, I think they have to be ultra, ultra picky, as well,

305
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,320
because, you know, it's the final.

306
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,000
It's always disappointing when your bakes don't make the grade.

307
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,840
What can you do?

308
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,760
There are only two challenges left for Richard, Luis and Nancy

309
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,120
to prove they deserve to be crowned Bake Off Champion.

310
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,960
OK, bakers, welcome to your last ever Technical Challenge.

311
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,800
You three have got to be on it like a Jane Austen bonnet.

312
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,760
OK, judges, tutty-byes.

313
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,320
It's a really nice one. Good luck.

314
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,920
She says, with a grimace.

315
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,400
Now, over the last few Technicals,

316
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,960
we have seen you create more and more elaborate bakes.

317
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,960
This goes to a new level.

318
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,520
We'd like to see you master the basics.

319
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,000
So, Paul and Mary would like you to make

320
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,800
12 mini Victoria sandwiches, 12 mini tartes au citron

321
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,200
and 12 mini scones.

322
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,480
You better get a crack on, you've only got two hours!

323
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,520
- On your marks...
- Get set... 
- Bake!

324
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,000
- Nancy, have you seen the method? 
- Yeah.

325
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,440
The instructions are extremely comprehensive.

326
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,400
My method is three lines.

327
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,040
The first one is "make 12 Victoria sandwiches",

328
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,560
the second one is "make 12 tartes au citron",

329
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,200
and the other one says "make 12 scones".

330
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,760
This is the first time ever Paul and Mary

331
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,000
have asked for three different bakes in one Technical Challenge.

332
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,080
If I can keep my head on and keep to time, I should be all right.

333
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,120
A perfect pastry, a perfect sponge, a perfect scone,

334
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,600
all at the same time, in just two hours.

335
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,280
We've tested them on every single skill,

336
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,280
and we've gone more and more elaborate as we've gone on.

337
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,360
And all of a sudden, we've reverted back to bare basics.

338
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Exactly. These are classics.

339
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,040
They should know it like the back of their hand.

340
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,600
We've asked them to do 12 of each,

341
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,840
but the tricky thing is they've only got two hours to complete it.

342
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,760
And the result has to be sheer perfection, that's all.

343
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,280
Not much to ask.

344
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,320
It's a tough challenge in two hours to make all of those things,

345
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,640
so I'm just trying to figure out an order, more than anything.

346
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,560
I'm going to get my jam bubbling away early,

347
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,920
make my pastry for my tarts, that can rest.

348
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,480
Once I've done that, I'll work out how to do everything else

349
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,280
I'm going to make the pastry first

350
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,360
because then I can concentrate on other things,

351
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,680
because I'll know that the pastry's well underway.

352
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,480
I'm just rubbing in butter into flour

353
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,000
and then I can roll it out and get it into the tart cases.

354
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,880
You've got to keep pastry cold,

355
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,920
that's why I want it to rest for half an hour.

356
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,720
Cool that for ten minutes.

357
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,480
Right, I'm just going to make a start on the Victoria sponge.

358
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,280
Right, jam. I make all my own jam.

359
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,200
All my own marmalade, lemon curd, all that sort of thing.

360
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,080
- How are you?
- Jam's on.

361
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,760
Jam's on... Good. Is the order of things really important?

362
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,400
- Presumably, it is, isn't it?
- Yes.

363
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,800
Oh, it's just one panic after another, innit?

364
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,280
There is no hiding place on this one.

365
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,480
If you can't get the basics right,

366
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,800
then it'd probably raise a few questions.

367
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
I'm looking for a light sponge.

368
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,120
The worst that can happen here is that you get a curdling...

369
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,880
when the eggs start to go in,

370
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,040
so I'm putting a spoonful of flour in every time

371
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,640
and that stops that happening.

372
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,040
I'm just bashing my butter up at the moment

373
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,160
so that I can get the sugar mixed into it,

374
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,200
then I'll get the eggs mixed into that,

375
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,640
then I'll fold the flour in.

376
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,640
And that will be the basis for my Victoria sponges.

377
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,240
- I think I'm going to whack these in the oven.
- OK.

378
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,280
How long are these going to bake for, Nancy?

379
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,320
- I reckon these are going to need something like 16 minutes.
- OK.

380
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,880
Quite precise, Nancy, I like that.

381
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,600
60 minutes to go.

382
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,360
They need a few more minutes yet.

383
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,880
I need to start thinking about my pastry.

384
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,480
So, this is the pastry, which I'm just making next.

385
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,400
Just let them cool in there for a few minutes.

386
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,320
Yep. They're done.

387
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,320
I'm trying to make it as thin as possible.

388
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,160
Mary likes thin pastry.

389
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,280
I hate thick pastry.

390
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,960
And especially in a tart.

391
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,120
It's so hot in here, though.

392
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,240
The pastry's really, really thin and it's making it difficult.

393
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,240
You can just patch it up, but obviously it's not ideal.

394
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,680
I'm popping the rice in, giving it a bit of a press down.

395
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,400
I'll put them in for about ten minutes, I think.

396
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,480
They're only little, so they shouldn't take too long.

397
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,600
Right...

398
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,040
I'm going to start weighing my scone stuff out.

399
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,280
Right, scones...

400
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,640
Yep, I've done that wrong.

401
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,600
The recipe said two eggs,

402
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,640
so, like an idiot, I put two eggs in,

403
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,800
but one of the eggs is for painting egg on the top at the end.

404
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,600
I'm going to re-do it.

405
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,360
30 minutes! Well, you wanted it basic.

406
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,800
Yeah, it's basic, everything's basic.

407
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,000
- Have you started another one? 
- This is a new batch.

408
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,920
- What happened before? 
- I over-egged it.

409
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,000
You literally over-egged the pudding.

410
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,200
No, I'm not happy with that. It's too thin.

411
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,640
Better, a lot better.

412
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,840
I'm hoping my scones will rise.

413
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,880
I must admit, there have been times in my life where I've felt calmer.

414
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,560
Not great. They're just a bit overdone, I think,

415
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,800
but the paper was sticking, so I left them in a bit longer.

416
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,720
- Nightmare task, this one, isn't it? 
- You're on about 20 minutes now.

417
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,200
Oh, my God.

418
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,800
- It's holding up pretty well, though, that pastry, isn't it?
- Well...

419
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,160
Just keep patching.

420
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,600
Just keep patching, mate, it'll all be good.

421
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,040
Keep patching. What could go wrong? They're just tarts.

422
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,640
- There's a little bit of rice in there.
- Oh, God.

423
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,400
I got it.

424
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,240
OK, bakers, 15 minutes!

425
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,840
I've got loads to do and no time to do it.

426
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,760
What I've got on there is the filling for my lemon tarts,

427
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,720
which I'm just very gradually going to warm up.

428
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,280
I've boiled my cream before I put it in the egg mix,

429
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,040
just to warm things through a bit,

430
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,360
and then it won't need as long in the oven.

431
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,120
Tarte au citron's not something I've ever made

432
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,240
so the plan is to mix everything up, chuck it in the pastry cases

433
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,440
and whack it in the oven, hope for the best.

434
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,240
That might be the stupidest thing anyone's ever done,

435
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,120
but I shall see what happens.

436
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,560
I don't know how much to put in. I'm just pouring to the top.

437
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,520
Finalists, you've got ten minutes left.

438
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,400
Richard, how's it going?

439
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,360
It's a bit fraught at the moment.

440
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,000
- Liquid's just soaking straight in, I think.
- To the tarts?
- Yeah.

441
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,640
What a nightmare.

442
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,280
These are done, because, if I move them,

443
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,160
they're not wobbling anywhere.

444
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,720
The tartes au citron are a disaster.

445
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,320
I'm feeling like that's this weekend up the Swannee.

446
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
OK, bakers, five minutes!

447
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,160
I've got a nicely set jam, a bit too set,

448
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,440
but it's better than it running all over the place.

449
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,280
The jam could be thicker, but it'll taste like jam.

450
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,320
I'm feeling like I could have done better.

451
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,160
Time's up! Step away, please.

452
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,000
Step away, everybody away from their bakes.

453
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,920
Ooh-ooh-ooh. Well done!

454
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,560
Well, that was good.

455
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,560
Please bring your bakes up.

456
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,480
Pop them on the gingham altar behind the photo of yourself.

457
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,320
You know the drill by now.

458
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,440
Mary and Paul are looking for light, fluffy sponges,

459
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,160
well-risen scones and crispy, thin pastry

460
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,200
filled with a smooth custard.

461
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,560
SHE EXHALES

462
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,280
Right, start from the top with the scones.

463
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,080
They're very pale, no glaze.

464
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,160
- They are baked. 
- And the texture inside's all right.

465
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,440
So, we come to the Victoria sandwiches.

466
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,320
There's been some attempt at some piping work in there.

467
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,000
It's got a decent colour on the top, actually,

468
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,600
of the sponge, hasn't it?

469
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,800
I think the overall texture's all right, actually.

470
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,480
But when we look at the tartes au citron...

471
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,480
Um...

472
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,880
The pastry's on the thick side.

473
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,200
- It's been over-cooked.
- Patched up.

474
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,240
And then to finish it all off, there's no piping on it at all.

475
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,080
Let's look at these guys over here.

476
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,680
They're a lovely texture, and nicely baked underneath.

477
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,960
I think, possibly, they've been left in there a little bit too long.

478
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,120
They just feel a bit dry to me.

479
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,400
So we're on to the Victoria sponge.

480
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,640
Very nice colour, perfect bake all the way round.

481
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,440
We haven't got piped cream in these.

482
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,880
I think when you're trying to impress, you do pipe.

483
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,960
This is the final of The Great British Bake Off, Mary!

484
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,600
You pipe!

485
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,280
And then we come to the tarte au citron.

486
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,520
It's got a nice shine to it, that's what I always look out for.

487
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,600
They're very neat and the writing on it's pretty good.

488
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,880
Nice and sharp.

489
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,840
Yeah, they're not bad, them, they're not bad at all.

490
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,520
Now, actually, I quite like these scones.

491
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,800
They're good consistency, quite flat on the side, nice and soft inside.

492
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,080
Nice flavour. I think they're nice scones

493
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,840
They're good.

494
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,360
Then we come to the Victoria sandwiches.

495
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,160
Looking at these, the jam is too runny,

496
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,560
it is weeping into the bottom part of the sponge.

497
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,000
Right, move on to the tarte au...

498
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,240
I can't read that. "..colon?"

499
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,520
- Colon. Tarte au colon. 
- LAUGHTER

500
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,600
It's a new kind of French delicacy.

501
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,200
- Now, look at it. It's... 
- Scrambled egg.
- It's scrambled egg.

502
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,840
Wow.

503
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,560
They are totally over-baked,

504
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,880
and the mixture has curdled.

505
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,040
A sort of sweet scrambled egg, I'm afraid.

506
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,880
MEL: Mary and Paul will now rank the bakes for the last time.

507
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,240
I'm going to tell you who is in third place. Who did this?

508
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,400
Right.

509
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,920
The disaster, I'm afraid, were the tartes au citron.

510
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,720
In second place is this one.

511
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,320
Actually, your sponges weren't too bad,

512
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,560
- but your lemon tart... 
- I'm really embarrassed,

513
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,360
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm not even going to talk about them.
- No.

514
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,840
And in first place,

515
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,680
your piece de resistance was the tarte au citron.

516
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,000
- So, well done.
- Well done, Nancy.

517
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,680
Well done, Nance.

518
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,120
It feels great to come first on a Technical.

519
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,920
I feel set up for tomorrow.

520
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,680
I feel I could go in now and do it.

521
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,440
I think I was very lucky there.

522
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,720
I would have put me last, without a doubt.

523
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
I would love to have done better today.

524
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,160
It would have been brilliant.

525
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,200
I'm not going to beat myself up about it.

526
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,400
I'm just going to go in, eyes wide open,

527
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,280
crack on and do my best tomorrow.

528
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,200
It'd be nice to finish it off with something that I can stand by

529
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,000
and be proud of. I'd like that.

530
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,840
The festival finale is just a few hours away,

531
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,920
but before they can celebrate with friends and family,

532
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,920
Nancy, Luis and Richard must bake the ultimate Showstopper.

533
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,080
So, finally, the sun is shining,

534
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,600
and, behind you, we can see Glaston-Berry,

535
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,080
which we've assembled for family and friends.

536
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,360
I suppose breaking news today is Richard, I suppose.

537
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
He doesn't usually make mistakes,

538
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,920
but that tarte au citron was just overcooked.

539
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,640
How the mighty fall.

540
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,800
- MEL: Can he pull it back, though? 
- Any one of them could win still,

541
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,440
but it's more likely to be Nancy or Luis.

542
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,920
MARY: The great thing about Nancy is she has a wealth of knowledge

543
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,960
and she is consistent and she's calm.

544
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,640
MEL: But Luis' forte is his design and this is Showstopper,

545
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,200
surely he'll really come through with this?

546
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,720
It does play to his strengths, but this final stands on its own,

547
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,280
we don't look back.

548
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,080
Three guys are here because they deserve to be here,

549
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,760
and at the moment, the way it stands, Nancy and Luis,

550
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,240
one of those two guys could win.

551
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,640
Or Richard's got to do something magnificent.

552
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,720
Good morning, bakers, and welcome to your last ever challenge.

553
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,200
Now, for this rather marvellous occasion,

554
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,120
we want you to create something rather marvellous. A piece montee.

555
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,320
Now, this is a rather spectacular, enormous

556
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,000
and elaborate patisserie centrepiece.

557
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,880
It conventionally consists of cake, sugar work,

558
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,240
choux and petits fours, any kind you like.

559
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,040
Now, Paul and Mary would love you to construct this piece montee

560
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,480
into some kind of design.

561
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,480
It could be a design that means something to you. Richard, it could

562
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,680
be a building site. Nancy, it could be your beloved vegetable patch.

563
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,200
Luis, it could be the Hacienda nightclub from 1980s Manchester.

564
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,760
Make some noise!

565
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,720
It's got be spectacular and it's also got to taste increds.

566
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,680
You've got five hours. On your marks...

567
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,600
- Get set...
- Bake!

568
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,840
You don't get another go after today.

569
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,520
I'm trying not to think about the fact that it's a final

570
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,040
and you could win it at the moment.

571
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,280
This is the ultimate patisserie challenge.

572
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,600
We've deliberately chosen a Showstopper

573
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,400
because it is very, very tricky.

574
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,400
For the final, this is perfect.

575
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,480
I think of the ones that I've seen in 18th- and 19th-century pictures

576
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,320
and you'd have everything from palaces to Le Tour Eiffel.

577
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,240
They're vast and very intricate.

578
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,920
They've got to get it absolutely perfect,

579
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,200
utilising all the skills they've learnt over

580
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,160
the whole of Bake Off and bring in their characters,

581
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,400
bring in their strong flavours, this will be fantastic.

582
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,440
Do you know, week one now just seems so easy.

583
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,480
- Morning, Richard.
- Morning! 
- Piece montee.
- Piece montee.

584
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,360
- Who is Piers Monty? 
- What have you decided to do?

585
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,520
I come from a place called Mill Hill,

586
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,400
our village sign is a windmill, so I'm making a hill out of

587
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,360
an almond sponge with a raspberry jam, and I'm going to make the

588
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,760
base of my windmill out of a ginger sponge with a lemon and lime curd.

589
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,960
Then I'm making a croque-en-bouche on top of that

590
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,280
with an orange custard, drizzled in an elderflower liqueur,

591
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,880
white chocolate ganache.

592
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,400
Richard's Mill on the Hill will also feature an almond brittle stone wall

593
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,640
and sails. It's sponge hill will be covered

594
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,400
in iced green grass and meringue mushrooms.

595
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,320
How are you really feeling about it?

596
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,640
Nervous, it's the Showstopper, isn't it?

597
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,080
I had lots of ups and downs yesterday, mainly downs,

598
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,720
so I'd like to redeem myself today.

599
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,840
- Keep to your timetable. 
- I'll do my best.

600
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,960
- Good luck, mate.
- Cheers. 
- Bonne chance.

601
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,760
Richard caught the baking bug when he was just 14.

602
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,560
He became the fourth generation to join the family building business.

603
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,400
But before bricks and mortar, he was crafting something a lot sweeter.

604
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,560
Richard had a job in the local high street cake shop

605
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,920
before he'd left school, Saturday job.

606
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,400
I think they gave him the doughnuts to cook!

607
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,960
The building business and baking both require

608
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,120
a bit of determination, and that's what Richard's got.

609
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,200
Richard built his family home

610
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,520
for his wife, Sarah, and his two daughters.

611
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,040
Richard and I have been together for 13 years

612
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,120
and he is so modest and so humble.

613
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,400
Even though people are telling him every week that he's doing so well,

614
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,600
Richard never sees that in himself.

615
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,120
Everything Richard does makes me proud...

616
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,760
..and of all the things he's done, apart from being a really great dad,

617
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,200
this is by far the thing I'm proudest of.

618
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,360
I'm making the mix for my ginger sponge at the moment.

619
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,760
I am a ginger lover. I did marry one.

620
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:27,200
All three of the finalists have chosen to use sponge cake as the base for their construction.

621
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Because I need to get ahead time-wise, I'm doing

622
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,560
an all-in-one sponge. I'm just throwing it all in.

623
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,240
- Morning!
- Morning.
- So, how are you feeling about it today?

624
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,840
A bit excited. So excited I have flour everywhere but, anyway,

625
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,280
I'm sticking with the French theme.

626
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,640
- I've decided to do the Red Windmill. 
- The Moulin Rouge?
- Indeed.

627
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,560
And how are you incorporating all the elements?

628
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,440
I'm going to have a four-layer cake at the bottom,

629
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,760
then I've got my croque-en-bouche,

630
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,880
and then the body of the windmill will be a ginger and orange biscuit.

631
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,080
Nancy will also be making mini shortbread decorations

632
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,400
and she'll be using red-dyed caramel

633
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,120
to create the Moulin Rouge's iconic sails.

634
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,000
You've got to think burlesque and red and black...

635
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,560
- Paul thinks of nothing else. 
- ..and cancan. Sort of sinister.

636
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,080
Sinister? Ooh, very nice.

637
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,280
Good luck, Nancy. This is going to be quite a size. I think it's...

638
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,880
Do you know what? I think she CANCAN do it.

639
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,160
Nancy grew up in Hull and after raising a family,

640
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,080
in her forties she went to university

641
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,760
and gained a Masters degree in Business Admin.

642
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,480
She's been married to husband Tim for 20 years.

643
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,480
She's focused on whatever she does.

644
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,880
I mean, one time she was training dogs

645
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,920
and got as far as taking the dog to Crufts.

646
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,440
If she's determined to do something, she'll do it.

647
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,160
Throughout the Bake Off, Nancy's had the support

648
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,280
of her biggest baking fans, her eight grandchildren.

649
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,040
Excellent, Ed, in you go.

650
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,680
I think Granny in the Bake Off is good and a good baker.

651
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,200
She taught me how to bake cakes and buns and lemon cake.

652
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,240
It's good that Granny's in the final and I wish she wins.

653
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,920
So I've practised it twice to try and get on top of it. I think

654
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,840
I'm all right with all the component parts. My issue is time.

655
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,960
I've got two batches of cake to do

656
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,640
so I'll get one done and get it in the oven quickly.

657
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,160
In you go.

658
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,760
With multiple elements and fillings to make,

659
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,320
any delay in getting the first sponges into the oven will make

660
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,280
the piece montee even harder to complete on time.

661
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,560
Mine's called The Village Where I Live.

662
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,840
So I come from a village called Poynton,

663
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,680
which is an old mining village.

664
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,760
The undercurrent theme of flavour is chocolate through everything.

665
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,480
So I'm doing a chocolate cake, a vanilla cake, which will then

666
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,160
be flavoured, the bottom one is going to be orange and almond.

667
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,440
- The next one will be chocolate and hazelnut.
- Works for me.

668
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,320
Luis' Village in Chocolate will also be decorated

669
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,600
with mini chouquettes and mint macarons.

670
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,680
To top it all will be an edible tribute to his home town of Poynton.

671
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,080
I'm doing a mining wheel out of biscuit, which will be out of the

672
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,280
top of the cake, and then there'll be a choux rope going over it.

673
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,120
- This will be interesting. It's all about timing.
- Yes, it is.

674
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,320
Five hours. Have you done this before - completely?

675
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,040
- Well, the last time I did it, I did it in two days so...
- Two days?!

676
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,640
Well, I'll tell you something,

677
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,720
I'm not coming back tomorrow so you'd better get it finished.

678
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,080
When he's not baking, Stockport-born Luis channels his creativity

679
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,560
into performing with his local ukulele club.

680
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,320
# ..Blow my blues away... #

681
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,200
But it's his work as a graphic designer that has helped him hone his skill for style.

682
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,320
Ever since I've known Luis, he's been creative.

683
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,680
We met at art college so he's always had a creative streak.

684
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,280
I think that's really helped him with his baking.

685
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,360
Luis can thank his Spanish parents,

686
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,160
who migrated to the UK in the '60s, for his early baking inspiration,

687
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,640
and his family have encouraged him ever since.

688
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,640
- Are you nervous, Luis?
- No.

689
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,560
We're nervous for you!

690
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,560
He's just really worked hard, and now he's at the final,

691
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,080
you just go, "Wow!"

692
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,600
So it's just... So proud.

693
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,440
I'm just making choux pastry now just to get different things done.

694
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,480
Choux buns are a vital component to any piece montee,

695
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,320
and are traditionally stacked to give the structure height.

696
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,600
You have to throw the flour in really quickly and then bring

697
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,760
it down to temperature slightly before you add the eggs.

698
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,760
I'm just cooking the flour for my choux.

699
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,720
I've put the choux pastry in the machine,

700
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,600
to cool it down to about 100 degrees before I put the eggs in,

701
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,640
- otherwise the eggs will cook. 
- Not quite ready yet.

702
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,400
You need to get the choux not too wet, not too dry.

703
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,560
You should be able to pick it up

704
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,080
and it should only just about start to drop off the spoon, like that.

705
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:47,080
I'm piping out my profiteroles so, as soon as that sponge is done,

706
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,880
they can get in and get inflated!

707
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,840
These will puff up in the oven - hopefully -

708
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,880
and then I can fill them with passion fruit cream.

709
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,360
I mean, they're normally bigger than this, but I chose to do small ones

710
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,360
because I didn't want them to dominate the windmill.

711
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,160
These are little choux balls

712
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,040
so they'll all interlink.

713
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,200
Better just look at these cakes.

714
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,280
That is one hell of a cake.

715
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,640
They're like tyres, aren't they?!

716
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,440
But not rubbery.

717
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,840
I'm making a ginger and orange biscuit,

718
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,920
got to make a building out of it.

719
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,240
I'm just making some chocolate biscuit, which I can then

720
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,520
make the centrepiece for the top of the piece montee.

721
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,760
Nancy, Richard and Luis have just two hours left

722
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,320
to complete their spectacular final Showstoppers.

723
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,680
Is anyone else in a silent panic, or is it just me?

724
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,440
Constant, constant... I wonder how long I'll be able to keep it up!

725
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,200
Just to add to the pressure,

726
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,280
outside, friends, family and a few familiar faces have gathered

727
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,320
for a very special Bake Off festival finale.

728
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,720
It feels so lovely to be back. I've been so lucky

729
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,440
because I only had to be away for one week,

730
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,520
I don't think I would have lasted staying away for more than that!

731
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,840
Ahhh, I'd love to be in that tent. I'd love to be as exhausted

732
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,080
and petrified and terrified as they are all feeling right now.

733
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,760
Who is it going to be? So close, this is a close one.

734
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,840
I think the people who got to the final definitely deserve it.

735
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,680
I think I'd put my money on Luis to win.

736
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,040
I would vote for Richard. I really hope he can go that last mile

737
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,400
and actually win it.

738
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,880
I'd like Nancy to win because she's a woman, so woman power, really.

739
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,600
I would really, really like Richard to win.

740
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,240
If I had to choose one to put a pound each-way bet on,

741
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,560
I'd definitely pick on Nancy.

742
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,040
This is the mix for my petits fours.

743
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,880
I quite like making macarons, but they did take a long time to try

744
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,920
and figure them out and I'm still not perfect at them.

745
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,800
I do like a nice pretty bit of baking. I do have daughters.

746
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,960
You've got to bake for the people you love, haven't you?

747
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,680
I can forget about that for an hour.

748
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,680
Tim made me this gadget

749
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,280
because I said I want to be able to mould my brandy snap

750
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,880
around something, and I said maybe a drainpipe or something like that.

751
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,800
I think it's a drainpipe.

752
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,560
Bakers, you've got an hour left on your final Showstopper Challenge.

753
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,840
Obviously baked my little petits fours biscuits,

754
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,720
but they spread a little bit in the oven, so I'm just re-cutting them.

755
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,800
I've got to ice the cakes, I've got some sugar work to do,

756
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,080
and I've got to make the central top structure.

757
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,320
I definitely gambled with time, definitely,

758
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,360
but...just got to keep going.

759
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,720
This is where I might lose my sponge.

760
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,120
I've got to make the sails for my windmill now.

761
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,960
To decorate their Showstoppers,

762
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,600
the finalists must display to Paul and Mary their skill at sugar work.

763
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,080
This is for my sails.

764
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,680
The mixture is just melted sugar with flaked almonds in it.

765
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,920
So hopefully, the almonds should give it a little bit of stability.

766
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,400
Just get the outlines, and then I'll fill them in.

767
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,160
I'm going to start building a croque-en-bouche soon.

768
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,880
Before this week, I have made zero croques-en-bouche in my life.

769
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,520
I made two this week.

770
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,880
Try these offcuts. This is Nancy's.

771
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,760
I've done it in component parts and timed those,

772
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,160
but that's not a bit the same as doing it like this.

773
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,680
- That's a lovely cream, isn't it? 
- Isn't it?

774
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,800
I'm trying to get as many finishing touches done as I can

775
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,440
before time runs out.

776
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,080
- That's our next course. 
- We'll leave those.

777
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,800
- Are those offcuts?
- Oh, yeah. 
- Are they?
- Pipe 'em and eat 'em.

778
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,680
Why aren't you using these, love?

779
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,520
- I always make extra so I can make enough...
- For us?

780
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,560
Just so you guys have got something to eat!

781
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,120
I've never filled one of these before. Do it.

782
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,120
Ready? Down in one?

783
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,960
- Cheers.
- One, two, three...

784
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,880
15 minutes left, bakers! On your last ever challenge, 15!

785
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,480
Mmm-mmm!

786
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,640
If I can get this in how I want it to,

787
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,320
I'll be happy, definitely. But flippin' heck!

788
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,400
This is the tricky bit,

789
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,400
and when I practised and put it up there,

790
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,360
the whole thing fell to bits.

791
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,120
OK, my love, the cake colliery is nearly complete.

792
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,480
Five minutes, bakers. Five minutes.

793
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,920
I think I'd rather have ten minutes.

794
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,960
Gosh...

795
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,560
I'll just get my sails.

796
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,120
One of my sails has fallen off.

797
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,840
My hands won't keep still because they're too nervous. Oops!

798
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,080
Not having it.

799
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,280
Finalists, time's up!

800
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,360
Well done, your Bake Off 2014 is over.

801
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,440
Step away from your bakes.

802
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,720
Richard, stop tinkering with that windmill!

803
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,440
HE SIGHS

804
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,880
Richard, please, could you bring your Showstopper up?

805
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,840
Interesting colours.

806
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,240
THEY LAUGH

807
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,960
I'm a man with small children.

808
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,360
Yeah, and I can see that appealing to them.

809
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,840
The height's there, I like the sails,

810
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,280
bit of moisture has got to that one, which is why it's bent.

811
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,400
I like the croque-en-bouche, particularly.

812
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,360
- It is pretty bright, it's fun. 
- I'll take "fun".
- Right.

813
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,640
The sponge looks good.

814
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,160
MEL: (Very good jam.)

815
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,600
I think the flavour of it is fantastic.

816
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,760
The almond coming through is lovely, the raspberry jam is nice and tart.

817
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,160
It's lovely. It is very, very good.

818
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,000
It's a lovely contrast to the layer below -

819
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,160
it's very spicy, it's moist.

820
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,000
- That's lovely, that. The ginger's lovely.
- Oh, yes!

821
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,800
But I think what we need to do now is check out one of the choux.

822
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,040
That's a first-class choux.

823
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,200
Lovely filling, and you've got so much in, they're so tiny,

824
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,280
and you've filled them cram-jam full and that's what I like.

825
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,560
The...

826
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,880
..brittle is very good.

827
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,520
Your component parts are all very, very good.

828
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,680
- Thank you very much, Richard, well done.
- MEL: Well done, Richard.

829
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,600
Nancy, CANCAN you bring that up, please?

830
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,320
Looking at it, I think you should be very proud of that.

831
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,840
The skill with which you've done the brandy snap at the top,

832
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,040
the piping, and the windmill even moves round.

833
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,200
I think we should try one of those biscuits first, shouldn't we?

834
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,280
- I'd like to have seen them a bit neater, if I'm honest.
- So would I.

835
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,880
I think they're a bit rough round the edges, you know?

836
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,960
That's a first-rate shortbread biscuit.

837
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,240
What I think we'll do is we'll cut into the base sponge

838
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,880
and have a look at this.

839
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,120
What I like to see is that you've got the layers -

840
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,200
those three fillings are in proportion.

841
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,480
Flavours are good - it reminds me of a birthday cake I had

842
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,120
when I was a kid, actually.

843
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,080
It's beautiful - very, very good, very, very light.

844
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,640
Let's have a look at some of these profiteroles, shall we?

845
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,120
Mmm!

846
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,240
Passion fruit is one of the flavours that I really enjoy -

847
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,440
it's very intense and it's slightly sharp,

848
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,680
which is good, because you get the caramel on the outside,

849
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,040
which is very sweet.

850
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,520
You probably could've done with the profiteroles being slightly bigger.

851
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,200
Now...

852
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,320
MEL AND MARY GROAN

853
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,560
- We could just break a little off... - Don't break the house!

854
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,520
- It's nice, that's a good biscuit! 
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

855
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,720
Cheers, Nancy, thank you very much.

856
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,680
Luis - mine, all mine. Come on.

857
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,200
MARY: I think, when you look at that, it doesn't half draw your eye to it

858
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,560
and it does show us a lot of skills, and you're so good on design.

859
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,080
I like the wheel,

860
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,480
I love the way you've done the chain with the profiteroles, very clever.

861
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,400
That is gorgeous, it really is a piece of art.

862
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,760
Now if we start with your petits fours,

863
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,000
- which I take it is a macaron, yeah? 
- Yes.
- Let's take one of these.

864
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,760
Often, when you start adding the flavour of mint and peppermint,

865
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,960
it's too strong - that's just perfect.

866
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,040
Let's try one of these chouquettes.

867
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,600
I like the idea with the chocolate on the top.

868
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,000
Mmm - cute.

869
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,760
Right...sponge.

870
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,600
Striking.

871
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,440
The chocolate one is just a little bit dry.

872
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,200
- The Italian buttercream, I think it needs more flavour.
- OK.

873
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,200
All right, let's try the top one.

874
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,400
I think the flavour of the chocolate one is lighter,

875
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,440
I like the hazelnut as well, I think that works.

876
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,120
But I do like the top layer of sponges,

877
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,640
I think they're much, much better.

878
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,840
Now, moving on to the top -

879
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,040
- I'm tempted to try a bit of the biscuit...
- Go for it.

880
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,040
But I'm petrified about it all coming down.

881
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,440
It won't, it won't come down.

882
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,360
The miners have been through enough, Paul. Don't break their wheel.

883
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:13,920
MARY: But your skill in the piping and presentation of that

884
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,360
- is very, very good indeed. 
- Thank you.

885
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,680
- Beautiful chocolate biscuit. 
- Mmm! Crisp, lovely.

886
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,760
- Full of flavour - well done. 
- Thank you.

887
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,920
- You've done well, thank you very much.
- No problem.

888
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,600
Thank you very much, I appreciate that.

889
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,120
CROWD CHEERS AND APPLAUDS

890
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,640
Whilst Richard, Luis and Nancy join their friends and family...

891
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,600
..Mary and Paul have one final decision to make.

892
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,240
It's been a very fraught Showstopper with some extraordinary results.

893
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,080
First, Richard - what impressed you about Richard's Showstopper?

894
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,440
I thought Richard's did look a bit child-like,

895
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,640
- but the flavours were unbelievable. 
- Let's move to Nancy.

896
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,480
The sails on the windmill, that glorious red caramel,

897
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,840
and of course, she got her flavours right.

898
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,160
The symmetry of the whole piece was perfect.

899
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,760
The profiteroles filled with passion fruit was very good.

900
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,800
However, you saw the gaps, you saw the work

901
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,520
and I think if they were bigger, or more,

902
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,040
it would've covered it up more.

903
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,240
Let's look at Luis' - I mean,

904
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,880
that is a spectacular rendering of a hometown if ever I saw one.

905
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,160
That was really stunning.

906
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,160
The whole chain and design of the wheel at the top,

907
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,480
both of them tasted great.

908
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,360
I thought the flavour combinations in the bottom tier didn't work,

909
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,400
but the flavour combinations in the top did,

910
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,680
and did work extremely well.

911
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,080
So, Paul and Mary, time for the big decision.

912
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,800
Do you know who is going to win?

913
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,480
We...

914
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,960
We, for once, are in total agreement.

915
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,560
- Absolutely.
- Do you know already? 
- Like lovebirds.

916
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,720
I told you this would be the series they finally...

917
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,400
Don't start on me.

918
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,040
CHEERING

919
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,080
OK, bakers, the time has come -

920
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,000
I'd like you please to come and step forward.

921
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,040
Give them a round of applause.

922
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,240
All right, my loves.

923
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,440
Well done, all three of you.

924
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,760
Now, bakers, finalists of 2014,

925
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,480
Paul and Mary have made their decision,

926
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,040
and I'm delighted to announce

927
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:59,680
that the winner of The Great British Bake Off 2014 is...

928
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,240
..Nancy.

929
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

930
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,560
Nancy, good for you! Well done!

931
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,280
Nancy!

932
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,200
Well done, Nancy. Well done.

933
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,600
MARY: It's been a pleasure - you should be so proud.

934
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,840
I don't know how I'm feeling, really.

935
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:37,480
Absolutely overwhelmed and...pretty speechless

936
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,600
and a bit emotional, but...

937
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,440
I can't...I...

938
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,920
Who could believe it, you know? That I could win it?

939
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,480
Can you believe it?

940
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,360
Nancy has the instinct. She loves baking.

941
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,760
And, of course, she is a perfectionist.

942
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,960
And to win The Great British Bake Off,

943
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,600
that's just what you have to be, a perfectionist.

944
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,600
- So proud.
- Thank you.

945
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,560
Everything just joined together for the final.

946
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,680
I think it worked beautifully for her

947
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,760
and I think Nancy absolutely nailed it in the final.

948
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,480
Honestly, I'm so overwhelmed. It's been amazing today.

949
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,400
And without a doubt, hand on heart, the right person won.

950
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,560
I think the greatest lesson I've taken away

951
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,520
is that if you want to do something, just crack in and do it.

952
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,280
If you don't just open the door, you'll never find out.

953
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,720
I knew it! I knew it! I'm so proud!

954
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,760
The male judge said, "Have I got a name now?"

955
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,520
So I said, "Yeah, it's Paul.

956
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,200
"And I've been secretly in love with you all the time.

957
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,880
"I had to call you 'male judge' to be able to control myself."

958
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,120
Made him feel all right.

959
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,920
SHE LAUGHS
