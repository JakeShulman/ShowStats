1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Welcome back to the tent.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,040
We are at the quarterfinal stage of Bake Off and with only five

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,400
bakers left standing, who are Mary and Paul going to pick off next?

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,680
They're like the velociraptors of the baking world.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,440
THEY SCREECH LIKE VELOCIRAPTORS

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,040
BOTH: Welcome to the Great British Bake Off.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,920
Last time, the bakers strove for perfect pastry.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,680
Come on, pasties!

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,800
Richard excelled at eclairs...

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,240
- Great pastry.
- Thank you.

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,360
..winning Star Baker for the third time. Others didn't fare so well.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,760
- This is awful.
- Ow!

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,560
- Looks a little bit messy.
- Yeah.

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,680
And Kate became the seventh baker to leave the tent.

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,720
Now the five remaining bakers must impress Paul

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,040
with fruity signatures...

17
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,680
He just does that to scare me.

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,360
..achieve the perfect coiled loaf in a tortuous technical...

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,960
It's a funny-looking thing.

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,520
'..and conjure up 36 mouth-watering doughnuts.'

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,600
Curtain ring.

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,200
SHE LAUGHS

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,800
Who has the skill to stay the course?

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,480
I think you've cracked it.

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,800
And whose baking will fail to make the grade?

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,240
- LIVERPUDLIAN ACCENT: 
- "All right, it was overworked."

27
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,160
That's the Paul we know.

28
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,760
It's hard, isn't it? Because we've had bread week

29
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,200
and this is an entirely different ball game.

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,280
This is like bread week but better.

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,840
It's like that was bread GCSEs, this is bread A-level.

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,880
- It's like a PhD in bread. 
- Nobel Prize-winning.

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,600
So what do we call it?

34
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,800
BOTH: It's advanced dough week.

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,520
The eclairs have just haunted me.

36
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,360
I just keep thinking back to how awful they were.

37
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,520
I'm hoping that this week will be a lot more planned.

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,680
Having won Star Baker

39
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,840
and then have a nightmare week

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,400
has almost become a bit of an MO for me.

41
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,320
Hopefully that won't happen this week,

42
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,360
but, yeah, I'm keeping an eye out for it.

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,400
It's important you go in and execute

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,600
everything to perfection, I think,

45
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,960
otherwise you're on your bike.

46
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,600
Morning, bakers.

47
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,720
For your Signature Challenge, Paul

48
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,760
and Mary would very much like you to make a sweet fruit loaf, please.

49
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,960
This should be made from enriched dough which, as we know,

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,480
is a dough that has won the butter lottery.

51
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,320
And it can be any filling or any flavour that you like.

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,320
The key thing about your sweet loaves, though, bakers, is this.

53
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,840
It's got to be freeform.

54
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,000
We don't want to see any baking in tins.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,560
You've got two and a half hours for your Signature Challenge.

56
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,920
BOTH: Get set. Bake!

57
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,280
Enriched dough benefits from a slow prove

58
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,440
so the challenge for our bakers is to devise a fruit loaf

59
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,040
they can successfully make in the time allowed.

60
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,880
Paul's enriched dough takes three and a half hours,

61
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,760
whereas we've only got two and a half, so it's quite difficult

62
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,680
to get a good prove and a good bake in that kind of time.

63
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,320
Enriched dough is a particularly difficult thing to master.

64
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,320
The butter, eggs and sugar and milk, if you use it,

65
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,920
sit on the yeast and just retard it.

66
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,160
Doesn't kill it.

67
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,120
It just slows it up, making it a little bit more difficult to

68
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,800
make that perfect loaf.

69
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,640
When it's an enriched dough, it does take that much longer to prove

70
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,920
and it's no good being under-proved

71
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,560
and hope it will be rescued in the oven - it won't.

72
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,240
You've got to get your dough working quickly,

73
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,640
so I'm using everything warm, and it's warm in the tent,

74
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,880
which is good.

75
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,280
My bake takes longer to bake because I bake it on low heat for longer.

76
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,920
It's timing is the biggest problem.

77
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,680
- Morning.
- Luis, what kind of sweet loaf have you chosen?

78
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,240
I'm making what I've called a Black Forest Cherry Tree.

79
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,800
- I'm using the bath bun principle... 
- Really?

80
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,840
..of lots of little buns which

81
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,400
will prove to give you the top of the tree.

82
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,440
Luis' tear-and-share cherry tree has a cinnamon-flavoured trunk

83
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,160
and the buns which make the branches are packed with morello cherries

84
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,160
and dark chocolate chips.

85
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,800
What's this?

86
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,160
That is some cherry brandy that I've brought.

87
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,160
Every part of the tear-and-share tree

88
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,560
has a sugar cube in the middle, and the brandy,

89
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,320
I just soak the sugar cube - it's a good carrier for liquid without wetting the dough.

90
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,720
I'm making a Spiced Plum Iced Bread Swirl.

91
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,880
It's kind of a malty, cinnamon-y dough with some little prune

92
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,880
pieces running through it, and then I'm making a spiced plum jam.

93
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,840
Martha's jam will be the filling for her fruit loaf,

94
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,120
which she's decorating with a plum-flavoured icing

95
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,640
and flaked almonds.

96
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,320
I've got some like cassis in the jam that my Auntie has made and lots

97
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,200
of star anise and cloves in there as well - it's almost a bit Chinese-y.

98
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,960
Think Christmas crossed Chinese New Year, in a bread.

99
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,040
It's quite a sloppy dough, enriched dough, but after I've proved it

100
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,200
and kneaded it with a bit of flour afterwards, it should come good.

101
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,640
With their dough in the proving drawer slowly doubling in size,

102
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,960
the bakers now start preparing the fruit they're using

103
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,040
to fill and decorate their loaves.

104
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,880
I've no idea how you get a green cherry.

105
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,840
I need to look that up at some point.

106
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,600
- Hello, Chetna.
- Hello.

107
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,720
Right, what are you doing at the moment?

108
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,280
I'm preparing the filling.

109
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,960
I've taken inspiration from a Croatian bread which is

110
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,320
called "potizza". Somewhere it's called "poatizza".

111
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,600
Different names.

112
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,960
Is it a pizza?

113
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,160
No, "potizza".

114
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,320
Chetna's take on the Eastern European bread, povitica,

115
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,840
will be shaped using

116
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,560
eight rolls of dough, filled with a rich paste of walnuts,

117
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,680
cocoa and finely chopped dates.

118
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,160
Do you slice it or do you pull it?

119
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,840
When you slice it, it looks really pretty inside.

120
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,040
Like snooker balls in a triangle.

121
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,640
Yes, yes.

122
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,720
I'm making...I'm actually calling it Lincolnshire plum braid.

123
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,200
There is a Lincolnshire plum bread, but it's just a play on words.

124
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,560
Rather than just standard mixed fruit, I'm using apricot,

125
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,560
strawberries, putting some marzipan in there, bit of Marsala wine.

126
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,440
Should be quite good. Should be very good.

127
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,840
As well as dried fruit, Nancy's

128
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,040
using cinnamon, nutmeg and orange and lemon zest

129
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,640
to favour her plaited loaf.

130
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,240
Morning!

131
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,640
DEVICE BLEEPS

132
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,120
- Is that your dough, Nancy? 
- That's my dough.

133
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,640
And I'm going to finish the first prove in the microwave.

134
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,880
Have you tried this before?

135
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,360
Yes, I've practised it.

136
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,320
The big worry today is you're going to say this bread is under-proved.

137
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,360
- It's a dangerous thing to do.
- It is.

138
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,640
I think Paul's learnt something today.

139
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,560
- You never use a microwave, do you? 
- No, I never use a microwave.

140
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,280
No, I never do but needs must.

141
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,400
You've thought this one out, it's going to work.

142
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,920
SHE LAUGHS

143
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,960
I thought that was the Marsala.

144
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,240
It's oil!

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,520
While the others rely on their proving drawers,

146
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,240
Nancy's trying to bypass the hour-and-a-half proving time her dough needs.

147
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,520
- You microwaving it?
- Yeah. 
- I've never seen that.

148
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,360
He said it's a dangerous thing to do.

149
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,720
- HE LAUGHS 
- Did he? Not for our Nance.

150
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,120
Not for me.

151
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,840
She's using the microwave to inject that little bit of heat in there.

152
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,800
There is an issue with that because it destroys the protein structure because you're forcing

153
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,800
heat and it tends to break down so it can destabilise the dough.

154
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,800
Bloody hell, Nancy!

155
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,920
LAUGHTER

156
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,840
So I've cut down my rising time by a good half.

157
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,600
What stage are you up to?

158
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,560
I'm just arranging all of my fruit to spread out.

159
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,040
What I'll be doing is making essentially a Chelsea bun,

160
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,960
I'm making a Swedish tea ring.

161
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,360
So I'll be rolling out a Chelsea bun rectangle here, sprinkling it

162
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,120
with all of my various ingredients, but instead of cutting it

163
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,480
I'm going to roll it up and form it into a ring and slash the outside.

164
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,040
Richard's fruit Swedish tea ring

165
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,840
will be filled with a mixture of dried fruits and pecan nuts,

166
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,720
glazed with apricot jam

167
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,640
and topped with lemon water icing.

168
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,760
So you're going to bring your dough out and pop it into all that flour?

169
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,960
Do you not think that's a little bit excessive?

170
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,480
My dough looking a little bit wet so

171
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,840
- I'm going to suck a little bit of wet out of it. 
- Where's your dough now?

172
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,640
- It is quite...
- Oh, my God. 
- It's got plenty of fun to be had.

173
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,080
It's risen quite high as well.

174
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,400
The carbon-dioxide...you can see the balloon on the top. Good luck, mate.

175
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,360
Thank you.

176
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,120
I always worry when Paul comes along and asks me

177
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,960
a pointed question about my dough and then saunters off. I think

178
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,880
I've let it over-prove to start with, so I've had to work it in

179
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,080
and let it relax a little bit, but I think I've got enough time.

180
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,120
Yeah, I've got enough time.

181
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,720
HE LAUGHS

182
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,640
The bakers' challenge now is to create a freeform loaf

183
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,600
which will hold its shape

184
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,840
and contain its filling without the aid of a tin.

185
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,560
Are you advanced dough rolling?

186
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,200
Yes, I am.

187
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,080
So what are you doing?

188
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,120
I'm doing eight mini rolls. I'm just going to...

189
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,960
Even off the ends a bit?

190
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,920
- No, no, no. That's the beauty of it. 
- Is it?
- I like it.

191
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,680
There's an uneven nature do you think Paul will like it?

192
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,840
Well, I don't know but it is my bread.

193
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,640
When I've done it at home, it's looked fairly

194
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,520
attractive in a spirally shape.

195
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,560
When you have jam on toast,

196
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,680
because there's jam already in there,

197
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,760
it's like toast with the jam already inside.

198
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,560
I've just noticed I've not put my fruit in. That would help.

199
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,640
Yeah. A sweet fruit loaf.

200
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,400
Yeah, without the fruit.

201
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,800
Dip your cherries in the dough and off we go.

202
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,680
I'm adding chocolate now. Which I did also.

203
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,400
I'm really glad I came along.

204
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,840
If I hadn't, it would have literally been plain bed roll week.

205
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,720
And also each bun has a sugar cube in the middle which is

206
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,360
soaked in cherry brandy.

207
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,800
So you just get a slight hit of sweetness in the centre.

208
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,440
There's a polio vaccination going on in the middle of it?

209
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,400
- Yeah, it's like that. 
- I'm intrigued now.

210
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,880
All right, I'll let you branch out and I'll see you later.

211
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,240
Cool, thank you.

212
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,000
Microwave for five minutes on 10% power.

213
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,920
OK, amazing, I'm coming with you.

214
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,160
How do you feel, my love?

215
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,720
Bit scared, quite a bit scared

216
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,080
because this could be my death knell.

217
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,680
- It's done.
- OK, right.

218
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,080
It's twice the size.

219
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,480
Should be all right. It's been all right, I've tried it.

220
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,680
- Good luck.
- I hope so.

221
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,600
Definitely a bit of silence in the tent today.

222
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,360
I think this task is really difficult for the time

223
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,120
we've been given, so I think everyone's

224
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,880
a little bit apprehensive about that.

225
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,520
With a baking time of nearly an hour,

226
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,200
Chetna's loaf is first in the oven.

227
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,000
OK, guys, see you in 50 minutes.

228
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,720
See you on the other side.

229
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,360
It's enormous. Certainly bigger than one I've done before.

230
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,800
It goes in there for about 25 minutes.

231
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,840
Bakers, you've got half an hour left on this, stop loafing around,

232
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,480
half an hour left.

233
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,680
The pressure is definitely on now because everyone is so good

234
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,520
and it only takes one bad bake or one mistake to make you go home.

235
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,840
Don't know why I'm keeping an eye on it,

236
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,080
there's nothing I can do now. Once it's in, it's in.

237
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,880
But, yeah, it's looking OK at the moment.

238
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,840
Enriched dough is really hard as it always looks like it's cooked.

239
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,440
So that looks like it's done

240
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,920
but I'm not convinced that it will be in the middle.

241
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,520
Is it going to cook in the middle at that size?

242
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,960
I think that's done.

243
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,640
Five minutes, bakers, five minutes.

244
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,600
I'm going to leave it for another maybe two, three minutes.

245
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,080
It sounds pretty hollow and it's got a good colour on the bottom.

246
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,600
- Nancy...
- Family loaf.

247
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,400
Gosh! It's the size of a Labrador.

248
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,120
He just does that to scare me. Brush that bit that

249
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,600
he touched with a bit more apricot.

250
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
SHE LAUGHS

251
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,720
It's looking a little bit wrinkly on the outside,

252
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,600
I hope that's not it all collapsing back in.

253
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,080
Too late now, innit?

254
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:40,280
Bakers, you've got one minute left, one minute left for your bread.

255
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,720
Concentration here.

256
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,360
Oh, yeah, I'm really happy with that.

257
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,960
- One, two, three.
- Thank you.

258
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,720
Right, the challenge is over! Step away from your bakes.

259
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,600
It looks most tempting, I like the shiny finish.

260
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,560
I think if I peer round the side,

261
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,280
- there's a little bit of jam coming out.
- There's a little leak.

262
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,480
I think the colour looks very attractive,

263
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,360
it's got a nice, rich colour to it.

264
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,280
Well, you can tell it's an enriched dough

265
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,040
the way it's springing back as we cut through it.

266
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,280
You have the nice swirls of the jam coming through.

267
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,880
You've got some rawness here.

268
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,160
Part of it is down to the fact it's still warm but you see how

269
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,160
light it is there and how fluffy, and then there it goes quite dense.

270
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,600
OK.

271
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,440
- It's a very nice flavour.
- Thanks.

272
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,000
But I would have liked to have some pieces of plum in it.

273
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,720
- OK.
- I think it could have done with a slower bake

274
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,920
- but I do like the flavour. 
- Thank you.

275
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,200
I like the look of it, but I think...

276
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,760
It's very new, I've not seen anything like this before.

277
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,960
It is unusual. What are we expecting to see when we cut into this?

278
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,880
When you cut inside I'm hoping that you can see distinctive swirls.

279
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,360
Oh!

280
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,360
The weight of the top ones has rather squashed the ones

281
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,440
underneath, but there's plenty of filling in there.

282
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,960
I think you've got a little bit too much cinnamon.

283
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,360
I tried with slightly less and it wouldn't come through

284
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,080
and obviously I didn't want to...

285
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,400
- Ooh, it's coming through. 
- Oh, was it? OK.

286
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,200
But it is baked and it looks good.

287
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,120
I am quite happy with the cinnamon,

288
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,480
- because, between you and me, I'm not that fond of dates.
- OK.

289
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,520
- Very good idea. Well done. 
- Thank you.

290
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,360
Well, it does look very spectacular.

291
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,680
I think it's a nice idea, it's very attractive.

292
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,120
The crumb looks really nice, it's quite an open structure.

293
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,040
Tear off a bun, Mary.

294
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,040
That's what I was hoping you'd say.

295
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,120
I do like the flavour. The sugar, I'm not sure about.

296
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,800
Quirky, which I appreciate, but I don't think it needs it.

297
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,960
I'm certainly not arguing with the sugar in the middle,

298
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,840
I like a bit of originality.

299
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,440
I think it goes well, I've got quite a sweet tooth.

300
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,920
It's a beautiful bake, lovely texture,

301
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,800
I'll have another mouthful, please.

302
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,080
Thank you very much.

303
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,240
- What you have is something that's under-proved.
- Really?

304
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,280
Or the proteins have indeed been damaged.

305
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,040
- And then it rips and falls apart. 
- Heck. Right.

306
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,280
It's got a good structure. I think it's slightly under-done.

307
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,520
It's not awful, is it? It's not awful!

308
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,200
- I haven't said anything yet! 
- No!
- No, no, no.

309
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,320
I think what it is, because it's so dense...

310
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,760
If you'd made it longer and thinner...

311
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,840
Yeah. I'd just use less stuff.

312
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,880
I think it tastes absolutely scrumptious.

313
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,120
You've got all these flavours going through. I like it.

314
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,840
With a microwave, just using 500 grams of flour, you could feed an entire village.

315
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,720
- Absolutely.
- It's like magic!

316
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,720
It was a very, very wet dough.

317
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,360
- It was. 
- That's why it's sitting flat.

318
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,360
How long was it in the oven for?

319
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,640
22.

320
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,520
Yeah, you nailed that one.

321
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,480
- Absolutely beautiful.
- Well done.

322
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,360
The structure's very good,

323
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,600
got a nice blend of flavours in there as well.

324
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,600
I think from that soft dough, you've managed to do extremely well to get

325
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
the bake that you've got and a great flavour coming through. Well done.

326
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,960
Thank you.

327
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,640
They all taste good, they look great, everyone's on it!

328
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,520
We're a good bunch now!

329
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,600
I thought that went brilliantly!

330
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,600
I was worried about the look of it but they both liked the look of it!

331
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,160
Phew!

332
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
Well, I'm feeling positive at the moment,

333
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,040
but if you have a bad Technical, you're straight back down again,

334
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,440
It's like a roller coaster here.

335
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,640
Back in the tent,

336
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,800
the bakers are preparing for their advanced dough technical challenge.

337
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,120
Bakers, good afternoon, welcome to your technical challenge.

338
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,920
Give me happy faces, bakers! There we go.

339
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,560
Now, Paul, you are the self-confessed King of Bread.

340
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,720
Would you mind leaving with Mary?

341
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,040
Otherwise you're going to put them off their stride.

342
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,360
- Is that all right? Tatty-byes. Good.
- They've gone.

343
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,880
What Paul and Mary would very much like you to make today

344
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,120
is something called a povitica...

345
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,720
Ooh, you little teaser.

346
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,000
Chetna's heard of it because she managed to make

347
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,960
a variant of one this morning by pure, pure chance.

348
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,720
But no longer Croatian-INSPIRED, we want the real thing.

349
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,920
- Now, it's an Eastern European cross between a bread and a pastry.
- Is it?

350
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,000
It's basically got hidden swirls within it. If you want to know what

351
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,240
it looks like, just remember a couple of hours ago and remember Chetna's.

352
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,320
Now, you've got two and a half hours in which to bake this.

353
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,120
Very, very good luck to you all.

354
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,800
On your marks.

355
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,560
- Get set. 
- Baaake!

356
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,360
Oh, my God...this is...

357
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,320
I can't believe that they knew

358
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,480
I made that in the morning and nobody let it slip out.

359
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,280
I'm really excited!

360
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,840
Chetna's on it for this one, that was a stroke of luck from her point.

361
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,200
I might just watch over her and learn by watching.

362
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,760
It's not called copying, it's learning by watching.

363
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,360
I didn't even know what it was.

364
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,040
The only saving grace is Chetna's this morning,

365
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,440
so I've got a rough idea.

366
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,760
From the sounds of things, it's baked in a loaf tin.

367
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,040
It probably looks quite similar to a normal loaf of bread,

368
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,000
but I think, when you cut into it,

369
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,640
it will have all the spirals like Chetna's did this morning.

370
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,120
Gosh, that's a loaf and a half.

371
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,840
This is a povitica.

372
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,400
What makes it tricky, all that is one roll of dough that's been

373
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,160
rolled out so thin, filled with cocoa butter,

374
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,640
sugar and then walnuts, rolled up and then basically they've

375
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,520
got to lasso it around the tin to produce that shape.

376
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,000
And you can see those beautiful swirls on the inside.

377
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,640
Quite a long bake, actually -

378
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,560
an hour in the oven - but you need that to dry it all out.

379
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,680
Having all those walnuts and chocolate, it is very, very moist.

380
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,760
I wonder how the bakers will get on with it.

381
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,200
I'll tell you one thing for sure, Chetna's got a bit of a lift up.

382
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,680
It simply says, "Make the dough and prove."

383
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,280
But this is the quarterfinal technical,

384
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,760
it's hardly going to give you a walk-through, is it?

385
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,080
I used 300 grams in the morning and we're using 300 grams right now,

386
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,640
and we had two and a half hours in the morning,

387
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,920
we've got two and a half hours right now,

388
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,040
so I know how long to prove and things but this is one big roll.

389
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,440
I've never rolled a pastry so big.

390
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,560
You look mesmerised, Martha.

391
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,400
I'm just staring at my dough. I think that's there.

392
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,040
Now, when Chetna was making hers before,

393
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,800
could you have a good old gander?

394
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,720
I didn't pay enough attention, I'm annoyed,

395
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,200
- I should have watched really hard! 
- Martha!

396
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,920
The biggest decision the bakers now face

397
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,640
is how to divide their time between proving and baking.

398
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,640
I'm going to give it an initial 30 minutes and see how it goes.

399
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,040
Realistically, it needs an hour's proving, but I tell you what,

400
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,440
if it's not rising I'll be down to that microwave.

401
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,040
It says, "Blitz the walnuts, vanilla seeds, sugar

402
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,320
"and cocoa powder together," so I'm just working my way through that.

403
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,440
For me, you wouldn't want to blitz it too much

404
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,160
because it could go a bit too mushy.

405
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,640
And I think you'd want some bite in this, so I don't know,

406
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,560
blitz it but don't over-blitz it.

407
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,040
HE LAUGHS

408
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,440
It looks very similar to what Chetna made this morning,

409
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,280
so I think that's probably right.

410
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,200
It's doubled in size, so that's all I wanted.

411
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,640
I don't want to over-prove it.

412
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,320
It's supposed to double in size.

413
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,280
I would have given it longer

414
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,600
but there's a lot of work to do with it, I think.

415
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,880
I know how it's supposed to look, so how long it should be,

416
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,600
so I've measured it out.

417
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,880
It says, "Stretch out dough to a large rectangle,

418
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,360
"as large as you can." I think that's where the clue is.

419
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,960
It probably needs to be the length of this cloth.

420
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,120
I'm going to go as big as I can.

421
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,120
I often put clingfilm down on the surfaces at home

422
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,880
because either I'm too lazy

423
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,680
to clean up all the flour from the kneading

424
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,440
or it's clean already, and my parents...

425
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,600
I just do it so I don't get quite so much mess everywhere.

426
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,120
I think that's probably as big as I dare go without ripping it.

427
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,080
The bakers' next challenge is to find the best way to evenly cover

428
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,200
their paper-thin dough with walnut filling.

429
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,800
The recipe says, "Spread the filling evenly over the dough."

430
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,040
It's as thick as toffee and the dough is so, so delicate.

431
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,800
I'm trying to spread it but it's not spreading

432
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,360
because of the butter on the dough which he asked us to put on it.

433
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,200
This is really odd.

434
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,040
Seriously.

435
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,440
Is it happening to everybody?

436
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,040
He'll go absolutely crazy if there's blobs of filling

437
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,520
when he cuts into it.

438
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,120
The microwave is the only way forward.

439
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,520
That's better.

440
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,600
I think the only way I can get this on there without destroying

441
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,640
the pastry is out of an icing bag.

442
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,840
Nancy seems to have hit on a fairly good idea

443
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,360
so it would be daft to not copy.

444
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,840
Try a piece of cling-film and then roll over the top of it.

445
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,720
You do know, by the way, that behind you is Richard

446
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,560
and everything you do, he looks at you, he's your wingman.

447
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,720
Yeah.

448
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,280
What I thought I'd do,

449
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,560
using more cling-film, is spread it out into a rectangle a similar size.

450
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,640
I must say, I'm actually really happy

451
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,960
with how the clingfilm did that stuff.

452
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,920
Everybody's really struggling to get it out on their thing, and I was,

453
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,080
"This is really smooth. This looks really cool!"

454
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,040
OK, guys, you've got one hour on your Eastern European bakes.

455
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,360
I hope your Croatian loaves don't split.

456
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,440
While the others are still shaping their loaves,

457
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,320
Chetna knows from experience

458
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,360
how important it is to leave enough time for baking.

459
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,120
The cooking time is so long I've got very little time to prove it,

460
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,800
so I am going to whack it in the proving drawer.

461
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,280
(This looks amazing!)

462
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,280
I've left the nuts quite chunky,

463
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,640
I don't know if that's a good thing...

464
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,360
- We love chunky nuts here.
- Do you?

465
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,200
You know we love chunky nuts on Bake Off.

466
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,680
HE LAUGHS

467
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,240
That is one hell of a snake.

468
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,840
The clingfilm's good now which means I don't have to touch the dough,

469
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,040
as it's so thin, I wouldn't want to break it.

470
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,200
You've done all this before.

471
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,440
That is a mucky end I've made of that.

472
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,360
- No, I have as well. 
- What's to be done with that?

473
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,600
We'll sort that out.

474
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,880
Now I've seen you do it, I'm going to tell Richard,

475
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,520
cos it's much easier than him just watching, is that all right?

476
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,320
Then he can get on.

477
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,960
So what's she done, then?

478
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,000
Right, let me tell you what Nancy's done.

479
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,160
She's... She's sort of, yeah, she's chopped the ends.

480
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,760
You don't need to, you've done a nice job with yours.

481
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,160
I'm loving this.

482
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,200
- It's basically like a filled pop sock, isn't it, essentially? 
- Exactly. Do you want to swap ends?

483
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,600
Come on, then. It's like a sort of pastry do-si-do.

484
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,440
- I like this.
- We're getting good length, aren't we?

485
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,080
How much length do you want?! The same as Nancy's.

486
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,320
It needs to wrap around, doesn't it?

487
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,960
Stop looking over!

488
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,560
You're terrible. Did you used to do this in your exams?

489
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,040
- Of course I did.
- His will be better than mine at the end of it.

490
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,320
Listen, it's not a competition. Hang on...

491
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,000
It should kind of lay in there.

492
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,760
This looks a bit unappetising.

493
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,120
It looks a bit like a Wurst, doesn't it?

494
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,520
What do we think? What do we think?

495
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,280
Proving bag.

496
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
So how long's that going to prove for?

497
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,040
As long as I dare, I think, is the key.

498
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,440
Whack it in.

499
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,000
With the rest of the bakers only just putting their loaves in

500
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,480
for a second prove,

501
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,240
Chetna's putting hers in the oven

502
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,440
after only ten minutes' rise.

503
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,760
Now, where is your dough? Where is it?

504
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,120
- Oh, it's baking.
- It's already...? 
- Yes, because the key to this bake

505
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,400
is slow and long bake on low temperature.

506
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,080
You're the only person who knows that, that's the thing.

507
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,800
Because people haven't finished their second prove yet.

508
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,480
Baking is more important than the second prove.

509
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,640
It's a funny-looking thing.

510
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,520
I'll prove it for as long as I can

511
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,200
and then when I lose my nerve, I'll stick it in the oven.

512
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,040
- It might have to be thinner and longer.
- Can you do that at this stage?
- I could have a go.

513
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,840
Chetna's had loads of little whirls in it,

514
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,080
and if I do it like that, it will only have three.

515
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,480
Is it possible to make it much longer?

516
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,920
Can't really go much thinner than that, I don't think.

517
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,760
But that's a lot longer than it was.

518
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,400
There we go, we've got four, we're going to get five.

519
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,680
Yeah, we're going to get five, mate, that's it.

520
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,680
Back in the old cleaner's bag, and then how long to prove?

521
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,000
I think I've got about 40 minutes to go,

522
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,080
so I'm going to go about ten,

523
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,240
which isn't very many, but I haven't got much time left.

524
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,560
See, there's the mystery. "One egg white, beaten." It's not in there.

525
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,880
"Egg white, beaten." I used to put that in my hair in the '80s...

526
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,440
HE LAUGHS

527
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,160
..to give it proper rigidity,

528
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
that's all I know about egg white. "Meringue!"

529
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,440
- There's no meringue. 
- There's no meringue, is there?

530
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,240
- She knows.
- Does she? 
- She does.
- Yeah, she does.

531
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,560
"A beaten egg white and 100 grams of icing sugar and water."

532
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,600
So I thought, "We need a royal icing, then.

533
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,240
I'm not sure why on earth you'd need royal icing on something like this.

534
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,200
Because royal icing...

535
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,040
Hmm.

536
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:32,640
I think the egg white is just to brush on it for a glaze.

537
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,560
It's going in now.

538
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,520
I don't think this will take that long, to be honest.

539
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,720
SPEAKS CROATIAN

540
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,560
Which is "30 minutes" in Croatian.

541
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,600
In you go, Mr Loaf.

542
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,280
I'm not going to make royal icing now

543
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,320
because I don't see why royal icing should go on something like this.

544
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,120
I might open the oven and quickly egg wash my bread thing.

545
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,480
Bread cake? Cake bread.

546
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,920
Whatever it is, it's going to get some egg on it anyway.

547
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,880
So that's baking on high heat for 15 minutes

548
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,240
and then reduce the oven temperature so just keep an eye on it, I think.

549
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,720
Now I'm happy because it's got just the perfect brown

550
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,680
I'm looking for, so I don't want to ruin that.

551
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,800
- You all right? 
- No, it's raw inside.

552
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,400
No? They've all got a similar amount of worry.

553
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,160
Have you just stabbed it with your stabber?

554
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,640
Yeah, I thought 30 minutes would be long enough, though.

555
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,800
- There's a lot of wet in there, I suppose.
- Yeah, there is.

556
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,360
It's collapsed a bit. It's a funny-looking thing, I don't know.

557
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,240
Presumably the wow is when you cut into it,

558
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,680
because there's not a lot of wow going on at the moment.

559
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,080
In the sense that I've absolutely no idea what it's meant to look like, I'm over the moon with it.

560
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,160
It's perfect, best one I've ever done.

561
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,240
That is a good colour, I'm pleased with that.

562
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,680
I'm going to get mine out.

563
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,120
I'm very happy with that.

564
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,160
It's looking all right, it's not looking amazing

565
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,760
but it's not looking awful.

566
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,600
OK, bakers, just two minutes left to lovingly

567
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,240
hand-fan your advanced Eastern European breads.

568
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,200
Two minutes.

569
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,720
Quarterfinalist bakers, the piping must stop.

570
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,040
Bring your bakes up,

571
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,960
pop them behind the photo of yourself on the gingham altar.

572
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,360
Now, what have we got here?

573
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,120
They look OK.

574
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,360
When we look at this one, the rise is a bit stunted, it's quite

575
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,920
heavy and it shouldn't be that heavy but it's really down to the middle.

576
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,400
Bated breath...

577
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,960
The filling has gone around some of it but it's a bit in blobs,

578
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,680
it should be evenly spread amongst the whole lot.

579
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,960
And also, it's quite doughy as well.

580
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,600
It hasn't been in the oven quite long enough.

581
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,000
The walnuts in there have got a nice crunch.

582
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,720
There's often a tendency to chop them too finely and it's a powder,

583
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,480
but you've got a lovely bit of texture from the walnuts there.

584
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,440
Let's move on to number two. Which is very interesting.

585
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,160
Royal icing on the top, no glaze on top of the loaf.

586
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,640
Massively under-proved, raw inside.

587
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,600
That is going to have a few issues.

588
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,920
You can tell as you cut through that's royal icing,

589
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,280
because it's all breaking up.

590
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,960
It hasn't proved up enough, the layers, there's thick and thin.

591
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,200
Irregular with the filling as well.

592
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,200
But ultimately, what you have is raw dough

593
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,640
because it simply wasn't in the oven long enough.

594
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,240
I wouldn't advise you eat it, either. Let's move onto the next one.

595
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,720
This looks better, the colour on it I quite like, let's have a look.

596
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,000
It's very warm.

597
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,440
(It's baked.)

598
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,880
And it looks...it looks pretty good, yeah.

599
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,600
The flavour here is good and the texture's good.

600
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,480
The paste itself is fairly equal, the colour's good,

601
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,200
the size is about right.

602
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,800
That's not bad at all, not bad at all.

603
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,000
Moving on.

604
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,560
- Good bake.
- Doesn't necessarily mean it's a good bake inside, though.

605
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,640
There you go, raw.

606
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,120
When you say it is totally raw, it is absolutely raw.

607
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,000
Now, that's to do with the baking,

608
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,200
it simply wasn't in there long enough.

609
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,680
You need to bake this for an hour,

610
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,920
anything less than that is going to be tricky.

611
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,040
So I wouldn't eat that, Mary, if I were you.

612
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,280
Now, moving onto the last one, the colour looks OK,

613
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,720
the icing is lovely.

614
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,000
I like the strength of the icing. Bit lop-sided...

615
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,440
It's drunk.

616
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,000
HE LAUGHS

617
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,640
This bit here in the middle is just raw.

618
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,000
And it's not very evenly mixed, is it?

619
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,720
We've got rather a big piece of dough there.

620
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,840
That's what's caused the problem with the bake.

621
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,160
Because it's sporadic and you had lumps of dough

622
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,480
and lumps of the paste, it was going to be a problem.

623
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,760
So, overall, we've had problems with the baking, getting them done in the time.

624
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,120
It comes down to understanding how you bake in an hour.

625
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,200
Not a stunning result for most of the bakers,

626
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,640
but who fared worst?

627
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,280
So in fifth place is this one.

628
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,200
Whose is this one? Well done, Martha, you couldn't even eat it.

629
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,320
- How long did you bake it for? 
- 25 minutes.

630
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,400
And in fourth place, who is this one?

631
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,960
- Very nice icing...
- Thank you. 
- ..but a bit raw inside.

632
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,760
Third is this one, and actually we could eat a little

633
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,880
- bit of this here, your paste is just all over the place.
- Yeah.

634
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,760
Royal icing, what were you thinking?

635
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,200
I know.

636
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,480
And in second place, who is that?

637
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,080
It was the baking on that.

638
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,440
Too high a temperature, not in there long enough.

639
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,320
And in first place is this one.

640
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,960
Almost like she'd done it before(!)

641
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,680
Weird that, isn't it? Weird!

642
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,320
It came down to the bake, how long did you leave it in for?

643
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,880
50 minutes.

644
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,200
Yeah, that's better, you were slightly...

645
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,240
Only another ten minutes, it would have dried it out beautifully.

646
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,880
- Well done, Chetna.
- Thank you.

647
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,880
Bakers, well done, the day is over.

648
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,680
Go rest up and we'll see you tomorrow.

649
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,320
And by the way, Chetna, tomorrow's bake isn't that, just in case

650
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,040
you're thinking you're going to get three in a row, not going to happen.

651
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,640
This is the first time I've come first on a technical,

652
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,920
but to be honest, if I had come anywhere

653
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,640
other than first, it would have been embarrassing.

654
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,360
I was convinced I was last.

655
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,680
And I'd decided that when Paul said, "And in fifth place..."

656
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,520
and it was me, I wasn't going to put my hand up.

657
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,000
SHE LAUGHS

658
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,360
You've got to be quite determined

659
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,840
if you come last in the Technical to turn it back around.

660
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,920
I've really got to produce something really good tomorrow or it's going to be goodbye to me.

661
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,640
So it's fair to say, Paul, that yesterday's bakes gave you a chance

662
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,560
to use your digit of doom. There was a lot of raw dough being prodded.

663
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,320
Well, I think there's one person

664
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,440
that's really sort of let herself down. That was Martha.

665
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,600
On her Signature Challenge, the bread was underdone,

666
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,640
on the technical, that was raw.

667
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,880
When you looked at Nancy, for instance,

668
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,320
who I would say is in trouble...

669
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,360
She had a tricky day yesterday, didn't she?

670
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,400
She did, she came third in the Technical,

671
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,360
and actually her massive plait was under-proved.

672
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,480
Nancy has to move herself up a bit, doesn't she, to be totally safe?

673
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,360
But I think Martha will have to do brilliantly today.

674
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,040
So she's got a lot of pressure on her young shoulders today.

675
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,440
Unfortunately, yes.

676
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,280
Good morning, bakers.

677
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,800
Now, for this, your special Showstopper day,

678
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,000
Mary and Paul would like you to create doughnuts.

679
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,080
We'd like you to make two different types of doughnuts, 18 of each.

680
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,120
That's 36 doughnuts each. That's 180 doughnuts in this room.

681
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,800
You've got four hours to do this bake. On your marks...

682
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,640
- Get set.
- Baaaake.

683
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,360
Yesterday was probably one of my worst days,

684
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,520
so this has got to be pretty good for me to stay.

685
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,560
Every Showstopper is pressure

686
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,960
because you think you've got ages but you haven't.

687
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:00,560
I've probably made in excess of 30,000, maybe 40,000 doughnuts in my time.

688
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,960
I know what a good doughnut should look like and taste like.

689
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,040
I'm looking for ambition

690
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,040
and I really can't wait to see what the bakers come up with.

691
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,800
- Morning.
- Morning, Luis.

692
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,280
Luis, tell us about your two kinds of doughnuts.

693
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,480
OK, I am making cocktail doughnuts,

694
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,040
so they are inspired with cocktail flavours.

695
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,520
And you've won. Thank you very much.

696
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,040
I'm making...

697
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,600
The first one is a mudslide and then the next one I'm making is

698
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,880
a ring doughnut which is a raspberry mojito.

699
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,280
Luis' mudslide doughnuts

700
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,600
have a creamy Irish liqueur centre, while his mojito doughnuts

701
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,920
will be filled with raspberry and mint jam.

702
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,720
If I'm right, that's the zest of seven limes in there.

703
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,280
That is quite a lot.

704
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,640
You remember a mojito, Mary, they have a hell of a kick.

705
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,520
It seems a lot but you need a lot in there to get the flavour coming through.

706
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,920
It's quite a big mix of dough so I can cut out 18 doughnuts.

707
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,400
In doughnut dough, what I really want is for it to be springy

708
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,920
and not too wet, so the doughnuts don't collapse after they'd proved.

709
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,920
It's an orange-flavoured doughnut dough

710
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,360
so I've put orange zests in there and some orange extract as well.

711
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,440
I've learnt if you say something's in something you've got to be able to taste it.

712
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,480
Good morning, Chetna. So, doughnuts, what have you decided to make?

713
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,920
I'm doing South African-inspired doughnuts which are called

714
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,880
koeksisters, I believe.

715
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,760
They are very spiced dough.

716
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,400
And then some potato goes in, and then you make braids out of it.

717
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,880
My other ones are round doughnuts which I'm going to fill

718
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,360
in with dark chocolate mousse.

719
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,880
Chetna's round doughnuts will be decorated

720
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,840
with white and dark chocolate, and for extra spice,

721
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,440
her South African braided doughnuts

722
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,480
will be dipped into a ginger and cinnamon syrup.

723
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,440
I've never had one of these before.

724
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,440
Great, he doesn't know how these are supposed to taste. Amazing!

725
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,240
You and I don't know how it's supposed to taste,

726
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,560
I've never had one. This weekend was all about doing something different.

727
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,640
I'm making a lemon and poppy-seed glazed ring doughnut

728
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,600
and a chocolate and passion fruit layered doughnut.

729
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,000
It's a bit of a hybrid between, like, a croissant and a doughnut.

730
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,480
Martha's ring doughnuts will be decorated with a lemon icing,

731
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,480
and she's making a passion fruit curd to fill her round doughnuts,

732
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,520
which should separate into distinctive layers when baked.

733
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,080
What are you up to?

734
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,160
I'm just laminating the dough for one of my doughnuts.

735
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,280
So you're doing a laminated fried doughnut?

736
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,400
It's basically quite light because you've got the different layers.

737
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,000
- Like the side of a vol-au-vent you want, but doughy?
- Yeah.

738
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,080
Martha's laminated dough

739
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,680
is put to prove in the fridge to avoid melting the butter,

740
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,840
while the others are using proving drawers.

741
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,640
It is the quarterfinals. I think you have to show you're a bit

742
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,240
interesting, that you can make exciting bakes that are a bit new.

743
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,320
Because if you just do a jam doughnut,

744
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,880
it doesn't really show a whole lot of inventiveness.

745
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,160
One of my doughnuts has jam in and I think you should have

746
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,400
jam in a doughnut, but that's just me.

747
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,720
Hello, Richard, what are you doing?

748
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,200
I'm doing fair-inspired doughnuts today.

749
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,360
I'm doing toffee apples with a kind of an apple innard.

750
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,760
My second one will be a heart-shaped punched-out doughnut

751
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,440
with a rhubarb jam inside it and custard on top.

752
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,840
Does it stay a heart shape in the deep fat?

753
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,440
It stays in the fat, it's lovely, my wife loves them.

754
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,280
Richard's doughnut hearts

755
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,480
will be topped with a swirl of cream and custard

756
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,280
and his apple doughnuts will be liberally coated

757
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,520
with cinnamon sugar and salted caramel.

758
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,760
And I see you are displaying them in a doughnut box.

759
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,200
They're orange boxes from the market but I thought I'd jazz them up and paint them.

760
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,160
When we were asked to do 36 doughnuts, I thought,

761
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,040
"That just makes me think of a family gathering."

762
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,800
I thought, "I'll do some adult ones with a limoncello cream,

763
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,920
"and some kiddie's ones, chocolate and orange, with faces decorated on."

764
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,160
Nancy's limoncello doughnuts will be topped with flaked almonds

765
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,120
and her children's doughnuts

766
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,160
will be coated in milk chocolate and decorated with royal icing.

767
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,440
What kind of faces are you going to pipe?

768
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,040
I thought about grey, spiky hair

769
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,440
- and piercing blue eyes...
- Right. 
- And then a sort of a smile.

770
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,680
- A smile? 
- Is that like a male judge?

771
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,400
Sort of a male judge.

772
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,080
Like a fictional male judge because the real male judge...

773
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,800
- Doesn't smile.
- ..never smiles. 
- They're getting at you.

774
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,520
It really proved, a good start.

775
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,760
I'm just knocking it back a bit to get rid of the extra air.

776
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,200
And then I'm going to roll it out, cut out my first doughnuts.

777
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,320
I love this dough, it's so much fun to work with because it's so stretchy.

778
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,800
I'm now rolling my dough out to make my first set of doughnuts,

779
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,960
these will be the heart-shaped ones.

780
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,680
Now, Luis, am I right in thinking there's going to be a doughnut in each glass?

781
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,920
There is going to be a doughnut in each glass.

782
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,480
That is marvellous! You're going for the pizzazz on this, aren't you?

783
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,800
Well, it said, "Think about how you're going to present your doughnuts,"

784
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,400
so I certainly did!

785
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,480
THEY LAUGH

786
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,880
What's this?

787
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,760
- It's a cupcake corer.
- Why would you want to core a cupcake?

788
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,440
- So you can put filling in the middle of it.
- I knew that.

789
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,200
It's called a key, this bit where you fold them all in on themselves

790
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,960
and then you have to...

791
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,360
That sort of twists in on itself and raises upwards to form a ball.

792
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,120
Took me ages to learn to do it.

793
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,720
How many doughnuts have come through your house this week, do you reckon?

794
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,640
- Hundreds of doughnuts have come through our house.
- Seriously?

795
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,360
- A lot of them have gone to work. 
- Builders love a doughnut.

796
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,400
We love a doughnut, they're for builders.

797
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,240
It looks like he's making darts, are you making darts?

798
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,280
I'm taking out the judges today.

799
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,800
I'd love to step on the oche with those.

800
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,800
This is rhubarb and ginger for my rhubarb portion of the doughnuts.

801
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:28,560
Oh, no, those are huge! Oh, no. these are way over-proved.

802
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,640
I'm really kicking myself for that.

803
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,680
Oh, no!

804
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,160
These are absolutely awful.

805
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,800
Very, very delicate...

806
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,720
They take about a minute-and-a-half on each side, and they have to

807
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,120
come out golden brown with a nice white ring round

808
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,560
the middle, which I think it's kind of almost got.

809
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,880
Not used to deep fat fryers at all. This is the method to fry.

810
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,440
I've not known anything else.

811
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,000
It's just flat, at home they were about that high.

812
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,840
It's just a little pancake, which is so sad,

813
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,520
cos I know these taste really nice at home.

814
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,720
He's not going to like them. Bit hard?

815
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,160
Curtain ring.

816
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,560
SHE LAUGHS

817
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,960
I'll whack a few more.

818
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,320
I'd distribute it in four points

819
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,040
so it should get a good amount in each doughnut.

820
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,800
10ml in each one, I think.

821
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,640
I'm just kind of roughly seeing how much is going in,

822
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,920
so, you know, kind of by eye.

823
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,120
I've got numbers on the side of my syringe,

824
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:54,400
so I'm putting 25ml of apple in each one.

825
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,280
That's all the apple ones done.

826
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,720
Now I'm going to do the rhubarb ones.

827
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,160
Marth, talk to me, how's it going?

828
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,960
Rubbish.

829
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,480
Marth, don't say that word.

830
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,600
I've just over-proved them.

831
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:13,120
The more curds you put in there, you can sort of puff them out a bit.

832
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,400
- What are you going to fill these with?
- I was going to fill them with Bailey's.

833
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,920
So you'd have a little drink and then you'd have the doughnut.

834
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,360
Yeah. What do you reckon?

835
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,200
God, I need to decide.

836
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,480
The judges don't really like gimmicks, but you know what,

837
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,960
Mary will probably hate it but I'm going for it.

838
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,840
I don't want it to run down the sides, I want a clean line on it.

839
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,680
The best temperature to work with is about 40 degrees.

840
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,400
If it's going onto something cold, it shouldn't run down.

841
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,520
Yes, that's brilliant! What do you think of the bake, Paul?

842
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,480
- LIVERPUDLIAN ACCENT:
- "Totally nailed it, you absolutely nailed it.

843
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,400
"Come on, let me shake your hand."

844
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,920
What? Paul, what's happened to you? You're really happy.

845
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,760
"All right, it was overworked." Now that's the Paul we know.

846
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,680
OK, doughnutters, five minutes remaining!

847
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,560
Oh, dear, they're different sizes and they're a bit flat.

848
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:45,000
It's over! Step away, please, step away from your bakes, time's up.

849
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,920
The caramel glaze, which I was looking forward to,

850
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,120
seems to have gone in the tray.

851
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,120
I ran out of time, I didn't put them on racks,

852
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,680
I put them straight in the tray!

853
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,960
Let's start with rhubarb and custard.

854
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,760
It's got a nice fry on it, the colour looks good

855
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,720
and it feels actually quite light.

856
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,640
I was concerned whether the hearts would keep their shape

857
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,440
and they've kept them beautifully.

858
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,840
That's cracking that, yeah.

859
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,160
The blend of the cream,

860
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,960
you've got the little bit of zing coming from the rhubarb as well.

861
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,160
Yeah, that's a nice doughnut, that.

862
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,560
Thank you.

863
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,560
Let's try a caramel. Nice colour on the doughnut.

864
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,120
Not too dark. It's quite even on both sides as well.

865
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,920
Oh, I like that a lot.

866
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,680
As a package, it's a very professional doughnut actually.

867
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,160
- I think you've cracked it.
- I'll take that, I'm going to pocket that.

868
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,120
I think it looks fun for the children.

869
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,720
I think it's a great display. Let's start with one of the adult ones.

870
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,920
The irregular differences in colour is a little bit of a worry.

871
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,720
We're going to have lemon cream in the middle. Limoncello.

872
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,120
It does actually feel quite dry inside

873
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,920
- and I think you could have done with frying it slightly less.
- Yeah.

874
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,800
The limoncello cream is absolutely lovely.

875
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,360
You can get away with the slight dryness

876
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,800
because of the moisture of the cream.

877
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,720
Now, the children's one.

878
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,360
It's got a nice colour there.

879
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,680
There are some dark ones up there as well.

880
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,040
- Did you find you were getting irregular in colour? 
- They all look all right to me.

881
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,240
- Would you say if they didn't? 
- Of course(!)

882
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,320
The chocolate's been put on extremely well.

883
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,960
But I have a strong suspicion they're slightly overdone.

884
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,560
They're slightly overdone.

885
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,160
You are good at your flavours, I just think you let

886
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,840
- it down with the proving and the frying on this one.
- Yeah.

887
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,520
The layered ones,

888
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,000
I don't think they've done the rise that you wanted to.

889
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,080
I over-proved them massively.

890
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,720
Let's start with the poppy seed one.

891
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,680
Very light, I love the way you've got the icing on that, by the way.

892
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,520
It's over-proved.

893
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,760
As soon as you open it up, you see those massive air holes.

894
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,800
- Just the right amount of poppy seed...
- Thank you.

895
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,480
..but not quite right.

896
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,760
Let's have a look at the laminated one.

897
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,160
Chocolate's staying in one place which is good...ish.

898
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,920
SHE LAUGHS

899
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,960
- A very light colour.
- OK.

900
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,160
- I like the passion fruit filling. 
- Thank you.

901
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,600
What you're got overall are two great-tasting doughnuts,

902
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,360
- but the textures and the look are all wrong.
- Yeah.

903
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,240
They're very, very fatty.

904
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,640
I think if you add more body to it then you would have more

905
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,600
dough with the syrup on top rather than soaked all the way through.

906
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,280
But I think the flavours are lovely.

907
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,200
Nice bit of chocolate work on the top.

908
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,760
Got a nice band running through the middle.

909
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,560
- It's more of a ganache than a mousse.
- OK.
- It's quite thick.

910
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:19,440
The actual doughnut itself is beautifully light, well-flavoured.

911
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,560
It's a pity that the mousse isn't more mousse-like.

912
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,040
You've given us a great display.

913
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,280
The raspberry ones, I can see you've injected them

914
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,800
on all four corners. The glaze is coating them nicely.

915
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,640
They are a little bit uneven.

916
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,360
These, pretty difficult to see sitting in here.

917
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,520
The proof will be in the eating.

918
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,120
- Let's try this guy here.
- OK.

919
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:51,920
Lovely shape for a ring doughnut, nice icing across the top as well.

920
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,760
I can taste the mint with the raspberry, which I like.

921
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,520
- I'm going to have a quick look at another one.
- OK.

922
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,440
- Yeah, I think they're all right, actually.
- OK!

923
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,200
I was worried they were over-proved, but you've got a nice

924
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,040
- consistency in there, the flavours are beautiful.
- Thank you.

925
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,480
I just think you've overdone a couple of them on the turns.

926
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,400
- Right.
- Cocktail, madam?

927
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,880
Ho-ho-ho!

928
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,440
Happy days, eh?

929
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,640
- Here we go.
- I mean, why are we bothering with the doughnuts?

930
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,320
SHE LAUGHS

931
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,800
Wow, they're full.

932
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,840
You've made the dough quite soggy

933
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,720
because of the amount of filling in there.

934
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,440
You haven't really got a doughnut, what you've got there is

935
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,400
a coffee bomb with alcohol in it.

936
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,240
But this one I love.

937
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,520
Well, I must say, I think this one's absolutely delicious.

938
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,920
Of course you do. Mary! Have another one, Mary.

939
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,240
There you go, love.

940
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,440
- Cheers!
- Good health!

941
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,480
Thank you very much, Luis.

942
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,720
Thank you.

943
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,440
So whose doughnuts, Paul, made you happy?

944
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,800
Well, one of the things which I really like...

945
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,480
Ooh, and that's a calendar right there.

946
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,640
You've only got about 130 more to go.

947
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,120
Richard's doughnut, the rhubarb and custard was fantastic,

948
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,520
and also his apple one as well.

949
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,960
The fresh apple inside the doughnut was delicious.

950
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,200
And, Mary, whose doughnuts made you happy?

951
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,800
I think she's sitting in front of the one that made her happy.

952
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,120
Well, you might as well say that.

953
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,520
Luis, I thought he really was pretty original.

954
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,640
Do you think we could be looking at a male Star Baker then this week?

955
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,160
I think we might.

956
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,880
Nancy... Her marvellous tree, did that put her out of danger?

957
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,760
I thought it went very well for her.

958
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,680
It was quite sensible to even start with having a children's one

959
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,640
and an adult one.

960
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,920
The issue I had was the dough itself.

961
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,320
They were taken under-proved, all the fat was slightly too hot

962
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,080
because they were so irregular on colours.

963
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,120
Martha's been in trouble all weekend long.

964
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,880
Did this bake do anything to help her out?

965
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,400
Martha's doughnuts tasted OK, especially the poppy and lemon.

966
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,280
But there were issues with the dough.

967
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,960
Do you have any idea who you think should leave this weekend?

968
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,680
I definitely have somebody.

969
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,960
- MEL: Paul?
- Yeah, I do have somebody.

970
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,720
It's whether, after one of Luis' doughnuts,

971
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,360
- we can remember the name of that person.
- Oh, gosh.

972
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,520
Bakers, what a weekend it's been.

973
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,560
Thank you for providing us with some superlative dough.

974
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,960
I've got the joyful job this time,

975
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,680
and it's a bit of a Bake Off first, I think,

976
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,880
because this person who we're going to award Star Baker to this week,

977
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,760
it's not the first time this person's received it,

978
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,920
nor the second, nor the third,

979
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,760
but the fourth time. Keep the badge on, Richard.

980
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,160
- You're Star Baker, Richard. Well done!
- Crikey!

981
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,960
As you know, we alternate good news and bad news,

982
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,680
so whilst Richard, we're sharing your delight,

983
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,760
it's really hard, cos I have to send somebody home today

984
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:00,280
and so, with huge sadness, the person leaving us today is...

985
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,160
..Martha.

986
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,240
You are 17 and you are so brilliant

987
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,280
and you are going to rule the world, my darling.

988
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,000
Let some old women hug you.

989
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
- Come on. You rock.
- Thank you.

990
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,600
I've loved every minute, I've loved all the people,

991
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,080
I've made inedible things and delicious things.

992
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:24,280
I've come last and I've come first, I feel like I've done pretty

993
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,360
much everything I came here to do and I'm so happy about that.

994
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,840
- Well done, Martha.
- Thank you. 
- You're going to do really well.

995
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,120
It was so sad saying goodbye to Martha.

996
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,640
Aged 17, she's achieved so much.

997
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,120
I think her name will crop up again.

998
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,640
Well done!

999
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,040
I've already got a burst eardrum from last week!

1000
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,960
That'll be four, racked 'em up.

1001
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,200
Yeah, that feels pretty good, pretty surprising.

1002
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,960
Richard winning Star Baker four times has probably got all

1003
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,800
the others really worried.

1004
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,920
They're probably thinking, "He's done it now,

1005
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,880
"he's the judges' favourite."

1006
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,520
We have no favourites

1007
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,480
and any one of those four people in that tent could win Bake Off.

1008
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,360
'Next time, the bakers battle it out...'

1009
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,160
What are you making?

1010
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,560
'..in a countdown to the final.'

1011
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,400
- Number four.
- Three. 
- I've already lost count of layers.

1012
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,600
PHONE BEEPS

1013
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,160
That is bone-dry.

1014
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,680
This is all about top-notch patisserie.

1015
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,080
My hands are shaking.

1016
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:26,840
I've seen pastry chefs crumble at making these things, let alone

1017
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,120
the bakers in the tent.

1018
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,280
SHE SIGHS

1019
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,920
I think I've messed up here.
