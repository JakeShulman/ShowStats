1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,400
- The tension is palpable, we're halfway through. 
- It's all drama, zero gimmicks.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,960
Hang on - I've booked some men with tassels and dancing shorts.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,400
Great. That means I can still fire you out the cannon!

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,960
- Welcome... 
- ..to The Great British Bake Off!

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,040
Last time...

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,360
Freezer, freezer, freezer.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,040
..desserts proved the undoing of Iain.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,960
No, no, no, no, you've got...

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,320
Richard came out on top...

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,240
Now, that's what I call a sauce pudding.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,800
..and was crowned Star Baker for the second time.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,120
- Ooh, well done! 
- Well done, Richard.

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,560
This time...

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,560
OK...

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,600
..the bakers tackle pies and tarts.

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,960
I've got it as thin as I dare.

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,800
With a Signature that challenges the steadiest of hands.

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,760
Whoa...

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,200
A technical that gets everyone in a spin.

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,400
I think this has to be one of the strangest things I've ever done.

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,320
And a towering Showstopper...

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,400
If that stays up without falling, I'll be amazed.

23
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,400
..that might just prove too much to handle.

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,160
Oh, my goodness.

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,800
We're half way through the Bake Off,

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,160
and unfortunately Diana has been taken ill.

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,280
Everyone was expecting to see Diana today and have Diana baking with us,

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,400
so it's a bit sad that she's not here.

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,800
We're missing her already, she's a lively character

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,720
and she's good for the team.

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,320
Sadly, she won't be able to continue in the Bake Off tent.

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,760
I'm going to miss Diana so much

33
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,000
cos she's my grandma in the tent. What am I going to do?

34
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,640
Morning, bakers, and welcome back to the tent.

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,680
For the Signature Challenge today,

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,480
Paul and Mary would very much like you to make a family-sized custard tart.

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,400
Mmm... Custard.

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,640
- There are a few rules though, Sue. 
- Strict, Melly.

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,280
- Firstly, please don't put your tarts in the bin.
- No.

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,760
That would be good.

41
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,600
Got two and a half hours. On your marks...

42
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,280
- Get set, bake!
- ..Bake.

43
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,080
What am I looking for...? Sorry.

44
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,120
I love custard tarts, so I normally make the custard tart on its own,

45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,240
but I needed to spruce it up a bit so that's what I'm doing.

46
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,240
Achieving the perfect custard tart

47
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,040
takes real skill. It's all about texture.

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,440
We're looking for a crispy base, and a beautiful silky custard.

49
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,160
When it comes to the pastry,

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,600
if it's badly put in the pastry ring,

51
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,560
they'll make holes and the custard will leak out.

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,160
It is quite a difficult challenge to get really perfect.

53
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,480
Morning, Norman. What is your version of the custard tart?

54
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,520
I chose tarte au citron.

55
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,120
It's always been a favourite of mine.

56
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,080
I first tasted it in France about 20 years ago.

57
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,840
Never had anything as exotic as that before.

58
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,560
Norman's French classic will be dusted with icing sugar

59
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,480
and topped with candied lemon.

60
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,520
You've kept it simple. Very simple.

61
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,520
I haven't stretched myself today. I'm stretching myself tomorrow.

62
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,800
I like a man who knows when he's stretching himself.

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,040
- Well, you need to warm up. This is your warm up.
- It is.

64
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,320
You're making a basic tarte au citron. That thing must be beautifully level.

65
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,480
No cracks in sight, and just about set.

66
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,960
Yes.

67
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,560
I am making today

68
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,640
an apricot tart with pistachio pastry.

69
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,680
Martha will be topping her tart with runny honey -

70
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,560
but she's not feeling very confident about this challenge.

71
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,840
I like eating pastry. I just don't enjoy making it.

72
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,400
Out of all the things that you bake, this is probably my least favourite.

73
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,520
It's one of those things that if you're a bit older

74
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,320
I think you make a lot - people like Nancy

75
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,120
I think make a lot of pastry, so...

76
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,000
have to see how it goes.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,120
I'm just going to bring it together.

78
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,520
The trick is to work the dough just the right amount,

79
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,360
so that when baked it'll have a melt in the mouth crumbly texture,

80
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,320
not one that's chewy.

81
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,000
Pastry's my favourite. I love making pastry.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,240
And rather than do a sort of bog standard custard tart

83
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,800
I want to experiment a bit.

84
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,320
Nancy's using cocoa powder in her pastry,

85
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,160
and filling it with a thick passion fruit custard.

86
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,640
She'll bake it in a rather thin tin.

87
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,680
- Is that your ring? 
- Yes.
- It's very shallow.

88
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,880
With the pastry in there,

89
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,720
how much filling are you actually going to get in there?

90
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,840
Erm... Quite a lot.

91
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
Well, I wouldn't say quite a lot, when you look at that.

92
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,120
You're thinking it's going to look half pastry, half filling,

93
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,760
- but it's deceiving.
- OK.

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,160
I'm just going to put it in the fridge now.

95
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,400
It's always best to

96
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,960
chill it for quite a while before you use it.

97
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,200
It'll roll out better without cracking.

98
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Chilling the pastry is really important,

99
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,040
so I'm hoping that I've chilled it for enough time before I line it.

100
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,240
But not too long, or it won't bake.

101
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,160
- Hello, Kate.
- Hi.
- Whereabouts are you up to with your tart?

102
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,440
My pastry is in the freezer just chilling down,

103
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,280
and I've got the rhubarb on the go.

104
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,160
- So this is your classic rhubarb and custard.
- It is. It is.

105
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
Kate's rhubarb and custard tart

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,040
will feature an almond and rosemary pastry,

107
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,800
and a swirl of her rhubarb compote.

108
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,360
Any decoration on top?

109
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,480
The rhubarbs are in a swirl so I'm going to put them

110
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,040
onto the pastry case,

111
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,160
then pour the custard in and then do a swirl,

112
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,280
10, 15 minutes into the baking.

113
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,680
I'm liking the body there...

114
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,120
Well, you have to wobble it out of the oven, and

115
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,400
I don't want to leave the oven door open so I do have to put it on the top and then swirl it.

116
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,600
- I wanted to keep it simple because I love custard tarts. 
- There's nothing simple about that.

117
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,560
Well... As simple as I could.

118
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,920
At the moment I'm just preparing the fillings,

119
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,280
just need some pureed mango, which I'm just sorting out now.

120
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,760
Luis, Chetna, Richard, Nancy and Norman

121
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,440
are also flavouring their tarts with fruit.

122
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,240
But they've chosen to add it into the custard mix.

123
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,440
I haven't done this quite a lot.

124
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,320
I know that four or five lemons is just about right.

125
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,120
But changing the consistency could make it harder

126
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,240
for the custard to set.

127
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,280
I think the trickiest ting about custard is

128
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,960
getting the egg to other ingredients right.

129
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,840
If you've got too little egg, then it's not going to set.

130
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,840
If you've got too much egg, it's a bit rubbery and not very nice.

131
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,240
Luis's making a tropical fruit tart,

132
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,880
that hails from a region not often known for its sunshine.

133
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,560
- Morning.
- Morning, Luis.

134
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,760
So what's your version of a tart?

135
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,600
OK. I'm doing a tropical Manchester tart.

136
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,000
The flavours are passion fruit, orange, lime and some mango puree.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,520
So what's the Mancunian element?

138
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,880
- Er - the Mancunian is it's made by a Mancunian.
- That works for me.

139
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,000
This is for poaching figs,

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,160
this is dessert wine with cinnamon, honey and peppercorns as well.

141
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,920
When they're out of season, figs are just texture and no taste, so

142
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,560
hopefully poaching them will bring some of the sweetness out.

143
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,280
Richard's tart features an almond pastry.

144
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,840
He's setting his poached figs in a basic custard with a twist.

145
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,080
I love an orange custard, but

146
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,480
cos it had to be special I thought I'd put some poached figs in it.

147
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,760
Orange and fig together should work quite well.

148
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,200
The orange coming through should be nice and sharp,

149
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,080
and those figs should be beautiful when you put a knife through them.

150
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,000
I hope they are. They taste nice at home.

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,360
Chetna is going one step further than everyone else,

153
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,400
by adding fruit and rice to her mix.

154
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,640
We have a pudding in India which is called kheer

155
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,600
and it's made in milk and rice.

156
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,840
And usually in the summer season you eat mango with it,

157
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,960
so I've thought I'll try and mix it together.

158
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,000
Chetna's kheer-inspired custard tart

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,440
is topped with fresh mangoes and raspberries.

160
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,000
She's paying close attention to balancing her flavours.

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,520
It's not an extremely sweet tart, it's just mildly sweet

162
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,920
so I'm going to make the rice slightly sweet

163
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,360
and have the custard on top of it.

164
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,040
The downside with it is because it's dark in colour,

165
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,760
if you start adding extra flour you'll alter the colour of it.

166
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,920
So I'm not using any flour at all to roll it out.

167
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,560
You don't want the pastry too thin because

168
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,840
it can spring holes and leak but

169
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,520
at the same time you do want thin pastry because...

170
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,440
I dunno - thinner the better, really.

171
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,840
It's just sticking a lot and I'm having to roll it again

172
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,680
which is a nightmare because it makes it a bit tougher.

173
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,640
I'm having to add a bit more flour which I don't want to do, but...

174
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,520
we'll get it in there.

175
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,440
I've decided to use clingfilm,

176
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,720
because you can get the pastry really thin and kind of

177
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,320
pick up the whole sheet like that, and then...

178
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,800
Not making this look easy.

179
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,840
..roll it over like that.

180
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,400
Sort it out while it's in there.

181
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Because it's too... I'm working it way too much.

182
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,120
And I'll just patch it up at the sides.

183
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,960
At the moment I'm just lining my tart tin.

184
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,440
I've got it as thin as I dare,

185
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,760
and I'm just going to blind bake the pastry case.

186
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,360
When you blind bake pastry,

187
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,760
what happens is the fat sets, the pastry cooks,

188
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,720
and then when you pour your liquid in,

189
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,400
it's already got a solid base to sit in

190
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,160
otherwise it'd all just go really soggy and messy.

191
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,520
Blind baking the pastry is essential,

192
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,560
and SHOULD stop any leaks.

193
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,080
BEEP

194
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,400
Oh, this is my worst bit.

195
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,000
I feel so nervous today. I don't really know why.

196
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,400
Are you a pie or a tart?

197
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,800
- Oh, a tart.
- Yeah. I'm a tart as well.

198
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,920
- I am too.
- Yeah.

199
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,360
Look at our hairdos.

200
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,800
I think we've got slightly tart hairdos today.

201
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,600
OK, bakers, that's one hour remaining. You can't keep a tart waiting.

202
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,280
Time is money, time is money. Come on!

203
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,000
- You OK? 
- Yes, I just hate making pastry...

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,960
Oh, yours looks really good!

205
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,760
The next tricky thing is I've got to trim the pastry.

206
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,600
So I have to literally carve away at it.

207
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,280
To achieve a perfect finish,

208
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,480
the edges of the pastry case need to be delicately trimmed

209
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,760
while still hot.

210
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,320
- You pleased with that?
- Yeah, it's come out neat, hasn't it?

211
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,880
- Hasn't it?
- Yeah it's really neat.

212
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,480
Yeah, the key to making a good tart I suppose is

213
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,600
making a nice job of the pastry, you know.

214
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,760
I'm just making sure it's all clear of the edge,

215
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,120
so it's got a nice clear edge when I take it out of the case.

216
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,160
A steady hand is vital,

217
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,120
as the custard is poured into the pastry cases.

218
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,520
Any overspill could be disastrous.

219
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,160
TIMER BEEPS

220
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,080
Shush!

221
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,640
If you kind of carry it from here full and put it in

222
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,480
it's a recipe for disaster, so

223
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,600
fill it halfway, put it in the oven,

224
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,320
fill the rest in the oven door.

225
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,320
Whoa...

226
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,600
Well done, well done. Don't slip it over!

227
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,480
Oh...

228
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,840
Bit of a spill, but...hopefully that'll dribble out.

229
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,800
Nothing to do but wait now, innit? Might taste a bit of custard.

230
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,880
Right, bakers, I know you're all pie-eyed by this stage

231
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,480
but you still have half an hour left.

232
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,920
The real challenge is knowing when to take the tarts out.

233
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,720
I think it's got a wobble. Hopefully it has.

234
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,840
It's still got a little bit of a tremble. Which is what I want.

235
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,680
Looks pretty good to me.

236
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,800
It's the moment of truth, I'm just going to take it out of the case.

237
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,320
How does he do it? Every time.

238
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,360
OK, bakers, that's five minutes!

239
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm going to turn it up a bit.

240
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,200
I knew it was going to be... Yeah, it was going to be tight.

241
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,280
It's not as set as I would like, but

242
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,320
I think I'm going to need to get it out now.

243
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,680
Well, some custard did escape, didn't it?

244
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,600
Come on, metal base. Come on!

245
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,760
- Can't get it out.
- Can I help you?

246
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,640
- It's just about to fall off, move it that way a bit.
- Is it?

247
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,600
OK. I reckon it's going to come off now.

248
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,000
No. No, no...

249
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Ooh... This side's nearly off. Oh, no!

250
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,760
It's OK...

251
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,240
Well done!

252
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,120
Icing sugar gives it a nice finish.

253
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,840
Right, has to come out... Oh, no, that's fine.

254
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,600
Oh, phew!

255
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,760
Pastry, over!

256
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,800
I like it short.

257
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,240
SHE SIGHS

258
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,640
The bakers won't know if they've succeeded

259
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,520
until Paul and Mary cut into their tarts.

260
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,160
Erm... I think it looks a mess, if I'm honest.

261
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,600
A tarte au citron should be clean, sharp and very neat.

262
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,720
It is just baked. It could have done with a little bit more.

263
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,320
The flavour is fantastic -

264
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,880
but I think overall the presentation is not good.

265
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,640
Considering that you had all that time to make one mix and a pastry,

266
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,280
I expected something a little bit better.

267
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,360
Nancy, it looks totally original. Very attractive.

268
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,600
I like the idea that it's shallow,

269
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,400
because I know that Paul was a bit worried about

270
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,480
not all the filling getting in.

271
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,680
- I like that, Nancy. 
- SHE LAUGHS

272
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,840
- I think the whole thing, it works. It's very good.
- Thank you very much.

273
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,680
I think you could have cooked your rice a bit longer.

274
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,920
- Oh.
- I think the pastry is excellent, the look of it looks good,

275
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,920
but I think you missed it on the flavours. For the first time,

276
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,960
you've missed it on the flavours.

277
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,720
Right. Are we going to get that rhubarb coming through?

278
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,240
It's in the bottom and on the top.

279
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,280
It's custard. It's almost, your taste buds are picking up

280
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,040
the tang from the rhubarb but not the flavour.

281
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,000
But it's lovely pastry, beautiful decoration

282
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,760
- and a well flavoured custard. 
- Thank you.

283
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,680
We've had a little bit of...

284
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,760
Was that leakage, or going on the way to the oven?

285
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,800
That was me being a clumsy lad.

286
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,720
As I put it in, I knocked it...

287
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,320
- But you've got a steady hand. You've shown us in the past.
- Usually!

288
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,560
- I was really looking forward to tasting the orange.
- Mmm.

289
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,440
- Very little orange comes through. It's a shame.
- Oh, well.

290
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,320
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

291
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,560
The first thing you look at it,

292
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,760
it needs a shine, a lovely glaze of some sort.

293
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,720
There's a lot of moisture there, isn't there,

294
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,400
- a lot of wetness, coming through from those apricots.
- Yes.

295
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Looks as though that pastry is not quite done underneath.

296
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,280
I think the consistency, looking at it,

297
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,920
should be a little bit firmer.

298
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,520
- I'm not convinced about the flavour. 
- Oh, OK.

299
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,600
- It's quite tart, apricot.
- OK. 
- For me in the custard.

300
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,080
- Thank you very much, Martha. 
- Thank you.

301
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,560
The pastry from here looks perfect.

302
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,640
Very thin, a perfect colour.

303
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,400
The custard has got a lovely shine. Perfect set.

304
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,160
Nice and thin, the pastry as well, sides and bottom.

305
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,040
OK, thank you.

306
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,120
You've got the sharpness coming through,

307
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,200
all the citrus fruits coming through really well.

308
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,720
Very difficult to critique, actually. But thank you.

309
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,240
- Thank you very much, guys. 
- Thank you.

310
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,960
I guess it's just hard when you spend

311
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,560
two and a half hours making something

312
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,200
for them to kind of hate it. It's quite...quite hard.

313
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,480
And it hasn't happened to me yet, so...

314
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,640
I had a really good round there, I think,

315
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,720
so erm... yeah, I'm totally delighted.

316
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,840
Paul said he couldn't critique it, he couldn't find a fault with it,

317
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,840
and... I mean, that's just fantastic.

318
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,080
Paul said that this is the first time

319
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,960
I missed on my flavours.

320
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,400
But I thought, just to get a hint of everything -

321
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,280
I should have just gone... bang, you know.

322
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,400
It went marvellously well,

323
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,880
so yeah, I'm really pleased. Relieved.

324
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,400
When you're planning a wedding you might think,

325
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,800
big white meringue dress - tick.

326
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,080
Live salsa band - tick.

327
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,440
Cake to break over the bride's head...what?

328
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,840
I tell you what, brides have it very easy these days compared to days of yore.

329
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,880
An edible centrepiece is a long established ritual on the tables of wedding feasts.

330
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,680
But rather than the cutting of a tiered white cake that we know today,

331
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,720
past traditions were a little more unusual.

332
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,800
For some time it was customary for the groom to break a bride cake

333
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,920
over his beloved's head for good luck.

334
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,600
Another alleged ritual was for a couple to kiss

335
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,840
over a pile of scones and biscuits.

336
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,960
But perhaps the most intriguing was the 17th century bride pie.

337
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,600
Everyone's familiar with wedding cakes, or bride cakes,

338
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,360
as they were called, and they've been around for a very long time,

339
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,080
but we also used to have the savoury elements in the bridal feast - pies.

340
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,640
If you look some of the ingredients up, they're nearly all aphrodisiacs.

341
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,960
So good for bridal chamber activity and hopefully children to come.

342
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,520
Exactly.

343
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Amongst sweet and savoury ingredients, arguably the most potent

344
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,720
to encourage a fertile wedding night was lamb testicles.

345
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,200
There's a real whiff of locker room about this, isn't there?

346
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,160
I think there is, but there are other ingredients too.

347
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,840
We've got sweetbreads, ox cheek, or ox pallet, and the most powerful

348
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,800
aphrodisiac of the Renaissance period, globe artichokes.

349
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,840
There is something about the look of this which is not...

350
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,200
- Does it remind you a little bit of something else?
- Not dissimilar.
- Yes!

351
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,560
This is a bride pie for the top layer of society.

352
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,840
It's made to a recipe from one of the great English cookery authors

353
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,240
of the 17th century, a man called Robert May.

354
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,960
Oh, lord, hang on. What's this?

355
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,400
Some of the later recipes tell you to put the glass ring in

356
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,000
and the person who finds it is likely to be the next one to be wed.

357
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,880
It's rather like the bridal bouquet being thrown now.

358
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,400
But, Ivan, I think we've been through something quite special together,

359
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,480
what with all the aphrodisiacs, so really I have to make it official.

360
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,680
Will you marry me? Doesn't quite fit there.

361
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,760
- Just a minute, I haven't said "I will" yet!
- Oh, yes, sorry!

362
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,920
- SUE:
- The bakers were able to practise making their first pastry dish

363
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,600
at home, but they have no idea what's coming next.

364
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,760
Bakers, time for the dreaded fiendish technical challenge.

365
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,160
Now this week, it is one of Paul's recipes.

366
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,080
Paul, if you could leave the tent before you say something we regret.

367
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,520
Off you go now, Paul. And Mary.

368
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,280
Now, this is the deal, bakers.

369
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,160
Mary and Paul, please, would like you to make...

370
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,360
mini pear pies.

371
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,880
Now, they are made with a perfectly poached pear

372
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,840
surrounded by spirals of rough puff pastry

373
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,440
and baked until golden brown.

374
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,480
You've got two hours to do this, so...

375
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
- On your marks...
- Get set... 
- Bake!

376
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,560
I have absolutely not a clue what we are doing.

377
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,400
I have never made a mini pear pie. I've never even poached a pear.

378
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,720
It seems quite straightforward,

379
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,200
although I've never seen this recipe before.

380
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,600
But I shall bash along with it.

381
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,840
- PAUL:
- There they are, Mary!

382
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,280
Gosh, they look quite something.

383
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,440
Why did you choose pear pies for a challenge?

384
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,640
I think it's a great challenge to check their timing.

385
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,680
First of all they've got to make a cheat's puff pastry,

386
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,240
but the other angle is they've got to poach a pear, and bake it,

387
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,680
so the tricky thing is trying to cool the pear

388
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,480
and trying to chill the dough.

389
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,720
If the pear's too hot, the pastry will just simply fall off.

390
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,360
And this is just perfection.

391
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,360
Both the pear and the pastry are perfectly cooked.

392
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,800
It's a very difficult challenge but we're here to test them.

393
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,480
I'm just reading the pastry ingredients,

394
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,880
making sure I've got everything.

395
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,320
And it says combine all the ingredients to make a quick

396
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,080
puff pastry, so that's what I'm going to do.

397
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,000
We're trying to make a quick rough puff, which basically involves

398
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,480
knocking up a bit of dough and folding some fat into it.

399
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,840
I've literally never heard of this pudding, so I'll be flying blind.

400
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,600
It'll be a nice voyage of discovery for me today.

401
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,760
This is ready, I'm going to roll it out.

402
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,400
I'm just going to dot the fat into it and then start folding it.

403
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,080
The fat has to stay in big chunks so that then we get some flakes.

404
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,800
Something scientific probably happens to it.

405
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,000
If they're too heavy-handed with the dough at this stage,

406
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,360
the fat could melt and the pastry won't achieve distinctive layers.

407
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,160
Fold the top third up, bottom third...no.

408
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,760
Top third down and then the bottom third up and over the top third.

409
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,720
Turn 90 degrees, which I've just done,

410
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,000
and then roll out again and then repeat the fold and roll.

411
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,160
I feel a bit under pressure that I need to do well in this

412
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,960
because this morning wasn't brilliant, to say the least.

413
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,040
You have to chill it because the butter

414
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,760
and the lard start melting cos you're handling it, and you want

415
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,520
the butter and lard to stay intact and be like a marbled effect.

416
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,560
So by chilling it they go hard again,

417
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,360
so when you roll and fold they don't just vanish into the dough.

418
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,440
They need to repeat this process twice more before the pastry

419
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,920
is ready to be baked.

420
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,160
Right, mine's on the bottom layer of the fridge.

421
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,720
- OK, mine's middle, hers is top. 
- Awesome.

422
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,800
Prepping the pears.

423
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,720
All it says is to prep the pears and make the poaching syrup.

424
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,320
So I'm going to do that.

425
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,600
The poaching syrup is a mixture of white wine, sugar,

426
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,480
orange zest and cinnamon.

427
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,600
I've got the pastry chilling in the fridge. I'm halfway through peeling

428
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,600
the pears. I'm just getting the poaching liquid on to heat up now.

429
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,160
I have poached pears once, that was absolutely years ago.

430
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,600
If the pears are poached for too long, they'll collapse

431
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,200
when wrapped in pastry.

432
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,880
I don't want them completely soft

433
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,400
because they're going to cook a little bit more in the oven,

434
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,760
but I want them so you don't want to cut into them and to be hard.

435
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,600
Not quite sure how long they take but once they're soft,

436
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,880
that'll be a good indication they're done.

437
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,560
Too sweet for me.

438
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,720
I won't be drinking that.

439
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,040
Bakers, you've got an hour till we want to see Paul's mini pear pies

440
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,040
out on your benches.

441
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,440
I'm ready to go into the fridge, get my pastry out

442
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,760
and give it a roll and put it back in again.

443
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,200
There is an element of repetition in this

444
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,560
but it's mixed with the fear of hoping I don't ruin my pears.

445
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,040
I don't really know when my pears are done, so...

446
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,760
I know it's not allowed but I'm looking at other people.

447
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,600
- Think they're done. 
- Are they nice and soft? Your pears?

448
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,800
That's a good question, let's test.

449
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,320
I've got a nice pear, Luis.

450
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,640
Are they soft enough?

451
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,160
I think so. What's the worst that could happen?

452
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,800
Well...you don't get through to next week?

453
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,960
Yeah. Put them back in.

454
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,240
I'm joking, I'm joking.

455
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,680
I might take them out now.

456
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,400
The big challenge is to successfully wrap the pears.

457
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,440
The bakers need to judge the perfect moment -

458
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,400
if the pears are too hot, the pastry will slip off mid-bake.

459
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,320
I've just put the pears in the fridge,

460
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,160
because I think they need to be cold before you put the pastry on them

461
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,960
because otherwise I think they're going to be really hot

462
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,600
and the pastry will just melt, and that will not be very good.

463
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,040
And they've only got 40 minutes to go.

464
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,160
It's the last folding, because it still needs to rest again,

465
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,880
then come out and then roll it and then cut thinly

466
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,120
and then put it on the pears and then...bake!

467
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,680
Very large, long rectangle, right.

468
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,800
It says in the recipe to roll it no thicker than five millimetres.

469
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,640
I think I'm slightly thinner.

470
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,040
Half an hour left.

471
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,360
With an ideal bake time of 25 minutes, and none of the pears

472
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,080
yet wrapped, all of the bakers are cutting it fine.

473
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,480
Very concerned about time.

474
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,080
How are we supposed to cut these strips in this time?

475
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,120
The pears need to be coated in a thin layer of poaching syrup

476
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,680
to help the pastry stay firmly in place.

477
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,120
"Starting from the bottom, wrap the pastry strips round each one."

478
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
Give that a try. One way or another.

479
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,160
Argh! Come on, come on, come on.

480
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,720
I think this has to be up there with one of the strangest things

481
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,440
I've ever done.

482
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,080
It's like mummifying a pear.

483
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,320
This pastry is extremely thick,

484
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,080
possibly even too thick.

485
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,760
Considering I have no idea what they're meant to look like,

486
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,680
I'm not too unhappy with how they look.

487
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,280
I'm going to put three in and then the other three join them

488
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,880
when they are made, because I prefer to have three cooked

489
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,440
than none cooked. Right, in these three go.

490
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,240
Come on, pears, at least three of you can bake.

491
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,880
I'm going to put the temperature up.

492
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,640
OK, bakers, 15 minutes!

493
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,640
On the only challenge where if it goes pear-shaped, it's going right.

494
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,160
Really, really, really pushed for time.

495
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,120
I thought they would take 20 minutes.

496
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,040
Now, because I haven't got that long, I'm going to say 15!

497
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,960
Whack up the oven.

498
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,880
Hopefully they won't need long

499
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,720
because they ain't going to get long.

500
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,520
No way they're going to be done in time.

501
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,800
Let's get that heat up. Well, I think they need about

502
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,480
20 minutes in the oven, but we've only got ten minutes left.

503
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,840
It's beginning to catch colour, just beginning to.

504
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,760
There's one at the back that I think looks really good.

505
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,160
I'm going to put that one right under their nose.

506
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,200
I'm not really impressed with these but they might be all right.

507
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,640
Mine's all gone to pot anyway, all mine have fallen off.

508
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,120
Oh.

509
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,560
OK, bakers, you've got one minute left before Paul turns up!

510
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,600
One minute!

511
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,120
I think I'm going to get them out now.

512
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,920
They've got a good colour on them.

513
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,960
OK, puff pear pie purveyors,

514
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,520
this challenge is now over.

515
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,760
Please leave your pears

516
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,520
and bring them up and put them behind your photo, please.

517
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,840
Mary and Paul are looking for perfectly poached pears,

518
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,400
well wrapped, in a thin golden brown pastry.

519
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,280
Right, shall we have a look at this one?

520
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,920
What we're looking for is thin strips to go round.

521
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,960
These look like thinnish strips.

522
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,840
And it has held together.

523
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,280
The pear's poached lovely, the pastry's got a bit of crunch

524
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,840
on the outside but it's just raw on the inside, isn't it?

525
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,680
It just hasn't been in there long enough.

526
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,080
Moving onto this...mess, pastry was too thick going on.

527
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,200
Probably you put it on when it was too hot

528
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,880
and the whole thing concertinaed down into a mess.

529
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,800
Pear's not quite done.

530
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,760
Pear's not... No, it isn't poached properly either.

531
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,120
We have got some thinner sheets going round there

532
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,880
but just not long enough in the oven.

533
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,920
This isn't too bad, actually.

534
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,360
Nice colour, nice swirls going up

535
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,680
and actually they've got a bit of flake on there as well.

536
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,560
This one's got a bit of colour.

537
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,000
And it's sort of got the swirls round it. Slipped a bit at the top.

538
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,320
I think the pear could have done with a bit longer, don't you, Mary?

539
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
It's acceptable.

540
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,360
This one's got a nice spiral on, it's covering all the pear.

541
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,440
Probably needed a little bit longer in the oven

542
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,600
looking at the colour here. This one looks good.

543
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,720
Nice strong colour.

544
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,920
Good with flavour. It's nice.

545
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,520
The pears are done. When you look at it, it's a gorgeous

546
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,200
golden brown colour.

547
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,880
- This one shows that it can be done. 
- Yeah.

548
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,120
But which bake went the least, or the most, pear-shaped?

549
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,120
Seventh place is this one. Richard.

550
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,400
What a shocker, eh?

551
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,160
Absolutely. Now, obviously, I think the pastry was too thick.

552
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,080
You put it on too warm.

553
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,040
But the poaching of the pear was...was under-done!

554
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,640
- I think I got a full house, didn't I?
- Yeah, you did.

555
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,080
And in sixth place, this one. It's not quite cooked.

556
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,200
MEL: Norman takes fifth place, and Nancy fourth.

557
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,480
Number three is this one. Not bad, Kate.

558
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,320
Nice colour on this as well.

559
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,360
And in second place...

560
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,320
- You've got a good bake and a well flavoured pear.
- Thank you.

561
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,880
Obviously in first place, is this one. Well done, Martha.

562
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,320
The pastry was nice and thin, the pear was poached well.

563
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,160
The whole thing together, that's what you needed to do.

564
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,120
I feel amazing coming first!

565
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,960
This morning I was like weepy Martha who made a rubbish custard tart,

566
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,280
and now I've completely forgotten about that and it's just amazing.

567
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,800
Awful! What an awful task!

568
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,720
I'll never wrap a piece of fruit in pastry again,

569
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,840
I'll be honest with you. Hated it.

570
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,240
I think that was as bad as it could possibly have gone.

571
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,000
I think I would have probably done better

572
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,840
had I set the tent on fire, to be honest.

573
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,600
So, Paul and Mary, we're halfway through Bake Off now.

574
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,440
At this point,

575
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,800
surely there's some indication as to who is doing really well.

576
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,360
I think Luis has to be up there.

577
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,120
I think his first tart was very good,

578
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,440
although his technical wasn't particularly good.

579
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,880
And Nancy, the chocolate tart she made,

580
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,600
so flavoursome and a very polished finish.

581
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,760
I think Kate is being particularly good as well.

582
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,200
Her rhubarb didn't come through, but the custard was good

583
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,040
and the bake was good and she was third in the technical.

584
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,120
So if we look at the other end of the spectrum

585
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,840
and those who haven't done so well.

586
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,720
I wasn't convinced that Martha's Signature Bake was that good.

587
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,920
But she came first in the technical.

588
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,880
I think that Norman is in a difficult position.

589
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,080
He was doing a tarte au citron.

590
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:05,200
Although the flavour was very good, the actual finish was not good.

591
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,240
The one that surprised me this week is Richard.

592
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:12,080
Bottom of the technical and sort of for me mid-station on his Signature.

593
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,600
- OK, well, all to play for? 
- They've got a big day today.

594
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,280
- Have they? What they up to? 
- They've got a very big day.
- Oh!

595
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,800
Hello, bakers, and welcome to your pie Showstopper.

596
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,520
Now, Paul and Mary asked you to make a pie with tiers.

597
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,120
Doesn't mean there's sadness involved in the making of it,

598
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,480
just layers.

599
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,720
And, unlike Mel and myself on a night out,

600
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,480
they must be able to support themselves.

601
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,000
Now, these pies can be sweet or savoury,

602
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,120
that's completely up to you. You can use any pastry you desire.

603
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,040
Four and a half hours to do your three-tiered pie. On your marks...

604
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,840
- Get set...
- Bake!

605
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,400
Right...spoon.

606
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,560
We've asked for a three-tiered pie minimum - could be more tiers.

607
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,720
The pastry is all-important.

608
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,880
They've got to choose a good strong pastry to hold the filling

609
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,160
and that will support the other tiers.

610
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,880
- PAUL:
- This is a pie challenge.

611
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,800
The choice of fillings and flavours is entirely up to them.

612
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,280
But theme it, have a reason so they all link together,

613
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,480
that'll be the key thing.

614
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,840
They've got to really think about this challenge.

615
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,280
Trying to be really tidy today

616
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,640
because there's so much stuff on my bench.

617
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,840
- Hello, Luis. 
- Morning. You all right?

618
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,080
Tell us your pies, please.

619
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,080
OK, I am making, I call it the Four Fruity Seasons Tower.

620
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,480
And each one represents a different season.

621
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,240
What it is at a glance, they look like fruit pies,

622
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,360
because the tops are all fruit filled,

623
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,680
but inside they're actually different meats.

624
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,240
Luis's Fruity Season Pies will all be wrapped up in

625
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,840
plain hot water crust pastry and split over four tiers.

626
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,360
Luis, you know you only have to make three tiers, m'love.

627
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,280
You've made this quite hard for yourself.

628
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,560
Well, the top one is only tiny.

629
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,720
It was minimum of three tiers, and knowing you,

630
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,680
you like to go to the extra mile.

631
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,600
I do, but I have kept them a bit smaller than normal.

632
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,720
I'm making my hot water crust pastry,

633
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,120
and I'm going to have to go in with my hands straightaway.

634
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,040
Even though it's quite hot.

635
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,280
Like Luis,

636
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,040
Kate, Richard and Martha are making all of their pies

637
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,760
with hot water crust pastry.

638
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,040
I'm using hot water crust pastry because it is just strong.

639
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,400
You can probably build a house out of it, to be honest.

640
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,920
I'm just going to knead it a bit more.

641
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,280
I love a hot water crust pastry, it's such a nice thing to work with.

642
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,920
But if it's too hot it kind of drops in the pan,

643
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,800
but if it's too cold it breaks and can be brittle.

644
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,200
Kate will fill all three of her hot water crust pies with pork,

645
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,600
and they'll be individually flavoured with a rhubarb,

646
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,360
prune and apple coulis.

647
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,120
I'm sticking to one kind of pastry. I think it looks nice

648
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,960
and I do make them a bit at home, but they take a long time to cook.

649
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,360
So I need to get the pastry done really quickly.

650
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,680
- Morning, Martha.
- Hello. 
- Hello, Martha.

651
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,760
So what have you chosen for your three-tiered pie? Have you got a theme?

652
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,880
Yeah, I'm making like, a three little pigs themed pie.

653
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,960
And here we are!

654
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,520
Martha's making a chorizo, pulled pork and traditional pork pie

655
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,240
and is going the extra mile with her pastries.

656
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,240
I love the idea that you're flavouring the hot water crust pastry -

657
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,280
hopefully the colour should come through,

658
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,000
but more the flavour as well.

659
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,440
I'm looking forward to huffing and puffing, and blowing your pie in my direction.

660
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,440
It's going straight...

661
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,560
in my face.

662
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,400
Chetna, Richard and Norman are pre-cooking their fillings before baking their pies in the oven.

663
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,680
This can help stop moist fillings seeping into the pastry, making it soggy.

664
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:57,160
I'm making three pies. One is a venison, haggis and spinach pie.

665
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,520
The fish course is a haddock and cheese sauce,

666
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,800
and the dessert's a raspberry and passion fruit meringue pie.

667
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,280
Norman's dessert pie will be crowned with a lavender meringue,

668
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,120
and sit on top his Pieful Tower.

669
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:15,240
He's set himself the additional challenge of making three different types of pastry.

670
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,640
I suppose I'm stretching myself a bit. I've been here long enough now

671
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,680
to see how things work, and I'm going to aim a wee bit higher today, you know.

672
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:30,080
- Hello, Richard.
- Morning.
- What have you decided to do?
- I'm doing posh builder pies today.

673
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,560
- Nice! Nice!
- What's that then? Full English breakfast pie? Steak and chips pie?
- With doughnuts?

674
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,640
It's steak and ale pie, and chicken and mushroom.

675
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,600
Richard's three hot water crust pies

676
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,160
will also include something for pudding.

677
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,320
There's going to be a pear and apple pie with a frangipane base on it as well.

678
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,720
- What pastry are you using for that? 
- I'm using hot water crust for that one as well.

679
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,320
Interesting. Never had a dessert inside a hot water crust pastry before.

680
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,880
It stays nice and sweet, I'm cooking the pears down so they're almost caramelised.

681
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,920
You're very brave, Richard, going back to the old pear.

682
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,400
I know I've got to get back on the horse with pears.

683
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,000
Good man - face your nemesis, come on. Exposure therapy.

684
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,640
I'm just dividing up for the first two pies here.

685
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,080
The bakers need to take extra care rolling their dough to the perfect thickness.

686
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,640
Strong pastry is essential to stand up to moist fillings

687
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,480
and support pies stacked on top of each other.

688
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,840
That's not too bad.

689
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,880
At the moment I'm just lining the first tin.

690
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,040
With it being hot water crust it's pretty robust, so I always do it

691
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,520
to about five or six mil thick, which is plenty to be honest, you

692
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,080
don't want it too thick otherwise it's a bit white and gooey inside.

693
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,000
So I'm just patching up any kind of thinner looking areas

694
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,640
because I think once you've got all the fat bubbling away,

695
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,360
the thin bits of pastry do tend to split, which will make it leak.

696
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,520
Nancy's preparing her first pie, but to make life more difficult

697
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,400
she's hand-raising it without using a tin.

698
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,880
It's a bit awkward because I need three hands, really.

699
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,160
Got to build the filling up

700
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,920
and at the same time build the pastry up over the edge.

701
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,840
Nancy is filling her hot water crust pie with chicken and gammon.

702
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,360
She's also hand-raising her two sweet pies.

703
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,000
- Hello, Nancy.
- Morning. 
- What are your two?

704
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,840
- I'm going to make a trio of apple pies.
- Nice.

705
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,640
I'm doing a hot water crust pastry for this with dried apple

706
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,280
in the middle, then I'm going to do puff pastry galette

707
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,000
with creamed apple filling, and then my top pie is a simple

708
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,560
shortcrust one crust pie of blackberry and apples, and no tins.

709
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,880
No tins?

710
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,280
No tins on anything.

711
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,880
You've got to be aware of fat bottoms on some of these pies.

712
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,120
Nancy, they're like children. Raised by hand...

713
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,400
- With fat bottoms.
- And then supported...with fat bottoms.

714
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,120
Chetna is also stretching herself, by making all of her pies

715
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,200
from different pastries.

716
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,720
I am making four different pies. This one's the hot water crust.

717
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,000
It is a bit risky to do so many different pastries,

718
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,480
but it's just a perfect mix of pastry and my flavours.

719
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,680
Chetna's four fusion pies are themed around classic Indian dishes.

720
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,520
There'll be made from a combination of hot water crust,

721
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,800
shortcrust and flaky pastry.

722
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,160
You've got an awful lot of spices,

723
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,920
is this going to be hot pies or are they going to be aromatic?

724
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,440
They're not going to be spicy hot

725
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,640
but they're going to have lots of flavours in it.

726
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,920
Your flavouring is always good.

727
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,000
Except, I feel, for your Signature,

728
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,040
so that...

729
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,000
- You shaking there a bit, Chetna? 
- Yeah.

730
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,240
Right, going in with the prune.

731
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,600
With hot water crust pastry you don't have to blind bake,

732
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,160
it's literally make your pastry, fill it,

733
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,840
put your lid on, in the oven, there's no need to do anything else.

734
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,400
The bakers must be careful not to over-fill their pastry cases.

735
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,200
Too much filling and the pies might burst.

736
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,400
I'm just flattening out the haggis to go in the bottom of the pie

737
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,920
and the venison will rest on top of that.

738
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,880
Normski. Would it be appropriate to quote some Robert Burns?

739
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,480
Would you address the haggis?

740
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,360
Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the puddin'-race!

741
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,000
Well are you worthy of a grace As long as my arm.

742
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,880
I ken you're awful smelly but you'll soon be doon ma belly.

743
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,200
There's a lot of verses to that but those are all the ones I know.

744
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,880
I like that one, what was it?

745
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,280
I know you're very smelly but you'll soon be in my belly?

746
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,840
That's right! Spot on.

747
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,600
It's an orangey colour anyway which is what it'll be when it's cooked,

748
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,960
which can make it a bit harder to see when it's cooked.

749
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,600
But I'm more scared of under-cooking than over-cooking here.

750
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,360
Right, one in.

751
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,080
Ooh, that's a tight squeeze!

752
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,840
Ahhh. Two down.

753
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,080
One part of my mind's telling me it's time for a cup of coffee.

754
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,160
The other part's saying, time to get on with it.

755
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,000
So two of my pies are in the oven, I'm doing four.

756
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,360
Now I'm making the flaky, which is the fourth pie.

757
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,600
I'm just making my second batch of hot water crust pastry.

758
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,240
I've got two pies in the oven

759
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,480
and now I'm just knocking up the final pie.

760
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,480
"Knocking up." Lovingly crafting the final pie!

761
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,600
It's for a sweet pie, sitting on the top

762
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,960
and we'll pop this into the fridge until this pie comes out.

763
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,920
I want a pencil, really. Richard, can I...? Thank you.

764
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,920
OK, bakers, you've got one hour, so put a lid on it!

765
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,880
I need another 15 minutes. Third in, one more to go.

766
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,600
I'm just laying the sweet potato, I've got kind of like, pulled pork

767
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,560
and then sweet potato layers going through the pie.

768
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,680
I'm nearly there, I just need to get this in and can relax a bit.

769
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,960
Relax? Then you've got to worry about them bursting...

770
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,360
I just need to get this one in then I'm done.

771
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,280
And we're going in.

772
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,200
An hour till the end of the challenge,

773
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,520
and I think it'll probably take an hour.

774
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,120
Which one's that then?

775
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,000
That's apple, pear and frangipane in the bottom,

776
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,080
- hopefully the frangipane will have kept it...
- That looks good.

777
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:01,400
I worry there's so much in it that the frangipane might still be a little bit un-frangipaned.

778
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,520
This is the Italian meringue for my top pie.

779
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,320
And it's raspberry and passion fruit,

780
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,960
so I'm hoping this will thicken up on time.

781
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,800
The raspberry and sugar will set, but I've also got cornflour in it.

782
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,760
That's sort of the belt and braces, if you like.

783
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,760
Right, you bunch of pie-ro-maniacs. You've got 30 minutes left on the clock.

784
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,440
That's it, they're all out.

785
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,760
So just need them to cool a bit and I can start stacking them up.

786
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,920
Not too bad, actually. Not too bad.

787
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,920
Going to just pipe something onto my hand. This tastes of lavender!

788
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,400
It does.

789
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,240
It really tastes of lavender.

790
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,520
I tell you what, I'm going to have a look,

791
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,320
make sure this is cooked underneath.

792
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,920
It should be.

793
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,600
Yeah.

794
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,680
Ooh.

795
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,520
Oh, my goodness.

796
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,360
- Martha, what's going... Ooh! 
- It's having a plumbing problem!

797
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,280
We've got a little bit of weepage there.

798
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,360
OK, so what is that leaking?

799
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,160
It's leaking fat, which is gross.

800
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,920
I think I might put it back in the oven to dry out.

801
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,480
On the plus side at least you can work out exactly how much liquid's been lost.

802
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:25,040
OK, ten minutes to get yourself out of hot water...crust.

803
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,840
OK...

804
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,320
Hey, check this out. Spirit level!

805
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:55,240
Now...I don't think Paul Hollywood will be very impressed with this pie.

806
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,760
Maybe if I can just take off the burnt bit...

807
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,000
I just hope they won't moan about the colour.

808
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,160
That's my only worry.

809
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,800
Thing is it's such a big pie you've got to cook it through,

810
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,880
so you're going to get a bit catching on the top.

811
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,800
Are you worried about that?

812
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,840
I am a little bit.

813
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,040
If that stays up, without falling, I'll be amazed.

814
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,280
When I practised, I think

815
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,120
I must have made the bottom pie a little bit bigger.

816
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,640
There we go.

817
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,120
Sur-pies! You've got one minute left.

818
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,560
Ooh, there it goes!

819
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,840
Right, bakers, good news, time's run out.

820
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,680
Give me a pie five, someone. Wahey!

821
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,520
Yours looks amazing, Richard.

822
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,760
It's burnt!

823
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,120
It's judgement day for the pies.

824
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,840
I do think they look good. Got a nice colour,

825
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,640
nice height to it as well.

826
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,000
Nice ridge, it drops down, it's the classic pork pie shape.

827
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,000
It's a good bake, nice strong colour,

828
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,080
you've got a lot of filling in there.

829
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,960
Very good, yeah, very good.

830
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,520
I like the texture, I like the flavour, too.

831
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,200
Nice bake again, being consistent with the colour.

832
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,840
So this is the prune one.

833
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,440
It's a great looking pie, that.

834
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,320
It's lovely, absolutely delicious.

835
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:14,440
And the pastry, so crisp, it's really lovely.

836
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,040
Impressive, quite a stable mix. Bit burnt.

837
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,960
I think I was so worried about trying to get the bottoms to cook

838
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,320
that I left them in long enough for the tops to catch.

839
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,440
You've been consistent, they're all a little bit over-cooked

840
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,200
but we will get lovely crisp pastry.

841
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,920
You've got lots of filling there, which is good.

842
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,520
Not much flavour coming from that frangipane.

843
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,520
The point of a frangipane is to expose it to the heat,

844
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,600
not cover it up.

845
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,640
Because it's down at the bottom the heat can't penetrate and it can't caramelise.

846
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,960
And the last one, steak and ale?

847
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,720
That is absolutely wonderful.

848
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,240
Stunning, it really is. The pastry's excellent, it's just over-baked.

849
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,000
The whole appearance is the most attractive.

850
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,480
Good pastry, flaky.

851
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,200
The flavour queen's back.

852
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,000
Very good, good blend.

853
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,720
I think it looks great. The colour on the bake is fantastic.

854
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,600
It's holding together beautifully as we cut it.

855
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,000
But we really have got far too thick a pastry.

856
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,440
But the whole idea, I think, is lovely.

857
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,400
It's the pastry that lets you down.

858
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,720
Obviously you've done it all without a tin, you get a brownie point

859
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,280
to your name for that because they've all turned out

860
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,360
looking quite good.

861
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,200
Nice layers in there, it's quite distinctive.

862
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,600
I think the flavours are fantastic. I think it's quite dry inside.

863
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,280
I'll try the meringue first.

864
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,160
Very pale underneath, I daren't lift it again

865
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,720
because the whole thing's going to collapse.

866
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,320
When something is cut it's got to hold enough,

867
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,400
and this is weeping out over the tray.

868
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,880
And it has affected the pastry underneath.

869
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,360
What's in that egg white?

870
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,360
- Lavender.
- Lavender? It's probably a little bit too powerful for that.

871
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,280
It's pretty good.

872
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,440
It's an interesting idea and interesting flavours

873
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,240
but it's just a bit too crumbly.

874
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,960
Overall I think the top two look pretty good - the bottom one, it's caught slightly, hasn't it?

875
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,560
- And leaked.
- Yes it has. 
- OK, let's start.

876
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,400
That looks a lovely little pie when you get into it,

877
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,560
- it needs just a little bit more cooking.
- OK.

878
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:25,200
That's nice. Nice layers, well thought out, well baked.

879
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,720
Now for the monster.

880
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,400
Oh, hello, that's a three-man job.

881
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,760
I love the idea, adding paprika to the pastry.

882
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,800
The paprika in there and chorizo in there, it's fantastic.

883
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,400
It's really, really, different

884
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,680
and it's such a shame that it is over-baked,

885
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,320
but very interesting filling and it complements all the others.

886
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:58,480
Mary and Paul must now decide who will leave the tent this week

887
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,320
and who will be named Star Baker.

888
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,160
So, Paul and Mary, I think it's safe to say that none of us

889
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,120
will ever, ever want to eat a pie again.

890
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,560
- Not today anyway.
- Not today.

891
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,080
So who's done particularly well this week, do you think?

892
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,520
I think Nancy's done well, very consistent again

893
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,840
and I think Kate's done well.

894
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,360
I think the flavours in her Showstopper were very good.

895
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,720
And her pies were in beautiful proportion.

896
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,240
Which leads us to a slightly bigger question of those who

897
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,040
haven't done so well this week.

898
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:28,200
Well, Richard can do so well, but he hasn't had a great week this week.

899
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,160
Has he done enough to make him safe for next week, do you think?

900
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,120
I think he's down there, I think he's down there with Norman.

901
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:38,440
I've never had lavender in meringue and I don't ever think I want it again.

902
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:41,240
Also, Martha hasn't excelled this weekend.

903
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,160
Her Showstoppers today did look pretty bad at the bottom,

904
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,440
but the top two layers were OK,

905
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,200
the look of them.

906
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,280
You've discussed people you think might leave -

907
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:54,280
the bigger question is, with Diana sick, is it right that anybody goes?

908
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,760
Whether we leave it this week I don't know - I think

909
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,240
it's something you're going to have to find out in a bit.

910
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,880
You want to give us any sort of clue?

911
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,600
- No.
- Teasers?

912
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,200
- No.
- Honestly?
- No. 
- Every time I ask you.
- No.
- No.

913
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,080
Bakers, long weekend, and thank you.

914
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,960
You have all contributed to Britain's first ever hot water crust shortage.

915
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,760
Now, this week's Star Baker has for a long time been a bridesmaid,

916
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,240
never the blushing bride.

917
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,120
But thanks to huge quantities of piggy,

918
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,840
I'm delighted to say this week's Star Baker is Kate.

919
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,760
Now, this bit gets harder as the weeks go by.

920
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:49,040
I'm afraid the person who will not be joining us next week is...

921
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,920
..Norman.

922
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,920
But thanks for the lavender meringue.

923
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,320
- Oh, the lavender will stay with. 
- We'll never forget it.

924
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,080
It was an honour, sir, you're a gentleman.

925
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,760
I'm lucky to make it this far.

926
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,640
Oh, don't be silly, no.

927
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,840
I'm overjoyed I've made it to fifth week of the Bake Off.

928
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,640
At the same time a wee bit sad I'm having to go home. I never thought

929
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,800
I'd get this far, and I'll look on it as being an excellent

930
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,160
experience, and something that will stay in my memories for a long time.

931
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,160
That was a narrow escape, cor, what a touch.

932
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:33,480
Erm... Yeah. I feel very lucky to have stayed in.

933
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,200
I cannot believe I survived pastry, I thought

934
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,280
if I was going to go at any point, definitely pastry.

935
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,400
But I'm still here and that's amazing.

936
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,640
You should be a bit like...

937
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,360
I am a bit, I will be.

938
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,160
Puts shivers down your spine. Fantastic.

939
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,320
Especially in pie week,

940
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:56,640
because Luis was saying that no Southerner should ever win pie week.

941
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:02,480
And I'm as Southern as they get. So that's good.

942
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,800
Next time...

943
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,040
What am I doing?

944
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,440
..the bakers tackle European cakes.

945
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,760
Never done a Scandinavian recipe in my life.

946
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,080
With a Signature that could make them opt out of Europe.

947
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,920
I hate this bit.

948
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,080
Moment of truth.

949
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,200
A technical that really works up a sweat.

950
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,520
Am I showing a bit?

951
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,680
And a monumental Showstopper...

952
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,680
Nothing like cutting it fine, is there?

953
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,760
..that puts the hungry in Hungary.

954
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,680
I think I might just start again, again.
