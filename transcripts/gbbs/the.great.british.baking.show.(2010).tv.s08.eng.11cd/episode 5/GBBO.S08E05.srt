1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GBBO S08E05

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,400
Noel, what are you doing?!

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,680
It's Week 5, we've got eight
bakers waiting.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,360
I'm just frolicking in the fields.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,640
No, you're not.  What?

6
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,000
That's way too fast.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,360
Really? How do you know?

8
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,880
I was European Frolic Champion 1983,
you want to do it like THIS.

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,360
That is a frolic.

10
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,440
Wow. Yeah, that's better, actually.

11
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,840
Yeah, ain't that nice?  Anyway, never
mind the frolics -

12
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,720
BOTH: Welcome to The Great British
Bake Off.

13
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,800
Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,920
Last time...

15
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,040
The bakers went gooey
over caramel.

16
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,640
Oh, my God.
Liam hit the sweet spot...

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,880
I love that flavour.

18
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh!  ..but Kate...

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,360
You can do this, you can do this.

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,080
..spun her way to Star Baker.

21
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,280
That's delicious.

22
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,400
It's so original.

23
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,040
James almost came unstuck.  Massive,
aren't they?

24
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,440
They're sizeable.

25
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,040
But having fudged his cake...

26
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,680
Oh, Tom.

27
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,320
..Tom was the fourth baker to say
goodbye.

28
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,360
Going to miss you.

29
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,840
This week...  If it doesn't set, it's
a hot mess.

30
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,720
..puddings.
GASPS

31
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah! Yeah!

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,040
A steamy Signature...

33
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,000
Ow, ow, ow - hot.

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,600
..a twisted Technical...

35
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Everybody leave, except for Julia.

36
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,840
..and a multi-layered Showstopper...

37
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,920
Come on!  ..that turns bakers...

38
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,720
It's dribbling, it's
dribbling loads.

39
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,600
Look, look!  ..to jelly.

40
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,880
Massive disaster.

41
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,240
It's like watching a horror
film - you don't want to watch it,

42
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,680
you can't peel your eyes away.

43
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,440
I don't like rubber.

44
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,440
Disappointing.

45
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,040
Honestly, I can't believe the high
standard of the bakers this year,

46
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,920
and some of them are so young -
Julia, 21. Liam, 19.

47
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,160
I know, they're just getting younger
and younger,

48
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,560
it's as if Paul's genetically
breeding them in a lab.

49
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,520
Alfie, Frankie, it's all about using
your hand, all right?

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,480
You've really got to push in there.
Anyway, dig in.

51
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,200
What's this for?  It's Pudding Week.

52
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,200
Where'd you get that?  I nicked it!

53
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,360
Halfway.

54
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,040
If I can get to Week 7, I'll
be chuffed - Week 8.

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
I'll be chuffed if I can get to
Week 8.

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,400
I've been walking round with a big
grin on my face all week

57
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,480
since getting Star Baker. If
anything, it's made me want to
work harder.

58
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Pudding Week! I had a rubbish week
last week, so lots to improve on.

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,840
It was very noticeable last
week, there's not much

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,840
separating everybody, now I feel
even more pressure.

61
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,960
I'm totally scared, anybody
could go.

62
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,800
Morning, bakers, welcome to
Pudding Week.

63
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,320
That is a sentence I've uttered
many times,

64
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,320
but now that I'm actually hosting a
baking show, it finally makes sense.

65
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,360
For your Signature Challenge, Prue
and Paul would like you

66
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,800
to go back to a time of assemblies
and uniforms -

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,960
a time when Prue was in
short trousers

68
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,120
and Paul had a very nice
Aertex blouse,

69
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,120
because they want you to make
a steamed school pudding.

70
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,520
Your school pudding must be served
with an accompaniment,

71
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,200
like a compote or a custard.

72
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,200
You've got three hours to
get steamy with your school
puddings.

73
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,440
BOTH: On your marks, get set, bake!

74
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,000
I love puddings, puddings with
custard, ice cream.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,280
Now, see if I can make a
good pudding.

76
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,160
What can go wrong? Oh, God.

77
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,520
I love steamed pudding.

78
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,760
I mean, it takes me back to when I
was in school.

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,720
It's all about that little bit of
sweetness,

80
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,200
and then the gorgeous texture of a
light sponge.

81
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,200
With custard, ahh - it's one of my
favourite things ever.

82
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,120
Most bakers are very good at things
in the oven,

83
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,120
this time we're asking them to cook
something on top of the cooker.

84
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,120
It's extremely difficult to tell
whether the steam pudding is cooking
correctly.

85
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,680
Anything that's got a
little bit of sogginess to it,

86
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,680
it's a little bit stodgy, is a big
no for me.

87
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,080
Morning.  Morning.  Sophie, tell us
about your steamed school pudding?

88
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,360
I am doing a fig, ginger and honey
steamed pudding

89
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,680
and I'm going to serve it with a
tonka mascarpone cream.

90
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,600
Sorry, a what?  A tonka bean.

91
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,440
That's a first for Bake Off.
Does it smell?  Yeah - please.

92
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,800
Where do you even get those?
Supermarket.

93
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,640
We shop in very different shops.
SHE LAUGHS

94
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,720
Sophie's also adding an exotic twist
to her sponge,

95
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,480
soaking it with honey from Yemen,

96
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,320
served with her cream that should
give a flavour of Latin America.

97
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,480
A spicy vanilla.

98
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,320
People either love it or hate it,
so...

99
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,320
Well, that's a very safe thing
to do.

100
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,840
Whilst puddings can be a little bit
stodgy, you don't want them too
stodgy.

101
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,200
The key thing to get right today is
going to be the sponge.

102
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,040
I've just whisked some egg whites
and they're going into the batter,

103
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,720
adds some more air. It is hard to
make a steamed pudding airy.

104
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,840
We're avoiding stodge at all costs.

105
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,000
If I see any stodge trying to creep
into the tent...

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,040
Get out.

107
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,720
The thing is about a stodge,
when you tell a stodge to leave
a tent,

108
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,200
it will do it slowly.
HE LAUGHS

109
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,600
Scientist Yan, however, has a
stodge-avoiding strategy

110
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,920
up her sleeve.

111
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,120
Instead of a third of my flour, I've
put in a third breadcrumbs,

112
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,800
it lightens up the pudding.

113
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,880
To complement her light texture,

114
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,000
she hopes to create an explosion of
fresh flavours

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,720
by combining two
varieties of the same fruit.

116
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,240
This is normal mango, this is
Alfonso, the best mango.

117
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,880
Oh, my God, it's so good.

118
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,280
I'm hoping it's going to work.

119
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,120
Unlike Yan and Sophie,

120
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,600
the flavours in Kate's pudding

121
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,440
couldn't get any more
quintessentially English.

122
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,120
I've ground up some Earl Grey tea
and that will go into the sponge.

123
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,400
I'm making
Mr Darcy's Steamy Lake Scene.

124
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,120
Ooh!  Mr Darcy was never at my
school, sadly.

125
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,600
Kate's adding a frisson of lemon to
the delicate bergamot flavour

126
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,680
in her Jane-Austin-inspired pudding.

127
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,840
The Earl Grey won't be lost in it?
No, I'm hoping not.

128
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,960
I think that lemon will be the
overriding flavour.

129
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,720
Hopefully, I'll get the balance
right.

130
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Good luck.

131
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,840
For two of the bakers,

132
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,440
their love of classic English
flavours

133
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,560
has led them down precisely the same
pudding lane.

134
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,400
I love cherry bakewell.

135
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,520
When I was younger, me and my mum
and my sister,

136
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,560
we always used to go to the corner
shop,

137
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,160
so then we'd always get the tinned
version of steamed puddings

138
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,680
and our favourite was, like,
the cherry bakewell version.

139
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,200
I love a bakewell tart.

140
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,200
My husband loves, but we all love
a bakewell tart.

141
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,920
Stacey's doing a bakewell.

142
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,440
I try not to pay that much
attention.

143
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,720
See what happens, isn't it?

144
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,080
To recreate the bakewell pudding of
his youth,

145
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,000
19-year-old Liam's folding glace and
dried cherries

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,160
into an almond and
lemon-infused sponge.

147
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,320
I want them to think that the
combination of flavours are good,

148
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,080
that the bake is good.

149
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Yeah, I want to nail both.

150
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,320
The most important thing is that my
pudding is light and fluffy.

151
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,160
It's got to be the bomb. It's got to
be perfect.

152
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,760
Stacey's cherries will flavour the
jam on top of her almond sponge,

153
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,200
and in her bid to win the battle of
the bakewells,

154
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,000
she's left nothing to chance.

155
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,480
Have you practised it?  I've done it
17 times.

156
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,440
17 times?  I'd say about 17 times.

157
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,360
Yeah. I wanted to get it absolutely
perfect.

158
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Well, good luck.  Thank you. Thank
you very much.

159
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Let's see what happens on your 18th
attempt!  Thank you.

160
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,400
I'm just lining the bowl with orange
slices.

161
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,120
These will cook with the sponge,

162
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,320
so they become really soft

163
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,920
and you can actually eat the orange
and the sponge all together.

164
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,280
So it makes it a bit like a
marmalade-y sort of flavour.

165
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,960
James will also soak his sponge in a
ginger syrup

166
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,440
to try and bring to life

167
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,640
the steamed pudding of his boyhood
dreams.

168
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,840
In junior school we always had a
choice of either syrup pudding

169
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,520
or a marmalade pudding, so this is a
combination of both.

170
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,320
So, reminiscent of the school days.

171
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,960
I never had steamed pudding at
school.

172
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,800
It was like, I don't know, some
baked apple

173
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,520
with cottage cheese inside.

174
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,840
It wasn't great.

175
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,640
Having missed out on a lifetime of
steamed puddings,

176
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,760
Russian-born Julia was forced to
call

177
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
on her English in-laws for tips.

178
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,520
Treacle pudding, it's my husband
Matt's grandparents' favourite.

179
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,640
So I thought, &quot;I'll make that.&quot;

180
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,080
I'm zesting lemons.

181
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,280
The favours I've chosen are quite
classic, quite simple,

182
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,480
but I didn't want to try to be too
clever.

183
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,440
A lemon sponge with blackcurrant
sauce might seem straight-forward,

184
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,400
but being Steven, it's here the
simplicity ends.

185
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,560
Why have you got a syringe?

186
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,920
So we're going to take some of the
liquid from the compote,

187
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,560
inject little streaks into it.

188
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,280
So you'll get a marbled effect?
Almost marbling.  All right, mate.

189
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,080
Good luck, anyway.  Thank you very
much.

190
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,440
I look forward to it.  Thank you.

191
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,080
Right bakers, one hour gone, two
hours left.

192
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,080
I'm just lining the inside of my
pudding basin with slices of fig,

193
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,480
so when you turn it out, they'll be
on the outside.

194
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,040
The thing about steamed pudding,

195
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,840
you just need to get the right
amount of mixture in the bowl -

196
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,680
not too much, not too little.

197
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,840
I'm putting it in.

198
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,440
That takes just under two hours.

199
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,960
It's nicely bubbling away,

200
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,360
and then I'll put it down to low, so
two hours.

201
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,040
Exactly an hour and a half.
Originally, I was doing two hours,

202
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,080
then I went down to an hour and
three quarters,

203
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
then I went down to an hour and
39.

204
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Now, it's an hour and a half.

205
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
It's just literally put it in and
leave it.

206
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Absolutely not touching it, it's a
fatal mistake.

207
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,120
Fatal.

208
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,200
Ooh!

209
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,120
Oh, no.

210
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,120
As their puddings gather steam,
there's still sauces to start...

211
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,800
This is the blackcurrant compote...

212
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,760
..and custards to concoct.

213
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,760
So in the pan, I've got milk, cream
and some cinnamon stick crushed up.

214
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,720
That's going to go into a couple of
eggs

215
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,720
and also some nice chocolate,
as well,

216
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,000
so it'll be a nice thick
chocolaty custard.

217
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,440
My dream custard is thick.

218
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,440
You know when you pour it onto the
cake, you can't see the cake?

219
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,000
It's just like...

220
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,840
I just want to take it a little bit
past runny

221
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,680
because I don't want a thick gloppy
custard,

222
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,520
I want like a nice, light
creme anglaise.

223
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,520
This is Earl Grey.  It's like the
19th century was in the room.

224
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,880
Yes.  Hello, Liam.

225
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,960
The thing is about this,

226
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,680
it's kind of a school pudding from
the '70s

227
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,760
and I imagine they were probably
extinct

228
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,120
by the time you went to school.

229
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,200
Steam puddings did not exist at my
primary school.

230
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,040
So this is quite an odd challenge
for you

231
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,440
because it's sort of
recreating something historical?

232
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,280
Yeah. It's not really, it's a bit
odd.

233
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Unlike Liam, the steamed school
pudding and I go way back.

234
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,920
In fact, our formative years were
spent at the same institution -

235
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,960
Cambridge University.

236
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,800
Up until the 17th century,

237
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,720
the steamed pudding was a far from
sweet affair.

238
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,840
Comprised of an animal's stomach or
even a bladder,

239
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,560
jammed packed with meat and veg.

240
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,920
For the cooks at Cambridge,

241
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,280
mass pudding-making would have an
onerous task.

242
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,560
You put the contents in and then you
tied it up and then you boiled it.

243
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,520
And, trust me, it really smells.

244
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,400
Yeah.  Not only that, it's liable to
break.

245
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,360
Obviously, people from Cambridge
came and went

246
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,840
and someone has decided,

247
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,080
instead of using a sheep's bladder,
why not use a cloth?

248
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,080
So you've got people replacing the
meat with suet, putting flour in,

249
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,480
but then also adding sugar.

250
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,920
Sugar would have been too expensive
for most folks in 1615,

251
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
but not for the scholars of
Cambridge.

252
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,600
Adding this, along with the flour
and suet, created a lighter,

253
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,920
cake-like texture, resulting in the
Cambridge pudding.

254
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,120
Why can we date is so specifically?

255
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,800
Because it comes in a book
printed in 1615.

256
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Mince suet, new milk, warm, fine
sugar and eggs.

257
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,840
There's theory and then there's the
practicality -

258
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,640
we need to make a pudding.

259
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,000
Luckily, I have all the ingredients
for a Cambridge pudding

260
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,520
and culinary historian,
Dr Sue Bailey,

261
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,880
tucked away in my old dorm room.

262
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,960
This looks absolutely fantastic.

263
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,120
Now, I'm desperate for your help,
Sue.

264
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,920
Thank you, Sandi.  I've got the
recipe, it's frankly unclear.

265
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,880
Mince suet, is that grated suet?

266
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,560
It is grated suet.

267
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,760
This is what has been actually
rendered down.

268
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,480
I'm going to put all of this in.

269
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,400
Fatty pudding. Taken from round the
loins

270
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,280
and the kidneys of beef and
mutton, suet's a calorific fat,

271
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,680
perfect for satisfying hungry
students,

272
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,640
whilst negating the need for meat.

273
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,120
You now have to do a little sort of
dent in the middle,

274
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,840
because otherwise, you're not going
to be able to fit the butter in.

275
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,440
I've actually never seen this much
butter going into one thing.

276
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,960
Then we put them on top of each
other.

277
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,400
On top of each other, so.

278
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,360
Wow, look at that.

279
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,200
I can actually feel my
cardiovascular system

280
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,280
having a little seizure.

281
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,520
Mm. It's nice, isn't it?

282
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,800
Thanks to the clever cooks of
Cambridge,

283
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,600
the sweet steamed pudding was born,

284
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,520
and sheep's bladders faded from
school menus,

285
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,520
much to the relief of pupils
and dinner ladies across the nation.

286
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,640
Bakers, you have 30 minutes left,
30 minutes.

287
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,800
It's time to take it out of there
now, I'm terrified.

288
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
If you open it and it's sunk in the
middle,

289
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,200
there is no going back from that.

290
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
You cannot hide it.  There's just no
way of knowing.

291
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I'm a bit worried.  Three minutes.

292
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,600
Am I the only one who's taking it
out?

293
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,760
I feel so sick.

294
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,120
Someone else open it for me.

295
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,360
Is this quite a moment?

296
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,560
Is that hot?  Ow, ow, ow, ow!

297
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,760
I'm too scared to even do it.

298
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,040
I just want it to be good.

299
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,160
Oh!

300
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,040
Yeah, yeah!

301
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,920
Good, I'm pleased with it.

302
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,720
Why don't you open it, and I'll look
and tell you how good or bad it is.

303
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,760
Please, don't be mean.  OK.

304
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,800
Put the lid back on.

305
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,040
I'm joking, that's all right, isn't
it?

306
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,320
Please, please, please.

307
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,200
A bit of sinkage in the middle.

308
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,560
Oh. Yes, so far so good.

309
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,920
I just need to...

310
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,440
You don't know until you turn it out
whether it's right or not.

311
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,600
Yes.

312
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,120
That is beautiful, it looks steamed,
it looks pudding-like.

313
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,680
Ah, thank gosh for that.

314
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,680
I'm happy with the way it looks.

315
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Right, just serving it like that.

316
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Ta-da. It looks all right, the
mangoes are done.

317
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,600
It's a bit more rustic than the kind
of thing I like to bake.

318
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,640
Ah, it's all right - nothing to see
here.

319
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,520
Oh.  That happens every time I do it.

320
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,520
It's perfect.

321
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,200
How long have we got?  Bakers, you've
got five minutes left.

322
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,640
It's not thickening, I don't
understand.

323
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,720
How long has it been on?  Ages.

324
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,600
How can I help?  You can't.

325
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,880
Wow, that's the sort of thing you
used to make cows with.

326
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,880
I want that juice to be all the way
through the sponge.

327
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,760
I'm basically giving these mangoes
a shave.

328
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,520
I'm making a raspberry flour.

329
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,480
Look at that, that is the nuts, that
is.

330
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,680
I'm sorry, that is very good,
actually.

331
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,840
Oh, stand up!

332
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,440
It's not thickening, so what I'm
doing

333
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,080
is just putting a little bit more of
the cornflour in.

334
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,080
Right, bakers, you have one minute
before we ring the school bell.

335
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,320
What a disaster.

336
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Bakers, time is up, pencils down,
the exam is over.

337
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Please place your steamed school
puddings at the end of your desks.

338
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,000
Absolute disaster.

339
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Eight school puddings steamed
and served...

340
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,080
..ready for examination by
Paul and Prue.

341
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,680
I must say, it looks very pretty.

342
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,680
My mouth's watering.

343
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,240
It's not the lightest sponge
I've ever had.

344
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,320
On the other hand, you've got the
orange there.

345
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,720
It is nice and marmaladey.

346
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,400
Paddington Bear'll be pleased.

347
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,480
It's my pet name for Paul!

348
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,520
HE LAUGHS

349
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,840
It is a little bit dense.

350
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,680
I wouldn't say it's a great
steamed pudding,

351
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,240
but it's a very good
steamed pudding.

352
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,720
I'll take that.

353
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,840
Well done.

354
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,840
Thank you.

355
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,680
Nice custard, looks good.

356
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,680
The taste of the orange and the
treacle together, it works.

357
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,680
Not the lightest sponge,
but it is delicious.

358
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,240
It looks a little stodgy.

359
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,640
This is going to be interesting with
the mascarpone cream.

360
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,640
That tonka taste is very
extraordinary and rather good.

361
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,960
The flavour of the
pudding's delicious.

362
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,120
The ginger and the fig really work
together, and the honey.

363
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
I'm still unsure about the
tonka bean.

364
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,800
I love it, just too stodgy.

365
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Yep.

366
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,720
I love the effect of the fruits that
have fallen down

367
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,720
and the darkness hitting the lemon
sponge, I think that really works.

368
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,560
Looks very good.

369
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,560
That sponge looks so light.

370
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,240
Blackcurrant is a nice little burst
of acidity.

371
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,080
It should be sharp against the, sort
of, mellow lemon of the sponge.

372
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,280
And it's really good.

373
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,280
It is a beautiful sponge, it tastes
amazing, it is light.

374
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,440
APPLAUSE

375
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,640
Well done, mate, well done.

376
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Thank you.  Fantastic.

377
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,560
The custard's embarrassing.

378
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,600
SHE LAUGHS

379
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,600
That's not custard,
that's a big mistake.

380
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,920
It's quite powerful, but I don't get
the Earl Grey.

381
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,160
You've got Earl Grey fighting
against lemon,

382
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,160
it's going to lose every day
of the week.

383
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It really looks good, it's dramatic,
it's beautifully designed.

384
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,480
Held together well.

385
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,480
Nice consistency.  Yeah.

386
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,480
Mmm.

387
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,760
That is good mango.

388
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,320
It's beautiful and light.

389
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,800
It's lovely.
It's absolutely delicious.

390
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,680
Thank you.  Well done.  Oh, my God!

391
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,000
Oh, my God!

392
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,600
Two handshakes.

393
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Thank you, Yan.  Thank you.

394
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,240
I think it's very pretty.
I love the cherries on the top.

395
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,080
Oh, that looks lovely and light.

396
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,840
Very almondy,
proper Bakewell flavour.

397
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,960
HE LAUGHS

398
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,760
It's too stodgy.

399
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,320
OK.  You've probably mixed it
too much

400
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,880
and the gluten's got quite powerful

401
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
and that's why I couldn't give you
a handshake.

402
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,200
Ah!

403
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,440
Do you want a Fielding fondle?

404
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,920
LAUGHTER

405
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,360
Don't leave me hanging!

406
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,360
LAUGHTER

407
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,120
It looks quite attractive.

408
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,640
The sponge looks pretty good.

409
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,640
Oh, that looks really good,
nice and light.

410
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,120
Absolutely delicious.

411
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,040
One of my favourite things is
Bakewell tarts.

412
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,160
You have the texture of a Bakewell
tart in there, which is very clever.

413
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,160
Cherry's got that sharpness
to it as well.

414
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,120
So overall,
it's a very special thing.

415
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,160
SHE LAUGHS

416
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,760
It's absolutely delicious.

417
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh!

418
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,040
Thank you.

419
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,080
Thank you.

420
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,680
APPLAUSE

421
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,520
So close.

422
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,360
So close.

423
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,360
I'm really happy,
and I got a handshake.

424
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,120
He really did not want to give me
one because he'd given two already,

425
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,200
do you know what I mean,

426
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,680
which makes it even more brilliant
that I got one.

427
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,120
I'm well chuffed.

428
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,120
SHE GIGGLES

429
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,240
I always make custard,
what was that?!

430
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,560
That was embarrassing.

431
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,840
It was like a milk drink.

432
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,800
I don't think I'm looking forward to
the Technical that much.

433
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,920
Does anyone look forward to a
Technical Challenge?

434
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,920
I don't think they do.

435
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Not only are the bakers about to
face the total unknown,

436
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,440
this week, it's a Technical
with a twist.

437
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,480
Hello, bakers.

438
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,480
Today, your Technical
Pudding Challenge has been set by
Mr Paul Hollywood.

439
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,040
So Paul, any advice
before you leave the tent?

440
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,400
It's all about the timing.

441
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,360
Well, that's totally clear, I feel.

442
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,520
Now, as you know for this bit, Paul
and Prue are not allowed to stay.

443
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,520
We'll see them later. Off you go.

444
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,320
Right.  Today's Technical Challenge
is staggering.

445
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,760
Yes, we are going to be staggering
your start times.

446
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,760
We're going to call you in one by
one and tell you what the challenge
is at your start time.

447
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,800
So everybody leave except for...

448
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,960
Julia.

449
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,440
Out you come, come on.

450
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,480
Off you go.

451
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,120
Come on, no messing about.

452
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,200
Are you all right, Julia?

453
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,760
No.

454
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,600
For today's Technical Challenge,

455
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,600
Paul would like you to make six
molten chocolate puddings filled
with peanut butter.

456
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,680
You have one hour, and at exactly
that point, you have to present your
bake for judging.

457
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,080
On your marks.

458
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,120
Get set.

459
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Bake!  Bake.

460
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,120
Melt the chocolate and butter
together, whisk the eggs,

461
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,360
egg yolks and sugar together,
combine the two mixtures.

462
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,880
I've done it once,

463
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,880
but it was such a long time and it
was just filled with chocolate.

464
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,280
OK, melt the chocolate
back together.

465
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,360
Let me show you something, Prue.

466
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,360
So what we've got is a chocolate
molten cake with a beautiful peanut
butter filling,

467
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,080
which oozes out when
you cut it.

468
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,920
These are designed to be eaten hot,
straight from the oven.

469
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,240
So we're staggering their starts and
we'll judge them live.

470
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,560
You bake these for ten minutes.

471
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,120
Over bake, then the whole
mixture will congeal,

472
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,440
and you won't get that goo
when you cut it.

473
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,480
It's got to run.
If they under do it, the whole thing
will just collapse.

474
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,920
Do you know what, I think this is a
really tricky challenge.

475
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,920
And I will be astonished if
everybody produces perfection.

476
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,320
It is so weird being on my own.

477
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,600
I'm petrified,
I'm absolutely petrified.

478
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,600
It's all about timing. We have to
serve it on the hour.

479
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,200
Right, baker number two, for your
Technical Challenge,

480
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Paul would like you to make six
molten chocolate puddings filled
with hot peanut butter.

481
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,880
You have one hour.

482
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,920
On your marks.

483
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Get set.  Bake.

484
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,080
Never made one.

485
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,880
So I suppose, actually, I've got to,
you know, really think about when
they go in the oven

486
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,880
because they have to be, you know,
still runny in the middle.

487
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,000
Potentially, they could sort
of carry on cooking, so...

488
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Oh, it's a mine field.

489
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,280
I'm just melting my chocolate with
some butter.

490
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,680
Well, at least I'm not on my own
right now, which makes it
a bit better.

491
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,640
Hi.

492
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,520
Does it? Does it actually
make it better?  No.

493
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,200
No. No, it doesn't.

494
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,200
Just got to melt some chocolate,
just melt some chocolate.

495
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,360
Baker number three, for your
Technical Challenge,

496
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,840
Paul would like you to make six
molten chocolate puddings.

497
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,000
You've got one hour.

498
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,600
Bake!  Bake.

499
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,360
I've never made them before, but I
know what they look like.

500
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,920
Thum, thum, thum, thum, thum, thum.
What do I need?

501
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,880
I've got the butter and
chocolate melting,

502
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,880
and then I'm just about to start
whisking up the eggs and sugar.

503
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,200
There's no raising agent in this
at all.

504
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,160
The raising comes from
the whisked eggs.

505
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Yeah, you need loads of air in it.

506
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
MOTOR WHIRRING

507
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,160
I can't believe I'm doing it
by hand.

508
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,760
Baker number four, on your marks.

509
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Get set.  Bake!

510
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,120
I have absolutely no idea.

511
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,080
I'm going with ribbon stage,

512
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,880
which means there should be a bit of
a trail left behind.

513
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,800
Everything you do,
you second guess yourself.

514
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,000
Should I be doing it that way?

515
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
What's that word I like,
trepidatious?

516
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,040
Baker number five.

517
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,640
You have one hour.

518
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,840
On your marks.  Get set.

519
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,320
Bake!

520
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,280
Oh, yeah, that's OK.

521
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,200
I've made this before, similar.

522
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,000
Not peanut butter, though.

523
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,240
It's OK, I've got it.

524
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,280
What am I doing?

525
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,600
So I've just whisked the eggs.

526
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,840
I'm trying to let the chocolate cool
a little bit more.

527
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,840
I just don't like the idea of adding
hot chocolate to like a cold egg
sugar mix.

528
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,360
Oh, have I turned my oven on?

529
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,800
Yes. Oh!

530
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,560
I need to combine the two together.

531
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,560
It doesn't say anything, how to
combine or what to do.

532
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,800
How's it going?

533
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,240
Yeah, it should be all right, I just
need to crack on really.

534
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,720
I don't really know what I'm doing.

535
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,040
Are you saying I'm in your way, what
are you saying, Liam?

536
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,720
I think I'm doing it right, but I'm
not entirely sure.

537
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,760
Baker number six,
for your Technical Challenge,

538
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,360
Paul would like you to make six
molten chocolate puddings.

539
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,880
You have one hour.

540
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,200
Bake!

541
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,120
I've never made a chocolate pudding
in my life.

542
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,760
So, brilliant.

543
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,800
So I've just added two tablespoons
of flour.

544
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,680
I don't want to knock out
the air bubbles,

545
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,680
so that's why I'm folding it gently.

546
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,360
Baker number seven, on your marks.

547
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,920
Get set.  Bake!

548
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,880
Never made them before in my life.

549
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,880
Fortunately, in revision last night,

550
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,880
I briefly glanced through molten
volcano cakes, which is similar.

551
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
I'm a little more confident than
I'm letting on.

552
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,920
HE LAUGHS

553
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,280
It says &quot;divide it between moulds&quot;.

554
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,280
I'm sort of starting out putting the
sort of same amount in each because
they will want them identical.

555
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,960
I've weighed them out,
dead on 100g in each pot.

556
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,720
I've filled three quarters of the
way up, and they're going to rise.

557
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,120
I don't want them billowing
over the top.

558
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,240
Baker number eight, on your marks.

559
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,040
Get set.  Bake!

560
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,560
Not a clue.

561
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,320
I'm just putting my peanut butter
inside of them.

562
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,320
Well, it says &quot;teaspoon&quot;, but with a
bit of an extra.

563
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,000
A heaped teaspoon.

564
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,920
I'm having a terrible dilemma
at the moment.

565
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,200
My main problem is, I'm not sure
whether I'm supposed to whisk that
up to a frenzy

566
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,320
or not whisk it up a lot,

567
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,960
but my heart is telling me to really
go for it.

568
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,640
But, then again, my brain is telling
me maybe don't go for it.

569
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,280
I think it's a light folding.

570
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,720
Fingers crossed that this is the
right way to do it.

571
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,920
The plan is to let them freeze off
for 15 minutes.

572
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,920
When you cook it, it makes it molten
in the middle.

573
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,720
I've got probably about ten minutes
in the freezer,

574
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,720
just to chill them down and then
it's item six, bake.

575
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,440
Baking time, that's what it's all
down to, and I have no idea.

576
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,120
How long?  How long to do it for.

577
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,040
Well, I've got an inkling.
An inkling.

578
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,920
I've got an inkling, and I think
it's not very long.

579
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,800
The undisclosed bake time for Paul's
recipe is ten minutes.

580
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,040
I've got 20 minutes left.

581
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,040
I'm going to bake them for, I'm not
sure, 12 minutes.

582
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,160
You don't want them over baked,
so I'll probably give them like...

583
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,120
Like 20, 15 minutes.

584
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,640
Oh, I don't know.

585
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,640
No idea, no idea.

586
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,480
Eight minutes.

587
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,680
I'm going to say it's probably about
35 minutes.

588
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,680
Obviously, I don't want them
to be raw.

589
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Oh, you're kidding me!

590
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,960
The oven wasn't on.

591
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Come on.

592
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,240
Eight more minutes.

593
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,240
15 left, eight more minutes.

594
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,680
25 minutes.

595
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,960
They're going in now, they can heat
up with the oven.

596
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,360
The key thing with baking is that
you want the outside crispy,

597
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,920
so that it holds the gooey centre.

598
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
180 for 10 minutes.

599
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,000
If you go too far, you just get a
rock hard sponge.

600
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,680
Too little,
it's just going to splodge.

601
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,680
So you just need the right balance,
which is going to be tricky.

602
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,280
They really should be in now.

603
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,840
I didn't want to be early,
but now I think I'm late.

604
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,280
It's a waiting game now.

605
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Come on, you can do this.

606
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,280
Baker number one, you've got
one minute left.

607
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,280
I don't think they're done.

608
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,120
As ever in a Technical Challenge,
Paul and Prue will blind taste
the bakes.

609
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Baker number one, your time is up,
and I'm going to come and collect
your molten chocolate puddings.

610
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,480
Baker number one.

611
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,000
Ah, thank you.

612
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,840
These actually look very neat,
don't they?

613
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,640
They do, don't they.
Let's have a look.

614
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,920
That's good.

615
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,280
Look at the texture of the peanut,
it's soft still, pouring out.

616
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,360
Yeah, that's good.

617
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,920
I have no idea what they're saying,
I can't hear anything.

618
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,520
Let's just have a quick taste.

619
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,800
Could have done with a
touch more filling,

620
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,800
but, I must say, it's not bad.

621
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,960
Baker number two, your time is up.

622
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,880
Thank you very much, waiter.

623
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,320
Very neat again. A bit of a wobble,
which is good.

624
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,840
We need to really get into it.

625
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,640
Oh, look at that!
Look at that.

626
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,720
Now you're talking.

627
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,720
That's more peanut butter, that's
what makes the difference.

628
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,160
And it's good.

629
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,120
They look good, the flavour of the
chocolate's good.

630
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,160
That's excellent.

631
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,000
I saw a lot of nodding.

632
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Baker number three,
I am coming to collect your
molten chocolate puddings.

633
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,160
I know they're under, so under.

634
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,520
I mean, you've got a
little bit of goo.

635
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,440
Let's have a taste of it and see.

636
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,080
It's very good.

637
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,640
The sponge is excellent.

638
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,800
The texture's pretty good as well.

639
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,960
I just think if they'd put more
peanut butter in it, it would have
been better.

640
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,000
Absolutely.

641
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
They're coming out.

642
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,240
Time is up.

643
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,240
That's wonderful news.  I'll be
gentle with them.

644
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,360
They look...  They look perfect,
don't they?

645
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,680
I think these are going to be
excellent.

646
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,480
Oh, it's quite solid.
Not quite runny enough.

647
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,200
Slightly over, aren't they?

648
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,200
What a pity, I thought we had a
winner here.

649
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,920
Baker number five, your time is up.

650
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,920
Wow, got to be careful how you serve
that one.

651
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,760
Baker number five.

652
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,080
Wow, thank you very much.

653
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,160
PAUL LAUGHS

654
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,080
If you're going to serve a cake,
serve it phallic.

655
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,960
Whoa!  It's not cooked.

656
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,680
It is under baked.

657
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,680
If you like undercooked cake
mixture...  Chocolate sponge, yeah.
..you'd like it.

658
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,920
Oh, I've overcooked these.

659
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,240
Oh, they look horrible.

660
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,000
Baker number six, your time is up.

661
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,920
If you drop them,
it wouldn't be a disaster!

662
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,880
LAUGHTER

663
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,920
Wish them luck.

664
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,080
Enjoy.  I don't think we will!

665
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,760
Oh, dear. It's cracked.

666
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,800
They're quite solid.

667
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,600
Oh, yeah, they are.
Let's have a look.

668
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,600
Yeah, see, massively overbaked.

669
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,240
It's like watching, like,
a horror film.

670
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,320
You don't want to watch it, you
can't peel your eyes away.

671
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,320
It looks pretty dreadful, really.

672
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Right, baker number seven,
your time is up.

673
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,640
One collapsed because I threw it
down too hard,

674
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,960
but at least I know it's
soft in the middle.

675
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,040
OK, this has got a few issues with
getting it out of the mould.

676
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,440
This one's broken, this is dipping,
that's got a big air hole in.

677
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,960
Let's cut this one.

678
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,320
Yeah, that's absolutely raw, look.

679
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,040
So's this one. That's raw as well.

680
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,040
It's a bit of a failure.

681
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,920
Yeah, they're a bit burnt.

682
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,920
Baker number eight, your time is up.

683
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,600
God, almighty.

684
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,440
Voila!  Thank you.
Thank you very much.

685
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,040
There's not a lot of middle,
is there?

686
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,720
It looks slightly overbaked to me.

687
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,440
This is horrible.

688
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,520
I just don't want to be last.

689
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,840
They taste OK, the chocolate's good.

690
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,640
I'm a little bit worried about
folding of the mix

691
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,240
because there are little air pockets
and cracks.

692
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,320
Sophie, what are they saying?

693
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,040
There's just not enough middle.

694
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,080
No.  Not enough peanut butter.

695
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,960
It's good,
but it's just not perfect.

696
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,120
Pru and Paul will now rank
the molten puddings

697
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,880
from the worst to the best.

698
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,000
In eighth place, who's that?

699
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,480
That's me.  Kate, that's you.

700
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,280
Well, they've collapsed,
haven't they?

701
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,240
In seventh place is this one.

702
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,280
James, it wasn't baked enough

703
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,040
cos all the chocolate was still
coming out with the peanut butter.

704
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,200
OK.

705
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,040
In sixth place, it's Yan.

706
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,760
Fifth, is Steven
and Stacey is fourth.

707
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,560
In third spot is this one.

708
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,920
Pretty good, actually, Julia.

709
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,600
I just think
that you could have done with

710
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,480
a little bit more peanut butter in
there and it would have flooded out.

711
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,440
And in second place...

712
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,000
This one. Who's that?

713
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,520
Liam, well done.
They really are excellent.

714
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,320
In first place is this one.

715
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,640
APPLAUSE

716
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,600
Well done.  Awesome.

717
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,080
Thank you.

718
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,360
'I'm pleased, actually.
I needed this'

719
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,360
and it's put me in a much better
position going forward to tomorrow.

720
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,440
That was sick. Yeah.

721
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,560
Ooh!

722
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,800
A little bit gutted,
a new day tomorrow.

723
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,920
I'm not beating myself up about it.

724
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:22,000
It's not the end of the world,
it's a pudding.

725
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,280
It's the Showstopper.

726
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,040
One last chance to prove
they are worthy of Star Baker,

727
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,160
or simply that they deserve to stay.

728
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,280
Right, my gorgeous judges.

729
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,840
Three handshakes.

730
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,000
It's a personal best for you.

731
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,240
When Stacy, Stephen, Yan

732
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,880
create something that is pure magic
and perfection...

733
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,600
You've got to give it a handshake.
I've got to give them a handshake.

734
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,760
Who for you is in trouble this week?

735
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,240
PRUE:  James is in trouble.

736
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,240
I adore James, I really don't want
him to mess up, but he just could.

737
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,640
I think Kate as well.
Kate was Star Baker last week,

738
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,160
but I think she is in trouble.

739
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,480
She was bottom of technical.

740
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,040
So, coming in to the Showstopper,

741
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,760
she really has the pull out
all the stops.

742
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,880
What if you're in the middle,
you could go up or down.

743
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,560
Oh, yeah ,absolutely.  You have
totally understood mathematics,

744
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,560
and I like that about you.
I know. I didn't even go to school.

745
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Heart's beating...

746
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,760
Morning, bakers. I hope you had
sweet pudding dreams.

747
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,280
Now, for your Showstopper today,

748
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,880
Prue and Paul would like you to make
an ornamental trifle terrine.

749
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,560
You'll need three things.

750
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,640
A baked element,
a set custard or a mousse,

751
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,800
and a jelly.

752
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,200
Without those three things,
it's just chaos.

753
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,520
And everyone must want a slice.

754
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,240
The slice needs to look as good
as the whole.

755
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,400
You've got four and half hours.

756
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,400
On your marks...  Get set.  Bake!

757
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,200
Four and a half hours seems
like a lifetime,

758
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,200
but I know this is going
to rapidly go.

759
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,640
The Showstopper Challenge today,
it's all about textures,

760
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,880
definitive layers,

761
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,600
and beautiful flavours.

762
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,160
The jelly is going to be
the most difficult one,

763
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,160
because it has to be firm enough to
be sliced, but not to be rubbery.

764
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,320
This is a masterclass in gelatine.

765
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,320
Because if you don't set the jelly,
the whole thing will collapse

766
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,400
when you bring it out.

767
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,040
Starting off with the
raspberry jelly,

768
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,400
because that's the first layer,

769
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,000
so that needs to get into the
freezer as quickly as possible.

770
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,840
I'm just squeezing out my
oranges for my jelly.

771
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,040
In the topsy-turvy world
of terrines,

772
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,840
the bottom layer becomes the top.

773
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,520
I'm making pineapple,
rum and mint jelly.

774
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,040
So, getting it set early
is a priority.

775
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,840
I'm just soaking some leaf gelatine.

776
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,520
I'm using powdered gelatine,

777
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,120
it gives it, like, a really
luminous orange,

778
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,400
if it sets.

779
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,760
This is the lemon-and-lime jelly.

780
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,440
It's going to be blue, so we're
going to add a blue liqueur.

781
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,480
Because I've decided to do a
hidden design,

782
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,840
I have to use a lot of gelatine,

783
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,320
which can make things a bit rubbery.

784
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,680
We'll find out.

785
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,440
Stephen's American flag trifle will
have raspberry jelly with white

786
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,560
chocolate coconut custard stripes

787
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,480
and his stars should magically
appear when sliced.

788
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,680
How are you going to do that?

789
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,360
Layering blue jelly

790
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,200
and then pipe rows of stars

791
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,960
with a white chocolate,
butter and sugar mix.

792
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,320
When you cut it, you should get
the stars and stripes.

793
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,640
Wow.  How many stars are you actually
going to put on it?

794
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,920
I have been to nine states in
America, so I'm doing nine.

795
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,440
I'm really looking forward to
seeing how this turns out.

796
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,760
Me too.

797
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,200
Stephen's not the only baker flying
the flag for trifle.

798
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,480
I'm just laying out the fruit
in the Union Jack pattern.

799
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,680
I call it the
Missed Silver Jubilee terrine.

800
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,440
When I was about six, I missed the
street party that we had

801
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,400
outside our house because
I had chickenpox.

802
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,520
Mum brought me up a trifle and that
is what I remember

803
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,760
about the Silver Jubilee.

804
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,800
A rubbish day, basically.

805
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,800
James's regret-tinged trifle will
layer Swiss roll, Eton mess mousse,

806
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,520
and raspberry panna cotta.

807
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,560
Topped with a fruity Union Jack
in proseco jelly.

808
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,920
When you cut a slice,
you'll just see stripes?

809
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,000
Yes, so it should be
red, white, blue.

810
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,880
Then you won't see the
Union Jack any more.

811
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,560
Yes.

812
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Well, good luck.

813
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,360
It's not just James whose patriotic
spirit has been stirred up by the

814
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,520
Great British trifle.

815
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,560
My terrine is called
Heart of a Hero.

816
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,160
Dad was in the Royal Navy,
stationed in Hong Kong.

817
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,040
He was then allowed to bring his
family over to the UK.

818
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,760
It's about him risking everything,

819
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,920
mum and dad risking everything
to come over.

820
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,520
Encircled by chocolate cityscapes,

821
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,760
Yan's trifle will sandwich

822
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,200
sponge with strawberry and white
chocolate mousses,

823
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,680
crowned with an ambitious
jelly poppy.

824
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,680
I've set jelly aside, just clear.

825
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,320
I'll use the syringe to inject
the red jelly, let it set,

826
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,360
and then the black colour, yeah.

827
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,680
Very clever.  Well, let's
see if it works.

828
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,080
Good luck.  Thank you.

829
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,120
All right, this can go in the fridge
to start chilling.

830
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,360
Let's get this baby in the freezer.

831
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,200
The last layer of blue is
just chilling out.

832
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,520
Then we're going to start with the
red, white, red.

833
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,880
That's my raspberry mousse.

834
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,880
This is my Eton mess layer.

835
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,840
So, I'm making the
strawberry mousse.

836
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,200
Whipped up the cream melt in a
packet of strawberry jelly,

837
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,040
and then pureed 200g
of strawberries

838
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,960
and then push it through a sieve,

839
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,840
because it is the Bake Off.

840
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,600
Just adding my yuzu to my custard.

841
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,360
The idea of this was just born
from a flavour.

842
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,880
It's a citrus fruit.

843
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,480
They use it a lot in Japan.

844
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,920
I'm fascinated by Japanese pastry,
I love it.

845
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,240
Sophie's yuzu flavour will run
through her sponge and custard

846
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,640
with a hidden core of yuzu curd
and raspberry mousse.

847
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,040
How are you going to get that in
there?  So, that's actually

848
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,440
already in the freezer, so I've got
a mini version of this.

849
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,080
This mould, what's it called?
This is a buche mould.

850
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,520
Mighty Boosh mould?  I think it is.

851
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,080
The Mighty Boosh or the mini Boosh?

852
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,320
I'm very excited.

853
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,840
All right, I think we better
ferme our buche and go.

854
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,560
Thank you very much indeed.

855
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,560
Right, let's make a sponge.

856
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,320
I'm making my raspberry and
almond sponge.

857
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,080
I'm not mucking about with
the pink today.

858
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,560
I'm going for it.

859
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,320
This is a savoyarde sponge,
which is the stuff of

860
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,760
ladyfinger biscuits.

861
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,160
This is going right at the bottom.

862
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,720
It needs to be a decent thickness.

863
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,480
I think the key import to this
is keeping the strata.

864
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,960
So, you don't want it to sink
into the below layer.

865
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,760
It's not as thick as I'd
like it to be,

866
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,800
but let's just see.

867
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,640
Just love this colour.

868
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,640
Stacy's flamboyant sponge will join
layers of rum and pineapple jelly,

869
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,960
passion fruit, Eton mess and
mango mousse laced with chilli,

870
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,880
all perched on a coconut
biscuit base.

871
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,360
OK, I'm trying to get my head right.
So, there are five layers?

872
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,520
Yes, but there is also,
going around the outside,

873
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,280
fuchsia pink passion fruit
meringues.

874
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,440
Wow...  I think this sounds
like Stacy.

875
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,440
It's ambitious, there's about
20 different things to do.

876
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,200
So, I'm putting them on 170 degrees
for, like, half an hour?

877
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,120
Get it baked.  Ten to 12 minutes.

878
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,400
But sponge...

879
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,560
Right.

880
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,200
..isn't everyone's cup of tea.

881
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,880
I've got brown butter brownies.

882
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,120
It's inspired by my friends at uni.

883
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,720
Whenever we have a break
or whatever,

884
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,720
we always have brownies and, like,
chai latte.  Chai latte?

885
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,120
&quot;Yeah, yeah, it was really popular
in university last year.&quot;

886
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,440
What?

887
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,120
Liam's ode to student life will
layer orange jelly, chai latte,

888
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:27,840
panna cotta and chocolate mousse
on top of his brownie base.

889
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,560
I love the idea of the flavours.

890
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,560
Chai latte?  They go to a very,
like, artsy, like, university.

891
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,840
Well, I did actually go to
art school myself. So did you.

892
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,520
So did I.  So, you are speaking to
two art students here.

893
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,480
We invented the chai latte.

894
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,200
Not everyone's trifles are
quite so trendy.

895
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,880
Going for traditional trifle.

896
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,880
I've got my great, great nan to
thank for this recipe.

897
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,160
As with any good old-fashioned
trifle,

898
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,240
raspberry will flavour Kate's
meringue cream sponge and jelly,

899
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,080
with a layer of thick-set
powdered custard.

900
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,720
Well, these are classic flavours.

901
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,720
Sometimes, you can't move too far
away from tradition.

902
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,960
Keeping it simple.

903
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,400
One hour gone.

904
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,040
Sponge coming out of the oven.

905
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,040
Should be perfect.

906
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,680
Beautiful.

907
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,680
It's the most amazing pink,
isn't it?

908
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,720
Is the jelly set?

909
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,320
My orange jelly is not setting as
fast as it normally does.

910
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,440
At home, it takes, like,
half an hour to freeze over,

911
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,720
but I don't know what's
going on here.

912
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,720
It's set.  It's taking ages.

913
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,200
And like magic...

914
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,400
I'm just soaking sponge in
a fruit juice.

915
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,840
So, when I turn it out,

916
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,600
I've got a lovely, colourful trifle.

917
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,560
Julia's vanilla and liqueur-soaked
summer fruit sponges will surround

918
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,400
passion fruit jelly,
topped with chocolate mousse.

919
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,720
Are trifles popular in Siberia?

920
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,920
I've never in my life seen trifle.

921
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,240
What's trifle, then, in Russian?

922
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,200
I don't know.

923
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,200
Bakers, you have had half the time
for your ornamental trifle terrines.

924
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,520
The jelly just hasn't set.

925
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,760
Right, raspberry jelly.

926
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,760
There is a lot to do. Now I'm moving
on to the chai latte panna cotta.

927
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,520
Let's see what happens.
Let me not panic.

928
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,840
I'm just getting started on
the Eton mess.

929
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,320
When I practised it, the Eton mess
has been a mess.

930
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,600
I'm not a big fan of trifles.

931
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,600
Back to the sad day of when I
couldn't go to the Silver Jubilee.

932
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,520
What's next?  I'm doing my
custard next.

933
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,200
Just adding my yuzu custard.

934
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,160
Coconut custard.
Quite unconventional.

935
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,680
This whisks our custard powder.

936
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,320
Can't have a trifle without
a custard powder.

937
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,480
Shocking ingredients.

938
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,560
Do you like making these terrines?

939
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,640
No, not really.

940
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,440
You know, any future husband better
not be getting ideas off this.

941
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,080
If I ever get married, which is
highly unlikely at this stage...

942
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,440
Why?  I don't know.

943
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,680
Like, is this a conversation?

944
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,160
Seriously, you cook and you're
a blacksmith.

945
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,800
That's, like, the perfect
combination.  Am I going red?

946
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,800
You are, darling. I don't think this
is the best way for you to pull.

947
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,640
Bakers, one and a half hours left
on your trifle terrines.

948
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,400
I'm actually ahead of time.

949
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,200
We are, we're halfway up the flag.

950
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,200
I'm making a thin coconut biscuit
to finish off.

951
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,200
This is the white
chocolate bavarois,

952
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,680
which is going to envelop
the insert.

953
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,080
Chocolate mousse, the layer that can
make or break my terrine.

954
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,640
HE LAUGHS

955
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,680
This is going to be a
mango-lime chilli mousse,

956
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,280
just mango, lime,
and chilli in there,

957
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,120
and then I'm going to be
putting cream in.

958
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,120
I'm just making my Swiss roll.

959
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,560
A red sponge because, obviously,

960
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,600
we want it to match the colour
of the flag.

961
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,480
Just worried it's not pink enough.

962
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,360
Done.  Let's get this in the freezer.

963
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,040
Let it set.

964
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,480
MACHINE BEEPS

965
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,120
All done.

966
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,440
Now it's a waiting game.

967
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,440
Bakers, you've got half an hour
to put that welly in your jelly.

968
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,880
The terrine is in the freezer,

969
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,800
so decorations, in the meantime,
really.

970
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,320
You've certainly hit the '80s.

971
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,120
That's the plan.

972
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,640
Chocolate skyline of Hong Kong.

973
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,480
And London.  Build the future.

974
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,240
In chocolate?  In chocolate.
Totally.

975
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,960
I'm just making my topping.

976
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,960
HE GASPS

977
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,760
Massive disaster.

978
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,960
I've forgotten the sugar
in my biscuit.

979
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,720
No sugar. Got to do it again.

980
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,280
It's funny, isn't it? As soon as you
get in the tent, you just ruin it.

981
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,640
I've got to pipe the poppy.

982
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,640
So, this is gelatine and
I'm just colouring it.

983
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,120
Spot the scientist.

984
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,120
I'm just putting some silver leaf on
to the little meringue crowns.

985
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,680
I can do it better than that.
I want to make another one.

986
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,520
Come on, you can do this.

987
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,040
All I have to do is take the terrine
out of it's mould,

988
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,560
with a cool biscuit underneath.

989
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,800
But the biscuit isn't cool because
it is in the oven now.

990
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,520
Bit of a problem.

991
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,640
Amazing.  It is called
Heart of a Hero.

992
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,200
That's my dad's heart.
He's a hero.

993
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,720
That is so clever, dude.

994
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,160
I'm just waiting for my
terrine to set.

995
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,600
Fingers crossed
it will come out firm.

996
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,400
Or a nice wash.

997
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,280
Can you imagine?

998
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,280
Happy with it?  Can't really tell
until it is unmolded.

999
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:42,120
Ah, it's nerve-racking.

1000
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:47,080
Really soft, so I'm just going to
do it really gently.

1001
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,040
Come on.  I feel sick.

1002
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,120
Come on, you can do this.

1003
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,520
Oh, wow. That's beautiful.

1004
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,120
Is the jelly set?

1005
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,440
Not great. Hasn't quite
frozen solid.

1006
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,080
15 minutes left.

1007
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,240
15 minutes only.

1008
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,440
Make or break.  That's my girl.

1009
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,320
Trying to get it as smooth
as possible.

1010
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,040
It's dribbling, it's dribbling.
It's dribbling in loads, it's...

1011
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,640
Look, look! It's an absolute mess.

1012
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,160
Stop panicking.  It's dribbling.

1013
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:25,160
And it's a mess.

1014
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,000
Really need them to speed up,
I am stressing out.

1015
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
It's not going to set.

1016
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,960
Someone tell me it's going
to be fine.

1017
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,960
It's dripping, it's dripping.

1018
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,640
It's fine. It's all fine.

1019
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,640
It's all fine.

1020
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,440
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1021
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,840
Ta-da. Oh.

1022
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,720
Bakers, that is the end of your
Showstopper Challenge.

1023
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,720
Done.

1024
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,600
Are you OK?
Are you all right, babe?

1025
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,600
I don't know what happened
to my orange jelly...

1026
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
HE SIGHS

1027
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:35,240
Sophie, please bring up your
ornamental trifle terrine.

1028
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,440
It's wonderful that you got your
pink sausage in the middle.

1029
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,080
Yeah.

1030
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,760
I like the look of it, I love the
colours.

1031
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,960
Wow, it drops through lovely.

1032
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,880
Well, that worked, didn't it?

1033
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,880
Beautiful.  The slice is pretty, very
good slice.

1034
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,920
And that yuzu really comes through.

1035
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,840
That's absolutely delicious.

1036
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,920
Brilliant.  Really good.
The sponge...

1037
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,160
..the bavarois, the mousse, the
jelly...

1038
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,160
I think, altogether, you've created
something very pretty, very
high-class.

1039
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,920
Really delicious.

1040
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,560
Amazing, isn't it?  I actually love
it.

1041
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:29,560
And to get the gelatine to create
the poppy - it's very clever.

1042
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,480
Wow.

1043
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,080
The strawberry mousse is a triumph!
But, who doesn't like strawberry
mousse?

1044
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,000
The custard, I think you've got a
little bit too much gelatine in
there.

1045
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
It's just set on the wrong side of
firm, but it looks incredible.

1046
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,280
Thank you.

1047
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,880
Well, it's certainly jolly.

1048
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,120
Pink is proper pink, isn't it?

1049
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,920
Yeah.

1050
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,480
Well, the slice is pretty, isn't it?

1051
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,480
Yeah.

1052
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,600
This is spot-on.

1053
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,840
The lime, the mint...

1054
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,120
..the chilli!

1055
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,040
Who would have a chilli in a trifle?

1056
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,360
But it works, that little heat at
the end is fascinating.

1057
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,200
The biscuit down in the bottom is
delicious.

1058
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,280
Meringues around the outside,
again, genius.

1059
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,200
I think you come up with something
that is truly unique,

1060
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,200
and tastes beautiful.

1061
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,280
It's neat, it's clean, stark lines.

1062
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,320
The difference in colour's
phenomenal.

1063
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,200
The jelly is very nice, and tart,
and really raspberry!

1064
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,160
It's delicious. The custard takes me
back a few years.

1065
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,920
I used a bit of custard powder.

1066
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,120
Me Nan used to do something very
similar to that.

1067
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,120
It's very good.

1068
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:05,000
It does look a bit firm.

1069
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,560
It's too firm on all of it.

1070
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,960
White chocolate is very sweet.

1071
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,480
The best bit is the prosecco jelly
on the top.

1072
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,000
All the other layers are not
carrying much flavour.

1073
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
It's a bit sickly.

1074
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,440
Overall, I think the appearance is
all right, actually.

1075
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,440
I'm fascinated to see what it's
like inside.

1076
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,440
Right.

1077
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,120
I don't think the jelly works,
funnily enough,

1078
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,480
although I love passion fruit.

1079
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,240
It almost tastes watery.

1080
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,240
The passion fruit isn't strong
enough for me.

1081
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,040
The texture and everything is OK,
that soggy sponge, though,

1082
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,120
I just don't get.

1083
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:50,120
That's a shame.

1084
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,480
Oh!  Oh!  Look at that!

1085
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,000
Wow.

1086
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Isn't that fantastic?

1087
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,640
Ha!

1088
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,880
It's very clever.

1089
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,880
The stars are amazing.
Thank you.

1090
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,920
The coconut flavour's lovely.

1091
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,560
It's a little tough.

1092
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,760
Hmm...

1093
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,720
..disappointing.

1094
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,400
I don't like rubber...

1095
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,280
Yeah.  ..and it is, it's too much
gelatine in there.

1096
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,520
I think you've gone for appearance
rather than textures.
Yeah.

1097
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,400
It's not good.
OK.

1098
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,400
It's a shame, cos it looks amazing.

1099
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,680
Everyone's had a style over
substance, at least once.

1100
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,960
I think it a bit clumsy, and the
jelly's not set.

1101
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,040
Yeah, it's...yeah.  Wow!

1102
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,560
It's like water, that jelly,
isn't it?

1103
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,560
LIAM SCOFFS

1104
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,320
I do get the chai.

1105
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,440
Chai latte panna cotta is delicious.

1106
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,640
Chocolate brownie...

1107
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,280
..is quite tough.

1108
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,280
And your jelly is a disaster.

1109
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,440
VOICEOVER:  I'd like to stay in, but
I think I'm in the danger zone.

1110
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,760
And there's a few of us who are
quite worried, I think, tonight.

1111
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,640
VOICEOVER:  Oh, I hope I'm...I will
be here next week, but...

1112
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,760
SHE SNIFFS

1113
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,760
..I really don't think so.

1114
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,760
VOICEOVER:  I just hope they see it
was just a blip.

1115
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,160
I just hope they see past it.

1116
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:06,000
HE SIGHS

1117
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,040
Right, who's vying for
the top place?

1118
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,520
I thought Sophie's was delicious.

1119
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,800
If you walked into a
Michelin-starred restaurant

1120
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,640
and had that, you wouldn't
argue it.  It's absolutely superb.

1121
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,160
What about Stacey?  Very clever.

1122
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,440
Every layer was good.

1123
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,960
She's definitely a contender.

1124
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,520
What about Kate?
Has she saved herself?

1125
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,800
I think she has saved herself.

1126
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,760
It's not the first time
that Kate's done that.

1127
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,160
The whole thing together as one when
you eat it is absolutely delicious,

1128
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,640
and actually quite elegant, too.

1129
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,360
The one who I wanted
to weep for is Liam.

1130
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,920
It's all too clumsy.

1131
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,640
I, sort of, weep for him, as well.

1132
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,920
He could do better than that,
and he knows that, as well.

1133
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,360
The other one who I think
is in trouble is James.

1134
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,520
Fantastic jelly.

1135
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,120
Problem for me is every other
element was wrong.

1136
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,200
Julia's was really disappointing.

1137
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,720
She had a passion-fruit jelly
with very little flavour.

1138
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,720
Julia, yeah, she's put herself
into a bit of trouble.

1139
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,200
Well, you've got a lot to decide.

1140
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,840
Meanwhile, we'll just double-check
that this is, you know...

1141
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:06,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1142
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,440
Right, bakers, I get
the best job of the week,

1143
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,320
cos I get to announce
the Star Baker.

1144
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,680
The Star Baker this week is
the baker whose terrine,

1145
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,960
the four of us have literally
just finished off,

1146
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,160
cos it was so delicious.

1147
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:28,600
The Star Baker is...

1148
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,280
..Sophie.

1149
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,120
APPLAUSE

1150
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:37,120
Which means that I've got
the horrible job of revealing

1151
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,120
who's leaving us.

1152
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:45,120
The person that we have
to say goodbye to is...

1153
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,480
..James.

1154
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,480
I'm sorry, mate.

1155
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,120
I'm so sorry.  That's all right.

1156
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,760
SHE QUIETLY SOBS

1157
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,400
Thanks, Paul.
Unlucky, buddy.

1158
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,360
VOICEOVER:  My time has come.

1159
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,240
It's gutting.

1160
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,240
I wanted to do this to put myself
against other really good bakers

1161
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,440
to see how good I was.

1162
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,440
To be part of that has been
really humbling.

1163
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,600
PRUE:  We will miss James
in the tent.

1164
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,720
Julia was sobbing her eyes out,
and who was comforting her?

1165
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,640
Don't get me going. I'm not crying.

1166
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,720
That's typical of James.
He's just such a nice guy.

1167
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,280
Well done, Sophie. That was
delicious.  Thank you very much.

1168
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,160
VOICEOVER:  With the Showstopper,
Sophie stepped up to the plate,

1169
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,200
and produced one of those
bakes that you just

1170
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,560
want to go back for again
and again and again and again.

1171
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,160
Yeah, Star Baker.
I will try and enjoy the moment,

1172
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,840
before I start thinking
about next week.

1173
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,600
But, yeah, I'm really chuffed.

1174
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,360
Are you OK?  Yeah.

1175
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,800
It was really important
that I did well yesterday,

1176
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,800
because if I didn't...

1177
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,920
All I need to do next week is just
pick myself back up and just keep

1178
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,640
on going upwards.

1179
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:03,640
That's how I'm going to do it.
That's the plan. That's the plan.

1180
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,880
Next time...

1181
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,920
Whoa.

1182
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,280
..pastry. A decorative Signature
with shortcrusts worthy

1183
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,440
of &quot;Piecasso&quot;.

1184
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,560
The little hearts,
absolutely beautifully done.

1185
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,440
A technical tart that
causes Portuguese panic.

1186
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,000
I think it's turned
to scrambled egg.

1187
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,920
And a showstopping pie.
Lot of meat.

1188
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,400
..with a crust...
I can't believe I'm so stupid.

1189
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,680
..that lands the bakers...

1190
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,520
In my opinion, that's
not a hand-raised pie.

1191
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,200
..in very hot water.

1192
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,800
I'm leaking, but maybe
they won't notice.

1193
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,800
That... That could happen.

1194
00:57:37,320 --> 00:58:01,000
