00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,320
SANDI IMITATES YORKSHIRE ACCENT:
To think we've had two weeks

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,720
in t'Bake Off tent.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,560
Here we are, week three.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,560
Two bakers gone,
now just ten remain.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,640
Grand times.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,520
I don't know why I'm doing
the voice in your head.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,880
I can't do the accent,
keeps coming out a bit Indian.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,360
Well, go to the top of our
stairs, you're here now, lad,

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,880
might as well do this.

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,880
Welcome to the
Great British Bake Off.

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,480
Last time, the bakers
battled biscuits...

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,120
SHE GASPS
..Sophie came close again...

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,920
I think it's wonderful.
..but it was checkmate to Steven...

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,800
That is exceptional.  ..winning Star
Baker for the second week in a row.

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,600
SHE GROANS
So frustrating!

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,400
Stacey and Flo were at
breaking point...

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,880
Ah! Job cracked.

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,240
..but it was Chris that folded
under the pressure...

20
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,560
This is so embarrassing.

21
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,600
..and was the second baker
to say goodbye.

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,080
Now it's bread week.

23
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,080
What can go wrong?  They'll be taking
on a signature tea-time classic...

24
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,880
Ah! They've sunk.  ..getting stuck
into the technical...

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,920
Two fingers.

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,160
I just know how Paul does it.

27
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,320
..and going all-out to attempt...

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,840
I've never baked a dragon before.

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,840
..the toughest bread sculpture
challenge ever set on the Bake Off.

30
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,360
I feel like you're trying
to psych me out.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,320
I quite like this accent, I might
stick with it, go up the path,

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,200
and 'ave a bath.  Really suits you.

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,280
What about you, could
you pretend to be well-bred?

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,600
Actually, I am well-bred,

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,560
I just pretend to be
a street urchin, you know,

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,160
give me a bit of an edge.
Check this out.

37
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,200
HE IMITATES POSH ACCENT:
Toodle-pip, everyone,

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,200
and welcome to bread week.

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,840
This is probably the week
I've been...dreading!

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,320
Bread's not my forte.

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,640
I love bread and I can't wait
to get on with it.

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,080
I've been making bread
for about 40 years.

43
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,560
I've said that now.

44
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,040
I hope they turn out good today!

45
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,120
I love bread, but I make
it for my family,

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,480
I don't make it for
Mr Paul Hollywood.

47
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,440
I hope I haven't peaked because I
really would like Star Baker again -

48
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,120
it's kind of addictive.

49
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,840
Morning, lovely bakers,
welcome to bread week.

50
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,800
Today, Prue and Paul would like
you to make 12 teacakes.

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,160
Your teacakes need to be round,
they need to be identical,

52
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,000
made with an enriched dough,

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,280
and your fruit of choice
needs to be evenly distributed.

54
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,680
You can serve them
with accompaniments.

55
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,720
Maybe a jazz singer.

56
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,600
Yeah, that'd be nice,
or just jam is fine, too.

57
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,760
You've got 2 hours 45 minutes.

58
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,680
On your marks.  Get set.

59
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,000
Bake!

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,480
This is the biggest week for me.

61
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,760
It's my chance to show them
that I can bake bread.

62
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,000
Still a bit nervous, I'm not
a great one for bread week.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,920
We don't make a lot of
bread at home.

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,880
Fingers crossed,
I've tried these quite a lot,

65
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,720
so everyone at home
is absolutely sick of teacakes.

66
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,160
Teacakes are made from
an enriched dough,

67
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,160
which contains extra fats, eggs,

68
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,520
sugars and fruit, all of which
can inhibit the yeast,

69
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,280
preventing the all-important rise.

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,640
With an enriched dough,

71
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,240
they have two prove it for
a little bit longer

72
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,160
because it's full of butter,
so it will rise more slowly.

73
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,640
If they under-prove, the dough
will be very tight inside.

74
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,760
If they over-prove,

75
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,000
it'll just basically flatten
out like a pancake.

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,680
Some of the bakers will do very
unusual flavours, I'm sure,

77
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,680
and I love that. I don't think
I should have a closed mind,

78
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,240
however much I like
a traditional teacake.

79
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,240
They can put cranberries in there,
sultanas, mixed peel.

80
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,120
As long as it tastes sweet
and delicious,

81
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,120
and spread out equally amongst the
whole teacake, I'll be happy.

82
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,960
I've got me milk on to boil,

83
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,960
so I'm making blueberry and cardamom
teacakes, with, like,

84
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
cinnamon through it as well,

85
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,720
just because it's all the flavours
of, like, sticky buns, you know

86
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,120
those cinnamon buns that you get?

87
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,440
Like, they're like my
favourite thing.

88
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,640
Back home in Liverpool,

89
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,640
Kate often bakes bread and cakes
for a local homeless charity.

90
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,320
She's filling her teacakes
with dried blueberries

91
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,600
and infused spices.

92
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,080
That's gone a bit wrong.

93
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,160
No, I'm going to start this again
because my hob turned off

94
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,440
and now my butter's gone weird.

95
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,320
Oh!

96
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,840
I think they have too much clo...

97
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,600
Ugh!

98
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,960
Hello, Liam.  Morning.  Morning.

99
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,680
Tell us about your teacake.

100
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,280
So I actually didn't know
what a teacake was.

101
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,440
Have you never had one?  No.

102
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,800
So I was, like, OK,

103
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,800
something that's remotely similar is
my nan's Jamaican Easter bun.

104
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Liam's been following his nan's
recipes since he was 15.

105
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,200
His homage to her Jamaican roots

106
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,440
will be packed with
cherries and raisins

107
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,440
and made with a dough infused with a
stout he's just old enough to drink.

108
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,760
What sort of texture are
we expecting inside?

109
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,320
Teacake texture.
Right, and that is...?

110
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,200
Very nice.
THEY LAUGH

111
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,640
I'm just putting the milk
in the dough,

112
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,360
see if I can get it the
right consistency.

113
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,800
Oh, that's nice! That is nice.

114
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,160
So I'm making a kind of
Dutch-Nordic-inspired teacake.

115
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,960
Go, James!  Playing to the crowd.

116
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,560
James is no stranger to
trying something new.

117
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,360
At home, he has a lengthy to-do list
of bakes he'd like to master.

118
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,040
Today, he can tick off fruited
teacakes, with cardamom, citrus,

119
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,920
and infused dried fruit to give
them a Nordic twist.

120
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,200
What makes a good teacake?

121
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,040
Well, I don't like teacakes,
to be honest.

122
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,200
I think they're the poor
cousin of the hot-cross bun.

123
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,840
You are joking, aren't you?  No.

124
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,400
These are great for, like,
a lunchtime snack...  Lunchtime?!

125
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,880
Well, in the Nordics.  You can't
tell cos of the light in there,

126
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,440
you can't really tell if it's
morning, evening, night or what.

127
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,440
Don't you start with your
anti-Scandinavian nonsense!

128
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,600
Oh, I love a bit of kneading.

129
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,200
Cos you don't have
to go to the gym.

130
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,960
As well as providing a workout,

131
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,720
kneading creates the gluten
that gives dough its strength

132
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,160
and structure.

133
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Without enough kneading, the bakers'
teacakes will be dense and flat.

134
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,920
Lots of people say,
&quot;Oh, if you're really angry,

135
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,240
&quot;like, knead and put
your anger in the dough,&quot;

136
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,480
but I always feel like I can't do
that because I love my dough.

137
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,400
You think, &quot;I love you, I love you!&quot;

138
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,560
Julia's been married to husband
Matt for three years.

139
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,720
It's her English mother-in-law's
love of toasted teacakes

140
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,720
that's inspired her Earl Grey-infused
apricot and cherry version.

141
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,720
Just need to get the dough proving
as quick as possible.

142
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
I just want to get it right.

143
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,840
Cos rushing too much creates
panic, doesn't it?

144
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,400
Who needs panic? Nobody.

145
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,680
I call them my tagine teacakes

146
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,080
because they are based on the
leftovers that I had from a tagine.

147
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,880
All the ingredients, minus the lamb.

148
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,080
Trainee stuntwoman Sophie started
baking six years ago

149
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,760
when she left the Army and
the officers' mess behind

150
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,800
and finally got her own kitchen.

151
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,240
Her tagine-inspired teacakes will
be filled with spiced dates,

152
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,200
almonds and apricots.
You're a stuntwoman, aren't you?

153
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,080
You can probably do
stunt falls, can't you?

154
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,640
Rolls.  Combat roll, I used to...

155
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,040
Combat roll, do you learn
that at stunt school?

156
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,360
Erm, I actually learnt that
when I was doing judo.

157
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,880
They call it a break fall.
Judo, very similar to comedy.

158
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,320
First day at comedy
school, banana skin.

159
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,720
Of course!

160
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,360
Once the bakers feel their
dough's kneaded enough...

161
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,640
I like the feel of it,
when it changes from this, like,

162
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,560
gloopy mess into a nice silky ball.

163
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,840
..the dough needs to prove.

164
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,720
Prove that for about 45 minutes.

165
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,720
This is going to prove for an hour.

166
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,480
It's a waiting game now, just
waiting for it all to prove.

167
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,240
What have you put yours on?  One.

168
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,760
Half.  See, I've put mine on 30.

169
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,720
30?  It's on holiday in there!

170
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,800
SHE LAUGHS

171
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,960
Holidaying in Greece!

172
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,560
Steven comes from a family where
recipe books are piled high.

173
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,400
He's hoping for a hat-trick
of Star Baker crowns.

174
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,440
He's going all out with his
Madras cocktail teacakes

175
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,160
flavoured with orange and cranberry
and with a unique accompaniment.

176
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,920
So this is vodka butter.

177
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,920
The vodka is purely there
to lift flavour.

178
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,080
Oh, I can taste it.

179
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,040
This is called keri no chundo, it's
the equivalent of mango chutney.

180
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,240
My friend's mum has this for
breakfast every morning.

181
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,480
She likes it a bit more spicier than
I'm going to present it

182
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,320
because I don't want to
blow their heads off.

183
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,320
After an unconventional commute home
from work, Yan loves to bake bread.

184
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,320
Her spicy keri no chundo will
accompany her honey-glazed

185
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,280
masala-chai teacakes.

186
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,120
You've got a little bit of
an injury there.

187
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,680
Yeah.  Is that a baking injury?

188
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,200
No, it's a scooting injury.
I fell off my scooter.

189
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,520
What, like a moped?

190
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,120
No, a...

191
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,880
A children's scooter?

192
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,760
It's an...

193
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,040
Little bit embarrassing.
Little bit embarrassing!

194
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,000
Maybe you need to take some
tips from Sophie.

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,680
Cos, you know, she's a stuntwoman,
so she can do those stunt falls.

196
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,520
Tuck and roll?  Yeah, the tuck and
roll.  Well, this is a minor injury,

197
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,320
could have been worse.  No, that's
not bad, actually.  That's not bad.

198
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,200
It makes you look a little bit,
you know, dangerous, a bit edgy!

199
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,560
You're so edgy, Yan!

200
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,480
I quite like doing these bread
cos it's nice and quiet.

201
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,200
Aw, I don't know, this makes me
nervous, the sort of sitting around.

202
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,280
Everything makes me nervous.

203
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,600
Back in her own kitchen,

204
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,000
Flo loves to share her 40 years of
baking knowledge with granddaughter

205
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,880
Lydia.  That's the
Elvis Presley quiff.

206
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,320
She's making spiced
mixed-fruit teacakes

207
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
served with orange and whisky jam.

208
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,440
I feel terrible sitting down here.

209
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,720
With one hour of the bake
already gone...

210
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,160
I feel as if I'm doing nothing.

211
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,240
..the bakers need to manage
their time carefully.

212
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,800
It's definitely grown.

213
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,280
I think mine's ready.  Spend too much
time on their first prove

214
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,120
and they won't have enough
for the second.

215
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,680
I can't leave it in
there any longer.

216
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,960
I think another five minutes,
then I'll stretch it out,

217
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,320
get the fruit in there, cos I think
the second prove's more important,

218
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,400
as you're making the actual
shapes of the buns, so...

219
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,800
Now I'm introducing
the dried fruits,

220
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,320
the cranberry and the orange zest.

221
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,720
The only thing that
I always stuff up on

222
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,800
is my fruit being
evenly distributed.

223
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,800
The thing is with adding fruit now,
it's not easy to mix it in

224
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
because it all just falls out.

225
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,160
I've rolled it up like
a sausage roll

226
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,600
to try and get it quite
even to start with,

227
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,120
then it's just a lot of kneading.

228
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,280
Ensuring their teacakes are
all the same size

229
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,000
is about attention to detail.

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,200
You've got to get them
as even as possible, really,

231
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,720
so that they cook evenly
in the oven.

232
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,360
Pretty straightforward -
what can go wrong?

233
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,400
If the fruit pokes through,
it tends to catch in the oven.

234
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,720
I'm sort of smoothing the dough,
pushing it round, tucking it under,

235
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,120
so all the fruit's in the middle.

236
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,120
I didn't even know what a teacake
was cos in Scotland a teacake is,

237
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,880
like, a mallow thing
with chocolate and a biscuit.

238
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,480
Tom's homeland may have denied him
a lifetime of fruited teacakes

239
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,320
but it's given him plenty of lochs
to swim in at the weekends.

240
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,280
Agh!

241
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,160
He's making a cranberry
and orange fruited teacake,

242
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,320
and for extra sweetness he's adding
chunks of white chocolate.

243
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,240
You've managed very well
to have your fruit hidden.

244
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,480
Is there any fruit in there?

245
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,880
There are. I hate when
you get a teacake

246
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,200
and you get a little cranberry or
something that's like a bullet.

247
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,920
I actually think it looks like a
good teacake when you've got a bit

248
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,720
of fruit on the top, personally,
but who am I to judge?

249
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,920
Ooh, that's good.

250
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,840
Stacey makes bread every
week for her family.

251
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,160
She's channelling all the flavours
of Christmas with her cranberry and

252
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,760
cinnamon teacakes.  Are you
egg-washing these before they go in

253
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,520
the oven?  I'm putting a bit of milk
on the top and it makes them nice

254
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,520
and soft.  You put milk on the top?

255
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,680
Right, bakers, you've got one hour
left, 60 good teacaking minutes.

256
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,840
That is really not a
long enough time.  Ooh!

257
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,840
The addition of fruit means
the second prove will take longer.

258
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,440
I'm going to leave it in for as long
as I can before they have to go into

259
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,160
the oven.  How are we supposed to
prove two in the proving drawer?

260
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,160
I'm stacking them, with bowls.

261
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,640
SHE GASPS
Oh, dammit!

262
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,440
Almost had squashed ones.

263
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,160
Instead of perilously stacking
in the proving drawer,

264
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,800
Steven's opted to use somewhere that
already has more shelves.

265
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,640
Hopefully in this

266
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,920
proving oven, that should

267
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,920
be all right.  More waiting.
HE CHUCKLES

268
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,840
Hello, Flo.  Hello.

269
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,680
So you can have a little
rest now, can't you?

270
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,320
I can, yep. Can't be doing
with clock-watching.

271
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,280
Wow.  I never time a cake or nothing.

272
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,160
All in here?  Mm.
That's magic, isn't it?

273
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,440
Mmm. Yes.

274
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,080
Do you just get a sense, a feel?

275
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,400
Yeah. Yeah.  A touch.

276
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,440
Ah. Not all the time.

277
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,120
Didn't last week!
HE LAUGHS

278
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,720
There's 30 minutes, bakers,
just 30 minutes left!

279
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,160
Great.

280
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,240
To avoid under-baked teacakes,

281
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,120
judging the precise moment
to stop proving

282
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,120
and start baking is critical.

283
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm going to go in in
five minutes, you know.

284
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,880
Ah...  You all right there, mate?

285
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,800
Mine are going in.  You're going in?

286
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,520
I'm going in. They look big enough.

287
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,520
These have not had
long enough to prove.

288
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,560
Yep. Come on, bad boys.

289
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,960
Oh, mine are huge.

290
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,120
They haven't rised as much as
I wanted to, but, like,

291
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,360
you've just got to crack on.
I'm egg-washing the teacakes

292
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,440
so they come out nice and shiny.
I'm putting a bit of milk on the top

293
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,040
and it makes them nice and soft.

294
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,280
Argh, they've sunk, they've sunk!

295
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,000
They just... The proving, I think
they've just proved too quickly

296
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,960
and they've gone, &quot;Bleurgh.&quot;

297
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,120
15 minutes, bakers, 15 minutes!

298
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Right, they'll go in for 15.

299
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,120
Going in, OK?

300
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,040
I've put them in at 190.

301
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,800
I have 160.

302
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,200
You're 160?  I went 160.

303
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,640
160? That's low.

304
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,880
I don't know whether to do 180.

305
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,960
Do what you normally do,
don't listen to me, sorry.

306
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh, I don't know now!
It's the blind leading the blind.

307
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,680
How long have we had, do you know?

308
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,680
How long have we got?
Bakers, you have five minutes!

309
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,640
They're not going to be ready.

310
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,920
I'm coming out, I'm coming out,
I'm coming out.

311
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,920
Mine aren't ready,
so I'm not taking them out.

312
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,560
They're looking fabulous. I think
I'm going to get one tray out.

313
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,840
Oh, my days.

314
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,840
They're going to cut into it and
it's going to be raw. Aw, I'm dead.

315
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,600
Bakers, you have one minute left.

316
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Oh...  One minute!  Ooh...

317
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,600
I actually think they're ready.

318
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,000
Ow! They're hot. Ow!

319
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,880
SHE GASPS

320
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,200
Jam, jam, jam, jam, jam, jam, jam...
Oh, thank you, lovely.

321
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,840
Do you want me to put these in?

322
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,120
Put them on the top.
Bakers, your time's up!

323
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,000
Step away from your teacakes!
LIAM SIGHS

324
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,480
The bakers' teacakes will now face
the judgment of Paul and Prue.

325
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,080
I think they're a bit small.

326
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,560
I think teacakes should be
big and flat.

327
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,720
These are sort of buns.

328
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Good fruit distribution in there.

329
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,080
I think you have slightly
over baked them.

330
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,120
Yeah.  I get the blueberry,
I get the cinnamon.

331
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,560
They taste terrific.

332
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,760
Thank you.  Nice...  Thank you.
..buns.

333
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,760
SHE GIGGLES

334
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,560
Great texture.  Thank you.

335
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,120
The proving is perfect.

336
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,800
And the baking is perfect.

337
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,640
It's got good flavour.

338
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,520
That tastes fantastic.

339
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,080
Yeah.  You just need that temperature
to be up by 20 degrees.

340
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,680
That's fair enough.  And you ended
up with the perfect teacakes.

341
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,520
Congratulations.
Brilliant, thank you.

342
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,520
Handshake from me.
Thanks very much.  Means nothing.

343
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,560
These two look heavily fruited,
and these don't.

344
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,640
They might not be when
you open them,

345
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,320
but the truth is it's
better not to have these outside,

346
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,000
because they get a bit
too overcooked.

347
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,920
My problem is, is
I don't think it's baked.

348
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,120
Oh, no.

349
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,120
It's not baked.  That's not good.

350
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,560
Have you got any
salt in there?  Yeah.

351
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,200
Yeah, a little bit of salt.
Not enough.

352
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,520
It's bland.  Bland.  Do you know,

353
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,960
I think you could have done
with a bit more fruit in here.

354
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,480
What temperature was your oven?

355
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,480
160.  Too low.

356
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Smells great.

357
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,640
Actually, I quite like it.  Yeah?

358
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah, I do. The thing it needs,
though, is more spice.

359
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,520
Oh, really? OK.  Yeah.

360
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,600
It just lacks flavour, but actually

361
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,600
the fruit is lovely.

362
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,320
I think it's clever of you
to have rolled them,

363
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
so that the fruit is really encased.

364
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,120
Never got any fruit in that one.

365
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,680
Never got any fruit in that one.
LAUGHTER

366
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,120
But the flavour of the dough is
excellent, and that balances it out,

367
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,320
so by the time you've toasted it and
put your butter on, it tastes good.

368
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,320
That's the closest thing I've
had to a teacake so far.

369
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,400
I think you baked it OK.

370
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,680
I honestly think it's
a good teacake.

371
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,680
It looks like a teacake, it feels
like a teacake, it's not hard.

372
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,560
I think your choice of milk
was a big problem.

373
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,320
Yeah.  Because if you'd had egg on
that, they'd look as they should.

374
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,000
I know.  But you've
got the basic shape,

375
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and you've got a decent teacake.

376
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,400
There seems to be plenty
of fruit in there.

377
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,120
I'm certainly getting the fruit, and
certainly getting the orange.

378
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,160
Spices, yeah, I'm getting that too.

379
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,080
Overall, I think the flavour's good,
distribution's good, the size is OK,

380
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,080
just slightly under proved.  OK.

381
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,600
It's a little doughy, isn't it?

382
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,160
It's the volume of fruit, and
it's added all the moisture to it.

383
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,080
But overall
the flavour's nice, you know?

384
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,800
It does have a very
good flavour, though.

385
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,280
What else is in the mango?
Cardamom, cumin, chilli.

386
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,240
It's amazing, there's so
many things going on.

387
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,480
Beautiful chutney.  And a
little bit of a kick at the end.

388
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,040
I didn't want to blow your
heads off.

389
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,520
That's great.  It's delicious.
Thank you.  Very, very good.

390
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,520
Really delicious.

391
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,920
They, my friend,
are not your finest hour.

392
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,880
They are pretty bad.
It's just over proved.

393
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,120
Because you've heated it up,

394
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,200
the whole thing's fallen apart,
you know.  Yeah.

395
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,200
On the other hand, your vodka
cocktail looks absolutely wonderful.

396
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,320
You know what, it's
absolutely delicious!

397
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,920
Try a bit of vodka butter, Paul,
see if you change your mind!

398
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,920
THEY CHUCKLE

399
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,680
They're still over proved!

400
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,680
I got my negative feedback
that I've been waiting for.

401
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,840
I think he referred to it
as &quot;not my finest hour.&quot;

402
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,080
It was really disappointing.

403
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,880
By far my worst bake
in the tent, hands down.

404
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,640
I need to come, like, top three
in the Technical, or, like,

405
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,360
I'm in trouble.

406
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,600
I do feel relieved,
yeah, definitely.

407
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,200
Just looking forward to the
Technical now.

408
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,760
I mean, I think for someone who has
never really eaten a teacake,

409
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,320
for Paul to say it was the
closest thing to teacake

410
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,560
he'd had so far was,
that was pretty good.

411
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,600
I would very much like them to say,
&quot;Wow, you've nailed it.&quot;

412
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,440
That's what I want,
&quot;Wow, you've nailed it.&quot;

413
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,440
Hasn't happened yet.

414
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,720
NOEL:  Bread week isn't about
to get any easier.

415
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,920
The bakers could practice for
their first challenge,

416
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,120
but not for the next one.

417
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,120
And they're tackling another classic
in the world of great British bread.

418
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,560
Right, bakers, it's time for your
Technical Challenge,

419
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,760
which, surprise, surprise,
has been set for you today by Paul.

420
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,240
Paul, any words of wisdom?

421
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,040
We expect perfection.

422
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,000
No pressure.

423
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm going to have to ask you two
lovelies to leave, sorry.

424
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,400
Off you go.

425
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,320
It's all right,
they're going drag racing.

426
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,760
Yeah, it's the Prue Paul Drag Race.

427
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,680
That is the pun to end all puns!

428
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,720
LAUGHTER

429
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,640
Right, for your Technical Challenge,

430
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,960
Paul would like you today to
make a cottage loaf.

431
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,600
Now, the cottage loaf, the history
of it, dates back hundreds of years,

432
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,640
to a time we call PM,

433
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,640
pre-mixer, so you are going to be
making your dough by hand.

434
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,280
You've got 2.5 hours.

435
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,800
On your marks...  Get set...

436
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,360
BOTH:  Bake!

437
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,600
Lovely jubbly.

438
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,800
Cottage loaves have been baked in
Britain for hundreds of years.

439
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,480
Oh, my God, something I know.

440
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,120
I'm just so pleased I
know what it is.

441
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,920
I kind of know what I'm doing.

442
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,360
But not all our bakers have this
loaf in their repertoire.

443
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,080
I've not made one before.

444
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,360
It is very daunting.

445
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,560
I don't bake a lot of bread.

446
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,560
What can go wrong?
Apart from everything.

447
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,680
Why have you set a cottage loaf
for a challenge?

448
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,360
These are the best amateur bakers
Great Britain has to offer,

449
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,360
so I expect them to be able to
make a decent cottage loaf.

450
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,520
What I want to see is the smaller
piece of dough on the top,

451
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,480
but not too small, larger on the
bottom, good, even colour,

452
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,200
and good slashes all the way around.

453
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,760
What can go wrong, Paul?

454
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,440
Shaping, obviously,
is the key point,

455
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,400
because you've got to be able to
bond the top and the bottom.

456
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,960
If they don't, the bottom
will blow off the top,

457
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,560
so the top will literally fall off.

458
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,760
So it's all about making both
the balls quite tight,

459
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,200
and the way that you do that,
and the way I do it is just

460
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,000
drive my finger right the way
through to the tray underneath.

461
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,280
Do you flour your finger?

462
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,040
HE SNIGGERS

463
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,400
You must, otherwise it would
just stick to the dough!

464
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,400
I could oil it!

465
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,960
Make a dough!

466
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,520
That's it, that's all we get.

467
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,040
The instructions are pretty vague,

468
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,680
so I'm just trying to get as much
liquid into it as possible,

469
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,200
without it becoming like sloppy.

470
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,280
I've never made one before
in my life,

471
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,240
so I've gone for the rubbing in the
lard, don't know if that's right.

472
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,040
I'm going to make the basic dough,
flour, salty-ish water.

473
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,440
If you put too much water in it,
it goes drunk,

474
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,200
what I've experienced loads!

475
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,200
When I've made it once before,
the little one on top, lid, off.

476
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Obviously, I've got a lot to
make up for from this morning.

477
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,600
Making the dough by hand.

478
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,000
Oh, my God.
It is quite a long process.

479
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,480
My muscles are aching so bad.

480
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,920
I'm knackered.

481
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,520
If it's not kneaded enough,
it just loses all its shape.

482
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,440
I don't know if that's
right or not, but...

483
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,040
It feels like it should
feel, I guess?

484
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,920
I can't really afford to
leave it much longer.

485
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,440
It's all about time management.

486
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,840
I'm just about to
do the window pane test.

487
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,400
If it doesn't get a hole in it, that
means the gluten's developed enough.

488
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,640
If you can stretch it, I can
say it's almost ready, so...

489
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,760
30 more seconds for luck.

490
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,280
It's going into its first prove.

491
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,040
I love Paul's
instructions, don't you?

492
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,400
Prove. Do it.

493
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,640
He hasn't given us any info.

494
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,840
Prove it for 40 minutes.

495
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,120
We're going to do it
for about an hour.

496
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,440
Play it by ear.

497
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,080
45 and check it.

498
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,840
If the dough doesn't prove enough,
the loaf won't come up and rise.

499
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,600
What I want is double in size.

500
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,600
The dough's in the proving drawer,
so we just wait.

501
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,600
I feel, like, heart racy.

502
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,640
This is horrible.
Are you enjoying bread week?

503
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,760
So far, so good.  Yeah, you
like bread, don't you?

504
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,000
Yeah, I love bread, but I do
know what a cottage loaf is,

505
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,120
I have made one before.
That's an advantage.

506
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,560
You said that like you didn't.

507
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,000
No, I have made one before.

508
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,040
I do know what it is.

509
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,440
I have seen one, I made one.
I've made one before.

510
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,600
Yeah? Prove it.

511
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,000
SHE LAUGHS

512
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
We're going to moonwalk out of here.
See you later.  Good luck.

513
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,560
I'm taking out.

514
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,400
It's the art of actually knowing
when it feels right, whether it's

515
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,680
proved right, and I just
haven't got the experience.

516
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,960
Would you take that out now?

517
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,640
What do you reckon?  I'm going to
leave it with you, my love.

518
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,640
I'm quite happy with it.
Looks good, risen well.

519
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,760
All right.

520
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,400
The instructions say divide the
dough, and shape into two balls,

521
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,440
one small and one large.

522
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,440
How much I'm going to split it,
am I going to split it 500, 225,

523
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,720
or am I going to split it...
I just don't know yet.

524
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
Take about a third, I think.

525
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,760
A quarter?

526
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,320
Divide by three.

527
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,160
I'm not weighing it,
I'm just doing it by eye.

528
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,200
No-one had scales, electric
scales, in a cottage.

529
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,880
&quot;Shape into a classic cottage loaf.&quot;

530
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,320
And that's about as much
instruction as we've got.

531
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,680
So I'm just shaping the dough,
otherwise it will kind of wonk over.

532
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,920
You don't want wonky balls.

533
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,240
You can't help but look around.

534
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,840
Paul wants it perfect, and this
isn't looking that perfect.

535
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,840
Maybe this should have been smaller.

536
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,160
That doesn't seem right.

537
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,520
What Paul does is he sticks his
fingers in the flour,

538
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,880
and he

539
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,240
goes down like that.

540
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,160
Two fingers.

541
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Up and down like that.
I just know how Paul does it.

542
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,720
That just looks wrong and weird.

543
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Put your finger in it.

544
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,240
I'm just going to stick with it.

545
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Slash your dough, any way you like,
I guess.

546
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,320
The instructions say prove.

547
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,400
So this is going to go back
into the proving drawer.

548
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,240
The second proof is really
important,

549
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,440
because it's what gives the
final loaf its structure.

550
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,440
It may work, it may not.
My heart is...POOF.

551
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Bakers, you have
45 minutes left, 45!

552
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,200
Take it out, the second prove.

553
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,800
It's not horrific.

554
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,360
If that's not right,
then I don't know what is.

555
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,600
Very happy with that.

556
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,240
I just want to make it perfect.

557
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,880
That looks like BB8
out of Star Wars.

558
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,680
Oh, well.

559
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,160
Not happy.

560
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,400
Oh, gawd. Look at my cowpat!

561
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,880
It's turned into just one loaf.

562
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,800
I think the dough was too wet,
so it kind of spread.

563
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
The instructions say &quot;bake&quot;.

564
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Hot water in the pan,
creating a bit of steam-age.

565
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Wish me luck.

566
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,520
Baking it at 170, but I might
have to turn it up.

567
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,520
I'll probably do, like, ten minutes
high, and then drop it down.

568
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,040
Fingers crossed.

569
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,720
How long are you going
to bake it for?

570
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,720
30, 35 minutes, but I'm going to
watch it like a hawk.

571
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,320
I'm trying to send vibes.
&quot;Become more beautiful.&quot;

572
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,040
Talking about the bread.

573
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,160
The longer it's in there,
the longer mine's hid.

574
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,240
Why?  The bottom of my bread has
eaten the top of my bread.

575
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,880
What can you do?
Nick someone else's?

576
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,880
You'll be fine.

577
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,360
Inside, I'm crying.

578
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,360
Bakers, you have 15 minutes
left for your cottage loaf.

579
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,840
It doesn't seem to be going brown,
it's going to take a while.

580
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,240
Not a great sign, is it?

581
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,440
I hope the clouds are not
a reflection of Paul's mood,

582
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,680
I'll put it that way.

583
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,840
I'm happy it hasn't gone like that.

584
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,960
I just hope it doesn't go zzzzup.

585
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,480
I'm frightened in case it
goes pffft.

586
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,120
Oh, God!  What's up?

587
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,440
It's fallen off the top!

588
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,440
It just fell off! Oh, my God!

589
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,440
It's ruined. It just, like, died.

590
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,320
I feel sick.

591
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,320
Oh, my God, I'm dying inside.

592
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,280
Do you know what,
it's not the worst.

593
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,280
It's just all about
not being the worst.

594
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,400
I feel like I'm in trouble.

595
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,960
Bakers, you have five minutes.

596
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,360
Say something urgent.  Left!

597
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,640
You've got five minutes left!

598
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,640
Seriously?

599
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,280
Five minutes?

600
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,280
Mine's raw.

601
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,360
I've just put the oven back
up a little bit,

602
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,840
because it's not quite dark enough.

603
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,240
It's the highest temperature
possible, just to give it...

604
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,280
Bang.  I'm hoping it goes POOOF!
And blossoms.

605
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,240
I don't think it's cooked.

606
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,560
I know it's not cooked.

607
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,560
Tick, tick, tick, tick...

608
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,200
My God! It's actually
sliding more down.

609
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,680
I'm going to wait until
the last minute.

610
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,760
Bakers, you've got one minute left!

611
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,280
OK, go!

612
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,040
That's definitely not cooked.

613
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,920
You see, mine's done.

614
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,960
I'm taking it out the
last 30 seconds.

615
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,960
It's going to be tight.

616
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,080
OK, bakers, your time's up, please
bring up your cottage loaves.

617
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,520
It's just a disaster.

618
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Paul and Prue want to see
a classic cottage loaf,

619
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,720
well risen with a rounded bottom,

620
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,200
and a honey coloured,
crusty exterior.

621
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,120
They have no idea whose
loaf is whose.

622
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,560
Let's start from this one over here.

623
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,080
The actual shape of it, the
way it sits, is good.

624
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,080
There's a little bit of decoration
on there, which is good.

625
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,680
And a nice rounded bottom.

626
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,080
It's quite risen.

627
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,240
It's proved well, but
it's slightly under baked.

628
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,640
Good flavour.

629
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,680
Overall, not bad at all.

630
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,080
Paul, I really do like this one,
it's been properly pushed together.

631
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,520
There is a nice shape.

632
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,200
I do like the big cuts
in it, as well.

633
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,880
Let's have a look at it inside.

634
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,560
It is baked, it's crispy.

635
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,320
When you're making a big loaf, you
can afford to have some crust,

636
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,200
and it's worth it,
because it's lovely.

637
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,000
I think it's a
really satisfactory loaf.

638
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,080
OK, next one.

639
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,080
That doesn't look as if it's
risen at all.

640
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,760
I think a little bit
more proving might have helped.

641
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,520
It's a bit soft, it needed ten, 15,

642
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,080
maybe even 20 minutes
still in the oven.

643
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,000
It's coming out too early, what
happens is the dough then rests,

644
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,080
and then concertinas down
onto the bottom.

645
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,480
Right, moving on to this.

646
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,480
The actual shape, but it is central,
it hasn't ripped either way.

647
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,840
It's got a little bit of
a crisp there.

648
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,400
If that had another ten minutes,

649
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,480
it would be perfectly crisp,
wouldn't it?

650
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,320
Yeah. OK, next one.

651
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,760
The actual overall
proportions are right.

652
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,560
Very nice.  The flavour's good.

653
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,280
But it would be nicer if
it had more crust.

654
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,320
Right, moving on.

655
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,960
It's just not been put on straight.

656
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,760
Normally, you'd push your finger
right the way through from the top

657
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,400
to the bottom, and that allows the
dough to become straighter.

658
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,880
Yes, this didn't get the finger
treatment, at all.

659
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,480
Next one. The overall shape is good.

660
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,360
It's stayed in the middle.

661
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,560
It's really under baked.

662
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,920
Yeah, it is.

663
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,920
And you can still feel it's full
of moisture, it's a wet loaf

664
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,800
Right, moving on to this.

665
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,960
The whole thing's merged
together to create a big cob

666
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,560
You've lost that top.

667
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,280
The dough itself was a bit too wet,

668
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,560
it doesn't look like
a cottage loaf at all.

669
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,080
Very neat, I quite like the
look of that one.

670
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,840
The proportions are right.
And actually the height as well,

671
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,520
you see the way it folds in.

672
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,480
It' lost a bit of definition
on the top, but it's still there.

673
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,360
It's quite light, too.

674
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,480
Enough salt. Flavour's good.

675
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,400
It's a decent loaf, that one.

676
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,440
OK, last, the colour's good,

677
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,840
but the one on the top

678
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,720
is almost like a pancake
sitting on top of the cob.

679
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,720
Texture's a bit tough,
it's a bit flat.

680
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Paul and Prue must now rank the
loaves from worst to best.

681
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,880
In tenth place, we have this one.

682
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,520
Whose is this?

683
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,920
Kate, it's slightly wobbly, though,

684
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,720
and it has a soggy middle.

685
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,440
In ninth place is this one.

686
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,200
Whose is this? You've lost all the
definition in it.

687
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,880
Yan is eighth,

688
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,600
Flo is seventh,

689
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,080
Sophie sixth,

690
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,320
Liam fifth,

691
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,600
and Tom is fourth.

692
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,120
And third place is this one,
whose is this?

693
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,840
Beautiful shape. I like the
flour, very, very neatly done.

694
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,680
I like that. Thank you.
In second place...

695
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,760
Beautifully risen, it would have
been a great loaf

696
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,680
if you'd left it in the
oven a bit longer.

697
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,280
So, in 1st place is this one.

698
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,280
APPLAUSE

699
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,000
Good definition, nice and round,
good, strong, shaping.

700
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,240
Very good.

701
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,920
First in the Technical on
bread week, I mean, that is massive!

702
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,040
So excited!

703
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,200
My dough ate itself,
which wasn't a good look.

704
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,720
I was surprised I wasn't
last, to be fair.

705
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,360
Oh, what a disaster.

706
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,320
I hope there's some redemption
there from this morning.

707
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,240
You can be confident,
and you know the bake,

708
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,720
but you don't know which way
that dough's going to go.

709
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,000
It's got a mind of its own.

710
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I've got to actually smash it
tomorrow, that's all I've got to do.

711
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:33,000
Just smash it tomorrow,
and I should be fine.

712
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,160
NOEL:  There's one challenge left

713
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,440
before Paul and Prue decide
who's destined for Star Baker

714
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,240
and who will be leaving the tent.

715
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,240
For me, the most surprising thing
is the way bread week

716
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,960
has simply blown it wide open.

717
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,880
I thought I had a good idea of who
was doing well, Steven particularly.

718
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,120
He did OK in the technical.

719
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,480
Then you look at his teacakes,
they were massively over proved

720
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,880
and it was such a shame. Two star
bakers on the bounce, that's...

721
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,760
That's a difficult place
to fall from.

722
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,640
Can we talk about Flo
for a brief moment?

723
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,120
Oh, lovely Flo.  She's been in a sort
of middling area the whole time.

724
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,320
She has and she struggled
in the technical as well,

725
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,880
so she's in trouble.

726
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,880
She has known every time that
that wasn't the best she can do.

727
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,560
And I think Liam's in some danger

728
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,920
because yesterday,
he didn't have a good day.

729
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,720
He just needs to do well today.
Yeah.

730
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,120
I think three of them,
at the moment, look very safe.

731
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,720
Julia I think's done well.

732
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,080
Tom's done well.

733
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,560
Stacey's done really well.

734
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,400
I'd like to see her do well
in the show stopper

735
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,080
because she's set herself up to be,
you know, a Star Baker, she has.

736
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,680
The Bread Queen.  Yeah,
she's in a very strong position.

737
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,600
Wow, that makes it quite exciting.

738
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,600
Just a touch!

739
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,160
Well, morning, bakers. Welcome
to your Showstopper Challenge.

740
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,360
Now, for today's challenge,

741
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,080
Prue and Paul would like you
to make a bread sculpture,

742
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,080
but not just any bread sculpture -
a coloured bread sculpture.

743
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,920
We want eye-catching designs

744
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,920
using natural ingredients
to create flavour and colour.

745
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,520
Channel Jackson Pollock.

746
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,320
Right, you've got
four and a half hours.

747
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,720
On your marks.  Get set.

748
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,720
BOTH: Bake!

749
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,840
This is big. This challenge is big.

750
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,040
I've got to smash this in order
to get into safety mode.

751
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,200
Just trying to stay calm,
do the best I can.

752
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,040
NOEL:  The bakers not only have
to produce a bread sculpture,

753
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,720
they have to showcase a minimum

754
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,080
of three naturally
occurring colourings.

755
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,240
Beetroot just, like, gives a
really, really nice vibrant colour.

756
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,280
I've got spinach and parsley.

757
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,120
And I'm adding it to
obviously make a green colour.

758
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,240
I'm flavouring it and colouring it
with some squid ink.

759
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,720
PAUL:  When you're introducing
colour to a dough,

760
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,960
it's all about balance.

761
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,760
Beetroot, turmeric, chocolate,

762
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,600
you've got to add them in
in such proportions

763
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,440
it doesn't inhibit the yeast
too much, and that's the trick.

764
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,360
PRUE:  I mean, to impress us,
it's got to look amazing

765
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,240
with as vibrant a colour
as you can get.

766
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,240
And every bit of it
has got to taste good.

767
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,080
All right, Flo?  Hello.  Hello, Flo.

768
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,960
Now is that activated charcoal
or is it..?

769
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,360
No, it's squid ink.  Squid ink.
Oh, squid ink.  Yes.

770
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,840
It's going to be
Davy Jones's locker.

771
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,600
Davy Jones's locker?  Yeah.

772
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Flo's pirate-themed sculpture

773
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,200
will be made from one
basic white bread dough

774
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,000
coloured and flavoured
with squid ink,

775
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,600
beetroot and paprika.

776
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,200
That's a good idea.  That's a nice
idea.  And I hope it turns out well.

777
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,480
I hope so.  Thank you.

778
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,400
Hope I do something right!

779
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,400
Don't be like that, it's all right.
Well done, Flo.  OK.

780
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,120
NOEL: Flo isn't the only baker
going for a nautical theme.

781
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,120
I'm doing a squid ink
and smoked garlic octopus.

782
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,760
Kate's octopus will take centre
stage in her undersea sculpture,

783
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,680
resting on a spicy twisted
red seaweed bread

784
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,040
with an accompanying
green spirulina bread.

785
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,320
I like flavours of the sea,

786
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,800
so I wanted to do something
that all, like, tied in together.

787
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,480
And I think it works
quite well as a concept.

788
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,800
I've never made a bread
sculpture in my life.

789
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,800
So... Especially,
when I saw coloured bread,

790
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,600
I was like, &quot;OK, cool,
food colouring.&quot;

791
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,600
But when I saw &quot;naturally&quot; I was
like, &quot;Eurgh... That's even worse.&quot;

792
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,960
Liam plans to shape his bread
into an ice cream sculpture.

793
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,240
His three doughs will be
coloured and flavoured

794
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,600
with apricot, beetroot
and cocoa.

795
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,280
I am in a precarious position.

796
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,400
Kind of wish I'd made more bread,

797
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,840
but I can't help
what's not my thing.

798
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,680
So I am doing a picnic basket,

799
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,120
so I've got a dough
for the basket itself.

800
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,960
Then I've got, like,
a baguette poking out of it,

801
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,800
so that's a separate dough.

802
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,560
Bunch of grapes.

803
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,560
And some apples and a sort
of tea towel, if I have time.

804
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,160
Sophie's trying to give her
sculpture an Italian colour scheme,

805
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,440
with a white basket,

806
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,120
green bread apples
filled with apple compote

807
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,680
and red beetroot bread grapes.

808
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,160
A lot of time's taken up
with the sort of kneading

809
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,720
and preparing the doughs, so I think
that'll be sort of priority,

810
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,880
just try and get that done
as quickly as I can.

811
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,720
SANDI: As if delivering
three different

812
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,360
coloured breads wasn't enough...

813
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,520
JULIA SINGS

814
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,400
..Julia has decided
her sculpture needs four.

815
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,400
I'm making kind of a scene, so it's
like bit of a grass on the bottom,

816
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,000
mushroom in the middle
and snail on the side.

817
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,200
You've got quite a lot to do, then.
I've practised it about...

818
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,720
Not a lot, only about, like,
six, seven times.

819
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,720
It's a big thing to do, isn't it,
six or seven times?

820
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,000
Julia's flora and fauna will sit on

821
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,200
a spinach and parsley forest floor.

822
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,200
A red pepper and paprika bread snail
will shelter under a mushroom

823
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,640
with a potato and beetroot bread cap

824
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,760
and a Russian black rye bread stalk.

825
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,720
Tell me about this
black Russian bread.

826
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,200
Basically, it's traditional bread
that I always had.

827
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,480
I've kind of changed the recipe
a little bit.

828
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,080
I'm adding black treacle to it and
I've put some malt in it as well.

829
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,640
I love the sound of it.
It's quite complicated.

830
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,160
We want you to do well, don't we?

831
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,680
Absolutely, yes.  We don't want
to send you home, or the snail.

832
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,680
Good luck to you.  Can't send snails
home, that's the thing.  Thank you.

833
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,680
I've got three different
doughs to do.

834
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,480
We're going to have a raisin
and walnut saffron loaf,

835
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,520
which is the milk steeping here.

836
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,160
So this will turn
a bit more yellowy.

837
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,760
So it'll be... I'm making an owl, so
it'll be like a tawny owl type body.

838
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,760
And if I've got leftover dough,
a couple of hedgehogs.

839
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,800
A hot chocolate
chilli bread will form

840
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,640
the head and wings of James's owl,

841
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,320
which will nestle
in the branches

842
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,560
of green tea
baguettes.

843
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,320
Now I've just got to make sure it
all stands up.

844
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,520
And the head doesn't fall off.
But apart from that, it's simple!

845
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,880
SANDI: For her sculpture,

846
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,520
Stacey's turning to a traditional
family recipe.

847
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,920
My main bread is a challah.
This is a Jewish bread.

848
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,400
It takes quite a while, a challah.

849
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,160
I mean, really, I like to prove
my dough overnight.

850
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,800
But I have done it in the time
before and it's fine.

851
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,440
Sporting a challah bread brim,

852
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,200
Stacey's hat will
have a crown

853
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,720
of woven turmeric
and lemon bread

854
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,120
and come adorned
with a variety

855
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,320
of coloured
breadsticks.

856
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,040
Are we going to get some good tastes
in this as well? Not just look good.

857
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,080
I know, well, the thing is -
I want it to taste good,

858
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,200
but I wasn't actually going

859
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,400
for the flavours in the colour,
I was going for colour.

860
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,760
If the basic bread is delicious
anyway, it's fine.  Yeah.

861
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,960
It's nowhere near as pink
as it is normally at home.

862
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,720
Don't want to put any
more beetroot in it,

863
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,280
cos I think it'll make it too moist.

864
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,520
And too heavy for the yeast.

865
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,000
So, erm... I think I might
make this again.

866
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,760
Tom's planning a floral bouquet of
beetroot and turmeric bread roses

867
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,960
nestling in a
pesto breadbasket.

868
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,040
I'm going to keep this dough,
I'm going to prove it,

869
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,120
as I would the other one.

870
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,600
I'm just going to see if the
other one gives me a better colour,

871
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,400
because it's got to be
a nice vibrant colour

872
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,640
to look like a flower.

873
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,920
FLO:  Look at that!

874
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,600
Nice that. It's a good prove.

875
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,000
SANDI: After the first prove,

876
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,600
the bakers can start shaping
their dough into their sculptures.

877
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,080
To get it right, Yan has been
practising using modelling dough

878
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,480
borrowed from her niece's toy box.

879
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,400
Wow!  The sculpture is called

880
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,320
Basil the Vegetarian Dragon and his
Pumpkin Hoard. No meat involved!

881
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,720
I can't see how anyone's
going to beat that

882
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,720
unless someone does
a gluten-intolerant unicorn.

883
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,520
Yan's dragon will be made
from a basil and spinach bread

884
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,080
with turmeric and
tomato coloured pumpkins,

885
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,360
a host of sweet and
savoury toadstools,

886
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,480
all resting on a
coriander focaccia floor.

887
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,080
My superpower is probably,
apart from baking, obviously,

888
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,240
is time management.

889
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,040
And in my head I can do this
in four hours and 30...

890
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,240
Four hours and 15 minutes
is my target.

891
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,560
Got 15 minutes to spare.

892
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,200
Before they can shape their dough,

893
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,280
the bakers need to incorporate
any ingredients they're using

894
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,520
to further flavour them.

895
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,840
Now this is the caramelised onion
and goat cheese.

896
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,520
The compote's got apple
and cinnamon mainly.

897
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,520
This is stuffed with chorizo,
Manchego, onions and garlic.

898
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,520
I don't want to disappoint today.
I really hope I don't.

899
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,680
There's a lot of flavours going on.

900
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,960
Morning.  Hi, Steven.
Good morning.

901
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,280
Tell us about your bread sculpture.

902
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,000
I'm making a handbag.

903
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,520
You're making a handbag?
I'm making a handbag.

904
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,520
Steven's handbag will be made of a
Manchego, chorizo and sherry bread,

905
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,800
adorned with a curried
breadstick chain

906
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,400
and a chocolate and
peppermint handle.

907
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,480
You've struggled a little bit
on the bread week so far.

908
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,880
Yeah, yesterday was...was
quite painful actually.

909
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,040
So it's really important
that this one works.

910
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,160
It's important... Just not that
it works as bread,

911
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,320
but that the flavours are good.

912
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,320
I'm just shaping the octopus now.

913
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,200
I'm making a snail.

914
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,880
That just looks inappropriate.

915
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,240
At the moment, it looks
a bit like a chicken.

916
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,360
That's why I need that model.

917
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,720
The second dough
is not quite the right colour.

918
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,160
So I'm just actually going
with the first one.

919
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,480
It's very fiddly.

920
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,480
I feel like you're trying
to psych me out.

921
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,080
Super stressy.

922
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,480
NOEL:  Bakers, you are
halfway through!

923
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,120
Is this what it's like being you?

924
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,480
Good, isn't it?  Yeah, it's weird
down here. I like it.

925
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,840
Your roots have...
well, they want doing.

926
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,840
This is ready to go in the oven now,
which I'm very pleased about.

927
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,600
If the bread doesn't hold
its shape whilst baking,

928
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,400
then their structures will collapse.

929
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Ooh, that one...

930
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,280
I've never baked a dragon before.

931
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,840
Please work!

932
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,840
This is the ugliest snail
I've ever made.

933
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,840
I'm going to make a couple
of little hedgehogs.

934
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,760
Trying to do a pirate's hat.

935
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,160
This is like a Noddy's hat.

936
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,000
Cos the light colour
can go really dark,

937
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
so I've made a little owl chest
plate for him and little sunglasses.

938
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,880
Please be nice, please be nice.

939
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,240
Mine's a disgrace.

940
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,240
I'm going home.

941
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,400
LIAM:  I'm out. Game over, kid.

942
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,720
It's done.

943
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,720
Some of them sort of,
like, tipped over, so...

944
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,760
One hour left, bakers,
just one hour.

945
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,360
An hour?  Yay, it looks like an owl!

946
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,520
I'm really quite pleased
with that actually, yeah,

947
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,000
I'm just going to give it
a Paul Hollywood tap.

948
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,720
It's not too bad.

949
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,920
It's the best I can do, anyway.

950
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,920
I've still got about 20-something
roses to make.

951
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,240
How many doughs are you in?
This is my fourth.

952
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,800
Ooh!

953
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,720
With at least three different types

954
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,720
of bread to bake
and only one oven...

955
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,720
Everything I'm doing, everything,
is on different temperatures,

956
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,840
so I've got to remember to turn it
up, got to remember to turn it down.

957
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,120
Right, they'll go in
for about 25 minutes.

958
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,760
..time management is crucial.

959
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,640
Have to move really quickly
with these because

960
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,880
literally one minute and they catch.

961
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,480
This is my mushroom.

962
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,240
Yeah, it seems to be OK.

963
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,520
So this one is
the focaccia forest floor.

964
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,920
It's a nice green, though, innit?

965
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,920
Not bad at all.
Now my challah's going in.

966
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,120
See you soon!

967
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,760
Hello, mate. You all right?

968
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,640
Emotional. Like, crazy, bro, like.

969
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,600
Really? Are you all right
though, now?

970
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,760
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

971
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,000
I mean, sometimes I just have
to have self belief.

972
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I couldn't boil an egg at your age.

973
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,640
I'm not too sure I can do that now!

974
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,480
No, I'm joking!

975
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,360
Bakers, you've got ten minutes left.

976
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,720
Ten minutes.

977
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,360
This is where the trouble starts.

978
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,360
The bread's a little bit softer than
it was when I was practising

979
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:31,560
but it doesn't look like
it's going to collapse.

980
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,320
This is so stressful.

981
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,320
OK. Three, two, one, go.

982
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,320
Bakers, you've got
five minutes left!

983
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,520
Just hating my pirate's hat.

984
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,920
Not happy.

985
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,600
Bakers, time's up.

986
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,280
Please place your bakes

987
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,280
at the end of your stations.

988
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,000
Some of them are marvellous,
aren't they?

989
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,280
It's judgment time
for the bread sculptures.

990
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,280
Each must showcase a minimum
of three natural colourings.

991
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,160
It's a pity he's like a baby dragon.

992
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,960
I would have liked to see him
really centre stage.

993
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,960
Paul's going to pull his head off.

994
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,480
I think you've got some
strong bold flavours.

995
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,480
The basil's there.  It's very good.

996
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,480
Tastes just like pesto.
Great flavour. Wow.

997
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,440
I think we'll try the pumpkin.

998
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,440
It's well baked. I love the colour.

999
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,840
I'm trying to hunt the flavour.
I'm not getting much.

1000
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,240
I get the chilli heat,

1001
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,240
but I'm not getting much else.
Let's try this focaccia.

1002
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,040
Garlic.

1003
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,880
Strong.

1004
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,880
Almost too strong.  Mm.

1005
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,960
It's not very evenly distributed,
the apricots.

1006
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,520
OK.  The flavour of the apricot
is delicious.

1007
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,000
What's in this chocolate one?
Um, so it's chocolate and date.

1008
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,200
Your flavours are fantastic today.

1009
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,200
Get in!  But your proving
is little bit under.  OK.

1010
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,280
I like the design of the owl.

1011
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,520
The hedgehogs, probably not as much.

1012
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,000
This is walnut and raisin, isn't it?

1013
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,520
Yes, it is.  Smells good.

1014
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,560
Saffron's quite strong.

1015
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,160
The walnut and raisin is losing
its battle against the saffron,

1016
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,080
which is a real shame.
Remind me what the green is?

1017
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,120
It's matcha green tea.
Oh, it's matcha.

1018
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,360
Do you know,
that's too strong for me, too.

1019
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,440
I really don't like
the flavours, James.

1020
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,280
Yeah.  But the design is so bold,

1021
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,200
the baking is so good,

1022
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,160
the proving is right...

1023
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,160
..you've got everything right,
except it doesn't taste nice.

1024
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,000
Do you know, I think it
is so elegantly done.

1025
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,080
It's exquisite.  Thank you.

1026
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,080
I'm going to take a little cut
of the challah.

1027
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,160
While I'm here...  Yes.

1028
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,960
..I'll take a little bit
of the lemon and turmeric.

1029
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,480
Challah is lovely.

1030
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,000
Really good.

1031
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
The tastes all right, but the
proving's wrong. It needed longer.

1032
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,200
The strength of that turmeric
is quite overwhelming.

1033
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,560
Now, the lemon's lost.

1034
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,880
I think the design's good,
I think it's been executed well,

1035
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,880
but your flavours are wrong.

1036
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,360
Wow.

1037
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,040
Well, Steven, that is amazing.

1038
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,680
It does look mighty impressive.

1039
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,680
I'm going to have to destroy
this now, you know.  It's fine.

1040
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,160
I think that's unbelievable.

1041
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:38,440
The delicacy of the crumb,
which is more focaccia-like,

1042
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,680
the flavours that you've got
from the manchego,

1043
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,200
from the chorizo... Well done.

1044
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,200
I mean, that's a big tick.

1045
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,920
I've got to find the weak link.

1046
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,560
It's delicious.

1047
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,280
It's a perfect breadstick,
just curly.

1048
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,320
Remind me of this one again.
It's a peppermint...

1049
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,320
A chocolate peppermint breadstick.

1050
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,280
It's lovely.  I mean, wow, wow, wow
on the flavours.

1051
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,040
Steven, come here a second.

1052
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,920
Amazing.  Come here.

1053
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,640
Stand next to Prue. I'm going
to go and sit down here.

1054
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,640
LAUGHTER

1055
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,640
That is ridiculous.

1056
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,680
Thank you, Flo. Can you tell us a
little about your coloured breads?

1057
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,600
It's supposed to be Tom Jones's...
Tom Jones? Davy Jones's locker.

1058
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,080
I think Tom Jones's locker
would not look like that.

1059
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,760
Davy Jones's locker!

1060
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,640
I think it's very ingenious.

1061
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,640
I think it's a little too clumsy
to come off perfectly.

1062
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,160
Oh, look at the colour.
There's your three right there.

1063
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,080
Squid ink, turmeric and beetroot.

1064
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,360
The texture's very good. It's baked
well cos it's more like a ciabatta.

1065
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,160
Is that what you set out to do?

1066
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,640
No.  You could've lied then, Flo.
I left the door open.

1067
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,640
You never walked through.  No.

1068
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,360
The paprika is quite strong
in there.

1069
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,360
This one tastes almost tasteless
because my mouth is still burning

1070
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,280
from the paprika.

1071
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,760
The paprika's just overwhelming.

1072
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,760
Not your best, Flo.  No.

1073
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,880
I love that octopus.

1074
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,200
I love the flavour of squid ink,

1075
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,200
so I hope we're going to get it.

1076
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,520
The squid ink comes through,

1077
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,600
and it's very suitable
for an octopus.

1078
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,800
That is very good.

1079
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,680
Heavy crust. All the way around,
which cracks.

1080
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,360
It's beautiful, and
a regular structure inside.

1081
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,360
Well done.

1082
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,280
I do like the basket. I think
the plaiting is very, very good.

1083
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,160
I'm looking for the definition in
the colour and I'm not seeing it

1084
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,640
too much at the moment.

1085
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,640
The apples don't really look
that green, do they?

1086
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,920
The dough's quite underdone.

1087
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,280
I think it's only marginally
underdone.

1088
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,280
And although of course the apple
inside has made it a bit wet,

1089
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,640
it's still very pleasant to eat.

1090
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,760
Well, you've certainly got your
three colours, haven't you?

1091
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,640
But having said that, it was about
getting the definition in the rose,

1092
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,720
and I think you've lost
some of the definition.

1093
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,240
And the definition on
the yellow roses is much better.

1094
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,960
Much better, yeah.  I mean that
is really quite exquisite.

1095
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,400
This is the...  Beetroot one.

1096
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,840
I mean, there's this little pink
hue, which is what you're going for.

1097
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,840
Yeah, what you're aiming at.

1098
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,520
Not much flavour. Quite bland,

1099
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,520
which is a shame.

1100
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,600
I like the snail.

1101
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,200
Is there something about the shape
of the snail that particularly...

1102
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,200
LAUGHTER

1103
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,560
Paul, are you going
to pull yourself together?  Yeah.

1104
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:15,440
Give me a minute.

1105
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,720
Well, you certainly have
the three colours, don't you?

1106
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,960
In fact, you have four colours.
Beetroot and potato.

1107
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,360
Oh, just feels so lovely.

1108
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,560
Look at that.  The colour
of that is amazing.

1109
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,480
Lovely texture.  Nice flavour.

1110
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,800
I'd like to try this.

1111
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,080
This is the rye.  Wow.

1112
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,960
Oh, that's packing a punch,
isn't it?

1113
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,640
This is going to be fascinating.
Good crust.

1114
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,840
Very malty.  Great texture,
great flavour.

1115
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,840
Really good bread. All right, now
we're going to attack this fellow.

1116
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,720
Look at that. It's goat's cheese
and...

1117
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,160
Caramelized onion.

1118
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,040
Great taste.
Really fantastic taste.

1119
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,520
The goat's cheese in there
is delicious.

1120
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,800
Your design is very, very good.

1121
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:05,000
Well thought through.  Well done.
Thank you so much.  Thank you.

1122
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,480
What a memorable Showstopper.

1123
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,040
Who stood out for you?

1124
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,320
Stacey's fallen out of the
possibility of Star Baker.

1125
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,840
I don't think that was good enough.

1126
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,040
I think Julia's certainly
still up there.

1127
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,880
Julia's was lovely.
The snail was humorous,

1128
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,760
with the goat's cheese inside
and the onion.

1129
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,760
It was delicious.  She gave herself a
huge job and she pulled it off.

1130
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,240
Obviously, Steven stood out.
That was exceptional.

1131
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,400
I mean, every single element to that
was perfection.

1132
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,400
The flavour combinations were
stunning.

1133
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,440
Very, very clever.

1134
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,320
Though I'm not sure we could give
him Star Baker when he did so badly

1135
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,560
with his teacakes.

1136
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,360
Can we talk about
Flo and Tom Jones' locker?

1137
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,240
The paprika burnt your mouth.

1138
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,040
It just killed everything.

1139
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,880
There's so much paprika in there.

1140
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,040
She's in trouble.
I think she struggled, Flo.

1141
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,280
What about Liam?

1142
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,560
I want to shake Liam because he
keeps doing things wrong,

1143
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,560
but he has this brave thing
about flavour, which I love.

1144
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,320
Has he saved himself? I don't know.

1145
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,400
Do you think that you two are going
to be in agreement about who's going

1146
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,720
to be Star Baker and who's going to
be saying goodbye?

1147
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,640
I think so.  I think we might not!

1148
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,560
I'm sure we will.  In the end.
Right.

1149
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:15,560
NOEL:  I've seen them, they
arm-wrestle.  I know.

1150
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,320
I have to say, that's the best Bread
Week I've ever seen.

1151
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,040
Well done.

1152
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,040
I have the lovely chore of
announcing who the Star Baker is.

1153
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:41,320
The Star Baker this week is the
person who put the &quot;tea&quot; into teacake

1154
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:46,120
and whose Showstopper was from
Russia with love.

1155
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:50,120
It's Julia.

1156
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,920
Well done.

1157
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,320
That leaves me with the horrible job
of revealing

1158
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,000
who's going to leave us.

1159
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
And the person that we have to say
goodbye to is...

1160
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,640
Flo.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.
All right.  Have a hug.  Fine.

1161
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,960
Honest to God, I'm fine with it.

1162
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:17,960
Let me get myself together.

1163
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,440
I will really miss Flo.

1164
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,400
I'm a little bit sad that she's
gone, actually,

1165
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,800
because I think the world of Flo.

1166
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,880
I've enjoyed the ride.

1167
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,600
I've met some lovely people

1168
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,440
and I'll remember that for the rest
of my life.

1169
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,440
I'm glad to get back to normal life.
It is exhausting!

1170
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,160
I thought I was going.
I need to up the levels a bit.

1171
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,480
I've got to do better.

1172
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,440
Julia is the deserved Star Baker on
Bread Week.

1173
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,440
She was incredibly ambitious.

1174
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:58,040
I did not expect that whatsoever.

1175
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,840
It was exhausting!

1176
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,760
I think it will be good for Steven
to realise

1177
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,240
that he's not going to dominate.

1178
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,080
You know, there are other bakers
there beginning to gnaw at his

1179
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,760
ankles a little bit and I think
Julia's one of those.

1180
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,280
I needed to come down off my little
cloud.

1181
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,640
I've got to practise.

1182
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,040
I'm heading back home tonight and
the oven's going on.

1183
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,800
Next time...
Something smells burning.

1184
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,080
..a Bake Off first...

1185
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,680
Oh, my God!  ..Caramel Week...

1186
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,120
It's a beautiful thing,
but it will destroy you.

1187
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,760
..with a super-sweet signature.

1188
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,640
Can you really eat that much
caramel?

1189
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,400
A double Dutch technical.

1190
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,000
What the hell does that mean?

1191
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,840
And a Showstopper so sticky...

1192
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,200
It's all just melting.
..it spins the bakers.

1193
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,760
Do not move.  ..into a sugar frenzy.

1194
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:42,400
The judges are not going to like any
of that.

1195
00:57:42,400 --> 00:58:11,000
