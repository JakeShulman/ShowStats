GBBO.S08E08.Forgotten.Bakes.Week.srt

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Hey, Sandi, look, I've been baking.
I'm not sure I've totally nailed it.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,720
I put them in the oven and forgot
about them.  That's brilliant!  Is it?

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,120
Yeah, it's the theme of the week,
Forgotten Bakes.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,480
Sometimes it's like I'm working
on a psychic level.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,520
Yeah, that's certainly one
explanation.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,680
I've got to go, I've left the bath
running.

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,280
Welcome to
The Great British Bake-Off.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,520
NARRATOR: Last time...  One more
toss and then I'm done.

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,080
..there was an Italian heat wave...
Ah!

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,760
..Sophie and Liam impressed
with their creativity...

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,360
It's just amazing to look at.

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,400
..but Steven had the style AND
substance...

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,840
I think you could sell them in any
pastry shop in Italy.

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,000
..landing his third Star Baker
title.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,840
Stacey and Kate were stretched out
of shape...

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,280
Absolute disaster.

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,200
..but it was Yan who unravelled...

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,560
Oh, no lamination.  ..and we had
to say arrivederci.

20
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,160
A totally wonderful adventure.

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,360
Thank you so much.
SANDI: This time...

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,320
Don't leak. Don't leak, don't leak.

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,160
..it's a blast from the past
with Forgotten Bakes...

24
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,920
Who has ever have heard of this
before?

25
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,440
A sweet and savoury signature...

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,000
I've literally dropped a clanger!

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,760
..a traditional technical tart...

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,000
It's raw.  ..and a grand
Victorian show stopper...

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,040
Don't drop it...  That demands...

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,040
the utmost finesse.

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,000
The quarterfinals are here.
The competition is on now.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,560
It's quite intense.

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,680
Final five!

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,200
It's very exciting.

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,440
I can't actually believe
I'm still here. It's great.

36
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,120
It's a bit weird, you're like,
&quot;Oh, my God, where is everyone?&quot;

37
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,000
It feels different now, it's going
to be a lot harder.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,480
We know what's riding on how we
perform on each bake, and yeah,

39
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,160
I think everyone's feeling it now.

40
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,200
Over the next few days, I just need
to be consistent.

41
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,640
Just bang out three good bakes,

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,280
and I should be fine.

43
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,280
Let's see what happens, innit?

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,120
Morning, bakers.  This week is all
about Forgotten Bakes.

45
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,040
It's those classic creations of the
past, which lately may have been,

46
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,560
I don't know, overlooked.

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,160
For your Signature Challenge,

48
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,400
Prue and Paul would love you to
make a Bedfordshire clanger.

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,880
It's a bit like a Cornish pasty,

50
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,840
except this was for a farm worker's
lunch as opposed to a tin miner's

51
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,600
lunch.  Made from suet pastry, your
clanger should be sweet at one end,

52
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,440
savoury at the other, with a sneaky
pastry wall dividing the two,

53
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,440
assembled by a tiny pastry builder
called Neville.

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,520
You worry me. The judges would like
your 2017 take on this traditional

55
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,040
recipe. Any flavours that you like,

56
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,000
you've got two hours to make
four Bedfordshire clangers.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
On your marks.  Get set.  Bake.

58
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,720
Clanger's a weird name.

59
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,920
The clanger.

60
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,920
This is not the kind of baking
I like to do.

61
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,400
No, I'm not really into making
clangers, no.

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,360
Conceptually, I think it works
really well.

63
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,080
You know, the savoury and the sweet,
your entire meal in one.

64
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,160
I suppose it's a bit like
aeroplane food.

65
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,000
Just got to deliver on this,
haven't I? Not drop any clangers.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,400
I'm here all week!

67
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,960
PRUE:  The clanger is a bit like
a Cornish pasty,

68
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,240
except it's long and thin

69
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,920
and sausage-shaped because it has
to contain two fillings.

70
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,280
One of the dangers is getting
the fillings right

71
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,080
so that they're not too wet
and will leak out.

72
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,760
The other danger is trying to
overcompensate for that,

73
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,960
and so they'll make their fillings
too dry.

74
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,840
You don't want a stodgy clanger.

75
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,480
And the key thing about the clanger
is the pastry itself.

76
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,320
It must be made with suet.

77
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,720
If the pastry's too flimsy and it
breaks apart,

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,080
it indicates you haven't worked
the dough enough.

79
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,360
Over-mix, it'll be like rubber

80
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,240
and you'll break your teeth
getting into it.

81
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,160
It's finding that balance
between the two.

82
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,360
Just rubbing in my butter
into my suet,

83
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,520
which is that disgusting-looking
thing there that's like baked, like,

84
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,000
worms or something, isn't it?

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
NOEL:  Suet is a fat found around the
loins and kidneys of cows and sheep.

86
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,200
That yummy fat!

87
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,800
When used to make pastry,

88
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,560
it creates a soft texture,

89
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,520
firm enough to hold its shape
when filled.

90
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,480
It's replacing butter or lard or
whatever you decide to use.

91
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,920
I think they originally used it

92
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,800
because it's so much cheaper
than butter.

93
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,040
It's quite similar to other
pastries, try not to overwork it.

94
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,800
Hello, Steven.  Good morning.

95
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,360
So, Bedfordshire clanger...

96
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
We're going Mediterranean.

97
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,360
Lots of herbs and spices.

98
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,280
Steven's spicy clangers will be

99
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,440
filled with feta and onion
at one end,

100
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,720
and orange blossom baklava
at the other.

101
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,800
What sort of colour are you going to
get on your pastry?

102
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,640
This colour, this colour,
or this colour?

103
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,760
Yeah, there you go.  I think
a bit more Prue!

104
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,160
Prue!

105
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,200
We are preparing a station for
rolling.

106
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,160
Can I sprinkle some?  Yeah.

107
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,920
Do you want me to show you how to
do it like a baker? Go on, then.

108
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,720
See, you get a pinch,
then you just do this.

109
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,920
Obviously, I wasn't going to soil
my hands!

110
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,960
Good morning, Liam.

111
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,960
Hi, Liam. So I want to know about
your pastry.

112
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,640
I want the pastry to be relatively
short, like flaky,

113
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,520
sort of melt-in-the-mouth situation.

114
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,200
But I want it to be robust enough
to keep the fillings in.

115
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,920
Liam's pastry will melt away

116
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,520
to reveal flavours inspired by
his favourite pizza toppings -

117
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,560
a pesto chicken and mozzarella
savoury filling will sit

118
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,040
alongside an apple and plum sweet.

119
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,800
Because it's like pizza-inspired,

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,440
I'm doing some dipping sauces
as well.

121
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,560
Who has dipping sauces with a pizza?

122
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,640
I do.  What?  What?  You have dipping
sauces with pizza!

123
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,080
NOEL:  Yeah, you do. Yeah.

124
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,560
Oh, this youth of today!

125
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,760
I know.

126
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,160
This is a modern take, so let's see
what it's like.

127
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,040
Traditionally, Bedfordshire clangers
had a meat, potato,

128
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,840
and diced veg filling at one end,

129
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,600
with apple and jam at the other.

130
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,120
It's vital the bakers make an
equally brilliant sweet and savoury

131
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,480
marriage.  It's a really cool
concept.

132
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,120
Like, it's just a pasty with a sweet
and savoury side.

133
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,720
It's nothing, like, that
ground-breaking,

134
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,920
no disrespect, but...

135
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,080
The people of Bedfordshire
will be up in arms!

136
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,400
The main bit of cooking is the
caramelized onions,

137
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,080
so I've got to get that on ASAP.

138
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,080
I'm going for Camembert, rocket,
pine nuts and caramelised onions.

139
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,320
It's kind of a posh take on a
cheese and pickle.

140
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,280
Stacey's the only baker using a wet
filling in her clangers.

141
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,200
A cinnamon custard will surround the
fresh blueberries

142
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,480
and apple of her sweet.

143
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,520
How are you containing that
little river of custard?

144
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,600
Well, this particular custard's
quite thick.

145
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,120
When it's inside, do you think it
will loosen up?

146
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,600
I've had a bit of a leaky clanger
issue over the week.

147
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,480
It's been quite stressful,
I've got to tell you.

148
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,040
When it's in, I'm walking away from
the oven. I don't what to see
what's going on in there!

149
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,160
OK, well, good luck, Stacey.

150
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,680
Thank you very much. See you later.
Sounds delicious.

151
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,440
I hope so.

152
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,960
Whilst most of the bakers are
sticking to familiar flavours,

153
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,080
some are taking inspiration
from further afield.

154
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,840
This is the char siu,
I love this marinade.

155
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,360
It's got all yummy sauces.

156
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,080
It's got hoi sin, soy sauce,

157
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,960
rice wine vinegar, loads of
those cool stuff.

158
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,040
Sophie's char siu marinade will
flavour the pork loin

159
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,000
in a savoury filling, which will be

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,800
complemented by a banana and pecan
praline sweet.

161
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,000
Interesting that you've chosen
char siu.

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,200
Have you practised this?
A couple of times, yeah.

163
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,880
Confident?  Yeaaaah.

164
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,720
You do know it's semifinal week
next week?  I know, I know!

165
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,200
You know, I'm just taking every week
as it comes because I don't want to

166
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,520
be disappointed. Hope for the best,
expect the worst.

167
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,000
Good luck, Sophie.  Thank you very
much.

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,440
Thank you.  Thank you.
Good luck, Sophie.

169
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,280
Sophie isn't the only baker giving
her clanger an exotic twist.

170
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,280
I really enjoy Mexican food, so it's
going to be a Mexican bean burrito.

171
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,320
The Bedfordshire clanger's
gone on holiday!

172
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,280
Kate's burrito-inspired clanger will
marry her vegetable chilli savoury

173
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,280
filling with a Caribbean banana
rice pudding sweet.

174
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,440
I think Sophie's using banana.

175
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,400
Either apple or banana works well.

176
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,560
You don't get too much fluid
coming off it.

177
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,080
So yeah, it doesn't surprise me
if there's lots of banana and apple
doing the rounds.

178
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,760
I haven't had a problem with
the clangers leaking in the oven,

179
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,000
but my baklava is quite dry.

180
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,920
There's no fresh fruit in there
to burst,

181
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,680
so maybe it was the right thing
to do.

182
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,680
Bakers, you are halfway through
your Signature Challenge!

183
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Halfway!  So as Oasis would say,
don't look back in clanger.

184
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,000
That was terrible.

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,720
He's getting funnier every week.
Have you noticed?

186
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,080
With multiple clangers to be filled,
assembled and sealed,

187
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,320
time management in the final hour
is crucial.

188
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,720
I think we're ready for action.

189
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,000
It's pastry time.

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,280
This is my pastry,
which has been rested.

191
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,160
Now, I'm going to start assembling.

192
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,840
Fill it, roll it over, egg wash.

193
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,120
The big thing is no leaking.

194
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,320
I measured it, but it's not precise.

195
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,840
I just measured it so I looked like
I know what I'm doing!

196
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,920
You know? All the gear, no idea.

197
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
Originally, Bedfordshire clangers

198
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,400
comprised one-third sweet
to two-thirds savoury.

199
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,800
Steven is the only baker sticking
rigidly to this tradition.

200
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,920
Sweet will sit here and savoury
will sit here.

201
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,840
That's so sweet, your little Berlin
wall that you've done in the middle.

202
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,840
I was going to say Trump wall,
but I don't...  Trump wall?  Oh, you
can say it.  Solar-panelled.

203
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,760
It stops the sweet and the savoury
melanging in the middle.

204
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,280
God forbid you would have a sweet
and savoury melange.

205
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,800
I'm in a bit of a rush.

206
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,800
I need to concentrate on my custard.

207
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,440
Have you started them?

208
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,320
Yeah, yeah. I've got two done
already.

209
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,240
They in the oven?  No, no, no.

210
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,200
I'm scoring it, just like you would

211
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,480
for bread, cos there is
some expansion.

212
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,120
I'm just doing the slashes.

213
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Traditionally, slashes were placed
on either end of the clangers to

214
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,560
differentiate between sweet
and savoury.

215
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,120
I've got my little pig, that's my
pork, and I've got my banana.

216
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,200
You don't want to be tucking into
your sweet end

217
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,480
when you want your savoury.

218
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,320
That's my sweet.

219
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,400
I haven't got time,
oh, my God, oh, my God!

220
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,040
Right, bakers, half an hour!

221
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,200
Half an hour!

222
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,000
I haven't spent enough time checking
they're not going to be leaky.

223
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,080
You're not gonna leak, you're not
gonna leak, you're not gonna leak.
You'll behave yourself.

224
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,240
Going in, can't wait.

225
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,040
They take about 25 minutes,
which is...exactly what I have.

226
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,200
I think one of them's going to leak.

227
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,120
I'm really, really rushing.

228
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,960
They're probably going to get a bit
less than they should.

229
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,520
Little bit late, I might say.

230
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,440
Don't leak. Don't leak, don't leak.

231
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Do not leak. Let's just do 15
minutes and see what happens.

232
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Oh!  Are you all right?

233
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,400
Let's eat Camembert.  Oh, cheese!

234
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,480
Bakers...

235
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,640
IMITATES A CLANGER

236
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,760
What are you doing?
I'm being a clanger.

237
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,320
You've got 15 minutes,
15 minutes!

238
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,520
Ooh-oooh!

239
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,520
I can't look.

240
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,760
Oh, oh, there's a bit of browning,

241
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,760
there's a bit of browning.

242
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,880
Do you know what? If they do leak,

243
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,160
but they look all right and they
taste all right, then it'll be OK.

244
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,360
One is definitely going to leak.

245
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,360
No leakage so far, so...

246
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,640
They need longer than
we've got left.

247
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,640
They're leaking.

248
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,120
They've cracked a bit more
than I'd want.

249
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
They smell nice, though.

250
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,880
Mine are massive,
I've got a huge clanger.

251
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,440
The cheese. I'm very upset
about that.

252
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,440
I'm just making my dipping sauces.

253
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,160
It's not cooking, at all.

254
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,160
What temperature are you doing yours
at?  240.  240!  I'm just hammering it.

255
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,800
Put it on 240?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, go.

256
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,800
OK, thank you.  Bakers, you have five
minutes left, just five minutes!

257
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,520
We've got five minutes!

258
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,760
Oh, my God, they're not going
to be done.

259
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,160
Oh, my God, two are leaking!

260
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,840
Oh, three are leaking!

261
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,840
They're all bloody leaking!

262
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,240
Oh, dear. We have significant
leakage on all of them.

263
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,240
I think we're going to take it down
to the last minute.
One more minute on high.

264
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
My main worry is I'm not going to be
able to save them.

265
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,400
Highly embarrassed.

266
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,400
What a disaster.  Bakers, you have
one minute, one minute left!

267
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,280
Right, out they come.

268
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,120
They are not pretty.

269
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,480
Massive, aren't they?

270
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,920
They would have been a lot better if
they hadn't cracked open.

271
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,560
Where's my sauce pots?

272
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,680
Oh, my God!

273
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,240
Oh!

274
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,240
This is hot syrup, this is how
baklava is made.

275
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,440
They're really not done.

276
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Oh, my God, what's just happened!

277
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,440
I've literally dropped a clanger!

278
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,120
Oh, my God, that's actually the
worst thing that could've happened.

279
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,160
Bakers, that is the end of your
Signature Challenge!

280
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,960
Please place your clangers
at the end of your stations.

281
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,240
Kate, pick yours up off the floor!

282
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,120
Oh, my God!

283
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,480
Disaster.

284
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,000
Oh, Kate.

285
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,080
The bakers' clangers must now face
the judgment of Paul and Prue.

286
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,560
This one ends up on the floor,

287
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,720
and they could have done with
longer in the oven as well.

288
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,880
I ran out of time at the end.
They do look a bit of a mess.

289
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,480
Never mind. Maybe it'll all be
redeemed because they will be so
delicious.

290
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,840
But how is he meant to tell which
end he is eating?

291
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,120
Well, it was going to have
decoration on, but again...

292
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,800
You ran out of time.

293
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,800
The pastry is quite tough.
But that's because it's not cooked.

294
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,560
You needed more seasoning in there.

295
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,280
You get a texture of rice and that's
pretty much what you get.

296
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,120
What a shame. Right...

297
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,120
The sweet.

298
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,000
I really like that, the rice
pudding.

299
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,200
It's not too claggy.

300
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,200
It's properly good.  I think nearly
all your problems come down

301
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,800
to under-baking.
The pastry is just not right.

302
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Thank you.  OK.

303
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,640
When you look at the uniformity,
it's there.

304
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,000
Great colour, the cuts are distinct.

305
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,600
I think you've done a great job.
They look very, very good.

306
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,600
Thank you.  Wow, that's delicate to
pick up, that.

307
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,440
SANDI: Oh, lovely.

308
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,760
You're so mean!

309
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,280
So mean!

310
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,080
You are so good at flavour.

311
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,560
Lovely pesto - bang!

312
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,200
And that pastry is so, so delicate.

313
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,480
You can barely pick it up.

314
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,920
Just perhaps not quite robust enough
for a clanger.

315
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,920
Are you going to try the dip?

316
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,320
Do you know, it's perfectly all
right, but Mediterranean flavours

317
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,960
are so strong, you really don't
need it.

318
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,960
No, I agree. Right, the sweet.

319
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,240
The flavours are very, very good.

320
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,440
I think the balance of the fruit
is excellent.

321
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,000
The pastry is so light, though.

322
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,600
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  Next time, work that
pastry a little bit more.

323
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,600
OK?  Cool.  Thank you.

324
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,360
Lovely colour. I like the
decoration.

325
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,400
I love the pig.
Love, love, love the pig.

326
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,720
Have you scored this?

327
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,800
Yes.  It's weakened it slightly
there.

328
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,600
Yup.  But it's robust.

329
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,480
All right.

330
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,640
The pastry's a little bit too thick.

331
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,440
I think it's baked well. It's
spongy, which is what it should be.

332
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,200
I just think it's a little bit too
thick.

333
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,080
I'm a bit disappointed in the
filling

334
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,760
because it's sort of predominantly
soy flavour.

335
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm not getting much else.

336
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Right.

337
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,520
Lovely flavour. Bit dry.

338
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,760
OK.

339
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,760
With the fact that your pastry's
still thick, that doesn't help.

340
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,760
Yeah.  Which is a bit of a shame.

341
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,240
You've been desperate to get rid of
those, haven't you?

342
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,000
Do you not have these in your
bakery?

343
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,680
Nope.  Clearly not!

344
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,680
It's not very robust there, if
you're carrying that into a field.

345
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,080
It's very good. And I think it's the
right texture.

346
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,320
It's moist without being sloppy.

347
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,040
Mm. Beautiful flavour.

348
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,360
I love the spices, the blends, and
it's a proper monstrous meal,

349
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,360
it's gorgeous. Now, looking at the
pudding, this is the baklava.

350
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,520
Hm.  I think that's absolutely
delicious.

351
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,120
I just think it's totally the
wrong shape. It's almost collapsed.

352
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,160
But the texture of the pastry is
very good.

353
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,160
Thank you, Steven.  Thank you very
much.  Delicious.  Thank you.

354
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,880
There's been a little

355
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,720
blueberry explosion.

356
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,280
So we know which end is sweet, even
if you hadn't put sweeties on.

357
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,880
Go in here.

358
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,800
I think you've got a great texture
there.

359
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,040
The pastry is nice and flaky.
It's a little bit soft,

360
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,040
as I'd expect from a suet crust.

361
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,960
That's lovely, that. The pastry's
flaky, it's light,

362
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,200
it's got lots of flavour.

363
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,960
It's got a nice crisp on the
outside.

364
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,440
And it's baked all the way through.

365
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,520
The caramelised onions are the
heroes in there.

366
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,640
Beautiful flavours.

367
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,640
The sweet...

368
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,280
I'm amazed that you got such good
texture,

369
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,640
because the blueberries were raw

370
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,080
and I rather expected them to sog up
the bottom of the pastry,

371
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,320
but they haven't.

372
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,840
That, young lady, is absolutely
delicious, that side.

373
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,120
SANDI: Yes!

374
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,240
Great clanger.  Feel good?
Feel great.

375
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,040
Thank you very much, guys.  Go, girl.
Thank you.

376
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,560
What a result. I don't know what
happened in there

377
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,520
but it's not what happens
when I'm at home.

378
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,800
I don't think it ever tasted that
good before.

379
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,120
Pretty good result, you know.
OK, it didn't look like a clanger.

380
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,320
Well, what does a clanger look like
anyway?

381
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,360
It's a little pink mouse
as far as I'm concerned.

382
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,360
When Prue said I was really good
at flavours, I was like, &quot;Yeah.&quot;

383
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,960
But there's always, like, one
thing that I sort of fall short on.

384
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,440
But then that's good for me,
because there's always something to
improve on.

385
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,280
You know what, you've got to
keep laughing.

386
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,640
If you don't laugh, you'll cry.

387
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,320
It's not the end of the world.
I dropped a clanger but, you know,

388
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,160
we move on from it, don't we?

389
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,760
A little bit disappointing. Had this
been a couple of weeks ago

390
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,440
I would have considered that to be
an OK judging,

391
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,360
but now that puts me in a really
sort of bad position.

392
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,280
THUNDERCLAP

393
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,840
SANDI: There are now just two
challenges to go before

394
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,880
Paul and Prue decide which
baker's heading home

395
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,400
and which four will make the
semifinal.

396
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,960
Right, bakers, it is time to test
you on a classic technique

397
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,360
of the past,
set for you today by Paul.

398
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,360
Any advice, Paul?
This is all about precision.

399
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,680
I think he's finished.  OK, judges,

400
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,200
I'm going to have to ask you
to leave the tent.

401
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,880
Off you pop. OK.

402
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,840
Bakers, for your Technical Challenge
today,

403
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,800
Paul would love you to make
a traditional recipe

404
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,480
from Cumberland, the rum Nicky.

405
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,080
A large sweet tart,

406
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,080
this forgotten beauty has a sweet
shortcrust pastry base,

407
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,960
a rum-soaked fruity filling,

408
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,560
a rather tricky little
lattice number on top.

409
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,040
Paul would like you to serve it the
classic way with rum butter,

410
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,080
and you have an hour and a half.

411
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,600
On your marks...  Get set...

412
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,600
BOTH:  Bake!

413
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,440
I don't understand.

414
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,760
As usual, there is very little
detail.

415
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,000
I have literally got no idea what
I'm doing, to be honest.

416
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,560
Cumberland rum Nicky. Who has
ever heard of this before?

417
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,560
Not me. It is forgotten, and
probably for a good reason.

418
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,280
They're looking for a really
good rum Nicky.

419
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,480
And I don't know what that is!

420
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,480
So, Paul, why have you chosen
this - rum Nicky?

421
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,440
I came across this particular tart
about three years ago.

422
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,560
It's delicious.

423
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,680
Well, if you look at the inside of
that now,

424
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,720
it's all about joining the fruit
together

425
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,800
to create this one mass.

426
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,120
You have the flavour of the rum,
you have the fruit,

427
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,120
which almost melts in the mouth.
The pastry's flaky.

428
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,280
It's lovely. And you can really
taste the rum.

429
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,600
The rum is king in this.

430
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,160
We're looking for something that's
going to taste of rum but not of
alcohol.

431
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,840
Now, the lattice, it's going to be
fascinating to see

432
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,880
how they lattice.

433
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,880
If they totally enclose that pie,
the alcohol cannot evaporate off.

434
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,760
Now, to make it as it would have
been done 230 years ago,

435
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,680
I expect them to take this pastry

436
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,000
right into the edge.

437
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,360
OK. How long do they bake it for?

438
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,200
Because I know you didn't tell them
that.

439
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,680
35 minutes in total.

440
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,480
That will create a beautiful
golden pie.

441
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,920
And have you given them a machine
to make the rum butter with?

442
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,600
I'm not a monster, Prue.

443
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,600
I've supplied them with a wooden
spoon and a bowl.

444
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,600
So, I'm just chopping up this dried
fruit. The instruction is,

445
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,800
&quot;Mix the dried fruits, ginger, rum
and sugar together

446
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,080
&quot;and then leave to soak.&quot;

447
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,640
Pretty much it's just a standard
tart but it's just the filling

448
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,880
that's a bit odd.

449
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,240
To be honest with you, this kind of
soaked-fruit rum thing

450
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,240
is not my bag.
But I'll just, you know, wing it.

451
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,400
&quot;Measure 50ml,&quot; and they haven't
provided a measuring jug. OK.

452
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,760
Anything even remotely useful on
the measuring front?

453
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,920
No.

454
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,280
Think about this, Steven. 50ml.

455
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,000
To be fair, I like rum-soaked
stuff, I love rum.

456
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,360
A little bit more for luck.

457
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,880
Mm. It smells like Christmas,
doesn't it?

458
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,840
No more rum. Whoo!

459
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,840
I'm going in.

460
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,360
Great, so...leave that to soak and
make the sweet shortcrust.

461
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,760
Let's get this done.

462
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,720
The recipe is really quite detailed.

463
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,160
So, my instructions for making
the shortcrust pastry are

464
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,720
&quot;make the shortcrust pastry&quot;.

465
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,840
It doesn't say how to do it,

466
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,560
but I'm going to combine my butter
and my sugar and my flour together

467
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,600
with fingertips.

468
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,360
You need to be careful
with shortcrust

469
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,360
that you don't overwork it, so,
like, nice, light, rubbing action.

470
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,440
I know this is a Forgotten Bake,

471
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,560
but fundamentally it's a fruit tart
with a lattice.

472
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,520
It's an alcoholic fruit tart with a
lattice top.

473
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,160
What's not to like?  Sounds like a
perfect drag queen if you ask me.

474
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,000
I've just added a teaspoon of lemon
juice and then one to two teaspoons

475
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,720
of cold water. It should be just
enough moisture just to combine it.

476
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,160
Do you know what? In all honesty,

477
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,480
the pastry that I made in the
Signature, that's what I want now.

478
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,840
Right, let's get this tin lined.

479
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,920
I don't know if I'm doing the whole
thing.

480
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,520
SHE MAKES POPPING SOUND

481
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,640
I'm just going to have to cut it and
hope for the best.

482
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,560
Could you... Yes.

483
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,360
Further, further, further.

484
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,400
Wow, you're quite bossy!

485
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,120
Just using a bit of pastry to get
into all the nooks.

486
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,920
Add the filling to the lined tin.
All the filling.

487
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,400
Then you add butter -
that's quite curious.

488
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,800
Bakers, you have 45 minutes to
finish your rum Nicky,

489
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,960
or, if you want to be a
bit more formal, your rum Nicholas.

490
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,360
If you have enough rum, you probably
do end up KNICKERLESS!

491
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,760
&quot;14-strip lattice
with the remaining pastry.&quot;

492
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,880
Hm, hm, hm, hm.

493
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,680
I want 14 strips.

494
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,160
I'm just going to have to go with my
gut instincts on this one.

495
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,320
This is definitely the hardest part
of the challenge for me,

496
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,360
without a shadow of a doubt.

497
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,160
I just do not know how the hell
I'm going to do that.

498
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,160
I'm very, very bad at maths.

499
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,120
SHE SIGHS

500
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,680
So, as per the instructions, you
arrange it on a piece

501
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,160
of grease-proof paper first.

502
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,280
The trick is to sort of lay the
strip across

503
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,120
and then fold back the other ones
that you didn't do last time.

504
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,480
I think Steven is doing his
entirely different to mine.

505
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,240
He's doing some kind of pull-apart
one,

506
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,880
but I'm doing what I would call
a traditional lattice.

507
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,560
Yeah, I did think about doing it
that way but I like this way.

508
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,320
We're going to run cuts up the side
of the pastry

509
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,360
and as you pull the pastry apart,
you get lattice.

510
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,240
There's got to be a quicker way to
do this. I don't know!

511
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,480
What's happening here?
You know what, I don't know.

512
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,560
Intricate lattice work.
Yeah, but, you know what,

513
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,880
I've just turned round and Steven
is doing something

514
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,800
entirely different.
Is that good or bad?

515
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,480
It's obviously bad, isn't it?
Because he knows what he's doing

516
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,920
and I don't.  Maybe not.

517
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,320
Maybe you know what you're doing.

518
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,760
Come on now.  No.

519
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,160
Come on now.

520
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,960
I just want to get this lattice
right. It's really important,

521
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,960
really important. Have I got 14?

522
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,480
I don't know.

523
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Bakers, you only have half an hour
left to whip up your rum Nicky.

524
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,640
30 minutes! My God!
SHE MURMURS

525
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,640
Over, under, over.

526
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,560
I'm taking ages, man.

527
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,560
Any idea? Argh!

528
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,520
I think I've messed this up.
I hate this so much.

529
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,960
Hate it.

530
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,960
That should just be enough
lattice work.

531
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,120
Too short.

532
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,120
This is where it's going to get a
bit messy.

533
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,480
What on earth was that?

534
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,480
This hasn't actually worked.

535
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,480
Right, we have got 20 minutes,
if that, to reroll this.

536
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,760
Steven, I can't help noticing that
you're doing the lattice work again.

537
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,120
Yeah, it didn't work out,

538
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,200
so I'm going to have to go back
to the drawing board.

539
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,640
You're all right, you've got time.

540
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,880
I don't know how long this thing
bakes for, but, hey-ho,

541
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,840
we'll just have to do our best.

542
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,240
I'm not really sure about this.

543
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,240
I'm thinking I should cut the rest
of it off.

544
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,560
I'm so bad at this.

545
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,000
God, it's not easy, is it?

546
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm putting on an eggwash now, and
then that is going into the oven.

547
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,840
Everyone else is doing the whole
dish,

548
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,040
and I'm the only one that's done
the inner part of it.

549
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,720
SHE LAUGHS

550
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,960
Oh, gosh, I don't know.

551
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,800
So ragged.

552
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,520
I don't know what to do.

553
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,080
Right, it's going in.

554
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,480
Not the prettiest, which is
annoying.

555
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,560
Just whack the temperature up and
leave it.

556
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,560
I've whacked the temperature
right up because it's not going
to bake in time.

557
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,920
Do I trim it?
NOEL:  What is your gut telling you?

558
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,760
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know.

559
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,280
You just have to trust your
instincts.

560
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,360
So bad.

561
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,880
You're all right, don't panic.

562
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,520
HE SIGHS

563
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,920
Let's hope we can redeem ourselves
with some rum butter.

564
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,800
So it says just make the rum butter,

565
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,160
and then it's just got the
ingredients.

566
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,440
Atrocious.

567
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,040
I'm just going to do 160 until
the end.

568
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,640
I don't think it's going to be in
the oven long enough.

569
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,640
I just took way too long
on the lattice.

570
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,280
Bakers, you have ten minutes,

571
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,120
just ten minutes to complete
your Technical Challenge.

572
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,280
It seems like an awful lot of sugar.

573
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,160
Who the hell would want to have this
to eat?

574
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,560
I remember it being quite grainy,

575
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,800
so I'm not expecting it
to be mega smooth.

576
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,680
KATE:  My God, I am absolutely
sweating.

577
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,560
It's just not butter. That can't be
right. It tastes disgusting.

578
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,800
I think maybe I'll just keep
stirring it until the end

579
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,520
and hopefully it gets less grainy.

580
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,480
I started this in 1792
and I'm still going!

581
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,640
Bakers, you've got just one minute
left, one minute.

582
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,640
God, they do not make your life
easy.

583
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,000
KATE:  It's come together now.
It's nice and whippy.

584
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,160
Rum butter's done.
I think we're doing all right.

585
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,720
I'm never doing this again.

586
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,600
This is enough rum butter.

587
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,600
30 seconds!

588
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,840
Stunning.

589
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,840
It's raw. Atrocious.

590
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,400
Bakers, your time is up.

591
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,400
Please bring your rum Nickys
up to the gingham table.

592
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,760
Raw, raw, raw.

593
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,640
NOEL:  Paul and Prue are looking
for a thin pastry bottom,

594
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,640
a beautiful lattice top
and a smooth rum butter.

595
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,240
And as usual, they won't know
whose rum Nicky is whose.

596
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,720
PAUL:  Right, we'll start with the
one at the end.

597
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,920
You needed to take the sides up
to the top of the plate.

598
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,160
That's a major issue.

599
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,120
The lattice is certainly not cooked

600
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,280
and I'll eat my hat if the bottom
is cooked.

601
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,240
Wow...we have a raw base.

602
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,080
Yeah.

603
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
Pastry is very raw.  It is.

604
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,200
Right, well, that was a
disappointment.

605
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,360
Now, the lattice work on this
is even.

606
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,680
You need to allow gaps to allow
the alcohol to evaporate.

607
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,000
And again, I think it would be much
better

608
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,600
if the pastry came to the edge.

609
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,920
The rum flavour is there,

610
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,840
but the alcohol couldn't penetrate
through the sheer volume of lattice.

611
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,080
And a bit grainy on the rum butter
as well.

612
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,320
Now moving on to number three,
this is more like it.

613
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,200
A nice coverage of the pastry,
which goes right to the end.

614
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,280
The lattice is a bit sparse -
that's a little bit too thin.

615
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,280
But it has got the best colour,
it's nice and brown.

616
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,440
Mm. I could just sit there
and eat a lot of that.

617
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,720
It just looks a little bit
thrown together.

618
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,120
Right, moving onto this.
Lattice - very good.

619
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,960
Needed less of them. Right...

620
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,640
You can see how soft that pastry
is underneath.

621
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,000
It's much more cooked than
I thought it would be.

622
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,600
I mean, the flavours are lovely.

623
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,800
It looks neat.
Yes, it looks very nice.

624
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,160
I think if it'd had a little longer
in the oven,

625
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,240
it would be a pretty good pie.

626
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,800
Moving on to the last one, we have
something that's shrunk back

627
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,280
slightly from the sides, but the
colour is not bad on the edge.

628
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,560
They've so nearly got it to the end.

629
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,560
It's just a little bit again in the
middle, but it nearly done, yes.

630
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,080
Yeah, it's good. It's very nice

631
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,520
and thin, the pastry.

632
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,160
Less alcohol in that one as well.

633
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,600
You've got the flavour of the rum.

634
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,400
Very good.

635
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,160
Bit smoother on the butter as well.

636
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,960
This is perfect rum butter.

637
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,000
SANDI: Prue and Paul will now rank
the rum Nickys

638
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,080
from the worst to the best.

639
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,080
OK, in fifth place is this one.

640
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,160
Liam, obviously it needed to go
in the oven for longer

641
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,640
because it's quite raw.

642
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,960
In fourth place is this one.

643
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,960
Sophie, the lattice looks absolutely
beautiful, but it is too closed.

644
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,720
In third position is this one.

645
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,640
Too many lattice strips.

646
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,240
It said 14, so we did 14.

647
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,080
13, 14, 15.

648
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,240
Oh, 15. Oh!

649
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,960
I've always had a problem with
maths.

650
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,440
Right, in second place
is this one here.

651
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,160
Kate, this is absolutely delicious.

652
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,120
The rum butter is the best
we've seen.

653
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,120
So, in first place is this one.

654
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,120
Nice gaps between the lattice

655
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,840
and the balance of flavours in the
fruit and the rum is perfect.

656
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,120
Although your butter's a little
bit grainy.

657
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,040
That was unexpected.

658
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,480
I feel incredible. I do feel a
little bit like I cheated, though.

659
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,960
I just threw it in the oven
and it came first.

660
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,280
But I'll take it!

661
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,480
I hope it's redeemed me a little bit
from this morning.

662
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,080
Because if I'd done really bad,

663
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,040
I'd have to do something spectacular
tomorrow

664
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,600
to even be considered to stay.

665
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,440
To come third in the Technical is
great at this late stage.

666
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,680
So, tomorrow I'll have to get
my head down and go for it.

667
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,320
Every element needs to be pukka.

668
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,720
I don't think anyone says pukka
any more, but...pukka!

669
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,720
I'm really not happy. All in all,
probably the worst day

670
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,160
I've had actually so far.

671
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,640
So, not great to be putting

672
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,080
that sort of thing out in
the quarterfinals.

673
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,400
I hate coming last.

674
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,040
I'm just going to have to pull
it out of the bag again.

675
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,000
Yeah, I've got to do a vintage Liam.

676
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,160
NOEL:  One challenge left before
Paul and Prue choose Star Baker

677
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,320
and decide who must miss out
on a place in the semifinal.

678
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,360
SANDI: I don't know if
I can stand the tension.

679
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,440
Quarterfinals, you'd think you might
know who's going to get into the top

680
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,800
and it's all over the place.

681
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,480
I think Steven's
had a bit of a dip.

682
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,520
He's coming back now, strong, coming
into the semifinals next week.

683
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,720
This is the time to get good.

684
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,080
But Stacey, handshake
from her clanger.

685
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,560
The pastries, the shape, the
flavour - it ticked all the boxes.

686
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,000
I would absolutely love
Stacey to make it to Star Baker

687
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,080
cos she's worked so
hard to get there.

688
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,680
I think Liam, Sophie and Kate are
all in a little bit of trouble.

689
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,600
Kate didn't do too
well on the Signature.

690
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,160
But she came back cos
her Rum Nicky was second.

691
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,840
I'd like to see
Liam in the semifinal

692
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,880
BUT coming last in the Technical

693
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,560
automatically puts you
into a difficult position

694
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,720
and I think Sophie's in
quite a bit of trouble.

695
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,960
Who could believe this?

696
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,400
Her char siu pork was...

697
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,840
was OK, but she was
fourth in the Technical

698
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,360
and I think Sophie has the
capability of saving herself,

699
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,720
but it's down to the Showstopper.

700
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,160
If they want to get through
to the semifinal next week,

701
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,720
they've got to pull their socks up

702
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,720
and create something
that's pure magic.

703
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,920
Morning, bakers. For your
Showstopper Challenge today,

704
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,720
we're heading back
to Victorian times.

705
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,000
COCKNEY ACCENT:  So, I'm going
up a bleeding chimney...

706
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,120
AS QUEEN VICTORIA:  ..and
Sandi will not be amused.

707
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,480
Today, the judges would like you

708
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,760
to make a Victorian favourite -
the Savoy cake.

709
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,520
Now, I'm not going to lie to you,

710
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,760
traditionally, this banqueting
centrepiece was rather inedible,

711
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,920
but Prue and Paul
would like you to make

712
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,400
a light, delicate sponge,

713
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,160
baked in an elaborate mould,

714
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,120
with a hard sugar coating.

715
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,360
Your Savoy cake can be
any flavour you want

716
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,920
but, to create that Victorian drama,

717
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,640
it must be served on a plinth

718
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,320
also created from sponge.

719
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,200
So, you need a bit of
sponge engineering.

720
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,880
You need to be the Brunel of baking.

721
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,160
You have three-and-a-half hours.

722
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,160
NOEL AND SANDI: On your
marks, get set, bake.

723
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,720
STEVEN:  The last bake before
the semifinals is big anyway.

724
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,600
It doesn't make it any easier, the
fact this is a complete unknown,

725
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,640
this cake. I don't think one's
been seen since about 1890.

726
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,920
KATE:  I don't really think
this is like any other cake

727
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,240
I've, kind of, had before.

728
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,040
It's a bit of a weird
one, this, isn't it?

729
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,120
SOPHIE:  Not a great day yesterday.
I like to come back to cakes.

730
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,280
I don't like stodgy,
old-fashioned pastry.

731
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,440
I like pretty things!

732
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,440
PRUE:  A Victorian Savoy cake would
have been an amazing centrepiece,

733
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,000
a real Showstopper,

734
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,280
and that's what we
want from our bakers.

735
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,400
But it was very seldom eaten.

736
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,760
We want them to
taste amazing as well.

737
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,520
This is going to be
a little bit tricky.

738
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,520
Traditionally, the Savoy cake is
made in quite an elaborate mould

739
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,440
but there's no
rising agent in there,

740
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,400
there's no fat in there.

741
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,360
So, the blending of the whites
and the yolks is critical

742
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,480
because if they beat
that thing to death,

743
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,080
the whole thing will collapse.

744
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,600
This cake was produced, actually,

745
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,400
for the kings and
queens of the time.

746
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,880
Now, we're asking them to produce
exactly the same standard

747
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,920
but for the gingham altar.

748
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,920
This has to be absolutely exquisite.

749
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,400
SANDI: The Savoy cake rose to
prominence during the 19th century

750
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,080
and featured among the sweet
entremets of a Victorian dinner.

751
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,280
In order to achieve
its impressive height,

752
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,880
a number of intricate and
elaborate moulded cakes

753
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,840
were stacked up on
a base plinth cake.

754
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,080
The sponge texture was
light and delicate,

755
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,440
and flavoured with
lemon or orange zest.

756
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,440
Although sometimes
lightly decorated,

757
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,400
the naked sponge was the star -

758
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,440
featuring a smooth, thin
coating of hard baked sugar

759
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,440
which would preserve the cake
for weeks, or sometimes months.

760
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,080
At the moment, I am just
cracking an awful lot of eggs.

761
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,000
Absolutely at capacity.

762
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,840
Savoy cake batter is made by
carefully folding whisked egg whites

763
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,080
into an egg yolk and flour mixture.

764
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,640
You're just relying on
the power of the eggs.

765
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,320
I'm so desperate to rush

766
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,840
but, if I rush this,

767
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,680
it's just going to
knock all the air out and

768
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,200
it will just end up...

769
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,480
I don't want to know what
it will end up looking like.

770
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,600
Stacey, however, isn't holding back.

771
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,560
I've got a lot to do in a very,
very, very short space of time.

772
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,840
If I didn't give myself a lot to do,
then it wouldn't be me, would it?

773
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,960
NOEL:  Not only is Stacey doing
two different flavoured sponges,

774
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,040
she's loading her
heart-shaped Savoy cake

775
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,480
with macaroons, madeleines,

776
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,360
jellies and swirled meringues.

777
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,280
Why have you gone and
made it so complicated?

778
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,680
I'll tell you why.

779
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,200
Erm, because it's week eight,

780
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,880
and it's the Showstopper
of week eight,

781
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,560
and I just want to go all out.

782
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,560
I really think you
look well organised.

783
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,960
I think it's possible
you'll pull it off so...

784
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,040
Let's see.  ..let's see,
Stacey. Good luck.  Thank you.

785
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,600
Right, where am I?

786
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,480
&quot;Add the zest of a lemon.&quot;

787
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,280
SANDI: Stacey, Liam and Sophie
are flavouring their cakes

788
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,640
the Victorian way,
with citrus zest.

789
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,680
I'm also going to put a little bit
of yuzu powder and yuzu juice.

790
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,480
The main flavours are
lemon and elderflower.

791
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,000
But not everyone is
sticking with tradition.

792
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,920
Chestnut puree, rum and orange
are the overarching flavours.

793
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,920
Our job here today is to take
what essentially is

794
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,520
a plain, boring,
tasteless, inedible cake

795
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,320
and make it light and delicious.

796
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,640
Easy!

797
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,480
Candied nuts and 16
handcrafted fondant flowers

798
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,480
will bedeck Steven's chestnut rum
cake filled with cinnamon apples.

799
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,160
The chestnut didn't make
the Savoy cake too heavy?

800
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,640
No, what the chestnut puree does

801
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,840
is just add a little
bit of structure to it

802
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,760
but it does add a little
bit of flavour as well.

803
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,960
Good luck with the
Savoy cake.  Thank you.

804
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,400
I hope I tick the flavour box today

805
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,320
because, you know, I'm not
going stupidly elaborate

806
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,640
with the design on this.

807
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,680
It's going to be classic,
simple and beautiful,

808
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,040
so I do want to make sure
that the flavours are there.

809
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,640
KATE:  I'm doing pecan and caramel.

810
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,800
I really, really love
the flavours of it

811
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,480
and I think it's a chance
to update the Savoy cake.

812
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,240
Good morning, Kate. How are you?

813
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,800
Morning. Good, thanks.
Tell us all about your Savoy cake.

814
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,320
I'm going to do, erm,
the Liver Building turret.

815
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,840
Brilliant. You're Star Baker!

816
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,840
Thank you very much indeed.

817
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,320
NOEL:  Chocolate decorations
will adorn Kate's

818
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,960
six-sponge Liverpool landmark,

819
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,320
topped with a silver
fondant liver bird.

820
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,400
I'm not using, like, a
traditional Bundt tin.

821
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,200
I'm going for an assembly
of many shapes and sizes.

822
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,920
How many eggs is it?
60.  60 eggs?  Yeah.

823
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,320
Wow.  This one was particularly
painful for the chicken.

824
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,040
It took a little bit
of the chicken with it.

825
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,320
You've practised this?  Yeah.

826
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,160
You can get it done in time?  Yeah.

827
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,680
It's semifinal week next week.

828
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,160
Go big or go home.

829
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,040
Exactly.

830
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,320
NOEL:  Whilst Liam won't be
impressing the judges with size,

831
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,200
he's hoping a little magic
will keep him from going home.

832
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,920
Savoy cake's all about
witchcraft and wizardry.

833
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,520
If I had a magic wand,
I would propel myself...

834
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,240
..to next week!

835
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,600
Liam's hoping to leave
the judges spellbound

836
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,440
with his three-tiered Savoy cake,

837
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,120
festooned with spun
sugar magic, a chocolate wand

838
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,600
and bottles of enchanting
bourbon caramel sauce.

839
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,120
Have you had problems with getting
the cakes out of the mould?

840
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,640
First time, yeah, I did.

841
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,920
You did?  First time I did

842
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,960
but you have to, like, absolutely
pack it with loads of icing sugar

843
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,560
so it doesn't, like, stay in there.

844
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,360
So, hopefully,
it does come out today.

845
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,400
I'm lining it with vegetable fat.

846
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,200
What I'm going to do then
is coat it with icing sugar.

847
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,760
The idea is that when it bakes,

848
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,080
you're going to get,
like, a crust of sugar.

849
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,440
Prue and Paul will be
looking for a sugar crust

850
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,720
that's thin, crisp
and perfectly smooth.

851
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,920
SOPHIE:  There's a little
bit missing there,

852
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,240
so I'm just making sure that
the whole thing is lined.

853
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,840
This is the most vital part.
Grease it up.

854
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,440
To give the Savoy cake
its intricate detail...

855
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,040
I'm going to zhoosh it around.

856
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,000
..the bakers must
make sure their batter

857
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
gets into every nook and cranny.

858
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,360
STEVEN:  I'm just gently
pouring this batter in.

859
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,440
This is a particularly
intricate tin.

860
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,720
I've had varying degrees of
success with this at home.

861
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,000
I just have to keep my
fingers crossed on this one.

862
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,080
SOPHIE:  I read that they
would cover them in parchment

863
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,440
so that the mixture would,
sort of, stay in the tin

864
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,760
and go right to the edges.

865
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,240
I like to be authentic.

866
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,800
NOEL:  The plinth in Sophie's
historically accurate cake

867
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,080
will be sandwiched
with yuzu buttercream,

868
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,640
circled by a croquembouche,

869
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,840
all topped with a
chocolate showpiece.

870
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,840
I'm doing a sort of
flower, essentially,

871
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,800
so I'm doing petals and then
gluing them around a little ball.

872
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
All out of chocolate?
All out of chocolate, yes.

873
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,880
Impressive. You've
obviously practised this.

874
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,920
HIGH-PITCHED:  Yeah!
That was quite a high &quot;yeah&quot;.

875
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,200
&quot;Yeah!&quot;  &quot;Yeah!&quot;

876
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,440
I have practised it.

877
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,400
It hasn't come out looking
as beautiful as I would like

878
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,560
but hopefully it'll
look good enough.

879
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,040
Right, this baby is going in.

880
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,120
Everything's going to
go in at the same time

881
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,080
because I've got a lot
of choux buns to do.

882
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,080
I'll need the oven as soon
as I can, basically.

883
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,160
STEVEN:  Oven door doesn't get
opened until at least an hour.

884
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,720
I'm not touching it because,

885
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,160
as soon as you open it
and let some of that heat out,

886
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,600
the risk is it will collapse.

887
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,920
Cakes in the oven...

888
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,560
Cake's in. Macaroons.

889
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,000
..the bakers can
focus on their trimmings.

890
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,920
That is choux pastry.

891
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,240
Or it will be.

892
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,120
All except for Kate, who's
got four more cakes to make.

893
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,960
This is batch number two.

894
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,200
I've got a lot to do in
comparison to everyone else

895
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,280
who's doing a
single-tier one or whatever.

896
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,000
I've just got to go for it anyway.

897
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,400
I'm going to flip this,
so you might want to stand back.

898
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,000
You don't want a hot
nut in your face, do you?

899
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,560
STACEY:  I'm making macaroons.

900
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,560
There's a lot to do, still,
but, so far, I'm fine.

901
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,240
This is the bourbon-spiced
caramel.

902
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,480
It's a case of
smashing this one today.

903
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,520
SOPHIE:  This is the green
apple creme diplomat

904
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,760
that's going to go
inside the choux buns.

905
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,440
Hey, Soph. Wow, you've got quite
a nice green going on there.

906
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,040
Yeah.  I think this is quite
a good Showstopper for you.

907
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,320
I hope, because I had a
terrible day yesterday.

908
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,600
Quite tricky, isn't it?
It's not your kitchen.

909
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,680
There's more space than
there is in my kitchen.

910
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,040
Do you not live in a tent?

911
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,040
I live in a tent identical to this.

912
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,840
Bakers, you have one
and a half hours left.

913
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,280
We want to see those Savoy cakes.

914
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,840
Check out that bad boy.

915
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,680
Cool. Done.

916
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,880
Pretty happy.  I think I'm
going to try and turn it out.

917
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,760
Shall we see what the
first one looks like?

918
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,400
I just hope it comes out!

919
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,040
I just hope it comes out!

920
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,240
If it doesn't, then we're done.
Game over, mate.

921
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,040
Sometimes it stays and sometimes
it doesn't, so we will see.

922
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,040
Dah-dah-dah!

923
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Little bit left behind.
I can live with that.

924
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,200
What do you think?

925
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,400
This looks nice.

926
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,480
Not bad. I've got a bit
of hole-age.  &quot;Hole-age&quot;?

927
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,640
But you know what?
Overall, I've got a sugar crust.

928
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,920
SOPHIE:  Look at that,
look at that. Beautiful.

929
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,440
That should be OK.

930
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,800
I mean, it's got the sugar crust,

931
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,800
but I would have liked it a
bit more even all around.

932
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,080
HE CACKLES

933
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,800
Now I feel really happy.

934
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,240
Right, OK. So, make
the second Savoy cake.

935
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,640
This is the plinth, so this is what
the Bundt cake is going to sit on.

936
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,120
LIAM:  It's just the same
mixture as I did before.

937
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,760
KATE:  Final batch. I'm
just adding the pecan nuts do it.

938
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,160
How many eggs are you through?
All of them.

939
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,160
I was doing mine with
a side of omelette!

940
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,160
It's all about getting the
consistency of the choux right

941
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,520
so it can be piped,
but it's not too thick.

942
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,360
I feel like I'm panning for gold.

943
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,040
KATE:  That's my plinth, there.
It's a huge cake tin.

944
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,960
LIAM:  I'll give it, like,
half an hour.

945
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,440
STACEY:  That's going to go there.
That's going to go there.

946
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,520
Get on with it.

947
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,720
STEVEN:  That's going to go
in for about 45 minutes

948
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,320
and, right now, we're going to get
some beautiful decorating done.

949
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,160
That's the choux pastry done and
then I've got to pipe it out,

950
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,320
and then as soon as my
Savoy cakes are out of the oven,

951
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,160
I can then put the choux buns in.

952
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,040
The plans for decoration,
cut out a liver bird.

953
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,320
The story behind them is, if the
liver birds ever leave Liverpool,

954
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,720
it'll be no more -

955
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,680
so hopefully I can get one
on the top of this cake

956
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,920
or my cake will be no more,

957
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,400
and I will be no more
in the Bake Off tent.

958
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,960
I'm just making my wands.

959
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,680
I piped some
chocolate into the straws

960
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,120
and I'm going to freeze them

961
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,520
and, once they're set,
I'm going to poke them out.

962
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,640
This is my favourite thing
to do, jelly making.

963
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,200
Get them in the fridge, done.

964
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,960
And then it's just buttercream,

965
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,960
madeleines, meringues.

966
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,600
I've got this!

967
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,160
OK, the other one's
going to come out.

968
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,080
These are sugar paste roses.

969
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,080
I did 150 of them for my
mum's 60th cake last year

970
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,680
and it took me two days.

971
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,560
But if I can just get them to
look like roses, I'll be happy.

972
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,240
Choux buns are going to go in.

973
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,240
Right, let's have a look
at this cake. Not far off.

974
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,560
I just broke the oven.

975
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,400
BLEEP.

976
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,920
Oven door's come off.

977
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,440
Now I'm panicking.

978
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,760
I'm taking it out.
Can she share mine at 150?

979
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,200
No, no, no. You carry on.

980
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,160
It's all right,
I'll just hold it like this.

981
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,000
It could do with maybe
a minute or two longer.

982
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,960
Hopefully it won't deflate.

983
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,320
What happened to Stacey?

984
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,960
Her oven broke.  Her oven broke?

985
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,560
Yeah.  Oh, my God.

986
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,120
Queen Victoria, Prince Albert.

987
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,680
You be Prince Albert.

988
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,560
FAUX GERMAN ACCENT:  Bakers,
you have one hour left

989
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,440
to finish your sponge plinths.

990
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,840
Wow, it's more like Angela Merkel.

991
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,440
Everything was going so well!

992
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,720
Perfect.

993
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,360
The only thing I'm not pleased about

994
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,360
is that my plinth is a lot
darker than these two.

995
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,920
STEVEN:  Not bad.

996
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,680
The plinth's stuck in the mould.

997
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,240
Just carry on and I'll see if I can
try and decorate my way around this.

998
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,320
Oops, I'm going to take it out.

999
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,680
Yeah, I think we're just about OK.

1000
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,560
So, let me just try and regroup.

1001
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,200
Is there any oven on that's spare?

1002
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,680
This is going to be for
the chocolate decorations.

1003
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,400
I'm going to make a chocolate clock.

1004
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,920
I'm going to make little petals

1005
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,680
and hopefully make
a chocolate flower.

1006
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,200
I do like to do this kind of stuff.

1007
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,040
STEVEN:  Shall we do another one?

1008
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,520
15 minutes. I want to
check my macaroons.

1009
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,840
I've had to use another oven

1010
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,760
but luckily there is another
oven to use, so we're all right.

1011
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,760
Let's get madeleine-ing, shall we?

1012
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,880
Get them in
the fridge to chill.

1013
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,520
Let's see if we can
get these babies in.

1014
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,480
The main thing now,
get the meringues in.

1015
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,400
I've got two minutes
to get them in the oven.

1016
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,360
You think you've got
more time than you have.

1017
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,120
All of a sudden, it...

1018
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,760
I've got to fill all my choux buns

1019
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,240
and then I've got to
assemble my chocolate flower.

1020
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,800
There's still quite a lot to do.

1021
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,080
LIAM:  This is certainly not
the time for shaky hands.

1022
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,960
I've got to keep composed.

1023
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,160
Oh, God! Oh, no!

1024
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,920
I've killed the liver bird off.

1025
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,160
I picked it up to move
it and it just went...

1026
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,640
SHE MAKES CRACKING SOUND

1027
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,720
SHE SIGHS

1028
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,160
I seem to jinx myself
regularly, don't I?

1029
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,600
It's a bit lopsided.

1030
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,240
So, this is improvisation.

1031
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,960
I'm just going to make
it chocolate instead.

1032
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,360
Savoy-oy, bakers.

1033
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,240
You have 30 minutes left.

1034
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,960
30 minutes.

1035
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,560
STACEY:  The meringues
are in the oven,

1036
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,280
so there's not a lot I
can do about it now.

1037
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,880
OK, so, spun sugar.

1038
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,880
SOPHIE:  It's taking ages
but we're getting there.

1039
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,760
Right, sir, have you
come for your shave?

1040
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,320
What is this?  It's...
It's fat, so I...

1041
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,520
Oh!

1042
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,120
KATE:  This is really stressful.

1043
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,560
LIAM:  It's the finishing touches.

1044
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,720
It's really weird that
I've finished kind of early.

1045
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,040
But you've done great for time.

1046
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,200
It's not like you're rushing.
Yeah, it's a bit weird.

1047
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,800
In all honesty,
I've actually never timed this.

1048
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,720
OK. I won't tell anybody!

1049
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,120
SOPHIE:  I've just got a few

1050
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,360
that I've dipped in freeze-dried
strawberries and in pearl sugar.

1051
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,640
Without realising it,

1052
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,640
this is probably something that the
Victorians would have appreciated.

1053
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,640
STACEY:  The macaroons are a bit
big but it doesn't matter.

1054
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,680
Big's better than small.

1055
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,720
I gather you've been
slightly unhinged today.

1056
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,840
Not ideal.  That's a
Bake Off first, I think.

1057
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,160
Oh!

1058
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,800
The spun sugar, now it's
just gone and dissolved.

1059
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,680
Yeah.

1060
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,080
Oh, I keep dropping them.

1061
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,200
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

1062
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,960
Five minutes before you have
to present your Savoy cake.

1063
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,400
SOPHIE:  This is going to get
done by the skin of my teeth.

1064
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,760
Don't drop it.

1065
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,320
STACEY:  No, they're not great.

1066
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,680
They're just not ready.
They're not cooked.

1067
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,680
I don't even know if I should
even put them on, to be honest.

1068
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,240
LIAM:  Do you know if Paul and Prue
could see it before the sugar melts?

1069
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,240
Please, please, please, please.

1070
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,440
SOPHIE:  Cutting it fine!

1071
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,080
KATE:  Oh, my God,
that's just cracked.

1072
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,280
Bakers, that is it.

1073
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,240
Your time is up.

1074
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,240
Please place your Showstopper Savoy
cakes at the end of your station.

1075
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,760
If I just did...ten more.

1076
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,760
Sophie, stop!

1077
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,760
Oh, I've stopped!  Almost.

1078
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:56,000
There's, like, this much left!

1079
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,960
SANDI: It's judgment time for the
Victorian centrepieces,

1080
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,960
but these Savoy cakes will need to
taste as good as they look.

1081
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,240
Wow, Stacey! It really has got about
20 elements to it, hasn't it?

1082
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,520
I'm very impressed that you got
all the cakes out quite cleanly.

1083
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,640
There's a nice shiny sugar crust,

1084
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,800
but, you struggled with
the meringue.

1085
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,240
Yeah, they weren't done in time.

1086
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,240
But overall, I think it's very you,
it's very Stacey.

1087
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,920
NOEL: The Victorian Stacey.

1088
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,600
We've got the orange on the top,
is that right?

1089
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,360
Yeah.

1090
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,360
It's got a nice texture.

1091
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,600
Great flavour.

1092
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,040
Really nice flavour.
The texture's amazing.

1093
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,600
And the orange comes through well.

1094
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,800
This is your lemon one,
is that right?

1095
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,320
Yeah.  Very good texture.

1096
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,440
That's not as well-flavoured
as the other, is it?

1097
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,560
It's there, it's not as potent as
the orange one.

1098
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,640
So you've got madeleines, you've got
macarons, you've got some jelly.

1099
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,480
The madeleines were little bit flat,

1100
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,240
but you've got the raspberry right
in the middle of that, haven't you?

1101
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,880
The raspberry's very nice,

1102
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,440
but the macaron, because they've
been sandwiched with a curd,

1103
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,960
they've got very soggy.

1104
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,160
The macarons I don't
particularly like, I don't think
they're well baked.

1105
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,360
Let me try a bit of hard jelly.

1106
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,720
Very nice.

1107
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,600
I think overall, you've just gone
slightly OTT on the decoration.

1108
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,240
But your two cakes are good!

1109
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,960
It's a massive work!

1110
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,320
Probably a titch overambitious.

1111
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,320
But I think it's a real achievement.

1112
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,040
I think it looks
a little bit haphazard.

1113
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,560
It's a bit topsy-turvy.

1114
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,960
I like the decoration of
the sugar, that's fine,

1115
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,000
but you can see what's
happened to it over time.

1116
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,200
It will collapse.
Humidity gets to it, destroys it.

1117
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,200
So it's elderflower?
Elderflower and lemon.

1118
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,080
It's quite dense, almost like you've
over-mixed it, you know?

1119
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,080
Yeah.  I think you did.  But I'm just,
not catching any flavours at all.

1120
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,400
OK.  The most flavour you get from
this is if you happen to get

1121
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,760
a bit of caramel.
It's a little disappointing.

1122
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,480
It is a little bit. The top layer's
better than the bottom,

1123
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,360
I think the bottom one is burnt.
Quarterfinal you want, consistency.

1124
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,560
Yeah.  I think you've had a really
great idea, Liam.

1125
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,560
Don't think you quite pulled it off.

1126
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,240
Sophie, I think that is a perfect
shape of a Victorian Savoy cake.

1127
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,920
It's nice and high,
it's spectacular to look at.

1128
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,880
The chocolate top is magnificent.

1129
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,240
It's very, very clever.
If you break through,

1130
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,040
you've got your plinth down
at the bottom down there,

1131
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,400
which is sandwiched as well.
You've given that a flavour.

1132
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,200
It's well baked all the way through.

1133
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,480
You got a nice sugar coating
on the top of it as well,

1134
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,960
and I love the design.

1135
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,560
You've celebrated the Savoy cake,
which I like.

1136
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,560
Right, I am going to take
a slice out of this.

1137
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,880
The texture of the cake
is quite chewy.  OK.

1138
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,840
But it's very pleasant.

1139
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,440
I love the flavour. I just think
when you mixed it,

1140
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,480
you may have just turned it a couple
more times than you needed to.  OK.

1141
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,200
You've lost that air,
but you're not far off it.

1142
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,200
Remind me what's in there.
Green Apple, creme diplomat.

1143
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,160
Mmm. I love that green apple!

1144
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,440
Really good.
I love that whole cake, actually.

1145
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,440
Thank you.

1146
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,280
Very elegant, very simple,
very small.

1147
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,760
It makes you question what have you
spent the last few hours making.

1148
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,240
All the time's been spent
on the roses,

1149
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,720
and they do look beautiful.
It's very elegant.

1150
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,120
I must say the sugar coating
looks really good.

1151
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,320
And I do think you've been
very clever,

1152
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,120
because those walnuts there
perfectly fit the mould.

1153
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,200
It's beautifully done!

1154
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,200
Now right in the middle there,
you have...  The cinnamon apples.

1155
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:59,840
Love a cinnamon apple.

1156
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,840
Not what I expected!
Nope. But it is delicious.

1157
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,720
The texture I think, is lovely.

1158
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,320
It's actually very brave of you to
put to put the chestnuts in there.

1159
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,920
Because chestnut in itself,
is quite a heavy thing.  Yeah.

1160
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,440
But it actually hasn't affected
the texture too much.

1161
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,000
It's still quite light. but for me,
if you're gonna put chestnut in it,

1162
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,480
get the flavour to come out.
Because it hasn't.  OK.

1163
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,280
But nevertheless,
very pretty design.  Thank you.

1164
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,240
Kate, please bring up
your Savoy cake.

1165
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,960
Do you want some help?  Yes, please.

1166
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,240
Ready?  Yep.

1167
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,240
Weirdest removal firm.

1168
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,480
I can see what it is.

1169
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,520
The top of the Liver Building.

1170
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,760
But, it's a bit simplistic.

1171
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,760
The bottom plinth has
had a few major issues.

1172
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,520
Yeah, it didn't turn out properly.

1173
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,480
These seemed to have caught again.

1174
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,400
It's all a bit broken up.

1175
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,800
I do think it's a bit rough and
ready but I like the fact

1176
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,480
that she's got the height.  Yeah.
It's a bold piece.

1177
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,760
The sugar coating on it's good.

1178
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,720
But, look how yellow that is.

1179
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,720
60 eggs have made that
very, very yellow.

1180
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,280
It's a bit dry, actually.

1181
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,080
I was wondering if it's a bit
over-cooked at that.

1182
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:11,080
I think it could be.
That's the one with pecans in it.

1183
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,680
That's a much better cake.

1184
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,080
That's delicious!  It's moister too.

1185
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,760
I'm biased anyway.
I love the Liver Building.

1186
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,080
But, star of the show's
that third one down.

1187
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:33,000
I just think all the others...
too dry.  OK.

1188
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,000
Wow, what a week.  It's been a
tremendous week.

1189
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,960
So, I know that Stacey has been
really scrapping

1190
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,400
with the Star Baker. Is it possible?

1191
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,120
I think it's certainly possible

1192
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,280
because Stacey has done remarkably
well.

1193
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,600
I just think she attempted slightly
too much.

1194
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,560
Having said that, this was about the
Savoy cake and they tasted amazing.

1195
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,320
However, I think Steven is the
favourite coming into today.

1196
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,840
He did create something that
technically was very good.

1197
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,240
The flowers, perfect. Leaves are
great. The cake is well-made.

1198
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,360
But the chestnut didn't get the
flavour.

1199
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,840
Well, let's focus on ones who are in
trouble.

1200
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,840
Sophie, perhaps, has saved herself.

1201
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,520
Oh, Sophie's definitely saved
herself.

1202
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,640
Nobody who can make a cake like that
can possibly go home.

1203
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,480
So, Liam and Kate are in a bit of
trouble.

1204
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,440
When you look at Kate's, she's used
pretty basic moulds,

1205
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,960
and it's quite rudimentary,
the decoration, as well.

1206
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,120
And she dried out a couple of the
sponges,

1207
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,560
but the pecan one was particularly
good.

1208
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,600
Whereas the elderflower in Liam's
one, you didn't think came through.

1209
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,680
I couldn't taste anything. And then
he put sugar work on something that

1210
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,600
was going to stand for a long period
of time, and it collapsed.

1211
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,200
But she didn't do as well in her
signature as Liam.

1212
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,920
His clangers were very good.  It
seems we keep balancing up things.

1213
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,360
It goes like that all the time.
Yeah, we have to break it down,

1214
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,320
go through the check list again and
then decide.

1215
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,600
There's something lovely, Paul,
about sitting here,

1216
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,760
listening to you talk in front of
the liver bird.

1217
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,280
It's amazing, eh?  There you go.

1218
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,600
You just ate its head.

1219
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,600
It was so pretty up until that
minute.

1220
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,680
Congratulations, bakers, on
surviving Forgotten Bakes week.

1221
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,680
Now, I've got the great job this
week of announcing Star Baker.

1222
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,600
The person who's won Star Baker this
week made clangers

1223
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,720
with their trademark twist,

1224
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,720
and made a Savoy cake that had
fabulous texture and flavour.

1225
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,960
The Star Baker this week is...

1226
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,960
Stacey.

1227
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,480
Thank you.

1228
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,480
So that leaves me with...just the
worst job.

1229
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,760
Well done to all of you for getting
through to the quarterfinals,

1230
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,760
but I'm afraid the person going home
is...

1231
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,000
..Liam.

1232
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It's cool.  I'm so sorry.  It's cool.

1233
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,760
In all fairness, like, I can look
back...

1234
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,320
probably tomorrow morning and
think...

1235
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,720
Yeah. I smashed it.

1236
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,440
Onwards and upwards now.

1237
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,640
It's not the end of me, it's just
the beginning,

1238
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,480
do you know what I mean? So I'm
coming from Paul Hollywood's job

1239
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,120
in a couple of years' time!

1240
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,960
Don't stop baking.

1241
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,280
So sorry to lose Liam.
He's learned a lot.

1242
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,640
From the beginning to now, he's a
different baker,

1243
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,480
totally different baker.

1244
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,600
He's done really well to reach the
quarterfinals.

1245
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,600
He should feel very proud of
himself.

1246
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,600
But he had a bad Showstopper,
and that's what it came down to.

1247
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,920
So glad you did it.

1248
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,560
You've been so close.
Thank you very much.

1249
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,960
Stacey has wanted Star Baker so
badly.

1250
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,800
The last few weeks, she's got closer
and closer.

1251
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,560
And this week, bingo.

1252
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,240
Well done, Stace.  Thank you.

1253
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,840
Well done.  Thank you.

1254
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,760
Coming into the semifinal now.

1255
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,840
This is the time to get Star Baker.

1256
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,920
And she started to nail it this
week.

1257
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,320
Her Savoy cake tasted amazing.

1258
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,160
Did not think I would end up in week
nine, no way.

1259
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,520
Week nine!

1260
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,160
I'd like to say that I'm going to
tone it down for next week,

1261
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,200
but, actually, I'm not. At all.

1262
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,520
Next time...  There's no calming down
today.

1263
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,920
..it's the semifinal.

1264
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,320
The pressure's on.

1265
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,160
Four bakers...  Do you know what?
I'm going to do it the sexy way.

1266
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,840
..three patisserie challenges.

1267
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,160
Oh...  This is insane, look at this.

1268
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,040
Who will crack under the pressure?

1269
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,200
Come along, dear.

1270
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,960
WHISPERS:  I've got no idea what I'm
doing.

1271
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,680
Gold leaf makes everything look
better.

1272
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,440
I've done it wrong, I've done it
wrong.

1273
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,960
And who will make it to the final...

1274
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,280
They look pretty, don't they?

1275
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,880
..of The Great British Bake Off?

1276
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,800
It's been the hardest decision that
I've been involved with

1277
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,640
in eight years of the Bake Off.

1278
00:57:47,640 --> 00:58:15,000
