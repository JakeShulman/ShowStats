00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GBBO S08E01

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,640
Can you see it, Noel?

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,120
I can't see it anywhere.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,440
Big white tent, 12 new bakers.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,680
Sorry, Sue, you did say
white tent, didn't you?

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,800
Where are they, Prue?

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,240
Dunno. They're late.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,240
Maybe we should've
got a minicab?  Hmm.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,520
My daughter applied for me.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,520
This is who I've got
to thank for all this.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,640
My mum said I'm already a winner.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,600
That's such a mum thing to say.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,440
When I saw the tent, my heart
rate went through the roof.

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,440
It's like my wedding day, all over
again, except my wife is not here.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,840
I'm going to be baking in the tent.

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,280
It's got so much history.

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,680
Are you sure I'm not asleep?
Are you sure it's happening?

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,960
Initially, I thought it
was a bit of a fluke!

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,800
I'm not going to lie.

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,080
I don't think I'll believe
it until I see it on telly.

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm ready to go.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,560
12 new bakers...

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,680
My children said,
&quot;Don't get sent home first.&quot;

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,400
If I do, I'm not allowed home.

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,240
NOEL:  30 brand-new challenges,

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,640
set by Paul Hollywood
and our new judge, Prue Leith.

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,400
This year is going
to be very special.

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,000
The bakers may think they know what
I want, but, when it comes to Prue,

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,840
they've absolutely no idea.

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,600
Prue's got 50 years' experience
in the business.

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,040
She'll know what she wants.

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,720
I'll be firm but fair,

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,160
because I want the bakers
to do their very best.

34
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,680
Baking is such a treat,

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,680
but it has to be the very best and
it has to be worth the calories.

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,480
I am always getting frustrated
with myself.

37
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,000
I cannot tell you the amount of
cakes I've thrown away,

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,240
biscuits I've thrown away.

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,040
Technical bakes may unstitch
me. We'll see.

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,920
NOEL:  In 2017, who will win
The Great British Bake Off?

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,040
I am British, but I'm
a proud Scotsman.

42
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,440
So, it would be good to be the first
Scottish Bake Off winner.

43
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,440
I just want to get on with it now
and, erm, burn that first cake.

44
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,400
NOEL:  We're back at the home
of the Bake Off,

45
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,440
Welford Park in Berkshire.

46
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,920
Right, so, I've got a list
of what we have to do.

47
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,560
First, set up theme of the week.

48
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,560
I was thinking a semaine of genoise,
creme patissiere, fraisiers gateaux.

49
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,960
Oh, I love it. What's it mean?

50
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,960
It's cake week.

51
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,320
I'm so excited. We're actually going
to walk into the tent

52
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,440
for the first time.  I know.
I'm a little bit nervous.

53
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,800
I-I don't really do camping.

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,640
Yeah, I don't think we
have to sleep in there.

55
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,880
Oh, OK.

56
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,400
NOEL:  Over the next two days, the
bakers will face three challenges,

57
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,040
after which, one of them will be
named our first Star Baker,

58
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,040
and another will be asked to
leave the Bake Off tent.

59
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,720
Hello, bakers and welcome to
the fabulous Bake Off tent.

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,680
We're all newbies here, well,
apart from ol' blue eyes.

61
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,680
So, let's get baking with your
very first Signature Challenge.

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,240
The judges would love you to make
a family sized fruity cake.

63
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,920
Now, the choice of sponge and,
indeed, fruit is entirely up to you

64
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,480
but it must be fresh fruit.

65
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
No dried fruit allowed.

66
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,920
Basically, what we're saying
is if it was a fruit party,

67
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,040
sultanas would not be
on the guest list.

68
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,760
You have two hours to
make your fruity cake.

69
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,680
Do you want to do it?
Shall we do it together?

70
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,680
BOTH: On your marks.
Get set. Bake!

71
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,600
Plain flour.

72
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,040
The reason why the fruity cake
challenge is such a great signature

73
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,480
to start off the series with

74
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,120
is because it really tests
the bakers' knowledge

75
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,720
of baking in its purest form.

76
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,240
How much moisture is that
fruit going to release?

77
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,680
What that does is make the inside
of the cake quite soggy,

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,960
so what's difficult to judge
is when it's baked properly.

79
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,320
When you stick a skewer in
to see if the cake is done,

80
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,920
the skewer may well come out wet

81
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,080
because it's hit a piece
of fresh fruit,

82
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,040
and you will be fooled into thinking
that the cake isn't done.

83
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,400
It's not a very easy
start to Bake Off.

84
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,880
Morning. How are you doing?  Hello,
James.  Good to see you all.

85
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,560
Tell us what you're doing.
So, I'm making a rhubarb,

86
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,280
orange and ginger cake and it's
got a crumble topping as well.

87
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,000
Takes me back to my childhood where
we used to have rhubarb crumbles

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,160
on a Sunday lunchtime.

89
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,120
That looks like proper rhubarb
out of a garden.

90
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,360
It is. Picked fresh from my
allotment, yeah.

91
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,880
Oh, how fantastic.  So, my dad
is the magpie of rhubarb.

92
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,240
Every time I go up the allotment,

93
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,040
he's nicked someone else's chunk of
rhubarb and he keeps growing it,

94
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,360
so he's...  Do the rest of the
allotment know that, James?

95
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,640
Oh, shh, don't tell anyone.

96
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,120
They do now!

97
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,920
Married dad of two,
James is a finance manager

98
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,520
from Brentwood in Essex.

99
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,040
He's been baking and gardening with
his dad, Brian, since he was five.

100
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,520
Put your back into it. Anyone would
think you're getting old.

101
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,600
His signature fruity
cake has a whopping 600g

102
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,320
of rhubarb in the sponge.

103
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,040
How are you cooking the rhubarb?

104
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,600
It's all going to be mixed in raw.

105
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,000
It'll cook for about an hour,
so it should soften up nicely.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It should be a little squashy.

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,560
Yeah, it does get a little...

108
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,760
juicy, shall we say.
Don't give too much away, James!

109
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,680
Oh, yeah. The judges are here.

110
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,720
NOEL:  For the first challenge of
this year's Great British Bake Off,

111
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,440
four of our new bakers have chosen
a great British ingredient.

112
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,720
Apple.

113
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,120
My grandma, she used to make
really good apple cake.

114
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,360
I used to call her Buzz, cos she
had a hearing aid that buzzed.

115
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,800
And I always used to call her,
every so often, Granny Smith.

116
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
I decided to name it after her.

117
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,920
Better than calling it buzz-cake!

118
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,520
NOEL:  Stacey lives in Hertfordshire,

119
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,720
with her husband, James, and
is a stay-at-home mum to her sons

120
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,440
Max, Zane, and Ethan.

121
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,480
Thank you. A pleasure.
THE OTHERS LAUGH

122
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,120
NOEL:  Her apple and walnut cake
contains five large Granny Smiths.

123
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,720
There's an awful lot
of apples in this.

124
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,560
Got to make sure that they're
all blended in nicely.

125
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,560
I'm making an apple crumble cake.

126
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,800
It's inspired by my sister's
lack of a sweet tooth.

127
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,960
This is for you, sister.

128
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,480
Liam is a student from
Hackney in east London.

129
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,160
At 19, he's this year's
youngest baker,

130
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,880
but he's already passing on
his skills to his nephews,

131
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,240
Chamari and Lakwan.

132
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,280
Happy?

133
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,240
His crumble-topped apple
loaf cake is lightly spiced

134
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,720
with nutmeg and cinnamon.

135
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,080
Why did you choose a loaf tin
and not a shallower tin?

136
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,760
It makes the baking more difficult.

137
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,680
But I like loaves.

138
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,440
That's bread.  You like
the shape of it?

139
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,520
It's not... Yeah, I like
the shape of loaves.

140
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,920
Liam, just say it's
always been perfect.

141
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,200
Flake of almonds, icing sugar, done.

142
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,040
And &quot;done&quot; - I like that!

143
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,680
Liam, I love the confidence.

144
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,160
Thank you.  It's terrific.

145
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,680
NOEL:  One Signature Bake is the
product of a weekend in Amsterdam,

146
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,120
resulting in an unusual
choice of fruit.

147
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,920
As I do, I go around all
the bakeries possible,

148
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,320
and there was some
lemon and courgette

149
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,480
and I fell in love with it.

150
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,480
And, technically, everything that's
got seeds in, is a fruit.

151
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,600
NOEL:  Russian-born Julia
lives in West Sussex

152
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,400
and bakes while Skyping her nan

153
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,400
back in her hometown
of Kemerovo, Siberia.

154
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,160
Her cake will also be filled with
blueberries and lemon curd

155
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,680
but there's already a problem
with her courgettes.

156
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,640
I meant to squeeze my courgettes
before I put them in.

157
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,440
I would keep that quiet.  Yeah.

158
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,760
How do you squeeze the moisture
out of a courgette?

159
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,160
Basically, you just put it
in...  Do you just wring it?

160
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,720
Basically, you have to grate it
first, and put it in a tea towel,

161
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,920
and squeeze it.  OK.  But...

162
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,080
So, you do know how to do it, you
just forgot?  I do know.

163
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,800
Just deny it. If they say, &quot;Have you
not squeezed the moisture out of

164
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,520
&quot;this courgette?&quot;  Yeah, I have.
Say, &quot;Of course I have.&quot;

165
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,920
I'm just not strong enough.

166
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,560
Elsewhere in the tent,
there has been squeezing.

167
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,240
I'm not doing too crazy.
I don't want to squash it.

168
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,160
Sophie is a former Army officer

169
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,880
from West Molesey in Surrey.

170
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,960
She'll sandwich her squeezed
pineapple and coconut sponges

171
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,480
with coconut Italian
meringue buttercream.

172
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,800
I just want to avoid too much
leakage into the batter.

173
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,280
Done it without before, it was fine.

174
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,480
It's just a precaution, really.

175
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,680
NOEL:  She's not the only baker
that's headed for the tropics.

176
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,560
I'm making a coconut cake.

177
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,320
My wife and my daughter love it,

178
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,360
but my son doesn't like anything
with bits inside it.

179
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,080
NOEL:  Peter is an IT manager
and bakes every Sunday

180
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,720
for his local church
in Southend-on-Sea.

181
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,880
That looks awesome.

182
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,840
NOEL:  As well as fresh coconut,
he's using coconut flour,

183
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,680
coconut milk, and coconut sugar.

184
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,800
I don't think you can ever
get enough coconut,

185
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
unless the cake screams,
&quot;Oh, leave me.

186
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,600
&quot;I've had enough coconut.
I'm tired!&quot;

187
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,280
HE LAUGHS

188
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,640
NOEL:  And we have a third
fruity cake castaway.

189
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm making a mango and
pineapple sponge.

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,120
Good for us, really, isn't
it, all this fruit?

191
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,600
NOEL:  Chris is a software engineer
from Somerset.

192
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,240
He's used a spreadsheet to calculate
the perfect balance

193
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,840
of mango and pineapple
in his unique sponge.

194
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,000
There's no butter in it and
there's...  No butter?

195
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,480
No butter at all.  No oil,
no marg, no butter?

196
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,040
Correct. Nothing at all.

197
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,800
How many eggs?  Just two.

198
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,240
Two?  Mm. Cook for 33 minutes.

199
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,160
You must have a tremendous amount
of fruit in there, then.

200
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,040
Yes, because the whole point
is that we can taste it.

201
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,160
Yeah, solid.

202
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,600
Going to put it in the oven.

203
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,800
I wonder if there's a countdown
clock anywhere.

204
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,880
I'm not sure how quickly
it's going to bake.

205
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,640
I'm just making sure I've
got an even amount in both tins.

206
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,960
You've got to be precise
on the Bake Off.

207
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,160
Mwah.  It's going in at
160, for 45 minutes.

208
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,160
TIMERS BEEP

209
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,640
Calm.

210
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,840
Cross my fingers.

211
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,640
And start.

212
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,880
We'll see how it goes.

213
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,880
Bakers, you've got one hour
left on your fruity cakes.

214
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,080
How long is your cake going
to be in the oven for?

215
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,680
It could to be up to 75 minutes.

216
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm hoping an hour.  Yeah,
that's the same with me.

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,520
NOEL:  The baking time for a fruity
cake can be a complete mystery.

218
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,120
The longer you look at
it, the more it cooks.

219
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,240
NOEL:  As the temperature in
the sponge rises,

220
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,040
it's hard to tell how much moisture
the fruit will release...

221
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,480
..and how long the wetter batter
will take to bake.

222
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,480
SHE HUMS

223
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, God. It isn't baking
the way I feel it should be.

224
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,800
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

225
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,120
No, your... Your red light's
got to be on.

226
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,560
Oh, for crying out loud!

227
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,680
Because if the light's not
on, the oven's not on.  OK.

228
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,720
Thank you, Stacey!

229
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,200
I had it written on my hand.

230
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,000
&quot;Make sure the oven's on.&quot;

231
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,800
Yan is a biomedical
scientist for the NHS

232
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,840
and spends her weekends
playing football

233
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,320
in her hometown of Enfield
in north London.

234
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,480
Yes!

235
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,400
Her team-mates' favourite apple
and cinnamon cake has a crumble

236
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,040
topping drizzled in caramel.

237
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,520
It was sitting in residual heat,
so, the crumble's gone all soft.

238
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,640
It's just a puddle of fat.

239
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,240
Let's make this again.

240
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,720
Luckily, I've got apples
and crumble...

241
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,640
..as a contingency.

242
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,520
NOEL:  While Yan has to
start all over again...

243
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,600
Oh!

244
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,280
..Flo has moved on to her
fillings and decorations.

245
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,120
It's, erm, a citrus cake and I'm
doing a lemon curd filling.

246
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,600
Is that a &quot;lemon caird&quot; filling?
Lemon... Lemon curd!

247
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,640
ALL LAUGH

248
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,040
Stop it!  I'll be a translator.

249
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,800
It's good you've got a
friend now.  Stop it!

250
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,680
NOEL:  Grandmother Flo,
from Liverpool,

251
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,800
sometimes helps out at
her son's restaurant,

252
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,640
but gets most enjoyment
baking for her family.

253
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,120
Why don't I get invited to
your houses for a meal?

254
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,240
I ain't got one.  Cos you're
the best at it.

255
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,400
NOEL:  Her children had to help
her type up her recipe

256
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,120
for a triple-layered citrus cake,

257
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,480
filled with fresh oranges
and lemons.

258
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,760
Me daughter put little messages
on the bottom of it.

259
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,120
&quot;Well done, Mum!&quot; Aw!

260
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,680
&quot;We love you!&quot;

261
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm nervous as anything.  Are
you? Oh, don't be nervous.

262
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,480
Nothing to worry about it.
I can always ask you to help me,

263
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,560
can't I?  Yeah.

264
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,560
I'll say no!  I know!  But you
could always ask.  I know.

265
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,680
While making a second sponge
has cost Yan valuable time...

266
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,960
..Tom is spending precious minutes
giving his fruity cake

267
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,240
an expensive makeover.

268
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,240
I wouldn't want to just put
a pear on the top of a cake.

269
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,200
Tom is an architect and
sports fanatic from Edinburgh.

270
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,240
Yes!

271
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,240
His golden pear will top a triple
tiered pear and blackberry cake.

272
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,760
It's just going to be mottled,
rustic effect.

273
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,720
It's not the sort of thing
I do very often.

274
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,080
Tom's gilded pear will
have some stiff competition.

275
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,720
I've got me little cut-out pattern,
erm, so, I'm going to put it

276
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
over the top of the cake,
and then I'm going to use

277
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,640
freeze dried strawberries,
and then do, like,

278
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,000
a fresh fruit garnish round it.

279
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,560
So, you made that yourself?
It took ages.

280
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,440
NOEL:  Kate is a health
and safety inspector

281
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,000
and a keen amateur blacksmith
from Knowsley, Merseyside.

282
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,080
Her intricate, stencilled
finish will top

283
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,240
three layers of strawberry
and rose sponge.

284
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,000
I love the combination
of rose and strawberry.

285
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,840
How are you going to make sure that
one doesn't dominate the other?

286
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,640
Hopefully, I'm going to layer it
with some

287
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,600
strawberries going through.
Well, good luck.

288
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,240
Thank you.  Thank you.

289
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,440
When it comes to fillings
and decorations...

290
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,040
Mm. I don't know what he's doing,
but I want to dip my finger in it.

291
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,120
..Stephen is going further
than anyone else.

292
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,440
Toffee sauce. Then, after
that, we're going to

293
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,000
crystallise the citrus rind.

294
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,600
I'm going to mix up the mascarpone,
cinnamon, and icing sugar,

295
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,080
and then, erm...

296
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,760
I probably should read my
instructions really, shouldn't I?

297
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,280
Stephen is a marketing
executive from Watford.

298
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,440
His mum, Judy, began teaching
him to bake when he was three.

299
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,920
Are you in ounces?

300
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes!  What year is this?

301
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
For his Bonfire Night apple cake,

302
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,400
he's planning a spectacular
final flourish,

303
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,200
straight from his mum's recipe book.

304
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,360
What's happening here?  So,
it's...  It's like some

305
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,400
bizarre game of chess.

306
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,920
I love it.  Every Bonfire Night,
Mum would make us toffee apples.

307
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,440
So, these are done by taking a melon
baller, small piece of apple,

308
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,000
dip the toffee, hang them upside
down. They'll leave a trail of

309
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,400
toffee, which, when turned the
right way up, will look like

310
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,520
the flames of a fire.  Oh, wow.
Yeah, I know. Amazing.

311
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,240
I think I'm in love with you.
Of course, if it doesn't work...

312
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,600
Already?

313
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,640
Bong!

314
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,400
Bakers, you have 30 minutes left
to make your fruity cakes.

315
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,080
Does the pan not make
a noise? Is it...

316
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,640
DULL BONG
Oh, yes, you are better.

317
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,080
It's always a tricky one,
whether to open it or not.

318
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,360
Let's do it. Let's be brave.

319
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,240
Testing the bake
on a fruity cake...

320
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,840
It's all very serious
and quiet in here, now.

321
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,360
..can be a total lottery.

322
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,120
Kind of Russian roulette
of rhubarb.

323
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,600
You don't want to mistake, like,
the juice from the apple

324
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,840
for underbaked sponge.

325
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,800
Just one sec, sorry. I think
that's apple on the skewer.

326
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,920
Okey dokey.

327
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,800
NOEL:  Whilst those making sandwich
cakes with separate sponges...

328
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,440
We're all good.  ..should
need less baking time...

329
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,680
Oh, look at them babies.

330
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,840
..for those baking one large cake...

331
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,360
Absolutely nowhere near ready.

332
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,040
..this first Signature Challenge...

333
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,240
Cheers!  ..is about
to get even harder.

334
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,840
You've got no cake, there, have you?

335
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,760
Hm?  You've got no cake, there?  Yeah,
I don't, it's just apple, isn't it?

336
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,480
It's supposed to be out in four
minutes. Not a chance in hell.

337
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,000
I shouldn't have gone for a loaf!

338
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,680
There's nothing I can do now.

339
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Should've just went for a sandwich.

340
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,720
Pants.

341
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,960
TIMER BEEPS

342
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,480
OK, there's the magic bleep.

343
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,800
It's just a sponge.

344
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,800
No-one's going to die.

345
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,720
Oh!  Unless the bakers have
left enough remaining time

346
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,080
for their cakes to cool...

347
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,520
I'm not panicking. It's all good.

348
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,520
..they won't be able to fill or
decorate them in time for judging.

349
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,200
Nearly done, that.

350
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,640
What's your problem, that you
need these to cool down?  Yeah.

351
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,560
You never know, I might
go on the first one.  No.

352
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,400
Think you're going to be all right?
Deep breaths.  So, what do you think

353
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,840
about your new job?
HE LAUGHS

354
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,440
I don't think I'm going
to be all right.

355
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,760
I think you're going to be fine.

356
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,200
I think we should swap.  No, no.
I think you'll be around.

357
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,120
15 minutes to go.

358
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,840
I'm going to turn the oven up.

359
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,040
Come on.

360
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,400
Oh, nice.

361
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,480
SHE SIGHS

362
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,200
Not too shabby.

363
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Crystallised oranges to
go on top of the cake.

364
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,400
Just grind up the freeze-dried
strawberry pieces into

365
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,400
a really fine powder.

366
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,800
Oh!

367
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,800
HE SIGHS

368
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,840
My heart's going now.

369
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,480
They're nice and crispy.

370
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,920
They'll have to go on.

371
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,400
All's I've got to do is decorate
the top, and then I'll be fine.

372
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,360
Has anyone got a small
sieve I could borrow?

373
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,360
My God. Thank you very much.

374
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,080
Fingers crossed this works.

375
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,280
Right, that'll do.

376
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,680
That's as good as it'll get.

377
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,160
Are you finished?  Yeah.

378
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,880
You?  Ah.

379
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,400
Right, bakers, you have two minutes

380
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,600
to bring this to a fruity
conclusion,

381
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,240
and, you know, who
doesn't want that?

382
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,440
I don't think I'm going to
get my apples done in time.

383
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,160
SHE SIGHS

384
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,160
Fingers crossed.

385
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,280
I just pray that it's baked.

386
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,040
Oh.  I haven't got time
to muck about.

387
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,520
Come on.

388
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Shizzle is nizzling.

389
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,640
Oh, no!

390
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,640
I've lost some bottom.

391
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,240
What do you need, mate?
Do you need icing sugar?

392
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,360
That's it.

393
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,880
Yeah.  Let's wipe down.  OK. All
right. Whisk, whisk, whisk.

394
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,800
If I tuck it under,
don't tell anyone.

395
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Bakers, you've got one minute.

396
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,720
There there's just so much
moisture out of the rhubarb.

397
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,720
You're good?  Yeah, solid.

398
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,040
Dripping all over the place.

399
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,640
Bakers, your time's up.

400
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,920
Looks gorgeous.

401
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,920
Your first challenge is over.

402
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Well done.
HE LAUGHS

403
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,720
Can I just, like...  No, it's fine.
Don't touch it.

404
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,440
Like, the middle, though...  Don't
touch it! Don't touch it! Liam!

405
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,880
I've made such a mess.
I'm so sorry.  Oh, my God!

406
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:32,000
Look at the state of this place!

407
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,960
The bakers will now face
the judgment of Prue and Paul

408
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,960
for the very first time.

409
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,520
Hello.  Hiya.

410
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,200
I think you've lost
a little bit of the stencil.

411
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,120
I always have a slight problem
with things you're not going to eat.

412
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,880
Nobody's going to eat a marigold.

413
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,880
My favourite bit.  Oh, God!

414
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,520
Or perhaps it's not!
Is that all right?

415
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,520
It tasted like a clown's nose.

416
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,480
The cake is all rose water.

417
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,840
It's not what we wanted
in a FRUITY cake.

418
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,840
It's a rose cake.
Style above substance.

419
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,880
How much baking powder
did you put in there?

420
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,560
Five teaspoons.

421
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,840
Yeah, it's burning my tongue.

422
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,440
Before the baking powder hits you,
you get a really nice, yes,

423
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,800
coconut flavour.

424
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,560
If somebody said to me

425
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,600
you're going to put a whole pear
on top of the cake,

426
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,280
I would have said,
&quot;No, that's silly&quot; -

427
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,560
but it actually looks very striking.

428
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,560
I think you have overbaked
the cakes, for sure.

429
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,280
It's a little bit heavy.  I meant to
squeeze a bit of juice out of it,

430
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,520
and then I forgot.  You forgot.

431
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,120
Well, you're a nice, honest girl.

432
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,720
I told you not to tell them!

433
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,720
I couldn't lie!

434
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,880
I think it looks great.
It looks well-baked.

435
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,680
I love the candied fruit on top
of that.

436
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,840
You finished quite early,
didn't you?

437
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,200
I did, yeah.  You were sitting there.
I kicked myself.  Why?

438
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
I left the lemon curd in the fridge.

439
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,640
Lemon curd in the fridge?  Yeah.

440
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,680
OK. Let's have a look.
Here we go. Oh, dear!

441
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,080
Mm! That is good sponge.

442
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,160
Loads of orange flavour
coming through.  Oh, good.

443
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,280
Do you know? I think there's
enough citrus in there.

444
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,720
Lemon curd is lovely, but unless
you are very restrained about it,

445
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,680
and only put the thinnest layer,
it would have been overpowering.

446
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,200
It's nice, that, Flo.
I'm awful pleased.

447
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,200
It's a shame about the lemon curd.

448
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,360
I have never heard of a sponge cake

449
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,000
with no fat in it,
with only two eggs.

450
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,800
I think your sponge is baked
to perfection.

451
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,040
Well, I tell you what.

452
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,480
It's got flavour. Texture,
not right in the middle,

453
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,480
because it all got squashed.  OK.

454
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,040
It is a bit stodgy.

455
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,040
It's a bit boring.  Oh, God.

456
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,320
I'm not getting a huge amount
of flavour through.

457
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
I'm getting the sponge
and I'm getting an apple.

458
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,440
Not light as air,
but it is a good sponge.

459
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,600
I think you got away with it,

460
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,520
considering that was your
second one, as well.

461
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,760
I'll take that as a win.
THEY LAUGH

462
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,760
Maybe a draw.  Yeah.

463
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,160
It looks absolutely delicious.

464
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,440
Thank you.
I love the sunflower flames,

465
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,440
and the shine of the toffee
is perfect.

466
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,920
Beautifully baked.  Thank you.

467
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,600
To get that texture of apple,
which is just slightly soft,

468
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,160
and you have those gorgeous warming
spices coming through.

469
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,840
The combination of flavours
is perfect.

470
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,120
I mean, it's just like
a little sum-up of autumn.

471
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,840
Thank you.
Very well thought through.

472
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,920
Well done. Well done.

473
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,920
Very good.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.
WHISPERS:  Nailed it!

474
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,240
Well done.  Thank you.

475
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,400
It looks as if the apple
has sunk a little.

476
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,480
The bake's OK,
but I get a hint of cinnamon.

477
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,480
I'm not convinced that
the whole thing together works.

478
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,760
I think it does look
a little bit rustic.

479
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,120
It's just mud.  Wet in the middle.

480
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,200
It's been flooded with water all the
time.  Yeah.

481
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,360
..while it's in the oven.

482
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,360
Nothing that a lot of custard
wouldn't help.

483
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,400
It's very neat. The piping's good.

484
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Oh, look at that sponge.

485
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,920
I think that texture's lovely.

486
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,120
Pineapple flavour
comes walloping through.

487
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,120
You must have dried the pineapple
a bit, did you?  Yes. Yeah, yeah.

488
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,440
That's delicious.
I mean, it really is.

489
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,320
Oh, my gosh, wow.  The pineapple that
comes through there is delicious,

490
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,680
and that silkiness that comes
from the Italian meringue,

491
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,880
it just works so well with that.
Wow. Thank you so much.

492
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,880
I'll have another piece of that.
No, you can't.  Well done.  Thank you.

493
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,360
Gosh!

494
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,720
When he sort of...

495
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
I was like, &quot;No! It can't be!&quot;

496
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,880
I am worried I might have peaked
a bit too soon.

497
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,480
When he put his hand out,
I thought he was going to hit me.

498
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,240
I know it's not pretty, but I was
hoping that it would hit the spot.

499
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,080
It's the Peter Beardsley of cakes.

500
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,080
Oh, my... Agh!

501
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The Bakers were able to practise
for the first challenge.

502
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,080
Every week, their second
will be a gingham-clad mystery.

503
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,920
Bakers! Now it's time for
your first Technical Challenge.

504
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,320
Today, set for you
by the lovely Prue.

505
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,760
Prue, any advice to the Bakers?

506
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,920
Well, all I can say
is it's a bit fiddly.

507
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,360
Right. As this challenge
is judged blind,

508
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,840
I'm going to have to ask
these guys to go.

509
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,680
No, not you.  What? I just wanted
to see where they go.

510
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,960
No, we've got work to do.  OK.

511
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,720
We have to set the very first
Technical Challenge,

512
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,720
which today involves Prue wanting
you to make 12 chocolate mini rolls.

513
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,160
That's 144
of these childhood favourites,

514
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,440
each one of which needs to have
a delicate chocolate sponge,

515
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,440
a swirl of peppermint buttercream,
and covered in chocolate -

516
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,480
but, cheekily, do not worry
about leaving a bare bottom.

517
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,280
You have two hours.

518
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,720
On your marks.  Get set.

519
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,960
Bake!

520
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,400
Oh, my God!

521
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,960
To make the chocolate mini rolls,

522
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,520
the bakers have all been given
the same ingredients,

523
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,440
from Prue's pared down recipe.

524
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,920
The instructions are vague,
a bit like me.

525
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,040
I've made a Swiss roll a couple
of weeks ago, so to me,

526
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,840
it's just lots of little
Swiss rolls.

527
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,760
I've never made a mini roll ever
in my life, why would you?

528
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,200
Prue, why have you chosen
chocolate mini rolls?

529
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,200
They are very familiar to everybody,
so they seem like an easy cake.

530
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,520
In fact, they are
very difficult to do.

531
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,800
They must look identical and neat.

532
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,760
Inside, soft chocolate sponge -

533
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,920
because there's no flour in it,
there is no baking powder.

534
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,920
You are relying entirely on the
egg whites to rise the sponge -

535
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,640
and there is peppermint buttercream,

536
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,120
which if you put too much essence
in, it tastes like toothpaste -

537
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,640
and it must make a perfect swirl.

538
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,280
Altogether, not an easy task.

539
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,920
That's delicious to eat -
very chocolaty sponge,

540
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,800
with that flavour of peppermint,
but not too much.

541
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,400
Let's see what they're made of -

542
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,360
and all I can say is I have
more difficult challenges to come.

543
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,920
Charming.

544
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,520
The recipe is telling me that I
have to...  Make a paste with cocoa,

545
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,280
butter...  One teaspoonful
of vanilla extract.

546
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,600
Four tablespoons of water.

547
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,280
It's looking like it should be
the right consistency.

548
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,640
My first bake wasn't brilliant,

549
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,000
so I need to pull it back a bit
with this one.

550
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,360
And then the next instruction,

551
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
whisk the egg yolks
with two thirds of the sugar.

552
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,720
SHE WARBLES HER TONGUE

553
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,280
And then mix egg yolks
with the paste.

554
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,440
Lovely jubbly.  Whisk the egg whites
with the remaining sugar.

555
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,680
This is getting enough air into the
egg whites

556
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,680
to give it a really nice,
light texture.

557
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,560
That'll do.

558
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,240
Gently folding in.

559
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,480
Nice and smooth,
but still plenty of body.

560
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,480
Cos the egg is the only raising
agent in this.

561
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,440
If you miss that step out, then
I think you could be in trouble.

562
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,440
Whisk in the egg whites
to the remaining sugar.

563
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,120
How are you feeling
after the first one?

564
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,280
Nah. So if I come in table for this,
it should be all right.

565
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,200
Going in.  Go.

566
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,920
Big breath. Big breath.

567
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,120
Here goes.

568
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,200
It says 12-20,
but that's pretty vague.

569
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,920
I don't know, I don't know.

570
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,080
I'm going to do 12 minutes,

571
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,840
cos as soon as they lose
that moisture,

572
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,360
they'll just crack as they roll.

573
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,000
See you in 12.

574
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,160
This isn't right.

575
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,600
You see, this isn't right...

576
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,600
and I can't work out
what I'm not doing right, actually.

577
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,080
Maybe it's supposed to be like that.

578
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,800
What's next?
Got to make the buttercream.

579
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,640
Is that something
you've done before?  I'm joking!

580
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,160
You're still joking, that's good!

581
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,400
Yeah, but joking can only
get you so far.

582
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,840
Thanks a lot!

583
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,000
It doesn't say how
much peppermint essence to put in.

584
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,280
Start off by doing
a quarter of a teaspoon.

585
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,840
I just put in a...
and then I'll see.

586
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,000
The flavour is not too overpowering.

587
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It needs a bit more.

588
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,040
It doesn't taste like toothpaste.

589
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Bakers, you are halfway through
the making of your mini marvels.

590
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,280
I just want to get to the point
where they are quite flexible.

591
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,720
They don't look done at all.

592
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,080
Any time soon.
Slightly sinking in one bit.

593
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,280
Let's be done, guys.

594
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,760
I don't know if I should
do it again or not.

595
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,240
Flat as a pancake.

596
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,240
So, I've started again.

597
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,120
I'm starting again as well.
Nothing like a bit of stress.

598
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,120
OK...

599
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,800
It's a little bit rubbery.

600
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,120
I want to redo my sponges.

601
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,440
I think I didn't
fold it in very well, maybe.

602
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,040
That looks disgusting, doesn't it?

603
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,160
Do think I need to mix it
for a bit longer?

604
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,640
Try not to lose the air.

605
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,080
Yep. Quite happy with those.

606
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,200
Second time lucky.

607
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,160
Melt the plain
and milk chocolate together.

608
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,840
Got dark and milk chocolate in here.
It'll be nice.

609
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,160
It's a chocolate feast!

610
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,720
That is pure...

611
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,360
Wow. I can actually feel my hips
widening as we do it.

612
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,680
Is that good?  Well, it's a thing.

613
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,680
OK.  And the white chocolate
is presumably drizzled over?

614
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,680
I made a mistake.

615
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,600
I've put white chocolates
in the milk chocolate.

616
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,920
See if I can do something with it.

617
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,480
See you again in 12 minutes.

618
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,680
You've got half an hour left
on your mini rolls.

619
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,080
Here.

620
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,600
He's bowled over.

621
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,400
Spread the filling
over the cool sponges.

622
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,160
I've got to make sure there's
even spreading of the buttercream.

623
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,000
Make sure I get right to the edges,
I want the nice tight curl.

624
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,600
OK, so... Roll from each short
so that it meets in the middle.

625
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,960
Roll it like that.
Roll it the other way.

626
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,320
And then cut that in half,

627
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,720
and then do the same thing
with the other one.

628
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,480
I've just scored it a little bit
to try and get it nice and tight.

629
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,200
Using the piece of paper to help me.

630
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,760
Just making sure
that the roll is tight.

631
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,760
It is fiddly.

632
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,120
It's all sticking.

633
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,480
I didn't realise that it would be
this much pressure.

634
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,080
Relief!

635
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,480
Happier with the rise on these.

636
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,240
They are looking absolutely awful.

637
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,400
Cut into 12 mini rolls.

638
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,000
The length is 20cm.

639
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,360
That doesn't divide.
But the edges are not neat,

640
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,360
so take a centimetre off each side,
and it works out, 6cm each.

641
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,600
Hopefully, you'll have
a perfect little spiral

642
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,920
and it'll be nice and tight.
HE LAUGHS

643
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,720
Oh, well. Put those ones
to the bottom.

644
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,720
They've got a nice whirl inside,
so at least that's something.

645
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,800
Ooh, didn't cut it even.

646
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,120
Right. Here we go.

647
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,920
It just says, &quot;Cover the rolls,
leaving the bases uncovered.&quot;

648
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,720
How are you going to pour
your chocolate?

649
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,040
Are you going to pour it on,
or are you going to dip it?

650
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,200
Because we are allowed an exposed
bottom, I will just pour it all on.

651
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,440
If there's an opportunity
to keep the bottom exposed,

652
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,920
we should all embrace that.

653
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,080
I'm planning on taking
my trousers off,

654
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,920
and Paul and Prue do the judging.

655
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,800
Just trying to ladle it over.

656
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,120
How long have you got left?
You tell them five minutes,

657
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,200
cos I don't want to make them
stressed, but you can.

658
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,920
OK, bakers,
you've got five minutes left.

659
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,360
What he said.

660
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,400
Use the white chocolate
to decorate it

661
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,280
in some unspecified way.

662
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,520
I'm thinking quite simple,
just some sort of lines.

663
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,520
Oh, shaky hands!

664
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,200
I don't have any time.

665
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,800
WHISPERS:  This is dangerous.

666
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,360
Looks are deceiving, aren't they?

667
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,200
My hands are shaking so much.
Oh, God.

668
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,760
Such a mess.

669
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,440
OK, bakers, your time is up.

670
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,320
Please bring
your mini chocolate rolls up

671
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,520
and put them behind your photo.

672
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,760
Paul and Prue are expecting
12 identical mini rolls

673
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,040
filled with a perfect swirl

674
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,480
of delicately flavoured
peppermint buttercream -

675
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,000
and they'll have no idea
whose is whose.

676
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,680
THUNDER RUMBLES

677
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,680
Oh, my God, I'm all shaky.

678
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,520
Hm.  Should we start from this side?

679
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,800
It's not perfect.
There is white chocolate on the top,

680
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,680
and they're all fairly even in size.
Yes.

681
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Let's have a look.
It's got a proper swirl.

682
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,840
The sponge is good.  The peppermint
is a little bit strong.  Mm.

683
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,160
This is certainly rougher.

684
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,000
They haven't been cut properly.

685
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,280
Very nice swirl.

686
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:38,280
That sponge looks good.

687
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,320
Good.  The peppermint is good
in that one.

688
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,880
It's a shame they look
the way they do.

689
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,760
I know, because
it's really good inside.

690
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,080
They're quite small,
so there should be a good swirl.

691
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,880
Look at that.  Interesting.

692
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,840
The sponge is actually
not very spongy.

693
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,280
It's just more like a ganache
than a sponge.  Yeah.

694
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,280
These look a little bit messy.
But I quite like the feathering.

695
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,720
Needed a bit longer in the oven,
that one, I think.

696
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,360
This one's decided to use
a different colour of chocolate.

697
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
We did ask for white chocolate.

698
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,480
Not getting the peppermint
in that one.  No.

699
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,560
Very neat,
and the chocolate is very good.

700
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,480
Nice swirl. Got a bit
of a hit of peppermint.

701
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,480
The sponge is nice, as well.
I think this is a very good one.

702
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,280
Right, moving on to this.

703
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,040
This is art. This is definitely art.

704
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,440
I rather like it.

705
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,520
Not much of a swirl,
this is a sort of C.

706
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,280
Too much mint.
Now these are actually quite neat.

707
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,840
I like the white chocolate
on the top.

708
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,240
Nicely coated, as well.

709
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,240
All the same size.  Let's have a look
and see what it is like inside.

710
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,040
Oh, dear.  Solid bit of cream,
no swirl.

711
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,160
That is a shame.
This is not a pretty sight.

712
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,520
The ends haven't been covered,

713
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,560
the white chocolate has been blobbed
on the top from about ten foot,

714
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,480
I reckon. Interesting swirl.

715
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,160
The sponge has not been cooked
enough,

716
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,560
so it's very squashed and thin.

717
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,040
These look neater. Equal in size.

718
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,000
There is a little bit of a swirl
in there.

719
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
The sponge is very good.

720
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,560
This looks quite neat, as well.

721
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,880
Mostly the same size.

722
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,280
Not too much of a swirl.

723
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,040
For me, there's a little bit
too much mint.

724
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,480
Sort of feathered.
Chunky monkeys, aren't they?

725
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,840
We're looking for more of a swirl
in the peppermint.

726
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,360
The sponge isn't too bad at all.  No.

727
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,880
It looks a little denser than it is.

728
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,720
THUNDER RUMBLES

729
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,600
Prue and Paul have made
their decision.

730
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,160
In 12th place is...this one.

731
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,000
Whose is this?  They might be mine.

732
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,440
Right. They were still raw.

733
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,280
This one is number 11.

734
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,160
Stacey. Your sponge mixture
wasn't cooked properly.

735
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,960
In tenth place is this one.

736
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,400
Why have we got a milk chocolate
on the top, not white?

737
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,360
It was just a mistake.

738
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,640
Flo is ninth. Liam, eighth.

739
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,520
Tom, seventh. Stephen, sixth.

740
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,080
Sophie, fifth. And Yan is forth.

741
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,000
And third place we have this one.

742
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Very well done, Julia.
Lovely swirl. Excellent.

743
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,440
And in second place...is this one.

744
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,080
Whose is this? Well done.

745
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,520
Thank you.  Very neat,
love the white lines on the top.

746
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,560
Thank you.  So, in the first place,

747
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,680
it has to be Kate.

748
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,720
They're all the same size,
swirl is there,

749
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,400
the peppermint flavour
is finely balanced, well done.

750
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,480
Thank you.

751
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,720
Well done!

752
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,600
Happier than this morning.
Do you know what?

753
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,680
I don't mind mini rolls,

754
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,680
but I don't think I'll ever make
a rose cake ever again!

755
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,000
I don't think anyone has any idea

756
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,600
quite what the tent
does to you in there.

757
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,240
I don't want to be out week one.
That would be absolutely gutting.

758
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,280
Definitely not.

759
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:40,000
Stern talking to myself tonight.
Serious talks.

760
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,840
One challenge remaining
before someone is crowned

761
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,440
this year's first Star Baker

762
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,440
and another is the first to leave
the Bake Off tent.

763
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,680
Bakers, welcome back to your first
Showstopper Challenge.

764
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,680
Today, Prue and Paul would love you
to make an illusion cake,

765
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,680
a cake designed to trick the eye

766
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,280
into thinking
it's anything but a cake.

767
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,920
It has to have the same flavour
of sponge throughout,

768
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,560
and the size and shape
must be to scale.

769
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,280
So maybe don't make
a woolly mammoth.

770
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,360
Yes, pace yourselves,
maybe not week one.

771
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,280
All the decoration
needs to be edible,

772
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,960
and you've got four hours to create

773
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,080
your spectacular show-stopping
illusions.

774
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,360
On your marks...  Get set...  Bake!

775
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,880
Making a cake that doesn't look like
a cake is the most complex

776
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,560
Showstopper Challenge ever set

777
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,320
in the first week
of The Great British Bake Off.

778
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,840
I would remind the bakers

779
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,640
that what we don't want is style
over substance.

780
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,680
Of course we want it to look like
what it's not,

781
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,600
it's an illusion cake.

782
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,920
But it's also got
to taste fantastic.

783
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,560
These guys have got to be
not just bakers but true artists,

784
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,040
and probably a little bit of
engineering as well,

785
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,520
and I imagine they've had a few
sleepless nights over this one.

786
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,040
Nerves don't exist today,
so I've got to smash it,

787
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,840
irrelevant of how I feel.

788
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,680
I want it to be airy, I really don't
want negative feedback today.

789
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,720
I don't want you filming it,
it's split!

790
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,040
It changes the rise.

791
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,280
Actually, the denser the mixture for
this, the better,

792
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,200
because I need a lot
of structural integrity.

793
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,840
Sophie's dense sponge
will be flavoured with chocolate

794
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,400
and carved into the shape
of a champagne bucket,

795
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,240
complete with sugar work ice cubes
and a chocolate champagne bottle.

796
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,080
It's actually a cake I did
for my housemate, for her birthday.

797
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,320
When I took it to the bar,
the bouncer went,

798
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,280
&quot;You can't take in
your own alcohol.&quot;

799
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,280
And I was like, &quot;It must look good,
then, if I can trick the bouncer!&quot;

800
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,320
And Sophie isn't the only one
heading for a posh night out.

801
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,480
I like going out in the evening
and getting dressed up sometimes.

802
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,280
Rarely, but when I do,
I quite like a nice bag.

803
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,160
Stacey's making red velvet chocolate
sponge,

804
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,640
which she'll decorate to look
like a designer clutch handbag.

805
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,040
It's quite a wet mix, isn't it?

806
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,600
Yes. It's going to be quite moist.

807
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,680
It's got buttermilk,
a little red wine vinegar, oil.

808
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,480
When you add the moisture
to a sponge,

809
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,320
it becomes quite airy and
can collapse very, very easily.

810
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,320
I've done it quite a few times, and
I'm hoping that it won't collapse.

811
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,040
Thank you.  Good luck.

812
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,840
Looking forward to the moist clutch.

813
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,400
OK!

814
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,720
As Stacey and Sophie head out...

815
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,320
..Tom is looking forward
to a quiet night in.

816
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,960
I am baking a stack of books,

817
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,680
the idea being a relaxing evening
by the fire.

818
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,360
The sponge inside Tom's books
will be flavoured

819
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,840
with two of the classics.

820
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,960
My flavours are
lemon and poppy seed.

821
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,480
I think it can pack quite a punch.

822
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,000
Whether you've had a quiet night in
or a big night out...

823
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,560
..the flavours in James' sponge
should get you up in the morning.

824
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,920
Got espresso coffee in it.

825
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,320
I start off most mornings
in the office

826
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,520
with a cup of coffee
and a croissant.

827
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,080
James will carve
his espresso coffee cake

828
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,400
into the shape of
his favourite breakfast.

829
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,880
It is kind of my day-to-day life
and then my baking life,

830
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,760
which is totally separate,
so this kind of joins the two.

831
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,760
So, I'm making
the banana sponge now.

832
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,240
Liam's flavoured sponge will also
be transformed into breakfast.

833
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,800
Every Sunday,
I try to have pancakes.

834
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,680
Me and my mum prefer
the thick American style.

835
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,880
His banana sponge
with blueberry compote

836
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,800
will be disguised as a stack
of pancakes,

837
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,000
complete with his mum's favourite
trimmings.

838
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,480
What's this for, then? The granola?

839
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,440
Because I always have granola
with my pancakes.

840
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,880
I just think the flavour's better.

841
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,840
Like you guys said,
I have to work on my flavours.

842
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,200
How are you making the pancakes?

843
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,760
So I'm making a marshmallow fondant

844
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,600
and then I'm going to roll it into,
like, a sausage shape,

845
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,080
and then cut out, like, thin strips
and then wrap it round.

846
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,760
Why would you roll it round
the cake?

847
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,000
That's how it will look like
pancakes.

848
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,800
Trust me, Paul.

849
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,200
PRUE LAUGHS

850
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,120
For Chris and Flo's sponges...

851
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,520
That's not red enough.

852
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,200
..colour is crucial to pulling off
their illusions.

853
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,560
What did you base the recipe on?

854
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,360
Paul's pork and egg pie recipe.

855
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,400
Oh, it's his own sort of
savoury recipe?

856
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,120
Yeah, so I'm making a yellow
sponge to represent the yolk,

857
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,760
I've got some white sponge to create
the egg,

858
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,640
then I'm going to make the pork.

859
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,200
Chris will have to cut and place his
almond-flavoured coloured sponges

860
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,200
so that when it's sliced, his cake
will look like Paul's favourite pie.

861
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,680
I know you're an analytical kind
of guy.

862
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,200
How precise has this all
to be measured?

863
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,120
Down to the millimetre.

864
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,280
Do you feel you need this one

865
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,280
to get yourself a bit higher up
the rankings?

866
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,920
I think we do, yes.

867
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,760
We? It's a &quot;we&quot; now, is it?!  It is.
I like that.

868
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,400
I thought this was a team!
You'd told me,

869
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,360
you told me you're getting them
drunk for me.

870
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,600
Did you give them that money
I gave you?

871
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,280
Flo's coloured sponge
should create an illusion

872
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,960
that's a little less savoury.

873
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,600
My husband loved melon.

874
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,840
We went abroad one time
and the barman made us

875
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,320
a watermelon cocktail,
called One In A Melon,

876
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,200
so it just brings happy memories.

877
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,160
I don't like melon myself.

878
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,080
Flo's red sponge will be soaked
in melon syrup,

879
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,080
studded with chocolate chips
and covered in green fondant.

880
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,840
I'm going in.

881
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,840
I'm going to have to do them
on two shelves today,

882
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,160
and I normally like to keep them all
on the same shelf.

883
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,200
With the multiple sponges required
to build the illusions...

884
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,560
Beautiful!

885
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,640
..come multiple baking times.

886
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,880
Start at 20.

887
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,720
And whilst keeping track of that...

888
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,640
That'll be in for
about 13 to 15 minutes.

889
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,840
..they also need to find time to
make multiple decorative elements

890
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,920
to deceive the eye.

891
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,360
Here we've got the ice malts.

892
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,880
It's basically a type of sugar.

893
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,440
It melts down to be totally clear,

894
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,560
and that's going to go
into my ice cube trays.

895
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,360
It mimics the look of the ice cube.

896
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,160
For her sugar-based deception,

897
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,600
Kate is also working with
unconventional materials.

898
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,320
This looks surprisingly
like Glacier Mints.

899
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,760
Yeah, I'm making a terrarium cake.

900
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,440
A terrarium is a small glass
container that you put plants in.

901
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,360
Mini greenhouse.  I used to collect
cactuses when I was a kid.

902
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,280
Kate's panes of Glacier Mint glass

903
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,520
will enclose buttercream
house plants

904
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,200
on a chocolate
and star anise sponge.

905
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,280
It's about engineering,

906
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,680
cos you've got to make sure all
those pieces fit together.

907
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,840
I've designed the moulds with a bit
of a lip on them,

908
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,160
so structurally
they've got some support.

909
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,960
Have you done this whole thing
before?

910
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,560
Not all together, no. I've done it
in different elements.

911
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,160
I think we ought to let you get
on with it. It's terrifying!

912
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,160
Peter is also venturing into the
intimidating world of molten sugar.

913
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,360
I made the knife mould myself,

914
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,240
so the ultimate goal is to have

915
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,880
a knife that is cutting
through the bread.

916
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,800
Peter's knife will cut a lemon
Madeira cake loaf

917
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,120
sat on a Genoese sponge
chopping board.

918
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,520
It just represents my foray
into baking,

919
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,240
cos I started baking bread
before anything else.

920
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,800
Stephen's also attempting to make
bread in cake week.

921
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,560
Being one of 12 bakers, I thought,

922
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,840
why not make a lunch for us
out of cake?

923
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,640
He is preparing 2kg of fondant
for his bakers' lunch...

924
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,160
to cover a loaf of chocolate
and hazelnut sponge

925
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,400
that will be sliced for

926
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,000
an accompanying fondant-filled
sandwich.

927
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,640
Which is a bacon,
lettuce and tomato.

928
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,000
BLT?  BLT.
How are you going to make that?

929
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,800
I will use this bad boy.

930
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,720
This is a spray gun
for edible colour.

931
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,560
For bits of lettuce, tomato, bacon.

932
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,840
Perfect.  Nice idea.

933
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,600
I think that's very interesting.

934
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,680
Good luck.  Thank you.

935
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,680
When it comes to fondant food, Yan's
lunch is a little more adventurous.

936
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,680
It's a pasta machine.

937
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,400
My mum's been trying to get rid
of it to me,

938
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,360
cos her house is massive and
mine is tiny, so why wouldn't she?

939
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,640
She'll attempt to make fondant
noodles

940
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,760
to top a banana cake

941
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,360
transformed into
a bowl of Japanese ramen,

942
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,760
complete with fondant Pak Choi
and chicken katsu fillet.

943
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,760
I like noodles, so banana ramen
just rolls off the tongue.

944
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,040
Yes, beauty.

945
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,040
Bakers, unfortunately,
time is not an illusion.  OK.

946
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,400
You are halfway through
your Showstopper Challenge.

947
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,440
Very happy with those.

948
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,880
We can work with that.

949
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,040
Bingo.

950
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,600
While some are happy with the
sponges

951
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,920
they'll have to build with...

952
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,000
Zen.

953
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,440
..for Stacey...

954
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,520
there seems to be
a pattern emerging.

955
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,200
Usually, they're much higher,
and I wanted a light sponge,

956
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,560
and that is not a light sponge.

957
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,560
Am I going to put it in the bin?
Yeah.

958
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,680
I want to redo my sponge.

959
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,680
Not what I wanted today, so...

960
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,960
For the rest of the bakers...

961
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,200
..it's the point of no return.

962
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,120
The sheer complexity of this year's
first show-stopping designs...

963
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,160
Cutting a cake when it's warm,
sometimes it springs back on you.

964
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,160
..means precision in every cut,
in every cake, is crucial.

965
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,120
This is going to be the core
of the cup.

966
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,720
I'm now making the inside,
so this is going to be my egg,

967
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,000
I'm going to cover it up, job done.
And breathe.

968
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Julia has also planned an illusion
on the inside of her Showstopper.

969
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,680
I'm making a Russian doll.

970
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,680
I think it's quite self-explanatory.

971
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,560
Hidden at the heart
of Julia's Showstopper

972
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,480
will be a fondant and sponge doll,

973
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,040
surrounded by a larger doll

974
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,520
made with five layers
of classic Victorian sponge.

975
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,520
The outside looks Russian, like me,
and the inside is English,

976
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,680
which is also me now.

977
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,520
How long have we got?  About an hour.

978
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,000
An hour?

979
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,720
Doable.

980
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,880
Very happy I re-did it.

981
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,880
Getting somewhere now.
Carving it round, like a melon.

982
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,120
I'm making the doll for the inside.

983
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,960
Now I'm doing three things at the
same time - sugar, fondant, cake.

984
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,320
Four things - icing.
The whole thing.

985
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,320
The clock seems to get faster.

986
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,920
Just about to do serious cuttage.

987
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,880
Shall we do it together?
It's like a wedding.

988
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,160
Feels lovely, darling.

989
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,360
Ooh.  Ooh?

990
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,320
Don't worry.  Is it OK?

991
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,760
It's technically your fault, but...
Yeah.

992
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,680
I want to try and get it
all neatly covered in one go,

993
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,680
and then I can trim it back after.

994
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,680
I'm just piping the succulents on,

995
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,440
although I think the buttercream
might be a little bit too hard.

996
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,040
My hand is so shaky!

997
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,960
I'm just trying to do
a crumb coating.

998
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,960
That's the diameter of the cake,
or circumference, I don't know.

999
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,120
I can't remember the last time
I did maths.

1000
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,120
This doesn't look anything like
I want it to.

1001
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,800
It's a katsu chicken fillet.

1002
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,640
It's made out of Rice Krispies
and marshmallows.

1003
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,520
I'm just dropping it in.

1004
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,880
It's like, you know when pancakes
have those air bubbles,

1005
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,880
so like just over there.

1006
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,360
Bakers, you have half an hour

1007
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,440
to bedeck your breathtaking bakes
of beauty.

1008
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,040
Still redeemable.
Everything's redeemable.

1009
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,040
Everything's redeemable.
Yes.  You can do this.

1010
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,920
This is modelling chocolate.

1011
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,000
Wow, what's happening now?

1012
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,120
You should have seen it
before I started sculpting!

1013
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,120
So this is the top
of my champagne bottle.

1014
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,040
Oh, yeah! OK, well, good luck with
that, yeah.  Thanks very much.

1015
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,560
I'm glad I saw that.

1016
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:21,240
Using my science background
to create the salmon roe.

1017
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,520
So I've liquefied some agar in some
mango juice and then obviously you

1018
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,080
want the spherical balls,
and how do you create that?

1019
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:31,080
So I've cooled down some oil in the
fridge, and as I pipe in the liquid,

1020
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,600
it cools down and creates
the outer wall.

1021
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,480
Juice balls.

1022
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,800
Science!

1023
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,800
Does it look like a watermelon?

1024
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,480
How long have we got? How long?

1025
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,920
Five minutes until we see
what your cakes are made of.

1026
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,920
Or what they're not made of.

1027
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,920
I haven't really got time.

1028
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,920
Try to not get in a state.

1029
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,760
Do you put bacon on first
or lettuce?

1030
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,760
We'll put lettuce on first.
Let's not be monsters about this.

1031
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,080
Ten...  Carrot.

1032
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,440
Nine.  Eight.

1033
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,080
Seven.  Six.

1034
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,880
Five.  Four.

1035
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,600
Three.  There we go.

1036
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,480
Two.

1037
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,480
One.  Bakers, your time is up.

1038
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,120
Put down your illusions.

1039
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,920
What a disaster.
No more touching your illusions.

1040
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,920
No.

1041
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:57,000
Well done.

1042
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,520
It's judgment time for
the show-stopping illusion cakes.

1043
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,520
Yan, please bring up
your illusion cake.

1044
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,920
I think what you've produced there

1045
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,240
is a work of art.

1046
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,400
I love the way you've
used the Rice Krispies

1047
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,000
and then the eggs look incredible.

1048
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,440
PRUE:  The little salmon roe,
it'll taste like mango,

1049
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,840
and your brain is
telling you one thing

1050
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,000
and your taste buds
are telling you another.

1051
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,280
We should be eating it
with chopsticks!  I know.

1052
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,280
Look at that. Isn't that beautiful?

1053
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,560
I think it's got
a good banana flavour.

1054
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,640
The case is slightly too dry.

1055
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,640
It's unfortunate,
but that design is incredible.

1056
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,880
I think you could have
done more with it.

1057
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,200
It's not detailed enough.

1058
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,880
Yeah.

1059
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,880
I love the flavour.
I think it's a little dry.

1060
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,640
It so nearly worked, didn't it?

1061
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,640
That glass looks great. It's such
a shame you lost it at the top.

1062
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,440
Yeah.

1063
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,040
Texture's nice. Very moist.

1064
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,040
Nice flavour. I like it.

1065
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,520
It's collapsed a bit there,
hasn't it?

1066
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,920
It did. It needed more time
before I iced it.

1067
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,920
Mm. Very nice flavour.

1068
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,920
It's a bit dry, but the chocolate,
the coffee, is delicious.

1069
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,760
It's a little bit basic
on the outside.  Sure.

1070
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,080
This is so exciting!

1071
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,560
Oh, that's disappointing.

1072
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,880
We can see it.
Oh, that's brilliant, that bit.

1073
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,880
LAUGHTER

1074
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,640
Very almondy flavour.

1075
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,400
But it comes down to the texture.

1076
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,400
It's a little bit too dense for me.

1077
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,320
Flo, please bring up
your illusion cake.

1078
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,360
PRUE:  If you saw that in
the greengrocer's shop,

1079
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,440
you would think it was a watermelon.

1080
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,320
I'm dying to see
what it looks like inside.

1081
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,840
Oh, there you go!

1082
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,440
Look at that.

1083
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,480
NOEL:  Wowsers.
That's excellent, there.

1084
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,800
Now, this has got watermelon syrup
in here as well, hasn't it?  Yeah.

1085
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,800
I want some with the chocolate in.

1086
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,400
I can't really get the watermelon,

1087
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,200
but then my mouth
is full of chocolate.

1088
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,720
What's the matter with that?
I think it's wonderful.

1089
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,720
Your sponge is spot-on.
I love the colour you got inside

1090
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,840
and the chocolate just
highlights it and lifts it up.

1091
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,840
I love you, Flo.  I love you too now!

1092
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,840
SHE LAUGHS

1093
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,320
It's the fattest Russian doll
I've ever seen.

1094
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,800
Proper Siberian!

1095
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,520
Is that right? OK!

1096
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,920
LAUGHTER

1097
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,360
Oh, look at that!

1098
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,280
NOEL APPLAUDS

1099
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,280
Right, let's see if
we can cut into her.

1100
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,640
I find the cake a little bit plain
and a little bit dry.

1101
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,720
It's a little bit simplistic.

1102
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:17,720
I think it's a pity about the knife.

1103
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,800
A bit dry.
The flavour in there is beautiful.

1104
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,800
I just think you've left it in there
a little bit too long.

1105
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,160
I'm not certain that
I would know it was a handbag.

1106
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,160
It looks like a decorated cake
rather than a handbag.

1107
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,160
But what's more important is,
is it a great cake?

1108
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,560
I think it's delicious.  Thank you.

1109
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,280
Certainly a bit sticky
in your mouth.

1110
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,920
You wouldn't want to eat
a lot of it because it's so rich.

1111
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,720
The sponge is delicious.
What throws you is the colour.

1112
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,720
Overall, not really
overwhelmed by the design.

1113
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,280
I have to say, the champagne bottle
looks amazing.

1114
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,440
It's really beautifully done.

1115
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,760
Oh!

1116
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,760
I'll just get that before it melts!

1117
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,040
Surprisingly dry.

1118
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,760
OK.  The ganache is
making it even drier,

1119
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,760
but the flavour of
the chocolate's nice.

1120
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,880
Steven, please bring up
your illusion cake.

1121
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,240
Wow.

1122
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,120
That is stunning.

1123
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,160
Without a shadow of a doubt,
you know exactly what that is.

1124
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,400
Absolutely astonishing.

1125
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,960
You wouldn't think that
wasn't bread, would you?

1126
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,960
It is a chocolate hazelnut sponge
with a peanut butter frosting.

1127
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,920
It's perfect.

1128
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,360
The hazelnut, the peanut,
the frosting,

1129
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,200
the layers are equal, the outside,

1130
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,720
the colour, the texture,
it's all there.

1131
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,080
And it's not too sweet.

1132
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,640
I think it's lovely.  Well done.

1133
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,200
Well done.  Thank you.

1134
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,120
Well done.

1135
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:55,120
Liam, please bring up
your illusion cake.

1136
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,200
Well, I have to say,
I think it looks delicious.

1137
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,400
It makes my mouth water.

1138
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,680
I want to come to yours
for breakfast.

1139
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,640
Any time.  It just...

1140
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,640
It's so lovely!
LAUGHTER

1141
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,040
I mean, it really is
very difficult to believe

1142
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,760
that that's not pancakes.

1143
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,880
Yeah, I think it's ingenious, but...

1144
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,880
it's got to taste good as well.

1145
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,520
There's a lot going on in here
as well, isn't there?  Yeah.

1146
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,400
I was expecting
more banana flavour.

1147
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,800
I think that's because
the blueberries overpower it.

1148
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,920
Yeah.  But it's delicious.
A mouthful is lovely.  OK.

1149
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,920
I think your banana cake
is beautiful.

1150
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,240
Well done, mate.  Thank you.

1151
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,240
Oh, good.

1152
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,720
HE EXHALES

1153
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:12,000
NOEL:  Paul and Prue must now decide
who'll be our first Star Baker

1154
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,240
and who'll be the first to leave
the Bake Off tent.

1155
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,920
The standard has been
ridiculously high, hasn't it?

1156
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,480
I think this is one of
the strongest challenges I've seen

1157
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,680
for the first programme.
So, who has stood out?

1158
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:26,680
Well, I think Flo came straight back
with a cracking good watermelon.

1159
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,400
Sophie has been very constant.

1160
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,920
Steven didn't fail us
on the Showstopper.

1161
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,920
Nobody wants to be the first person
to leave, but who is in some danger?

1162
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,840
Liam saved himself with that
Showstopper. It was stunning.

1163
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,160
Stacey, I think, is in trouble.

1164
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,440
This didn't look like a handbag.

1165
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,200
Peter hasn't done well.

1166
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,840
Chris is full of good ideas.

1167
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,320
His flavours are spectacular,

1168
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,520
but his baking falls short.

1169
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,400
Well, I have to say, none of it
sounds straightforward.

1170
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,360
We have to send
somebody away, don't we?

1171
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,000
You could send Noel.  I'll go.

1172
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,840
I'll go now, actually.
I'll take a hit for the team!

1173
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,320
THEY LAUGH

1174
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,480
It's been great.
I've loved working with you guys!

1175
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,520
Nice to meet you.

1176
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,320
Sandi will be fine.

1177
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:20,000
Bye.  Bye, darling.
See you later, kids.

1178
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,160
Bakers, it is my tremendous
privilege to announce

1179
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,000
the very first Star Baker.

1180
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,560
The Star Baker is the person

1181
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:36,560
whose Showstopper was honestly
the best thing since sliced bread.

1182
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,160
LAUGHTER

1183
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,200
The Star Baker is Steven.

1184
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,200
APPLAUSE

1185
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,560
Oh, bakers, sadly
I have to deliver the bad news.

1186
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,320
Horrible job. The person that
we have to say goodbye to is...

1187
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,680
..Peter.

1188
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,280
I'm sorry, mate.
Give us a hug, come on.

1189
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,640
Well done.

1190
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,000
Peter, you were great,
I hope you've enjoyed it.  Yes.

1191
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,760
It's been a wonderful
experience.

1192
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,920
Maybe I could have done things
differently,

1193
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,120
but it's been just a pleasure
meeting everyone.

1194
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,160
PRUE:  I'm really sorry to
say goodbye to Peter.

1195
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,080
He was up against real competition.

1196
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,400
Sorry, buddy.

1197
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,320
The standard this year is so high,
and unfortunately,

1198
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,400
it was Peter's turn.

1199
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,360
I don't know what to say, mate.
It's all right.

1200
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,360
I understand it was the flavours
that put me a whisker above Peter.

1201
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,760
Give us a bit of love, then.

1202
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,320
Hugely stressful and fun, and
I've made some great friends.

1203
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,360
Thank you so much.

1204
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,400
And I'm so pleased they gave me the
opportunity to hopefully improve.

1205
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,560
When I seen that bread, I went...

1206
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,280
When I got that feedback today,
I was ecstatic.

1207
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,240
The kids will be absolutely
thrilled to bits.

1208
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,800
I won't be telling them anything
that they don't know.

1209
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,920
It's me that doubts myself.

1210
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,360
PHONE RINGS

1211
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,760
Hello, darling.
Hello, Ma, are you all right?

1212
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,720
I made Star Baker.

1213
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,040
GASPS
No!

1214
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,320
And, Paul shook my hand.

1215
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,320
Oh, darling, I'm so proud of you!

1216
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,720
I just want to feel like this
all the time.

1217
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,520
Not crying, obviously.

1218
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,760
That's quite awkward, on the tube.

1219
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,680
Next time...

1220
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,800
it's biscuits.

1221
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,840
That's it.

1222
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,920
GRUNTING

1223
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,840
With an emotional
signature challenge.

1224
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,600
Am I going to be crying when I
eat your biscuits?  I hope not.

1225
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,800
An oriental technical...

1226
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,120
You've got to be really...

1227
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,200
..that may predict
the Bakers' futures.

1228
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,360
So frustrating!

1229
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,760
And, a Bake Off first.
This is insane.

1230
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,400
Spectacular show-stopping
