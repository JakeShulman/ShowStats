00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GBBO S08E06

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,920
I miss the five bakers who've gone.
I'm glad we had a hug
before they left.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,720
It's important to conclude things
properly. Only then can you let go.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,440
Don't you agree, Noel?

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,560
I can't talk, I'm a tiger.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,480
What are you two doing?

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,440
We're re-enacting The Life Of Pi.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,480
What?  It's pastry week.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,640
Life of pie!

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,680
Last time,
puddings were on the menu.

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,400
Stacey's determination
finally paid off.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,240
Thank you.  But it was Sophie...

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,480
Absolutely delicious.

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,080
..who at long last
claimed her first Star Baker title.

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,520
And whilst Julia and Liam wobbled...

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,680
The jelly just hasn't set.
I just want it to be good!

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,800
..we had to say goodbye to James.

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,240
Julia was sobbing her eyes out,
and who was comforting her?

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,960
Don't get me going. I'm not crying.

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,880
He's just such a nice guy.

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,800
This week...  Whoa!

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,200
Roll on, pastry...
I've just ruined John Lennon's eyes.

23
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,440
..with stunning shortcrust
signatures...

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,760
I think it's a bit of a triumph.
..a technical tart...

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,920
Gone the wrong way.  It's so jarring.

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,640
..and a super-sized Showstopper...

27
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,240
It's an amazing construction.

28
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,800
..that leaves the bakers...
You can't serve up a wonky pie.

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,480
..on the verge of collapse.

30
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,400
Don't tell them I did that.

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Having a bit of a problem.

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,760
I've just realised, actually,
there's only two guys left!

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,080
Hm, I don't mind.

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,640
Got to represent.

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,000
I've been looking forward
to pastry week for ages,

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,480
and now it's here,
I'm a little bit anxious.

37
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,800
Pastry can smell fear.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,040
100%.

39
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,080
Morning, bakers.

40
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,520
Welcome to pasty week.

41
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,880
No, it's pastry week.  Is it?

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,760
Yeah.  I was looking forward to pasty
week, being a Goth and all that.

43
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,600
Yeah, anyway,
for your signature challenge,

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,640
Paul and Prue would like you
to make savoury pies.

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,080
Now, the flavour of the filling
is entirely up to you.

46
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,080
You have to make four pies
and the judges would love to see
how you fashion shortcrust.

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,480
They have to be
beautifully decorated.

48
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,880
Think designer pies,
the Coco Chanel of shortcrust.

49
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,520
So, you've two and a half hours
to make your four gorgeous pies.

50
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,920
On your marks...  Get set...

51
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,120
Bake!

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,080
Right, let's get cracking.
I'm cutting up my butter
as quick as possible.

53
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,760
I want the maximum amount of time
to decorate my pie.

54
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,480
It is quite a challenge. You have
to come up with all this decoration

55
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,520
and on top of that, you have to have
good pastry.

56
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,520
I didn't do it to time
last time I practised it.

57
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,600
They've got to make four individual
savoury pies,

58
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,120
but they must be connected
in some way through the decoration.

59
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,080
It's all about that little bit of
work with the knife and the egg wash

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,520
to create something
that looks amazing.

61
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Intricate pastry work takes a lot
of skill and there's a temptation

62
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,560
to keep fiddling around with
these tiny little bits of pastry,

63
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,120
and of course the more you fiddle,

64
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,120
the tougher it gets and it loses
its crumbly deliciousness.

65
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,200
The pies might look amazing,

66
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,600
but when you put that fork in
and put it in your mouth,
it's got to flake,

67
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,720
it's got to taste buttery, and then
you look forward to the filling.

68
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,720
They have to think of not just the
outside, but also the filling, too.

69
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,600
Hello, Yan.  Hello.

70
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
So what have you decided to do
for the savoury pie challenge?

71
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,600
The theme for my pie is science and
it's based on British scientists.

72
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,960
OK.  Nerd pie.

73
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,280
This is a nerd pie.  Geek pie.

74
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,240
Stephen Hawking, Charles Darwin,

75
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,080
Alan Turing and Franklin and Crick

76
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,120
will all be honoured
with their own chicken curry pie.

77
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,040
For the Turing pie,
I'm cutting out binary code,

78
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,320
ones and zeros sealing the pie.  Oh!

79
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,880
The DNA helix,

80
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,360
I'm plaiting so it looks like a
DNA helix and then pushing it down.

81
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,160
That decoration alone
would take me a day.

82
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,000
Almost more difficult
than splitting the atom.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,080
Complicated or beautifully simple...

84
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,240
Done.

85
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,240
..every themed signature pie will
require a perfect shortcrust pastry.

86
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,840
Shortcrust is three ingredients -
plain flour, butter, lard.

87
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,680
If you put them together correctly,
you end up with beautiful pastry.

88
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,840
Don't tell it I'm frightened of it.

89
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,680
I've enriched it by two eggs,

90
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,760
with a couple of tablespoons
of water as well.

91
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,880
I've got baking powder in my pastry.

92
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,720
Bucks up a bit in the oven,
which I like.

93
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,760
Get this into a bit of a ball.

94
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,760
If you knead it too much, it will
work the gluten and become tough.

95
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,120
It's a fine balance.

96
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,080
Steven is attempting to perfect
not one shortcrust pastry...

97
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,880
Whoops.

98
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,720
..but two.  I've got two batches
of plain shortcrust,

99
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,520
and this is going to be more for the
decorating on top with an egg yolk.

100
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,080
His second enriched shortcrust will
decorate pies filled with Swedish

101
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,040
meatballs, mashed potatoes
and lingonberry jam,

102
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,800
and all four will join together
in musical harmony.

103
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,040
I'm representing songs
from my favourite band.

104
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,440
Which is?  If I tell you the songs,
do you think you can guess?

105
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,000
OK, go.  Big Love.

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,280
Oh.  Storms.  Ah.

107
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,040
Songbird.  Yeah.  And Angel.

108
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,800
Fleetwood Mac.

109
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,400
There we go.
Obviously a fan yourself.

110
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,680
What is it you like about them?

111
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Childhood memories of my mother
cooking and listening
to Fleetwood Mac.

112
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,880
For one baker,
music is just the beginning.

113
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,880
John Lennon is going on the pie,
and Einstein.

114
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,800
That's Shakespeare.  Yeah.

115
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,800
And Amelia Earhart. Portraits of
people who I find inspirational.

116
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,800
Kate's personal Fab Four will be
immortalised atop pies crammed with

117
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,680
a delicious medley of garden
vegetables and fresh herbs.

118
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,040
They look quite intricate.

119
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,680
They are quite.

120
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,960
For ease of cutting them out,

121
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,640
I've made rough moulds
and then I'll emboss them.

122
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,560
I've got little tools I use,
and they keep their shape well
in the oven.

123
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,560
It's amazing.  Thank you.  I'm excited
to see a pastry Lennon.

124
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,760
Me, too!  It's going to be great.

125
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,760
Pastry done.  Now I'm going
to make the filling.

126
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,440
Sausages first.

127
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,440
R squared plus...  I'm not sure
what you're doing but I think
the recipe's a bit complicated.

128
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,160
It's to do with filling
versus pastry.

129
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,880
It's the equation
for the perfect pie.

130
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,880
Is it?  It is, seriously!  I love
that there is such a thing!

131
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,200
There is.  That's made me
really happy.

132
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,520
Stacey's approach
to filling her pie...

133
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,800
Quite a lot of onion in here.
..is a little more homely.

134
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,160
Fry some onions, mincemeat,
pine kernels.

135
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,800
This reminds me of the kind of thing
my grandma Elsie used to cook.

136
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,360
Now I'd love to speak to my grandma.

137
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,800
She'd be so proud I'm on this.

138
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,200
She used to watch it all the time
and I would love to speak to her,
but alas.

139
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,800
Grandma Elsie along with the rest
of Stacey's family

140
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,560
have also inspired
her signature bakes theme.

141
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,680
My theme... Love.

142
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,360
You're going to bring love back in.

143
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,040
Yeah.  I can see red
and paintbrushes.

144
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,040
I thought, what would happen
if I put a bit of colouring
in my egg wash?

145
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,160
You had such a good week last week.

146
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,480
I hope I can continue it
into this week.

147
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,880
I love the idea of the flavours.
Well, we'll see.

148
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,240
Whilst Paul and Prue will expect
incredible flavours...

149
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,320
I would marinate the meat overnight
but I don't have that luxury here,

150
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,120
so I'm going to use a vacuum sealer
so the meat will suck in spices.

151
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,960
..delivering them can come at
a huge cost.

152
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,400
There you go. That's done.

153
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,320
Almost every ingredient the bakers
use in their fillings...

154
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,240
Got the potatoes boiling, got
lingonberries cooking down...

155
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,640
..has the potential to release
shortcrust pastry's nemesis.

156
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,400
I'm towelling off my spinach.

157
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Moisture.  I just want the vegetable
and butter bean to be a bit more
reduced, so not too saucy.

158
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,040
While most are cooking
off their fillings...

159
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,000
hoping to ensure their pastry
stays dry...

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,200
Going to get the meatballs done.

161
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,200
..one baker is risking
the raw approach.

162
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,880
I've chosen this filling because

163
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,880
it's something I make for my family,
they love it, so I thought, why not?

164
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,760
Julia's hoping her sausage meat
and stuffing will cook through

165
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,200
as her pastry is baking.

166
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,720
How have you attained this colour?
What have you got in there?

167
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,920
Smoked paprika.  So what's the theme?

168
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,560
I'm making things you can find
on a tree.

169
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,640
So one's going to be fully covered
with leaves.  OK.

170
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,560
Another one's got an acorn.

171
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,560
The third will have a flower and the
fourth one's going to have grapes.

172
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,240
Grapes on a tree?

173
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,600
You can find it on my tree.

174
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,360
The only thing I'm disappointed
about is that you're doing stuff

175
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,400
you can find in trees
and you're not doing a monkey.

176
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,720
Sorry to disappoint you!

177
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,040
Or a sloth.  Or a small boy.

178
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,880
Or Noel.

179
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,320
Or Noel, yeah.  I do live
in a hollowed-out tree.

180
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,080
I'm going to get out of here.
It's got really weird.
See you later!  Thank you!

181
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,480
Even if they've managed to reduce
the moisture in their fillings...

182
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,360
Everything's going to plan so far.

183
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,480
..A shortcrust pie
is still vulnerable.

184
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,240
I'm just lining my tins
with the pastry.

185
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,400
If the rested pastry
is rolled too thick,

186
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,880
there may not be enough
remaining time to bake it correctly.

187
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,320
How long do you have left?
One hour 18.

188
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,320
Cool.  I'm doing my pastry quite thin
to avoid it going soggy.

189
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,840
The right thickness.

190
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,840
To achieve optimum crispness,
Yan has a scientific solution.

191
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,480
I'm sealing it with egg so that
the moisture stays in the pie,

192
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,400
so that it doesn't leak.

193
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,400
But one baker's been even more
cautious than Yan.

194
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,080
I'm just blind baking it with a bit
of egg to firm up the bottom.

195
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,640
Sophie will fill her blind baked
pies with roasted squash,

196
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,560
blue cheese and spinach
and they'll be decorated

197
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,520
to represent the four seasons.

198
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,280
I just have to do what I can.

199
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,880
Every step, I've been fighting
moisture problems the whole time.

200
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Bakers, you have one hour left
before your clever
combining of flour,

201
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,840
water and shortening needs to
taste better than that sounds.

202
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,440
I really need to get this show
on the road here.

203
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Creating elaborate preparations
in shortcrust is as fiddly
as pastry work gets.

204
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,840
I always give myself
difficult things to do.

205
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,560
Once I've decided on an idea,
I can't bring myself to simplify it.

206
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,360
And with four separate designs
to perfect...

207
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,280
Alan Turing, let's go.

208
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,400
..the more time
spent cutting and shaping...

209
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,560
the less time there'll be
to bake the pie itself.

210
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,760
If the four designs were the same,
it wouldn't be so much of a problem,

211
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,360
but it's not.  I need to stick
to my timings.

212
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,000
If I don't, then obviously
I won't get it done. Yeah.

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,480
Lee's carefully scheduled
decorations for his sweet potato,

214
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,160
feta and chorizo pies

215
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,720
have been inspired by
the second love of his life.

216
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,720
When I don't bake, I play a lot
of football, video games.  Right.

217
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,480
So one of my patterns
is a remote control.

218
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,360
OK.  And then I've got
a football kit.

219
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,240
What's your team?

220
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,200
Man United.

221
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,200
It's such a shame
you have to leave this week.

222
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,880
If I do go, you know why.

223
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,760
My pastry cases worked well.

224
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,520
Next one.

225
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,960
I've just eaten a bit of your
pastry. You didn't need that bit,
did you?

226
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,440
No, no, no. It was raw, though.
I like raw pastry.

227
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,320
Oh, seriously?  Yeah.  Is that
a Danish thing?  No, I think
it's just me.  OK.

228
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,480
It's going to be Einstein
in a minute,

229
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,480
when I put his facial features
on there.

230
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,280
This is Songbird.

231
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,280
I did need to show some sort of
pastry skill other than cutting
things out.

232
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,880
Darwin, Origin Of Species.

233
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,120
Really running out of time here.
Just 45 minutes remaining.

234
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,840
It's just really fiddly.

235
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,400
I'm now running out of time.

236
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,080
I just want to get
the filling inside.

237
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,920
Big spoon anywhere?

238
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,600
What are you looking for?  This.

239
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
It's like Supermarket Sweep!

240
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,000
Pants!  ..then get
the decorations on.

241
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,160
Are you going to be in time?

242
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,880
We might actually make this.

243
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,920
29 minutes?  33.

244
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,200
OK, cool.  It's not really cool.

245
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,920
I'm straining juice because
my filling is a little bit wet.

246
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,320
Normally, you would serve
lingonberry jam on the side,

247
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,320
but I've mixed it in with the mash,
which makes it
an interesting colour.

248
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Would you like some raw meat?
No, it's all right.

249
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,320
I'll fry it up for you.
I'm not a wolf!

250
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,320
I can fry it up for you!
Just eating raw meat out of the back
of the tent!

251
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,760
Oh!

252
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,120
Shakespeare...

253
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,720
OK, space pie, home straight.

254
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,720
It's getting fiddly now.  This
is going to be on top of Big Love.

255
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,160
Nice and careful.

256
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,400
It's not as neat
as I wanted it to be,

257
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,960
but who really knows what
William Shakespeare looks like?

258
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,960
I'll be fine.  I'm doing the
basket weave straight on the pie.

259
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,960
It mis-shaped so much in the moving
of it that it made more sense to do
it straight on the pie.

260
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,520
Whoa.

261
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,160
I tore my code.
I'm running out of time.

262
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,400
Right, bakers, 30 minutes left.

263
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,760
You all right, Noel?
Sorry, I just glazed over.

264
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,960
Bored?  No, no, covered in egg white.

265
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,280
Oh.  Prue did it.

266
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,280
This should be in already.
Little glaze, little shine.

267
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,120
I've got a milk wash,
an egg wash and egg yolk.

268
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,560
It gives it different depths
of browns.

269
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,880
I've put it in a really hot oven,
240 degrees,

270
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,400
to make sure everything's cooked
through.  Time to go in the oven.

271
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,800
Unless all the pies are ready to go
in the oven at the same time...

272
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,760
I'm going.  ..the bakers may not
be able to achieve an even bake
across all four.

273
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,000
See you, babies.

274
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,360
Just going to put that one in.

275
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,080
Putting one in.  I wasn't
going to stagger them all.

276
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,040
I wanted to get them all in at once.
I want that pastry to be cooked.

277
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,200
I want to have at least one cooked.

278
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Still got one more to work on.

279
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,040
Come on, planet.  In she goes.

280
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,280
What's everyone else doing?

281
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,280
Sophie's not got hers in yet.

282
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,240
Pow! Science pie.

283
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,920
I hate rushing.

284
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,160
I hate rushing! It's not me.

285
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,600
I've got all of them in the oven
apart from this one.

286
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,520
Oh, I've just ruined John Lennon's
eyes.

287
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Looks a bit more like Noel Gallagher
because I'm in a rush.

288
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,600
That is going to go in for as long
as I've got and then I'll get them
out right at the last minute.

289
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,880
I don't want John's to look
a bit anaemic.

290
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,760
They might all be anaemic.

291
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,760
Bakers, you have five minutes
to finish your feast for four.

292
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,080
Mine are going to be raw.

293
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,720
What have you got it on?  200.

294
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,680
Whack up the temperature.

295
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,680
I turned it up to 200 instead of
190, which is what I do at home.

296
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,640
Maybe I should have
compromised and allowed them
to cook for a bit longer.

297
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,480
It's definitely a pie.
It's a raw pie.  Cook, you rotters!

298
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,280
It's burning up a bit too much,
so I've put a bit of foil.

299
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,080
Hopefully, it will work.
Bakers, you've got one minute left.

300
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,600
Desperate Dan is on his way
to sample your pies.

301
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,360
He's getting a lift
with his brother, Desperate Ian.

302
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,520
Could you let me know
when there's 30 seconds left?

303
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,480
They've collapsed a bit, but the
designs aren't as I had described.

304
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Cool. Time to take out.

305
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,880
Right, bakers,
that is your pie pit stop.

306
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Please place your pies
at the end of your benches.

307
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,200
One raw pie.

308
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,000
Me, too.  Awesome, dude.

309
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,200
That's totally rad.

310
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,960
I'm so embarrassed.

311
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,840
Why?  They're raw and messy.

312
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,920
Shakespeare, Einstein.

313
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,640
Who's that?  Please don't.

314
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,000
Just don't. Don't.

315
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,040
Now, for the first time in this
year's competition, the bakers

316
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,760
will have their pastry
judged by Paul and Prue.

317
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,360
Hi, Sophie.  Hi, Prue.

318
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,800
Hello, Sophie. Tell us
all about your savoury pies.

319
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,120
So I have the four seasons,
and the filling is a

320
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,520
roasted butternut squash,
spinach and blue cheese.

321
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,920
I love this plaiting
around the outside. That is so neat.

322
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,360
So why didn't you leave it in there
a little bit longer to get

323
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,200
that latticework cooked
a little bit more?

324
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,760
Oh, no, that was intentional.
So that's got a milk wash on it.

325
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,320
Yeah.  And this one?

326
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,440
Oh, maybe that could have done
with a bit longer.

327
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,000
Gosh, that looks good.

328
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,240
That pastry,
it's crispy all the way through.

329
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,360
I think blind baking was
definitely a good choice.

330
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,880
I think it helped.

331
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,480
PRUE:  And that filling looks
perfect.

332
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,440
You've got enough sauce in there to
stick it together, but not

333
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,880
so that it sogs up the pastry.  Yep.

334
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,600
A little bit of saltiness
coming from the blue cheese.

335
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,320
Blue cheese is such a great flavour,

336
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,520
but it hasn't killed the butternut,
it hasn't killed the spinach.

337
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,160
You've got a really good balance.

338
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,280
The whole thing together is
absolutely delicious. Really good.

339
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,040
You've got the right sauce
level as well.

340
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,960
That is a triumph.
Well, thank you very much.

341
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,520
That's a proper Prue pat you got
there.  I get another Prue pat?

342
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,280
LAUGHTER
Congratulations.

343
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,920
I'll just double-check for them.
Just take that with me.

344
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Thank you.  Thank you.

345
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,000
Nice decoration and, actually,
the colours are all fairly even,

346
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,720
except for this one. What happened?

347
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,720
That was the last one in the oven -
it was just a rush at the very end.

348
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,520
Beautifully made.

349
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,760
I think the little hearts
around the edge are absolutely

350
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,640
beautifully done.  OK.
Item one.

351
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,160
Nice bake all the way down.

352
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
PRUE:  Perfect. That is very good
pastry.

353
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,640
I have to say, it doesn't look
really pretty.

354
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,200
I mean, there's something quite
upsetting about eating pink mash.

355
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,040
The colour's unfortunate.
STEVEN LAUGHS

356
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,640
It looks a bit like raw pork.

357
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,080
But the flavour's good.

358
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:13,080
The berries with
the mash are the star of the show.

359
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,640
Nice, bold colour.  Yeah.

360
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,160
I think you could have done with
a little bit less...  OK.

361
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,840
..if I'm honest.

362
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,560
Was it yours that had the, er,
baking powder in it?  Yeah.

363
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,160
You see, I honestly think that's a
mistake, cos it's made it a tiny bit
cakey.

364
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,360
Mm-hmm.  Can't really taste the
sausage meat. It's just paprika -

365
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,560
that's all you're getting,
really, coming through it.

366
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,640
Not your best work.
A little bit disappointed.

367
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,160
Sorry.

368
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,800
I don't think they look good.

369
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,720
No.  I think the plaiting is OK,

370
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,760
but you've lost all
the definition on it as well.

371
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,000
Let's go for, is that Jesus Christ?

372
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,960
Don't rise to the bait, Kate.
Oh, I won't, no.  No.

373
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,560
It's a bit boring.

374
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,680
I mean, it's perfectly pleasant, but
you don't think, &quot;Oh, that's
divine.&quot;

375
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,680
And you do have a
couple of soggy bottoms.

376
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,680
I've seen you bake a lot
better than this, Kate.

377
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,200
SHE SIGHS

378
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,320
The expectations are tremendously
high and, really, it does look

379
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,560
a bit of a mess.

380
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,640
and they don't all
look quite evenly-baked.

381
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,200
I was struggling for time so
I thought, &quot;I'm going to get at

382
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,360
&quot;least one pie cooked cos I don't
want to give you

383
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,840
&quot;anything raw to eat.&quot;

384
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,280
I think the one we are safest with

385
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,280
is trying this one here, with the
colour.

386
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,280
It's baked at the bottom.  Ooh.

387
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,400
Your pastry is delicious -
buttery, flaky.

388
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,880
I don't think it's the same on the
others.  No.

389
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,880
The chicken is tremendously dry and
over-cooked. The pastry is perfect.

390
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,680
It is pastry week -
just remember that when you...

391
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,760
Yeah, but, and filling as well,
unfortunately. And decoration.

392
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,280
SHE GROANS
And four the same.

393
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,040
Oh, bum.  But besides that...
Sorry, am I allowed to say bum?

394
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Yeah, say it again.
Perfectly OK stuff.

395
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,760
Overall, actually,
I quite like the colour of the pies.

396
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,000
One thing I do like is the dome.

397
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,480
I love that classic dome.

398
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,160
Let's have a quick look at this one.
Oh, it is baked.

399
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,800
OK.

400
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,160
PRUE:  Ooh, that looks good.

401
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,400
Very flaky. Looks a great filling.

402
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,080
Oh, that looks wonderful.

403
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,080
Look at those colours.

404
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,480
That pastry is terrific,
and it's well-seasoned.

405
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,120
I think your textures, between the
chorizo and sweet potato,

406
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,480
is very good - very buttery, flaky
pastry, and it is baked.

407
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,960
I think it's a bit of a triumph.

408
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,240
Thank you.  Well done, Liam.

409
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,240
SANDI: Keep me a bit for lunch.
100%.

410
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,720
Very clever, very neat.

411
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,760
Like the colour, like your designs.

412
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,200
That looks very, very good, indeed.

413
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,560
Well-baked.

414
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,120
PRUE:  It's cooked underneath.

415
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,440
Pastry looks good.

416
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,440
I mean, really well-filled.

417
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,200
A mouthful of pastry and mince is
quite gluey in the mouth,

418
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,880
but the flavour's lovely.

419
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,000
Mince can often give out a lot
of moisture. And, actually, you've

420
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,840
combatted that quite nicely cos
it's got a lovely colour underneath.

421
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,160
And I love that. That's a nice pie
there. That's very clever.

422
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,840
He's just eating it now,
he's just eating.  Good. It's fine.

423
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,680
Reminds me of me nan.
SANDI LAUGHS

424
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,760
It's like a proper northern pie.

425
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,760
Very well done.  Thank you.
Thank you.

426
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,080
'The pies were actually baked,
and that was a result.'

427
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,720
How that happened, someone was
obviously looking down on me,

428
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,360
sorting me right out.

429
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,720
Decent. Decent.

430
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,560
I found 30
minutes from somewhere.

431
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,120
I have no idea how I did manage that

432
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,320
because I was 30 minutes
over in practice.

433
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,880
So, shows what I can do when I
actually pay attention to something.

434
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,880
I've never, ever been called
boring before, so that's a first.

435
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,440
Ugh.

436
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,440
The pie was so good at home.
Now, people will think that

437
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,120
I can't make pie.

438
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,120
I can. I can so make pie.

439
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,920
The bakers' next challenge is
a mystery wrapped in pastry.

440
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,600
Right, bakers, I have to tell you
that your Technical Challenge

441
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,960
has been
set for you by Paul.

442
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,800
Paul, have you got any
advice before you leave the tent?

443
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,320
Read it carefully before you start.

444
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,920
Go now, and never darken our
tea towels again.

445
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,480
Until judging, obviously.

446
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,200
For your Technical Challenge,
Paul would like you to tackle

447
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,480
rough-puff pastry...  Of course.

448
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,880
..and make for us pasteis de nata.

449
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,760
Basically, Portuguese tarts.

450
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,200
You need to make 12
of the beauties with a crispy,

451
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,840
firm base and a perfectly-set,
smooth custard.

452
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,720
You've got two hours to
make your Portuguese tarts,

453
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,240
BOTH:  On your marks, get set, bake.

454
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,160
The bakers all have identical
ingredients

455
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,520
and Paul's pared-down recipe.

456
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,640
If I make custard tarts,
I've always done it with shortcrust.

457
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,080
I've never done it with rough-puff.

458
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,200
Have I had a Portuguese tart?
Of course, I have.

459
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,280
I know the pastry -
it's like a spiral.

460
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,400
Yan, how do you say it, babe?
Pasteis de nata.

461
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,080
Pasteis de nata?
ENGLISH ACCENT:  &quot;Pastiche de Nata.&quot;

462
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,440
Egg tart, love.

463
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,360
So, Paul, why have you set pastiche
de Nata as a Technical Challenge?

464
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,720
It's one of my favourite
bakes of all time.

465
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,160
Where do things go wrong?

466
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,560
From the very beginning.

467
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,640
They've got to understand
the philosophy of how a

468
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,280
rough-puff pastry actually works.

469
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,920
You're producing a flat dough with
butter in, and on, and folding it

470
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,640
and chilling it and folding it
again, which pushes the layers apart

471
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,000
which creates this
beautiful, flaky pastry.

472
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,880
Moving on to the filling,
nata meaning cream.

473
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,360
So, although it hasn't got cream in,

474
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,280
the texture is very much
like cream - silky and smooth.

475
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,080
Can we eat one?  You certainly can.

476
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,240
But look at the base.

477
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,800
You have that characteristic
swirl around the bottom

478
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,320
but when you bite in to them...

479
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,160
Go on, then.

480
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,000
Crisp pastry on the outside,
slightly chewy in the middle.

481
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,720
Mm-hmm.  It's really heaven.

482
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,520
Now, they are worth the calories.

483
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,400
They are worth the calories.

484
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,400
It says, &quot;Make the rough-puff pastry
dough using the chilled butter.&quot;

485
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,320
I've never made rough-puff,
so this will be a challenge.

486
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,360
I'm just rubbing the chilled
butter into the flour.

487
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,920
Then, I am going to
add in drops of ice-cold water.

488
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,880
Everything on this is supposed to
be as cold as possible,

489
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,000
so just trying to keep my hands out
of the equation as much as I can.

490
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Just going to try and get the
right consistency.

491
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,040
It feels a bit dry.

492
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,240
STEVEN:  &quot;Roll out the pastry and
half the frozen butter over one
turn.&quot;

493
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,240
So, that, we are going
to add the other half

494
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,600
and we're going to bring it back
over like that.

495
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,840
Forgotten how to fold pastry.

496
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,880
So, it's like you fold it,
and then you turn it,

497
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,400
and then you do it again...I think.

498
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,920
Give it half a turn,
do the same thing again

499
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,480
and that creates the layers
between the pastry and the butter.

500
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,760
so it puffs up,
crispy and flaky.

501
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,480
I have no clue if this is right.

502
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,840
And chill.

503
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,160
I'm going
to make a start on the custard now.

504
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,240
&quot;Heat the milk and the flour
in the pan, infusing the cinnamon

505
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,160
&quot;and pared lemon.&quot;

506
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,960
SANDI: Are you enjoying making it?
No, not really.
I've never made rough-puff before.

507
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,160
I've never made this type of custard
before. I don't know what I'm
doing.

508
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,400
So other than that you have no idea
what you are doing, it's going well?

509
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,280
Yeah.  Great.  It's all under control.

510
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,800
OK, I am going to go and see
if I can, erm,

511
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,720
put you on some dating websites.

512
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,800
Seriously, she's got all the
qualities that you're looking for.

513
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,360
She has no idea what she's doing.

514
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,920
I am going to turn my pastry
over again.

515
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,880
STEVEN:  So this is after the first
chill,

516
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,880
so I am just going to roll it
out a little bit.

517
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,000
Have you ever been to Portugal?

518
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,640
No, I've actually never been to
Portugal. Have you?

519
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,240
Quite beautiful-looking people.

520
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,400
I didn't expect it. &quot;Quite
beautiful-looking...people.&quot;

521
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,000
All the people there are really
beautiful. I'd never felt

522
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,920
so ugly in all my life.

523
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,920
&quot;Add the sugar syrup to the milk
mixture.&quot; So pour that into there.

524
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,680
&quot;Combine with the egg yolks.&quot;

525
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,120
So much whisking.

526
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,320
STEVEN:  With custard, you slowly add
hot milk to egg yolks.

527
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,120
If you don't, you'll curdle the
eggs,

528
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,280
so I am just doing it as
slowly as possible.

529
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,280
I have never made a custard with
an actual whisker,

530
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,920
so I'm not going to really start.

531
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,280
It's looking OK. I don't know
if it's going to bake all right.

532
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,960
&quot;Roll the pastry dough to a
rectangle then roll in to a log.&quot;

533
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,000
How thick a log?

534
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,280
I don't think there's any hidden
messages in there.

535
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,080
I'm just going to go with what
I know.

536
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,080
Right, so, that way.

537
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,160
How many do you have to make -
12?

538
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,960
SHE EXHALES SLOWLY
12 pieces out of that.

539
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,760
I think I see layers.

540
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,320
Cos it kind of forms a nice
little laminated kind of wheel.

541
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,600
I'm very confused.

542
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,560
Doesn't look a very good disc,
does it?

543
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,160
Oh, sugar.

544
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,560
I just realised that
I rolled it the wrong way.

545
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,560
There won't be as much rolls.

546
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,080
You're right.
HE SIGHS

547
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,400
We've gone the wrong way.
I've got the same problem.

548
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,640
HE GROANS
It's so jarring.

549
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,440
That is so annoying.

550
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,400
I just thought it was so obvious to
roll it longways to get it wider.

551
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,760
But, no, it should have been the
other way -

552
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,680
the short way and thinner,
with bigger discs.

553
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,200
So, now, they're
not going to puff up as much.

554
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,920
Now, we should all try

555
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,000
and keep up with the recommended
five pastries a day

556
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
but these Portuguese tarts are borne
of a different habit altogether.

557
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,920
And it was here at the magnificent
Monastery of Jeronimos

558
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,880
in Belem outside Lisbon
that a few religious folks with

559
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,080
frankly time
and egg yolks on their hands created

560
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,880
one of Portugal's most famous bakes
- the great pasteis de nata.

561
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,880
I want to find out exactly how we
got from monks and nuns to tarts.

562
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,120
In Portugal
at the time, there were an awful

563
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,240
lot of monasteries and convents.
And you had a lot of priests

564
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,000
and a lot of nuns,
and they had wimples and vestments.

565
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,280
White clothes.  There's always white
stuff, and it needs starching.

566
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,280
And, in those days,
they used egg whites.

567
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,920
So a lot of yolks left over.

568
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,200
What are you going to do with them?

569
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,080
Using those spare yolks,
the monks of Jeronimos

570
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,080
created their iconic custard tart.
And, 180 years later,

571
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,560
they are
still being made to the same recipe.

572
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,160
Can you show me how to do it?

573
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,400
Just go for constant round movement,
always the same direction,

574
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,680
and don't worry about pressing
it on the top.

575
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,440
Spreading the layers evenly up
the side of the tin is key to

576
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,960
creating the perfect flaky
pastry case.

577
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,280
So I'm going to push, turn.

578
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,920
No, no, no.  No, other way.

579
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,480
It's hard.  It's hard.  Takes a lot of
practice.

580
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,560
They are famous all over the world -
what do you think it is about them?

581
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,760
Being able to keep the original
recipe, and the dough is

582
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,720
actually a little bit salty, I think
it's this contrast between

583
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,280
being sweet and salty that makes it
so special and so different.

584
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,160
It looks like the simplest movement,
but it's a piece of art to make it.

585
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,040
Is it getting better?  It's better.

586
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,040
There you go.

587
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,600
NOEL:  Bakers, you have one hour
left.

588
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,080
And I've got a little Portuguese
fact for you.

589
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,800
Portuguese footballer Cristiano
Ronaldo once fired a custard tart

590
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,160
out of a bazooka, stunning
a chaffinch in flight.

591
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,000
LAUGHTER

592
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,160
So bear that in mind as you
are making your tarts.

593
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,680
It says, &quot;Place each disc in to
a muffin tin.&quot;

594
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,800
&quot;With your fingers,
line the bottom and the sides.&quot;

595
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,800
If the bakers over-handle
their rough-puff, they'll crush

596
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,320
the delicate layers they worked
so hard to build up in the pastry.

597
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,640
HE SIGHS

598
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,000
I am not really happy right now
because it just ripped.

599
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,440
Oh, God.

600
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,760
They are big tins and not much
pastry,

601
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,400
so I'm just trying to make it
stretch a bit.

602
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,400
That's not right. If I had a smaller
tin, I'd be all right.

603
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,120
YAN:  Oh, yeah, baby!

604
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,600
I don't know whether it's supposed
to be like that or not.

605
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,720
They look all right, don't they?  I
think, yeah, I'd like them a bit
neater.

606
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,240
They look quite different to
some of the other bakers'.

607
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,920
Really?
Some people have got smaller cases.

608
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,960
Well, I don't know who is
doing it right.  Who knows?

609
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,800
I don't know whether I should
make them wider, or just do it.

610
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,680
My pastry is absolutely rank.

611
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,120
OK, so I am filling my tarts now.

612
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,480
Custard consistency is key.

613
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,480
Too thick now, and
when it bakes it will never achieve

614
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,880
the silky-smooth
texture of a pasteis de nata.

615
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,040
I have done my custard -
it's definitely right.

616
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,520
It's so foamy. I whisked the eggs
obviously too much.

617
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,440
Do not drop this, Steven.

618
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,000
I am going in.

619
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,600
I'll put them
on for 18 minutes.

620
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,800
12 minutes...I think.

621
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,960
I think they should be kind of set
on top,

622
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,480
and, like, brown, I think.

623
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,640
BUTTONS BEEP

624
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,640
Start it off with ten,
and then check it all the time.

625
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,040
Still wet.

626
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,960
They're a bit puffy at the side.

627
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,680
I don't know what
they're meant to look like.

628
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,320
'Two of them look fully-covered,

629
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,440
'but now they kind of sunk.'

630
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,920
OK, absolute disaster.

631
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,440
They need to be spread out.

632
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,120
CLATTERING

633
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,360
I'm having a bit of a problem.

634
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,000
Right, bakers, five minutes
before you must present your

635
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,400
pasteis de nata.

636
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,440
They are not ready yet.  No.

637
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,920
Are these done?

638
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,600
Yeah. Well, sort of - I just
need to put some colour on them.

639
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,440
OK. How do you do that?
With a little ssh?  Wow.

640
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,600
Little flame-thrower?
I'm not sure...  Bunsen burner?
..I don't think so.

641
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,160
I'm just going to put it
under the grill.  Oh, OK.

642
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,280
I wish they were browner on top.

643
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,120
They're a bit burnt.

644
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,120
They don't look too happy do they,
my pathetic little natas?

645
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,560
They are meant to be browned
a little bit on top - you know
like burnt spots?

646
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,520
I think they have got dark
patches on them.

647
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,480
Pastry is quite crisp.

648
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,320
I really don't know
whether the pastry is done.

649
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,600
Yeah, there's really good
lamination on it, which is awesome.

650
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,560
You have one minute to
finish your tarts off.

651
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,560
Do you know, in another context
that might really sound weird.

652
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,280
I'm playing chicken.

653
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,280
I think it's turned to
scramble the egg. God.

654
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,600
I'm not sure how they're supposed
to look. I just don't know.

655
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,320
They look like the real thing, let's
hope they taste like the real thing.

656
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,600
Bakers, your time is up.

657
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,600
Please bring your pasteis de nata
up to the table.

658
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,760
KATE:  Mine look so burnt.

659
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,960
Paul and Prue will be looking
for perfectly crisp puff pastry

660
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,960
cases with a swirl on the bottom,
filled with smooth, creamy,

661
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,160
lightly-mottled custard.

662
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,440
Shall we get started
on this one, then, Prue?

663
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,560
They are about the right colour.

664
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,280
So this has got a swirl -
it looks quite well-baked as well.

665
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,200
Custard is a little solider
than I'd expect.

666
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,600
Yeah, it's not as light
as it could be, but it is creamy.

667
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,080
And, actually, the shells are OK.

668
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,960
Moving on to number two. What we
have there are chocolate cupcakes.

669
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,480
With a swirl, sort of.

670
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,280
The pastry case isn't too bad.
But that top, you can

671
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,240
taste the burntness coming from it.

672
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,760
Number three.
This is a bit irregular, actually.

673
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,560
The colouring there is not too bad.

674
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,520
My issue is there has been no
lamination on that.

675
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,880
There is no swirl there, either,
underneath.

676
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,360
Huge amounts of issues here.

677
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,800
That's half the depth
it should be. There is a swirl.

678
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,840
Where has all
the rest of the custard gone?

679
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,840
It doesn't look like a pasteis de
nata at all, does it?

680
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,760
The flavour is surprisingly OK.

681
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,000
These shells look much better.

682
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,920
We have the characteristic
swirl underneath.

683
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,040
That's good.

684
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,160
They are a little bit better,
but the custard is quite solid.

685
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,760
I've got great hopes for this one,
cos it looks good.

686
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,920
There is a swirl.
The overall feel is good.

687
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,160
That custard looks to me perfect -
it's creamy, it's got the blotches
on it.

688
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,560
They are pretty good.
The pastry is good,

689
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,360
the custard is particularly good.

690
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,360
Right, last one. This looks
more like shortcrust than flaky.

691
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,400
You can hardly see the swirl at all.
Very tough pastry.

692
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,760
Oh.  Not good.

693
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,760
So who has achieved Portuguese
pasteis de nata perfection?

694
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,120
In seventh spot is this one -
whose is this?

695
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,480
Julia, it's like shortcrust pastry.

696
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,800
In sixth place, this one here.

697
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,760
No-one owning up?

698
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,800
Stacey.

699
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,880
This is not your finest hour.

700
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,840
Kate is fifth, Liam fourth,

701
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,360
and Steven is third.

702
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,640
In second place, we have this one.

703
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,560
Sophie, the swirl is perfect,

704
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,280
the pastry is properly cooked.

705
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,080
It's not a bad pasteis de nata.

706
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,080
That leaves number one.

707
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,320
APPLAUSE

708
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,720
Thank you.

709
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,720
Custard was excellent.

710
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,080
You managed to get the beautiful
mottle on the top,

711
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,600
and the whole thing tasted
very nice.

712
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,120
'I'm totally relieved.'

713
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,640
That takes
a little bit of the edge off,

714
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,480
and now I know that my pie is...
My pie is good.

715
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,920
Not top three, not bottom three.

716
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,240
The plan was to go
kind of higher every week

717
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,560
and I seem to do this all the time.

718
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,800
So I kind of need to be more
consistent, kind of grow a bit more.

719
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:35,000
All to play for tomorrow, I guess.

720
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,240
One pastry challenge remains,

721
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,120
one more chance for the bakers

722
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,880
to earn their place in the tent
next week.

723
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,440
Who do you think is in line
for Star Baker?  I think Liam.

724
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,240
His pie filling was delicious.

725
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,600
I think Sophie has done well.

726
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,280
The butternut squash and the
blue cheese together was delicious,

727
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,720
and the pastry was gorgeous.

728
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,000
So, going into the showstopper,
who's got to pull out all the stops?

729
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,280
Definitely Julia.

730
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,080
Julia was last in Technical,
she struggled with the savoury pie.

731
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,000
She has not had a good week

732
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,080
so she has got to do
something amazing to save herself.

733
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,880
Who else is in trouble?
I'd say Kate.

734
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,200
Kate, actually, has been struggling
the last few weeks.

735
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,320
She is just limping through
week to week.

736
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,520
I'm actually going to throw Stacey
in the mix as well.

737
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,440
Although I did love her savoury pie,
to come sixth in the Technical

738
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,320
will always put you
into a bit of trouble.

739
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,320
If you have a terrible Showstopper,
you're in trouble.

740
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,720
Morning, bakers. Welcome to
your final pastry challenge.

741
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,360
For your Showstopper today,

742
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,760
Prue and Paul would like you to make
a hand-raised pie

743
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,160
with a hot water crust pastry case.

744
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,320
Hot water crust involves water
and it's a bit crusty.

745
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,240
You've got no idea, have you?
No.  No.

746
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,320
The filling is entirely up to you,

747
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,480
but we want one family-sized
pie that can be shared later on,

748
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,760
you know, by four greedy people.

749
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,480
You have four hours
to make your hand-raised pie.

750
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,160
On your marks.  Get set.  Bake!

751
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,520
Right.

752
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,440
'The bakers must start
by making a hot water crust pastry.'

753
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,800
So I'm just melting my lard
with some water.

754
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,920
'The high fat content in this dough
means that it should be able

755
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,840
'to hold its shape in the oven
without a mould.'

756
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,240
There's something impressive, isn't
there, about a hand-raised pie?

757
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,880
You go , &quot;Yeah, I hand raised it.&quot;

758
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,640
Like you brought it up or something.

759
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,880
Paid for its tuition.

760
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,080
They've got to make a family-sized,
hand-raised pie.

761
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,760
It has to be savoury.

762
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,640
They could choose
a vegetarian option,

763
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,280
they could choose a meat option,

764
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,640
but we want it topped
with glazed fruit,

765
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,760
and it must complement
the filling inside.

766
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,600
What I'm looking for is
really good powerful flavours,

767
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,760
and when you cut a slice of the pie,

768
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,760
the whole thing must hold together
like a slice of cake.

769
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,760
The traditional hand-raised pie
uses, essentially, a dolly

770
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,640
or a mould which you shape
your hot water crust pastry round

771
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,280
to create the overall shape
of the pie.

772
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,280
Oh, it's the lard.
It stinks like hell.

773
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,560
I've just got flour and butter
in here and lard.

774
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,680
The idea is
that it's more watertight

775
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,520
so it can keep in juices
without getting too soggy.

776
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,200
Sophie's watertight piecrust will be
topped with forest fruits

777
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,080
and filled with venison, rabbit,

778
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,120
wild boar and guinea fowl.

779
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,240
One of the big things with
a game pie is when you cut them

780
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,840
the amount of liquid that comes out
of the bottom of it is horrendous.

781
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,560
Yeah.  How are you combating that?

782
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,400
I have a little syringe
so at least if I extract the juice

783
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,920
then it's moist
without it flooding out.  Yeah.

784
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,440
Hand-raised pies,
the concept is simple,

785
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,560
but it's got to not look like
it was made in a factory,

786
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,840
but, you know,
you can't serve up a wonky pie.

787
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,200
Steven's pie will be full of

788
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,960
the flavours of a Christmas dinner

789
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,120
and for a touch of festive bling,

790
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,520
he'll be topping it with

791
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,480
glazed, glittery cranberries.

792
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,680
I was going to try and be smart
and put a mini Santa in or something

793
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,880
but, no.

794
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,240
No, Steven, curb your design
this week.

795
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,640
This is all about the pastry.

796
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,440
Most of the bakers are sticking to

797
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,120
the traditional
hot water crust recipe.

798
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,760
Look at that.

799
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,360
But Liam and Kate are
spicing things up.

800
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,040
I'm making turmeric pastry.

801
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,160
I don't know
if it will be that great,

802
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,640
but it should be all right.

803
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,040
I'm doing a turmeric hot water crust

804
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,080
and inside I am doing
a potato and onion curry.

805
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,200
Floats my boat.

806
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,000
Topped with mango and chilli,

807
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,240
Kate's simple potato curry pie

808
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,360
will be encased in

809
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,720
a thin, crisp pastry.

810
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,680
Now, the hot water crust pastry,
you're using this as your mould.

811
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,160
This, yeah.  That is a very big
mould. Have you got enough pastry?

812
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,200
Yes, cos I don't like
really, really thick pastry anyway,

813
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,040
so I'm going to roll it
relatively thin.

814
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,240
I'm looking forward to this,

815
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,480
especially with the mango and chilli
on the top as well.

816
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,480
I'm only worried about whether
that pastry will be a bit too thin.

817
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,640
So I'm going to start
raising my pie.

818
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,680
I'm going to shake the pastry around
upside down,

819
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,240
I'm going to roll it out on the top,

820
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,040
bring it around the sides
to the bottom.

821
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,520
'Because the pies must bake
without their moulds,

822
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,680
'ensuring the walls have
an even thickness is crucial.'

823
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,720
If they are too thin at the base,
that is when it will collapse.

824
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,000
'Hand-raised pies have been made
this way for hundreds of years,

825
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,160
'but 19-year-old Liam is
doing it his own way.'

826
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,720
I'm using a cake tin.

827
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,880
I originally formed it around it,
but it didn't work for me.

828
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,680
So your binding the inside?  Mm-hm.

829
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,920
What's your problem, Hollywood?
What is it?

830
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,680
Traditionally it is on the outside.

831
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,400
Not the inside.

832
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,800
Ignore his face, Liam. Look away.
Look away from his face.

833
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,120
Liam's take on a hand-raised pie is
also a tribute

834
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,000
to his nan's Sunday dinners.

835
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,400
He will fill his pie crust
with curried goat

836
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,680
and top it with
a mango and avocado salsa.

837
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,680
So, do I take the risk of doing it
the traditional way...

838
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,800
..to make boss man happy?

839
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,800
Or do I stick to my guns...

840
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,480
..and do what I've done at home?

841
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,640
Hmm.

842
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,640
'But Liam is not the only baker

843
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,440
who's crust could land them
in hot water.

844
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,120
So I've read in books,
hand-raised pies,

845
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,280
and they mould it on the inside
so I didn't know what to believe.

846
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,280
So I chose the easiest option,
as you do.

847
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,240
Liam, I am doing it exactly
the same way as Liam though.

848
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,760
I have no idea what to do.  Outside.

849
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,840
I've never actually tried doing it
that way.

850
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,840
Never.  Just change it.
I've never tried it.  Oh.  Never.

851
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
I think I'm going to do it.

852
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,360
So I'm going to give myself
a challenge.

853
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,000
If it works, it'll work.

854
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,520
I'm just going to go and do it.

855
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,520
I'm not going to change it
because...

856
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,840
What's the point?

857
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,560
Shall I redo it?

858
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,280
Are you tempted to redo it?

859
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,040
Yeah, cos they might mark me down
otherwise.

860
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,400
But what I don't want is
to serve a raw pie.  Right.

861
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,680
So I'm going to go with this one
and serve it and take the hit.

862
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,160
Yan's hoping to distract the judges

863
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,080
with her pie's colourful
chequerboard interior

864
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,280
and her elaborate fruit topping.

865
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,760
I know this one works
because I'd done it several times.

866
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,840
Fingers crossed.

867
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,600
Now it's all kind of going OK.

868
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,600
I'm just going to bang it
in the freezer for a little bit.

869
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,320
Yeah, it looks all right.

870
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,280
Slam it in the freezer
to firm it up.

871
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,160
'Whilst the pie crusts chill...'

872
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,480
Right, meat time.

873
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,640
'..the baker's move on
to their fillings.'

874
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,000
Whoa!  I just lost half of my hair.

875
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
This is a roux-based sauce
so very thick sauce.

876
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,920
I'm adding blue cheese
for the flavour.

877
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,040
When you cut into it,
it kind of holds it all together.

878
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,400
Julia's blue cheese sauce will bind

879
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,080
her flavour-packed fillings

880
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,440
which she will layer

881
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,760
into her pie crust

882
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,040
before removing the mould.

883
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,040
I feel a bit nervous, obviously,
because I do feel the pressure.

884
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,800
But at the same time, I feel good.

885
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,800
I will just try and enjoy what I do.

886
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,360
And hopefully it all will
go to plan.

887
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,760
I'm making a meat-free pie.

888
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,440
So it's got a layer of paneer
and then a layer of curry

889
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,200
and then a layer of eggs.

890
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,080
Sometimes it's nice just to have
something without meat for a change.

891
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,480
Stacey will set off the flavours
of her lentil curry filling

892
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,440
with glazed mango cubes.

893
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,600
Have you practised this at home?
I have.

894
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,560
I did two on Friday and one was
like ugh,

895
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,200
and the other one standing proud

896
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,200
so I'm hopefully going to do
a standing proud one today.

897
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,400
One hour of the bake has
already gone.

898
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,560
And whilst Yan and Julia are
filling their pies

899
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,800
before removing them
from the mould...

900
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,200
Not the most appetising of looks,
I apologise.

901
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
..the other bakers...
It's going to come out.

902
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,760
..are about to find out

903
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,920
if they have successfully
hand-raised their pies.

904
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,920
I'm going to try and take it off the
mould which is the difficult bit.

905
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:54,080
I don't like this.
How do I get this out?

906
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,000
It's got holes in the bottom cos if
you don't have holes in the bottom,

907
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,880
it creates a vacuum and
nothing's coming out.

908
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,320
I'm a crust whisperer.
I'll talk that out.

909
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,120
Come on. Come on, fella.

910
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,120
Just...

911
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:12,120
Why isn't it coming off?

912
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,520
Are you allowed to do this?

913
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,520
Stop me. I dare you.

914
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,400
There you go.  Oh, yes! Thank you.

915
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,960
It's happening. Come on.

916
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,480
There you go.

917
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,240
What's the baking handshake?

918
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,560
What was it?
This one and then this.  Solid.

919
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,480
Me and Paul do that
when you're not looking.  Is it?

920
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,480
Try and keep up with the youth.

921
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,600
Completely cracking.

922
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,400
Hurry up and fill the thing.

923
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,640
I have put some spinach leaves,

924
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,880
and then on the top,
it's the rest of the meets.

925
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,800
They didn't want to
layer it too much,

926
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,160
I didn't want it to be too fussy,

927
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,880
but when you cut it open,
it's got to look pretty.

928
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,080
Everyone else is
doing, like, mad layers and stuff

929
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,240
and I'm just, like, potato.

930
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,240
I've just realised something
really bad.

931
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,360
There's a bit of baking
parchment in the bottom.

932
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,280
I'm going to put my lid on
and crimp it in.

933
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,080
I've got to sort myself out now

934
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,640
cos I've got to get this
in the oven.

935
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,800
Not good.

936
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:36,000
At all.

937
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,480
Bakers, you are halfway through

938
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,600
your hand-raised pie
Showstopper Challenge.

939
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,600
For Julia and Yan, it's
the moment of truth.

940
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,800
Doesn't come off.

941
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,960
Don't tell them I did that!

942
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,360
I'm really scared to take it out of
the mould.

943
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,200
OK, do you need help?  Yeah.

944
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,520
This wrap that I put around the edge
is to hold it,

945
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,520
just for the first half an hour
whilst that pastry sets.

946
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,440
What do you do at home?
I use a palette knife.

947
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,840
What are you doing?
Um, trying to patch up a crack.

948
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,760
Patching up your crack?
I've got a big crack.

949
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,640
Ow!  That's going to leak everywhere.

950
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,560
Leakage?  Leaky crack, it's really
not a good thing.

951
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,640
NOEL LAUGHS

952
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,240
If you take that off, would it be
easy just to pull it apart or...?

953
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,680
Take what off?  This...this is
holding it together, right?

954
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,680
Oh, my God. I can't believe I'm so
stupid.

955
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,680
Got to get it in the oven.

956
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,440
That's probably going to go in for
about an hour, actually.

957
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,000
There's raw meat in there, but I
don't want it to be dried out.

958
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,120
That's the problem with turkey.

959
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,800
I'm just putting a bit of foil
cos I don't want the sort of top

960
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,080
of the meat to burn
cos there's no lid,

961
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,080
so just trying to keep a bit of
moisture in.

962
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,640
My aim was to sort of go for, like,
erm, straight on one side

963
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,960
and kind of caved in on the
other side

964
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,960
with, like, a floppy kind of look.

965
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,600
That's my aim. Yeah.

966
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,600
I think they'll buy that.

967
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,360
I am syringing off the juices from
the pie

968
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,520
cos there's a lot of it.

969
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,960
Let's get glazing.

970
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,680
I'm making my mango
and avocado salsa.

971
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,680
Mango, avocado, pomegranate,
red onions, lime juice, lime zest.

972
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,360
Peaches go with pork.

973
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,760
Apricots go with pork.

974
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,720
Figs go with pork. I quite enjoy a
bit of fruit.

975
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,040
Makes you feel not so guilty

976
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,520
when you're having a
massive, great, big fatty pie.

977
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,440
This is for the topping.
Are you OK? You seem fine.

978
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,960
Yeah, fine. You know me.

979
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,960
I'm not a big one with public
displays of emotion.

980
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,960
One day you'll crack, though,
you know that?

981
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,920
And burn the tent to the ground!

982
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,240
COCKNEY ACCENT:  Bakers, you've got
one hour left.

983
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,080
Get your bleedin' pies out the oven!

984
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,480
Have you got Russell Brand's
underpants on?

985
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,720
I'm going to take
my baking paper off

986
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,720
and hope that it's going to hold
its shape.

987
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,040
It held. Good.

988
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,400
I'm pleased with that.

989
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,880
It's still soggy. God.

990
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,640
It's a disaster.
All...everything about it.

991
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,120
But maybe they won't notice.

992
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,960
That...that could happen.

993
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,680
Paul could suddenly...turn into
a different person.

994
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,520
Yes.

995
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,440
All right, get in there.

996
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,000
I want to get somewhere between
70 and 74.

997
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,560
I'll go up to 74 cos
there's meat in it.

998
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,040
63. Got to get up to...

999
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,440
..70.

1000
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,040
It's quite quick to cook.

1001
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,040
Ugh, I don't like this bit.

1002
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,800
It's cooking nicely.

1003
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,640
I reckon it's got another ten
minutes left.

1004
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,640
It looks done, but it's the
temperature at the top.

1005
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,320
It's just infuriating.

1006
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,320
Bakers, you have 15 minutes to
finish hand-raising those pies.

1007
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,960
I'll give it another minute
for luck.

1008
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,680
My pie is all right.
It's not too bad.

1009
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,040
Pie is cooked. Yeah.
It's looking cooked.

1010
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,360
One side is all right.

1011
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,960
Meh!

1012
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,920
I'm going to give it another
ten minutes.

1013
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,600
If it's not done, they can't eat it.

1014
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,920
Whacked it up, the lot,
so just got to wait.

1015
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,720
It looks beautiful!
The top cracked a little bit.

1016
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,200
Just hope it's going to be fine
because haven't got much time left.

1017
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,560
So, what have you got to do next?

1018
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,560
So, I'm just going to cover it
with the fruit.

1019
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,560
It's a shimmer spray.

1020
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,280
And then...

1021
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,960
make it rain.

1022
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,960
Could not be serving something
without bit of camp in it.

1023
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,360
Wow, that's gorgeous.
That's awesome.

1024
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,680
Very cool.

1025
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,720
I can't put my topping on
cos it's not flat.

1026
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,400
It keeps falling off!

1027
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,320
Five minutes.

1028
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,160
One minute heating?

1029
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,160
To the last, almost
to the last minute.

1030
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,520
Ah, it's cooked!

1031
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,840
You've got one minute left.
One minute.

1032
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,840
Don't want to have to do to this
when it's warm, but...

1033
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,080
Do you want me to help?

1034
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,880
Could you take some of these and
just, like...?  Shove them on.

1035
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,840
If you can, yeah.

1036
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,840
Right, that is the end of your
Showstopper Challenge.

1037
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,880
Absolute disaster-looking thing.

1038
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,000
The bakers and their
hand-raised pies

1039
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
must now face the judgment of
Paul and Prue.

1040
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,320
Did everything go to plan?

1041
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,440
I'll know when you cut it open!

1042
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,440
Takes a long time to get that even,
smooth outside.

1043
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I mean, it is beautifully done.

1044
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,800
Well done.

1045
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,880
Yes.

1046
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,240
To do that much game and not get any
liquid out of there,

1047
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,160
is very, very good.

1048
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,120
I think it's an amazing
construction

1049
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,640
and I love all the flavours.

1050
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,080
The forest fruits cut through that,
that tartness really cuts through,

1051
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,920
but it's that pastry, it's too thick
on the side,

1052
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,920
and so you've got that raw bit of
hot water crust running through it.

1053
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,440
I think it looks great.

1054
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,800
Oh, look at that. Doesn't that
look perfect?

1055
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,800
The pastry's thin,
but it's held well.

1056
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,560
I think the flavour is lovely.

1057
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,480
And I think it looks pretty.

1058
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,520
Love that.  Do you?

1059
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,880
Yeah. Absolutely.

1060
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,400
The coolness of the mango with the
curry just works.

1061
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,400
Very clever.  Thank you.

1062
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,200
It does look a bit of a mess.
It certainly looks home-made.

1063
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,200
It probably should have been a bit
more professional-looking.

1064
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,520
One other thing I kind of have to
tell you...

1065
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,480
..I'm afraid there's a bit of
baking parchment in the bottom.

1066
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,560
Like a surprise?  No, it's actually
in the pie, isn't it?

1067
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,520
Yeah, it's actually in the pie.
When I took it out of the mould,

1068
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,760
it was falling apart so I filled it
up really quickly

1069
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,640
and the parchment circle is still
in there.

1070
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,560
I'm so sorry.

1071
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,800
I think if you were having this
as a meal, it would work.

1072
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,920
You've made a dish which tastes good

1073
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,920
and haven't considered the
hot water crust pastry.  Yep.

1074
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,320
Look how straight those sides are.

1075
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,160
It's neat, it's got a
lovely colour on it.

1076
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,880
It looks really moist and
attractive.

1077
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,800
It does look good.

1078
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,240
You know...overall, it's a
bit bland.

1079
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,440
The stuffing and the turkey almost
taste identical.

1080
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,320
The Brussels sprouts are
almost immaterial.

1081
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,320
It's a bit of a let-down
on the flavour.

1082
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,560
Now, this one was done inside
the tin?

1083
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:26,560
Mm-hm.  Is that right?  Yep.

1084
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,720
I think it looks all right.

1085
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,920
The little bit of crimping looks
quite nice as well,

1086
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,080
but I'm dying to see that
chequerboard inside.

1087
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,680
OK.  Oh, that does look good.

1088
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,880
Wow.  Very nice.

1089
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,960
It's quite stunning.
The pastry is crispy.

1090
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,840
It's golden. Nice, rich flavour to
it as well.

1091
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,480
All the sausage meats
taste different,

1092
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,920
and the fruit works with it.

1093
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,920
I think it's absolutely wonderful.
Yes!

1094
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:53,400
Could have been much neater...  Yeah.
..where the lid meets the sides,

1095
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,440
and they look a bit sad,
sitting on the top.

1096
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,440
Now, you did this in the tin.  Yeah.

1097
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,520
I don't think the asparagus works.

1098
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,280
It's all been in the oven too long
cos the chicken is dry

1099
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,800
and the asparagus is overcooked.

1100
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,800
On the other hand, the
pastry is undercooked.

1101
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,720
My conscience kicked in,

1102
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,400
so I ended up doing it the
traditional way of using the outside

1103
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,840
of the cake tin.

1104
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,840
Does your conscience have steely
blue eyes and a silver-grey beard?

1105
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,280
LAUGHTER

1106
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,280
Right.

1107
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,200
Wow. It's holding together
quite nicely.

1108
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,200
But the colours are fantastic.
Look at that.

1109
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,920
Considering it's quite a lean meat,
goat,

1110
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,600
that is succulent, it's juicy.

1111
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,480
You've got the plantain that gives
you that lovely smoothness to it

1112
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,160
and that tropical flavour as well,

1113
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,720
but, together, it's really nice and
when you get that fruit,

1114
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,600
that salsa as well,
it's spectacular.

1115
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,080
It's absolutely wonderful.

1116
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,560
Your grandma is a genius.

1117
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,200
Get in! Yes, Nan!

1118
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,920
What's your grandma's name?  Cynthia.

1119
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,000
Will she come round to my house
and cook this?

1120
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,200
Any time.

1121
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,840
Just wanted to make my nan proud
cos, like, her food is crazy,

1122
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,320
like, crazy good. Crazy good.

1123
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,160
#Cynthia.

1124
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,000
Sadly, I haven't felt like
this since week one.

1125
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,880
I'll be so gutted.

1126
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,840
I mean, desperately gutted
if I go home.

1127
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,520
I'm very pleased with the comments,
I'm really, really pleased,

1128
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,080
but, yeah, there's just...

1129
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,840
..really worried that...

1130
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:35,000
..that's not enough, really.

1131
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,040
So we were worried about Julia and
Kate, coming into the Showstopper.

1132
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,360
Are we still worried?

1133
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,840
I thought Kate's looked amazing.

1134
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,280
Love potato curry.

1135
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,160
And for me, I think
she saved herself.

1136
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,840
I thought Julia's was a bit untidy.

1137
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,240
The pastry was a bit thick,
and raw in places.

1138
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,280
Don't forget, she actually
did it in the tin.

1139
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,480
Which, again, does that
fit the brief?

1140
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,920
I think Stacey is in trouble.

1141
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,920
Look at the pie. The flavours
were all over the place.

1142
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,520
I think she struggled
on pastry week.

1143
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,840
So who is in line for Star Baker?

1144
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,720
I think Liam, Yan,
that's a good pastry.

1145
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,360
And it's a great filling. And...

1146
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,560
I think Sophie is still there.

1147
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:15,200
Yeah.  The thing about Sophie
was her wonderful fruits of the

1148
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,640
forest on top.  It did look good,
it looked very professional,

1149
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,120
the crimping was great.
Liam just astonishes me,

1150
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,560
week after week. He is... He's
something of a genius with flavour.

1151
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,520
He's got an instinct for
what goes with whatever.

1152
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,280
Can you see Sandi over the pie?

1153
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,280
Oh, shut up.

1154
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,840
Bakers, the person who is
Star Baker this week,

1155
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,880
used the wisdom of their elders to
create a wonderful Showstopper.

1156
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,000
Star Baker is...

1157
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
..Liam.

1158
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,360
So that leaves me
with the horrible job.

1159
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:05,360
You are all amazing, you're down to
the last seven, it's incredible.

1160
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,200
Somebody has to go home,
and it's really painful.

1161
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,200
The person leaving
the tent this week is...

1162
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,240
..Julia.

1163
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,960
I am so sorry.

1164
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,960
Sorry, sweetheart.

1165
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,840
You did amazing,
you know that right?

1166
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,600
You did incredible.

1167
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,400
Well done, Jules. You did well.

1168
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,440
You did very well.  Of course I will
carry on baking, that's my passion,

1169
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,440
that's... I'm very lucky to find my
passion in something I enjoy doing

1170
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,720
and I absolutely love
when I am only 21.

1171
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,160
And, you know what?
There is only one place.

1172
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,640
There is, there.

1173
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,640
Well done.  Thank you.

1174
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,400
Yeah.

1175
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,400
Star Baker. I didn't think
I would ever get it.

1176
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,960
Just over the moon.

1177
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,160
Over the moon. Um, yeah.

1178
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:11,160
It's like... Oh.

1179
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,280
That's me done, I could go
next week now I've got Star Baker.

1180
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,880
Mum, I got Star Baker.

1181
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,560
Oh, my God.

1182
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,560
Why are you crying?

1183
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,920
Next time...
Under pressure, immense pressure.

1184
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,480
A Mediterranean meltdown...

1185
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,280
Oh.  ..in our first ever
Italian Week.

1186
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,880
This is hot.

1187
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,680
With a deep-fried
Sicilian signature...

1188
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,040
That is heaven.

1189
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,320
..a technical take away...

1190
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,000
You look like a pizza.  I know.

1191
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,400
..and the most demanding
pastry Showstopper...

1192
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,480
So much pastry.

1193
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,280
..the Bake Off has ever seen.

1194
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:48,280
I'm going to faint.  These are
going to be &quot;ugli-atelle&quot;.

1195
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:17,000
