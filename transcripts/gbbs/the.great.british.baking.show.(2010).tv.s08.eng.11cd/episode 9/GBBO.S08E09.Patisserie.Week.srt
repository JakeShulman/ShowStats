GBBO.S08E09.Patisserie.Week.srt

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Come on, you can do it.
Noel, I need one more egg.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,120
That's what I've been saying.
Come on, you've got one more in you.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,840
I know you can do this.
Come on, chicken,

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,120
the fate of The Great British
Bake Off lies up your...

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,320
I was just trying to be a bit less
personal.  Oh, sorry.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,000
Why do we need another egg anyway?
It's patisserie week.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,160
Come on, Malcolm, please, for me.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,240
Malcolm? The chicken is called
Malcolm?

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,760
Yeah, Malcolm Eggs.  Any chance
we're wasting our time here?

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,800
Getting to the semifinal...

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,200
Ah!

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,400
..meant conquering forgotten bakes.

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,440
Don't leak!

15
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,920
Steven impressed again...

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,480
Mmm, I could just sit there
and eat a lot of that.

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,120
..but Stacey's bold approach...

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,440
Now that's a good colour.

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,720
..paid off at long last...

20
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,200
Wow, Stacey, I think that's
a real achievement.

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,800
..winning her Star Baker
for the very first time.

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,520
Kate was almost history...

23
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,160
I've literally dropped a clanger!

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,040
..but it was Liam...
It's raw.  ..whose time was up.

25
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,240
I'm just not catching
any flavours at all.  OK.

26
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,160
And we said goodbye to
this year's youngest baker.

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,160
I'm so sorry.  I can look back
and think, yeah, I smashed it.

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,800
Now, to reach the final...

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,360
Come along, dear.

30
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,840
..the bakers must master...

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,800
Oh, it's breaking and melting.
..patisserie...

32
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,280
I've done it wrong, I've done
it wrong, I've done it wrong.

33
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,520
..with three of the most
demanding challenges...

34
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,520
Really pushed for time now actually.

35
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,080
..and one of the closest calls...

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,360
Oh, my God!

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,920
..the tent has ever seen.

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,440
Do not crack on me.

39
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,600
This has been the hardest decision
that I've been involved with

40
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,600
in eight years of the Bake Off.

41
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,040
The semifinals are upon us.

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,040
Four bakers remain but next week's
grand final only has room for three.

43
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,760
This week, the pressure
has just tripled.

44
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,600
You've got to be
absolutely perfect here.

45
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,080
One small mistake can cost you
your place in the final.

46
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,120
Patisserie week's about precision
and finesse, so I just hope I've got

47
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,560
enough time to be able to do it,
cos I know I can do it.

48
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,600
Patisserie is very much the kind
of stuff that I love doing.

49
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,080
That's not necessarily saying
I'm any good at it!

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,400
I was going to tone it down a bit
this week and then I decided,

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,520
nah, I'm not going to
tone it down at all.

52
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,040
In fact, I'm going to tone it up.

53
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,600
Just three more bakes to show
Paul and Prue why they deserve

54
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,800
the chance to become
Bake Off champion.

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,560
I hadn't dared think that far ahead
but now it's in very close

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,640
reaching distance, to say I'm
a finalist would be amazing.

57
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,760
I want to get to the final.

58
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,120
I want to prove to myself
that I'm good enough.

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,200
Let's leave that one there, though!

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,240
I am fully aware that I'm here
by the skin of my teeth

61
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,480
after last week. I'm just going
to give it my best shot.

62
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,200
I intend on getting through
to the final.

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,200
I thought, I'm here, I might
as well give it a go.

64
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,320
Well, morning, bakers, and
congratulations on making it

65
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,160
to the semifinals.
Just four of you left.

66
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,240
Absolutely no pressure!

67
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,200
I can feel your relaxed
vibes from here.

68
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,520
Now, it's patisserie week so,
for your Signature Challenge,

69
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,200
Paul and Prue would love you
to make 24 choux buns.

70
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,320
Now, your choux buns need
to be light and airy,

71
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,960
filled with two different flavours.
Half of them must be iced

72
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,960
and the other half must exhibit
a perfect craquelin.

73
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,120
That's that crunchy, sugary bit
on top.  I love a bit of craquelin.

74
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,720
You've got two and a half hours.

75
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,320
On your marks...
Get set...

76
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,640
Bake!

77
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,160
At least when there's 12 of you,
there's quite a lot of people

78
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,640
to leave. Now, it's like,
this is it, one more person.

79
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,040
The worst thing that can happen
today is the choux buns don't rise,

80
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,040
they're too irregular,
the tent caves in...

81
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,760
We've asked the bakers to make
24 choux buns.

82
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,280
What we're looking for is
a crispy outside,

83
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,080
beautiful and airy on the inside
and the flavours must complement

84
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,840
each other, from the icing
on the top, or the craquelin,

85
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,800
to the unctuous filling inside.

86
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,360
Craquelin.

87
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,360
It's thin dough, goes
on top of the choux pastry

88
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,280
and bakes in the oven with it,

89
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,440
and it comes out with
a crackly, crunchy top.

90
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,040
We're expecting exquisite pastry.

91
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,160
This is their chance to show us
how good they actually are.

92
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,160
Are they worthy to get into the
final of The Great British Bake Off?

93
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,240
I'm making the craquelin topping
first so that I can put it
in the freezer.

94
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,960
It's a mix of sugar,
flour and butter

95
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,920
and you place a little disc
on top of each choux bun.

96
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,480
It's basically a little jacket, a
little jacket for your choux pastry.

97
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,560
As it bakes, as the choux puffs,

98
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,320
it splits it apart,
so you get crackling. Oops!

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,840
Good morning, Steven, how are you?

100
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,960
Good morning, very well,
how are you?  Very good.

101
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,560
Tell us all about your choux buns.

102
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,600
Craquelin. We've got
a wholemeal coconut top.

103
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,960
Wholemeal?

104
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,600
Wholemeal flour because the centre
is a Key lime coconut cheesecake.

105
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,720
It's almost back to front?  Yeah.

106
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,360
Not content with transforming
choux into cheesecake,

107
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Steven's also turning buns into
Bakewell tarts using frangipane,

108
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,200
creme patissiere and raspberry jam.

109
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,080
I know you quite well now, so when
you're a little bit more stressed...

110
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,680
The eye twitches.  You just get
little bright red cheeks.

111
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,280
It's been a pretty rough week.

112
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,200
It's a combination of developing
these recipes and knowing that

113
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,360
this carries me through
to the final.

114
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,720
The pressure's on.  Thank you
very much, mate.  Thank you.

115
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,720
I'm just rolling out the craquelin
between two bits of parchment.

116
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,720
Accuracy is the key
to perfect craquelin.

117
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,320
You have to roll it out
to very thin.

118
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,680
About two millimetres.

119
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,400
Too thick and it will prevent
the choux from rising.

120
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,400
I did rush that a bit and I'm not
sure I've done it very well.

121
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,520
You see, it's still got
some bits of sugar there.

122
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,680
I want to do it again.

123
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,680
I've upped my game for this
and it's just so important.

124
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,920
Good morning, Stacey.  It seems to me
you always do twice the work

125
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,920
of anybody, because you
quite often start again.

126
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,160
It doesn't take long, but
I just need to do it properly.

127
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,880
Right, tell us all
about your choux buns.

128
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,920
One's choux-mojis.  Choux-mojis?

129
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,160
And the other ones,
I'm doing choux-nicorns.

130
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,680
Choux-nicorns!  Can you tell me how
it's going to look like a unicorn?

131
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,880
Well, it's not going to look
like a real unicorn.

132
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,280
Did you just say the words,
&quot;a real unicorn&quot;?

133
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,440
Stacey's cramming her iced
choux-nicorns with multicoloured

134
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,280
creme patissiere and filling her
choux-mojis with banoffee cream

135
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,000
before piping faces onto
yellow-dyed craquelin.

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,840
You like girlie things
and things for children?

137
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,760
I didn't want to just have
a boring choux bun.

138
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,360
I wanted to go for something
different.  Sometimes you go too far

139
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,440
down the overall effect
and forget about the bake.

140
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,880
It's about finding that balance
between great flavour,

141
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,480
great texture and making it
look like it should be

142
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,200
in the front of any patisserie shop.

143
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,320
Hopefully it'll work
and hopefully you'll love it

144
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,640
and you'll want it for your next
birthday party, Paul.

145
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,920
I'll give you a call.
Thank you, Stacey.

146
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,760
Yeah, happy with that.

147
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,760
That is going in the fridge.

148
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,080
The start of my choux pastry.

149
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,080
Unlike most pastries, choux must
be cooked before it's baked.

150
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,280
It just seems really unnatural
to make pastry in this way.

151
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,320
Twice the chance for it to go wrong.

152
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,840
I've just got the butter melting.

153
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,960
When the butter's melted,
I'll bring it to boil,

154
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,040
put the flour in and then
start making my choux.

155
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Right, this is the craquelin
which needs to go in now.

156
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,480
I'm making the choux. I've got
to get on. I've got to get my

157
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,600
flour ready because that's got to be
poured in at exactly the right time.

158
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,280
You have to add it in one go

159
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,560
and then you have
to beat it furiously.

160
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,520
I'm just trying to avoid
any lumps forming.

161
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,360
It needs to be totally smooth.

162
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,560
You want it to come
cleanly away from the pan.

163
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,680
I'm just treating it quite nastily.

164
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,920
I'm doing a strawberry and rhubarb,

165
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,080
so it's going to have
vanilla craquelin.

166
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,960
The strawberry and rhubarb creme pat
and a white chocolate ganache.

167
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,400
It's got to look like it could be

168
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,520
in a shop front of a little
French patisserie.

169
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,640
Sophie also hopes to bring
the flavours of French patisserie

170
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,680
to her choux, filling her
chocolate fondant iced buns

171
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,000
with a classic vanilla
chestnut mousse.

172
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,880
We went to Paris and I had
the Mont Blanc, which is

173
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,800
a French delicacy and it's
made with a chestnut puree.

174
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,280
Yeah, it's lovely. I think
this particular challenge

175
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,320
plays to your strengths.
It's the kind of stuff that I love.

176
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,840
Does that put more pressure on you?
Yeah, a little bit.

177
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,960
Cos then they'll be like,
&quot;Oh, patisserie, eh? Disappointing.&quot;

178
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,160
Are you feeling the nerves?
This week in particular,

179
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,720
little pang in the stomach.
The butterflies are coming?  Yeah.

180
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,360
Good luck.  Thank you very much.

181
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,360
When it comes to flavours, Kate's
taking her buns on a European tour.

182
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,880
Kate!  Hello.  Choux buns.

183
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,960
I'm doing Valencian orange and
brown sugar with a craquelin top,

184
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,600
and I'm doing a Bellini one
with a prosecco and peach cream.

185
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,160
How are you making the peach cream?
I'm making a sort of peach puree.

186
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,520
You're not using any
artificial flavours?

187
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,360
I'm using a little bit of prosecco
and a little bit of peach.

188
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,040
Prosecco artificial flavour?

189
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,920
Yeah.  Wow, could you just add
prosecco flavouring to fizzy water?

190
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,000
I was made up when I found it!

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,560
With her creme Chantilly inspired by
the famous Venetian cocktail

192
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,960
and her Valencian orange
creme patissiere,

193
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,520
Kate's aiming to capture the fresh
flavours of both Italy and Spain.

194
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,960
Sometimes when you've introduced
flavours in the past,

195
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,720
they haven't come through, or
they've come through too strong.

196
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,200
It's about finding that balance
and making sure it's right.

197
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,720
I do think she's got good ideas.

198
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,640
I mean, both of those flavours
could be absolutely fantastic.

199
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,560
Listen to that and you come with me.

200
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,560
Thank you. Thank you, Kate.
All right, thank you.

201
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,800
I'm putting the eggs in now.

202
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,880
This is the most important bit
of the whole thing.

203
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,880
The wrong amount of egg will scupper
choux before it even hits the oven.

204
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,680
If you put too much egg in it,
there's no way you can save it.

205
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,760
You've just got to start
from scratch.

206
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,040
You can't really follow a recipe,
you just have to go by eye.

207
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,040
Over-egg and the mix won't puff up.

208
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,120
Under-egg and the buns
could collapse.

209
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,760
It looks lumpy before it starts
looking OK, so you've just got to

210
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,920
work through
and have confidence in it.

211
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,520
One test for finished choux is...

212
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,040
..that peak should fall over.

213
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,920
A little bit more egg.

214
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,960
A little bit more.

215
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,080
Almost there.

216
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,120
That's good, I'm quite happy with
this, basically how it looks.

217
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,880
I don't know, kind of like that.

218
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,520
Cool. I think we're there.

219
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,320
Right, I need to start piping
these now.

220
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,160
Hello, Kate, are you excited?  Yeah.

221
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,600
It is hard not to think
about the final?

222
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm not going there.
Do you dream about the final?

223
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,760
Yeah, but I'm not in it!

224
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,640
THEY LAUGH

225
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,320
I do really want to try
to get these equal shapes

226
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,920
and sizes and it is so difficult.

227
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,680
You seem very calm.

228
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,200
That's making me little bit nervy.

229
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,680
I do yoga.  Do you do it
with the other bakers?

230
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,440
No, but we should try it.
I'm in. Me and Paul.

231
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,040
I don't know if Paul's got
the sort of right...

232
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,520
He's very flexible.  Is he?

233
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,200
Paul is...  His forward roll is
honestly better than his Swiss roll,

234
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,600
if I'm completely honest
with you.

235
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,040
Just flatten them out
using a bit of water.

236
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,800
It will encourage it
to grow into a ball shape.

237
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,120
Sophie is particularly good
with this.

238
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,440
Sophie likes patisserie,
Sophie's good at patisserie,

239
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,480
this should be your week. That's
always a bit of additional pressure.

240
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,880
I'm going to put them in now,
just see what happens.

241
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,040
20 minutes.

242
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,960
I've got to get them
nice and crispy.

243
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,480
It's all about cooking time.

244
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,800
Start off with 20 minutes.

245
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,640
And I'm going to monitor them
after that amount of time.

246
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,360
Perfect patisserie isn't just
about precision baking.

247
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,640
Right, we're going to start
on the curds,

248
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,280
jams and creme patissieres
for the fillings.

249
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Paul and Prue will also expect
finely-tuned flavours.

250
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,160
Loads of Valencian orange in there.

251
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,520
It's, like, a bit more sweet.

252
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,960
This is going to be
for my creme pat.

253
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,040
Strawberries and rhubarb
and some rhubarb syrup.

254
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,560
I love this combination.
I just think it's lush.

255
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,280
This is my creme pat.

256
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,360
I'm colouring them
pink, yellow and blue.

257
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,400
When you cut into it,
you'll get a delight.

258
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,440
They look the nuts.  This is
the frangipane creme patissiere.

259
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,800
I like this, it's like a little
Alice In Wonderland bottle.

260
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,000
What's happening here?
That's almond extract.

261
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,800
Drink me! If I drink that,
am I going to get small or big?

262
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,360
Not as small as Sandi!

263
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,200
Genetically impossible.

264
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,280
Right, my lovely bakers, you are
halfway through the time

265
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,880
for your choux buns.
Halfway through.

266
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,160
Coming out of the oven.

267
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,040
I'm thinking a couple
of them aren't great.

268
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,960
I think I would have liked them
a little bit more puffed.

269
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,840
They're looking OK, nice and crispy.

270
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,400
Starting on batch two now.

271
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,280
Just piped another load of choux
buns and they're going to have

272
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,120
the craquelin on top. You just want
to have a nice little coating of it

273
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,720
round the edge, so I do quite
a big piece cos I always like

274
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,920
the whole of the bun to be enrobed
in it.  You're not stressed, are you?

275
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,040
I'm never stressed.  You looked a
little bit nervous earlier on today.

276
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,560
Did I?  Yeah.  When?

277
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,600
Was that an accident?  Probably
needed the loo or something!

278
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,520
Right, so these sit proudly
on top of their little choux.

279
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,560
This needs to go in now.

280
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,560
In we go.

281
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,120
There's no calming down today.

282
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,520
I'm making a toffee sauce that's
going in the banana choux buns.

283
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,240
I think more than anybody,
I've given myself so much to do.

284
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,320
I'm such an idiot.  I'm just about to
start making up my chestnut puree.

285
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,960
This is pulsed from fresh chestnuts.

286
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,480
Still loads to do.
Loads and loads to do.

287
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,480
Peach and prosecco in that, so it's
the normal flavours of a Bellini.

288
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,280
I like how much mess you make.

289
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,160
Do you?  I don't agree with them.

290
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,840
Paul always says, &quot;Tidy worktop,
tidy mind,&quot; you know.

291
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,640
Clever...  I reckon Picasso used to
get paint everywhere.

292
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,520
That's what I mean! I don't imagine
Van Gogh was hoovering, do you?

293
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,320
I've zested some lime into this
pan and so this is going to be

294
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,760
the lime curd.
I've got to get style and substance.

295
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,360
These are my unicorn horns.

296
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,760
Unicorns are pretty and magical
and I love them.

297
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,160
Right, I don't know what's going on.

298
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,080
It's obviously wrong.
It just feels a bit grainy.

299
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,960
I keep doing things wrong.

300
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,960
I'm having a very, very, very, very,
very, very, very bad morning.

301
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,960
Please.

302
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,000
I've got to do it again.
Let's just hope it works this time,

303
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,760
cos I need it to work.

304
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,360
Bakers, you have one hour remaining,
and if you don't finish,

305
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,800
Mr Spoon's going to be angry.

306
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,560
Craquelin bakes quicker
than the pastry it's covering,

307
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,560
so a perfect balance of time
and temperature is more critical
than ever...

308
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,680
OK, they're not far off.

309
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,880
..and it's even harder to tell
if the choux is done.

310
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,440
It should be nice and crispy.

311
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,160
Coming out of the oven.

312
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,160
They're a bit softer, but
the craquelin on top was burning.

313
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,440
I think I should have done them
at a lower temperature.

314
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,280
What was that tap? Do they sound
good?  It didn't achieve anything.

315
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,400
I don't know!
They look a bit burnt in places.

316
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,440
The craquelin's come out
really nice.

317
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,000
It's just a case of assembly now,
getting these cooled down.

318
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,800
Bakers, you have half an hour.
Just 30 minutes left.

319
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,840
Really pushed for time now actually.
It's going to be tight.

320
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,480
I need to start piping these now.

321
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,280
Frangipane and jam.
Right, let's get this done.

322
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,160
So I'm filling the buns with
vanilla and chestnut mousse.

323
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,160
So, what's happening here now?  OK,
so I'm glazing them quickly.  Yeah.

324
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,320
Except I've done it wrong.

325
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,560
I'm supposed to fill them first
before I glaze them.

326
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,880
Done it wrong. I've done it
wrong, I've done it wrong.

327
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,320
This is the peach Bellini.

328
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,880
I feel like I'm your carer and
I'm just coming in to visit you.

329
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,960
So, how's it going for you here?

330
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,200
You're making choux-nicorns?

331
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,080
I'm making choux-nicorns.
OK, I'm going to send the nurse in!

332
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,480
Oh!

333
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,720
Filling up my creme diplomat,
making sure I get them full.

334
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,880
Pierced right the way through
the choux bun.

335
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,600
Oh, and it's come outside.

336
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,920
This is an orange creme pat.

337
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,800
It's limey, which is just
what I wanted.

338
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,280
I don't know how long I've got.

339
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,160
Bakers, you have just
15 minutes left.

340
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,720
Not very much time left at all.

341
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,600
I've got to get these iced as well.

342
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,200
Uniformity is key.

343
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,840
They don't look like something
you'll see in the pastry window.

344
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,480
It's messier than I'd like.

345
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,160
Just trying to get rid of the excess
cos I don't want it to drip down.

346
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,280
They're not identical,
that's for sure.

347
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,280
I've got to show that I can make
something look pretty.

348
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,480
It's going to be a bit of a crazy
dash to the finish line.

349
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,480
Gold leaf makes everything
look better.

350
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,680
Do they look like horns to you?

351
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,280
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up.

352
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,280
Oh, God!

353
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,640
Right, bakers, your time is up.

354
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,760
Stacey!  I'm trying to put them on.

355
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,080
Stacey!

356
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,080
Please place your signature choux
buns at the end of your station.

357
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh!

358
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,920
The semifinalists' choux buns now
face the judgment of Paul and Prue.

359
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,040
Hello, Steven.

360
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,560
They look a bit untidy. And burnt.
They're quite flat.

361
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,600
I think your craquelin
was a little bit too thick.

362
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,600
It has restricted the growth.
Let's have a go.

363
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,600
Wow, OK.

364
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,520
I definitely think this
is underbaked.

365
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,200
The choux pastry's too soft.
Very soft.

366
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,200
I think the craquelin has kidded you
into thinking they're ready.

367
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,960
Oh, it tastes great, though!  It
tastes exactly like a Key lime pie.

368
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,480
That is absolutely delicious.
It just doesn't look good.

369
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,000
I think you've done this on purpose

370
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,240
so they don't say
style over substance!

371
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,760
THEY LAUGH

372
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,760
The Bakewell ones look very untidy
as well.  Yeah.

373
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,600
It's a bit too sweet for me.

374
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,720
Bloody gorgeous, mate!

375
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,600
They just taste heavenly,
but look awful.

376
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,160
I think you have to eat it
like that.

377
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,160
NOEL:  Just dim the lights.

378
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,600
They do look beautiful. A very nice
shine on the chocolate.

379
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,040
All of those are the same size.

380
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,040
They do look a little bit flat.
I think it's underbaked.  OK.

381
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,400
Do you see how white that is there?
That could be darker.  OK.

382
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,560
That's kidding you that it's ready.

383
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,600
So as it's sat and rested,
it's just collapsed slightly.

384
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Let's have a look.

385
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,760
I don't get the rhubarb.
I get the strawberry.

386
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,960
The strawberry's stronger
than the rhubarb.  Yeah.

387
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,120
Great flavour, though.
And the craquelin's nice and crisp.

388
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,120
OK, now these look
a bit flat as well.

389
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,040
It's very nice, but I'd have
liked lots more chestnut.

390
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,800
It's drowned by the chocolate.

391
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,160
I almost feel a tinge bit
of disappointment.

392
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,360
Oh, don't say that!

393
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,360
This is the semifinal, and we really
are after absolute perfection.

394
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,720
I think they look really lovely.

395
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,480
All the ones with the brown
craquelin are the same size,

396
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,320
and all the ones with the heart
look roughly the same size.

397
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,200
The craquelin has worked,
I think the colour is good.

398
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,120
It's a beautiful golden brown.

399
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,720
We'll start with
the Valencia orange.  Yeah.

400
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,280
This is how I like
to see choux pastry -

401
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,280
soft in the middle and crisp on
the outside.

402
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,640
Mm, very nice orange taste.

403
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,280
The craquelin, it's unbelievable. I
think the filling is delicious, too.

404
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,080
I just think you could've had
more in there.

405
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Now, this is the peach bellini.

406
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,800
That's delicious.
You have that peach in there.

407
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,880
You do get the prosecco flavour.
It really works.

408
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Very, very good.  Thank you.
Well done.

409
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Well done.  Thank you. Phew!

410
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,920
This one is most unicorn-like.

411
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,640
I had to rush the eyelashes and
things, and then I... Anyway...

412
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,760
NOEL:  That's a sentence
you don't hear very often -

413
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,720
&quot;I had to rush
the unicorn eyelashes!&quot;

414
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,360
They are a mess.

415
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,760
Oh, my goodness, look at that.
Oh, come on.  Fascinating colours.

416
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,760
I'm not sure it looks delicious -
it looks amazing.

417
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,120
With such a lot of icing,
it's very, very sweet.  Yeah.

418
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,480
It's a bit...sickly.

419
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,880
The craquelin,
I don't like the yellow colour.

420
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,200
Just trying to make it a colour,
just trying...  It looks like curry.

421
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,800
It looks like curry!  It does.
I hope it doesn't taste like curry!

422
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,520
It looks burnt as well. You've got
a dark bottom to the choux bun.

423
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,520
These are banana, cream
and salted toffee.

424
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,960
Mm!

425
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,720
Your flavours inside are good,
but your textures are all wrong.

426
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,320
PAUL SIGHS

427
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,880
Not your finest hour.

428
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,280
The risk I took didn't pay off,

429
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,280
and yet again, I kick myself
for not making it simpler.

430
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,800
A shame that they didn't look great
but not too disappointed.

431
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,320
I'm so pleased about the flavours

432
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,520
cos I lose out on flavour
quite a lot.

433
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,640
Yeah, I'm relatively happy
with those comments.

434
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,280
Well, I'm very happy with those
comments - not relatively happy!

435
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,800
SHE GIGGLES
What am I talking about?

436
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,600
The criticism is definitely harsher
because it's the semifinal.

437
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,680
Nail the Technical -
that's what I need to do.

438
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,240
Wait and see what it is first...

439
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,240
SHEEP BLEAT

440
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,480
What the bakers don't know is that
the recipe they're about to tackle

441
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,720
is the most complicated
ever set for a Technical.

442
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,400
Right, bakers, it's time for
your Technical Challenge.

443
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Now, it's Prue's first semifinal
as well

444
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,080
so who better to set it for you
than her? Any words of advice?

445
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,880
We're after finesse,
elegance, and every element -

446
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,040
and there are lots of them - counts.

447
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,480
As ever, the Technical will
be judged blind,

448
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,400
so we're going to have to ask
these crazy kids to leave the tent.

449
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,360
Off you go!

450
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,360
Prue has asked you to make
nine Les Miserables slices.

451
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,120
This is a traditional Belgian cake

452
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,280
with a pistachio
and lemon joconde sponge,

453
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,200
creme au buerre and
tempered-chocolate decoration.

454
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,440
I know that sounds complicated,
but in reality,

455
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,080
it is complicated.

456
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,520
You have three hours.

457
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,280
On your marks...  Get set...
Bake!

458
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,560
CHUCKLING:  Oh, my God.
Never heard of it.

459
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,160
This is insane. Look at this -
two pages.

460
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,680
Prue's made it up -
it isn't even a real thing.

461
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,960
She's just making...
I've seen them, they do exist.

462
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,600
Flicked past it in one of my books
once. Probably the kind of thing

463
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,800
I looked at and thought,
&quot;No way am I making that!&quot;

464
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,800
Les Mis was, like,
some tragic story, wasn't it?

465
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,240
So, Prue, why have you chosen Les
Miserables

466
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,800
for the Technical Challenge
in the semifinal?

467
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,920
Because it's about the most
difficult thing I could think of.

468
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,720
One of the difficulties
is getting those layers.

469
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,800
It's quite complicated
how it's stacked up.

470
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,440
The creme au buerre is in three
layers, one of which is raspberry.

471
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Then you have four layers of the
joconde, two of which are pistachio.

472
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,760
Name me three things
that could possibly go wrong.

473
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,360
I could name you 20!
But I'll start with three -

474
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,360
uneven layers, scrambled egg creme
au buerre, overbaked sponge.

475
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,520
But I can go on!

476
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,040
So, make the joconde...

477
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,840
Whisk together 150g of caster sugar
and the whole eggs.

478
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,680
I think this challenge plays
to my strengths...

479
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,880
but so did the choux buns -
apparently.

480
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,800
I need to put in egg whites
super gently.

481
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,240
Don't want to lose the volume.

482
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,440
If I don't do well in this,
I might as well not come tomorrow.

483
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Right, divide the mixture
between two bowls. Flavour them.

484
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,480
This is the lemon zest in this one,

485
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,680
and one's going to
have pistachio paste

486
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,440
and...some green food colouring.

487
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,920
How much food colouring?
That's the question.

488
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,920
So I'm just going to gently streak
a little bit in.

489
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,400
I don't want anything garish because
Prue's asked for an elegant sponge.

490
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,920
Oh, that's very green!  I love
the fact it's bright green!  Yeah!

491
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,920
You, your shirt, my shirt and that
sponge...  Rocking it, rocking it.

492
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,280
Right, let's get these in the oven.
It just says &quot;bake&quot;, I bet you.

493
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,720
Yeah, &quot;Bake.&quot; Love it.

494
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,760
I don't really know
how long it needs.

495
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,480
Just do five minutes.

496
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,560
I'm going to go eight minutes.

497
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,320
Right, creme au buerre, which
I thought he said creme Herbert,

498
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,560
as in his name was Herbert!

499
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,560
From what I can remember
of GCSE French, buttercream.

500
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,560
So you heat sugar, pour it
into egg yolks, add butter.

501
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,920
We are adding the buerre
to the creme au buerre.

502
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,600
I need it to be quite firm.

503
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,200
NOEL:  Firmness is crucial
to a perfect slice.

504
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,360
Although we're on a clock, I do want
to do this bit slowly.

505
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,360
NOEL:  If they go too fast...
it could all become a gloopy mess.

506
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,760
I feel like it should be thicker.
I'm stopping for a minute.

507
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,480
I've got a feeling that's not right.

508
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,480
My buttercream's quite runny.
It might be completely wrong.

509
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,000
Oh, no, no.
You've summoned me up like a genie.

510
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,080
I said, &quot;No, no, no.&quot;  Oh, I thought
you said &quot;Noel.&quot; Sorry.

511
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,960
Maybe get it in the fridge.

512
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,680
I'm just starting again. Round two.

513
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,000
I think I was supposed to put it in
slowly over time.

514
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,520
I feel like I've got to get
a move on now.

515
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,520
Bakers, you are halfway through
your Les Miserables slices.

516
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,520
Right, layering.
Putting the jigsaw puzzle together.

517
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,360
Paint this with chocolate.

518
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,600
&quot;And place chocolate side down
in the tin.&quot;

519
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,600
I'm reversing the sponge.

520
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,960
It's in.  Vanilla creme au buerre.

521
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,440
Pistachio sponges.

522
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,840
It's all about precision.

523
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,920
When you cut into it,
you'll see all the layers.

524
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,320
You want to try and
get them looking pretty.

525
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,200
Uh, it's a little bit too runny.

526
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,320
Topped with one of the pistachio
sponges. It's not very green.

527
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Have you ever done this before?
No, never.  Have you?  Yeah.  Yeah.

528
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,080
I make this all the time
with my kids...

529
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,600
..that don't exist.

530
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Bakers, you've got one hour left.

531
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,320
There's a huge amount
of decoration.

532
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,160
So I've got to temper the chocolate.
But I've never done it before.

533
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,200
I've never tempered chocolate
in my life.

534
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,560
Do you know what I usually do?
Melt it, use it.

535
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,000
To temper chocolate, you heat
it to a certain degree.

536
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,560
You have to raise the temperature
to loosen up all the crystals

537
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,040
and then reform them
by cooking it quickly.

538
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,440
Who would do this? Belgians do this.

539
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,480
Maybe cool it down with some ice,
actually.

540
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,600
Do you know what?
I'm going to do it the sexy way,

541
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,840
using the slab to cool
the chocolate, and then kind of...

542
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,560
give a bit of that.

543
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,440
Pour over the acetate.

544
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,720
Leave to set slightly.

545
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,920
I'd probably stick it in the fridge
if I were setting it

546
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,920
but I don't think it wants to be
in the fridge.

547
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,000
Not a clue.  &quot;Score it.&quot;

548
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,320
I won't even look round to see
what everyone else is doing

549
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,600
cos I can guarantee you now
it's probably not the same.

550
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,160
WHISPERS:  I've no idea
what I'm doing.  I can see that.

551
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,040
It's not really scoring very well.
It's not set.

552
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,080
Do you think if we just stand and
stare at something will suddenly...

553
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,520
Yeah.

554
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,920
You've just got to wait till
it's that perfect consistency

555
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,560
so that you can score a line and
it won't close back up again.

556
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,800
Right... &quot;Leave to set in
the chef's rings.&quot;

557
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,640
Why have they given me two rings?
You can have a wave of...

558
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,480
And then it would have to be like
a curled triangle?

559
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,480
I can't envisage it.

560
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,760
Ah, I get it now.

561
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,760
I'm really overthinking this!

562
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,160
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

563
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,160
&quot;Remove the cake from the tin.&quot;

564
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,720
Come on! Come along, dear.

565
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,760
This is not where I want to drop it.

566
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,320
Oh, all the chocolate's peeled off.

567
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,600
&quot;Divide into nine equal squares.&quot;
I'm terrible at maths.

568
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Three times three is nine, isn't it?

569
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,000
&quot;Top with
freeze-dried raspberry powder.&quot;

570
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,200
I'm going for the &quot;put as much on
as possible&quot;.

571
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,200
What on earth is going on with this?

572
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,880
This being the semifinal,
there's a constant worry,

573
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,120
but I hate worrying cos
it doesn't get you anywhere.

574
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,800
Uh! It's breaking and melting.

575
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,880
I've never seen such a mess.

576
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Bakers, you have one minute left.

577
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,800
Right, bakers, time is up.

578
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Please bring your Miserables
up to the table.

579
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,280
Paul and Prue are looking for nine
elegant Les Miserables slices

580
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,440
with defined layers, firm but smooth
creme au buerre

581
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,440
and light, airy joconde sponge.

582
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,040
Right, we'll start with this one.

583
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,040
I rather like the harsh colouring
because it looks so pretty,

584
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,800
but the chocolate is
a bit of a mess.

585
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Let's see what it tastes like.

586
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,080
The creme au buerre is quite nice,
and so is the joconde.

587
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,440
It just needed to be...neater.

588
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,320
Right, moving on. I quite like this,
looks very neat.

589
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
I'm very impressed with
the chocolate.  I agree.

590
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,840
And it's held its shape beautifully.
Let's have a quick look.

591
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,480
It cuts very nice.

592
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,880
Joconde's good, it's light,
it's airy.

593
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,120
Pistachio is there as well.
It's lovely.

594
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Moving on to this. It looks untidy.
There's no definitive layers there.

595
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,800
This raspberry in the middle looks
a right mess.

596
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,560
It tastes lovely,

597
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,360
but it's hardly the elegant
patisserie we were after.

598
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,080
Right, moving onto the last one.
This looks quite neat, actually.

599
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,280
But, pistachio could have done
with being a little bit greener.

600
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,840
The chocolate curl
is a bit too gold.

601
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,840
It should just be a tiny dusting.

602
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,000
The sponge on that - do you think
it's light and airy?

603
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,360
It's not the best.

604
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,360
Paul and Prue will now rank
the slices from worst to best.

605
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,440
OK, in fourth spot is this one.
Whose is this?

606
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,440
You've lost all the definition,
and it just looks highly untidy.

607
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,240
In third place is this one.

608
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,880
It's good, but it's not
the best sponge.

609
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,640
In second place is this one.

610
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,680
It was very tight between two
and three. Your sponge is better.

611
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,000
And that leaves Sophie.

612
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's a very beautiful
Les Miserables. Congratulations.

613
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,360
I really needed it, so I'm really,
really chuffed about that.

614
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,280
What happened there?
Tomorrow's a new day.

615
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,840
I always say this when I do
really badly in the Technical.

616
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,720
I am SO relieved.

617
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,760
I have to get my head down
and work super hard.

618
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,600
I'm just disappointed in myself.

619
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,000
Tomorrow, for me,
is incredibly important.

620
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,280
Just one more challenge stands
between the bakers

621
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,640
and a place in the final.

622
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,000
Semifinal week, patisserie
week, how is that going?

623
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,720
The pressure was ranked up,
and I think they all felt it.

624
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,360
Look at Sophie.

625
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,960
I thought her flavours were not
particularly good in the Signature.

626
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,360
And yet, her miserables...

627
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,480
They were perfect.

628
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,760
I think Stacey struggled
in the Signature.

629
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,480
She's really feeling the pressure.

630
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,440
The choux buns just weren't
good enough.

631
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,520
Steven's flavours yesterday in the
Signature Challenge were delicious,

632
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,160
but they did look a mess.

633
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,600
We've always said flavour is THE
thing that really matters.  It is.

634
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,000
The flavour wins out over aesthetic.

635
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,640
Absolutely.
So, Kate has been seesawing again.

636
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,480
She had a brilliant
Signature Challenge.

637
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,320
I think her flavours were fantastic.

638
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,320
Loved the prosecco in her choux bun
and the craquelin on the top

639
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,880
was absolutely perfect.

640
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,960
But, unfortunately for Kate,
she then came bottom of Technical.

641
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,640
It's really tricky coming into
the Showstopper.

642
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,360
They know three of them are going
to go through to the final.

643
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,840
And that is a very, very big thing.

644
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,040
To get to the final, the bakers
must take on the most fragile,

645
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,040
show-stopping structures
they've ever faced.

646
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,520
Well, morning, bakers, and
welcome to your very last challenge

647
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,400
before we find out who is
going through to the final.

648
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,200
For your Showstopper Challenge,

649
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,120
Prue and Paul would like you to
make a sculptural centrepiece
out of meringue.

650
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,400
The judges would like to see
at least two different types

651
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,560
of meringue, either French,
Swiss or Italian.

652
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,880
Your meringue masterpiece must be
embellished with dessert elements.

653
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,600
You have four hours and 45 minutes
to create your fantastic,

654
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,200
sensational meringue Showstoppers.

655
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,200
On your marks...
Get set...
Bake!

656
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,760
Showstopper in the semifinal now.

657
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,960
Nuts!

658
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,720
It is a bit more serious.
Not nearly as much banter.

659
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,720
We want them to make
a sculptural design in meringue.

660
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,760
They have to almost be architects
and engineers as well as bakers

661
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,840
because they've got to design
this thing to support itself.

662
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,200
Choose the wrong meringue,
the whole thing will collapse.

663
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,160
They must also have some dessert
element like curds,

664
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,160
and mousses or creams.

665
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,080
Because a meringue is so sweet,
I would like to see

666
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,760
something with a bit of acidity.
It must taste fantastic.

667
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,160
They've got to come up with
something that brings their
personality into the bake,

668
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,160
books their seat into the final of
The Great British Bake Off.

669
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,680
I think everybody is
up against it today.

670
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,200
Next week is the final. I don't
want to think about it, though.

671
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,040
I've got meringue to make.

672
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,280
I need to nail
the whole thing today.

673
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,480
Absolutely need to nail
every element of it.

674
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,560
Good morning.
Good morning.  Hello, Stacey.

675
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,640
Tell us about your
meringue centrepiece.

676
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,960
I'm doing Flamingos In Love.
NOEL:  I'm in already.

677
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,560
So I'm hopefully going to have two
flamingos looking at each other.

678
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,840
Do you know what a gang
of flamingos is called?

679
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,600
A flamboyance of flamingos.

680
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
Is it?  Mm.
PRUE:  Are they self-supporting?

681
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,040
They're going to be relaxed,

682
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,320
chilling out on the grass
after a swim.  Right!

683
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,320
Then you don't have to do the legs.
Well, I'm not silly!

684
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,080
Stacey's French meringue flamingos
will perch over chocolate boxes

685
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,720
filled with raspberry and lemon
mousse and vanilla panna cotta,

686
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,200
guarding their
Italian meringue nest.

687
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,720
I've practised this a lot.
I'm only just going to try my best.

688
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,800
Hold your hand out.
Do what I can do. I'm OK.

689
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,280
I don't really shake.
Oh, I am now, aren't I?

690
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,480
&quot;I don't really shake!&quot;

691
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,560
So I've got my Swiss meringue
in there.

692
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,040
Using the thermometer
to gauge the temperature

693
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,840
and when it gets to 50 degrees,
take it off the heat.

694
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,320
I'm doing French meringue.

695
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,120
I'm just slowly adding in
tablespoons of caster sugar.

696
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,600
I want to make sure all of the sugar
dissolves in the egg whites,

697
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,400
otherwise it could leach or crack.

698
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,120
By the end it should be nice
and sort of glossy and firm.

699
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,840
So, mine's actually going to be
a tutu, a ballet tutu,

700
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,880
so it's just a kind of throwback
to my ballet days,

701
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,760
a long time ago, now.
I think a lot of people who

702
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,040
maybe I served with would have
no idea that I could bake.

703
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,400
My dance friends couldn't believe
I was joining the Army.

704
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,440
My Army friends couldn't believe
I used to dance.

705
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,920
I'm always surprising people.

706
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,240
Sophie's tutu skirt will support
a nine-layer Opera cake,

707
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,720
her super-sized take on the
classic French coffee gateau,

708
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,760
encased in a Swiss meringue bodice.

709
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,120
So did you used to do ballet
when you were a little girl?

710
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,840
I did, yeah. Not even that little.
I did it until I was about 20.

711
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,880
When I was six, my mother sent me to
the Royal Copenhagen Ballet School.

712
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,240
Oh, wow!  I had three lessons
and they asked me to leave.

713
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,400
On what grounds?
I was not any good at it.

714
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,600
Well, they let me do it for
20 years before going...

715
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,880
&quot;You're really not...&quot;
You're a bit tall for it as well?

716
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,480
Tall and a little bit wide as well!

717
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,160
For his ambitious design,

718
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,160
Steven's been inspired by altogether
more cheerful childhood memories.

719
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,080
This whole design is
based around the song

720
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,200
that our nana would sing to us.

721
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,040
The name of it is Some Air Over The
Rainbow and it's a hot-air balloon,

722
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,840
a rainbow hot-air balloon.

723
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,400
Suspended above a lemon
Italian meringue pie cloud

724
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,840
will be Steven's
multilayered balloon,

725
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,080
loaded with macarons,
creams and curds,

726
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,560
and made from a soft style
of French meringue.

727
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,760
I want that crunch, the powder...
PRUE:  And a little bit of softness.

728
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,120
And the softness.
How are you going to suspend it?

729
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,520
Central dowel rod. Each disc will
sit through the dowel rod, but

730
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,360
hopefully the shape of the
piping should reduce the cracking.

731
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,800
The cracking is a danger, isn't it?
Hide it slightly, yeah.

732
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,320
Very ambitious, Steven.  I know.
NOEL:  Who's going in the basket?

733
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,280
Originally, when I first thought
this up, Paul, Prue, me, you,

734
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,880
but I think I'll just leave it
empty.

735
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,680
That's quite poignant.  It's a drone.
No-one's flying this one!

736
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,680
Rainbows are rare enough...

737
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,160
Now I'm just adding a touch of
colour cos it's going to be
a pastel rainbow.

738
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,120
..but this semifinal Showstopper's
been graced by not one, but two.

739
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,480
I think that's the nature of
meringues, isn't it?

740
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,520
They are bright, they are bold.
It's a given, really,

741
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,760
that everyone's going to be
doing that sort of thing.

742
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,240
Good morning, Kate.  Morning.

743
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,680
Tell us all about your
meringue centrepiece, please.

744
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,560
OK, so, I'm going to do a meringue
rainbow, which is obviously going

745
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,680
to be multicoloured,
going into two pots of gold.

746
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,640
NOEL:  I'm looking forward to
this rainbow.

747
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,800
PRUE:  It's a lovely idea.

748
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,440
Kate's Swiss meringue rainbow
will stretch over a sky

749
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,360
of Italian meringue clouds,
carved fruit and meringue kisses.

750
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,800
And each rainbow colour will have
its own distinct flavour.

751
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,600
I am using natural extracts
in the meringue.

752
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,960
What's that colour?
That's going to be purple.

753
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,640
I'm colour-blind, actually.
NOEL:  Are you?

754
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah.  That would explain...
quite a lot, fashion-wise!

755
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You know you're wearing
a pink shirt now, right?

756
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,320
I'm doing red and orange, which is
going to make, like, a bright pink.

757
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,040
I like pink!

758
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,360
I do like pink.  Pink, red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, purple.

759
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,720
I think purists might have
something to say about it.

760
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,760
So it's two rainbows going
on over there.

761
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,600
Flamingos here and a tutu.

762
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,600
This is the gayest challenge
of all time!  It really is!

763
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,920
One hour gone...

764
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,920
Let's get this started, shall we?

765
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,120
..and piping can begin.

766
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:12,120
So, I'm piping the French meringue
into little ruffles.

767
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,480
I AM shaking, you know.

768
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,600
A steady hand is critical...

769
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,560
as imperfections now could lead
to unstable structures later.

770
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,840
I'm just piping it on freehand.
Don't want it to crack.

771
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,240
The neck's super important.
Really don't want cracks on these

772
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,400
because they've got to stand
up for themselves.

773
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,160
And once meringue sets,
there's no going back.

774
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,880
It's just about trying to create
shape in there,

775
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,760
cos it should maintain this shape.

776
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,440
I'm just going to form the base of
the tutu skirt.

777
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,280
The rainbow itself is,
like, one piece.

778
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,040
It should be able to support itself.

779
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,520
These are the central layers.

780
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,600
I don't want to think about it
falling over.

781
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,320
Worst nightmare for a baker!

782
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,560
This is Swiss meringue. It's good
for things like sculpting.

783
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,160
The height of precision, now.

784
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,520
You paint the inside of the piping
bag and it comes out like that.

785
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,680
I'm now piping the bodice.

786
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,600
I didn't actually have many tutus.

787
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,800
I performed, like, once in a tutu.

788
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,920
I'm just worried that's not
quite thick enough, that's all,

789
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,440
I don't want it to crack.

790
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,600
I'm just colouring them.

791
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,800
I wrote a song about
a flamingo once.

792
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,040
I'll sing it to you if you win.
I would love you to.

793
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,600
Now they're going in.

794
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,480
It's more like a drying-out
process than baking them, really.

795
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,000
A meringue's texture can
alter radically

796
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,400
depending on how long it bakes.

797
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,040
Low temperature
for as long as I can.

798
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,120
The longer the bake,
the chewier the middle

799
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,280
but the sturdier the materials
for building.

800
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,400
It's going to be in the oven
for about two hours.

801
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,080
Let's see what happens
after two hours.

802
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,480
It's going to go in the oven for
about two and half to three hours.

803
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,160
I'm doing these at 150 for an hour.

804
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,280
I tried it low and slow and it
just turns to toffee.

805
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,040
It's not how I like meringue.

806
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,680
Meringues in the oven...

807
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,960
Dropping them on the floor.

808
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,680
..it's onto the dessert elements...

809
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,600
Blueberry jam. Just getting that
on the stove now.

810
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,200
..that should show off
their flair for flavour.

811
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,360
Cocktail time!

812
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,840
So this is a variation of
a cocktail called a lemon drop.

813
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,640
If you remember back to the song
Somewhere Over The Rainbow,

814
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,480
&quot;Your troubles melt
like lemon drops.&quot;

815
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,280
So, I've got my ganache, so the hot
cream's gone in there and it's
just melting the chocolate.

816
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,800
I haven't been to an actual ballet
for quite a while,

817
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,880
but always staring
at pictures and videos.

818
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,120
Making my raspberry mousse
and also my vanilla panna cotta.

819
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,360
If you're going to do a flavour,
do a flavour.

820
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,920
Do you know what I mean?
If you're going to put it in,
make sure they can taste it.

821
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,400
Passion fruit always
freak me out a little bit.

822
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,720
At what stage did someone decide
that they were going to eat that?

823
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,560
Chopping that,
and then I'll start on my cream.

824
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,240
Just going in here?
Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.

825
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,280
Oh, no!  No? Is that the wrong one?

826
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,960
Can you imagine if you turned that
on there? It'd come flying out.

827
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,320
What would happen? Would it?
That's it, it's clicked in now.

828
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,920
Maybe we could take someone out.
Less competition!

829
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,360
I do a brilliant impersonation
of Paul - listen to this.

830
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,360
PAUL'S VOICE:
Bakers, you're halfway through.

831
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,720
Yeah, we're good to go.

832
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,000
Steven? Is that all your meringue
done already?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.

833
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,520
The meringues are cracked slightly
and I know that it might
come back and bite me.

834
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,560
The more fracture lines
in the meringue...

835
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,320
I've got some cracks already.

836
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,800
..the less stable
their final structures.

837
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,920
Cos of the dome shape,

838
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,600
it's just pulled down from
the weight of the meringue.

839
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,720
It's pretty annoying.
I don't have time, really,

840
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,360
to faff around redoing it, so...
just go with it.

841
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,480
Just getting my ingredients ready
for my Italian meringue.

842
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,680
This is the last one.

843
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,960
I'm making the nest out of Italian
meringue and I'm blow-torching it.

844
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,600
It's just adding hot sugar
to whisked egg whites.

845
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,360
It's suddenly got very hot
in here again.

846
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,000
It's unbelievably hot.

847
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,680
And if making meringue
in a sweltering tent
wasn't tricky enough...

848
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,920
I'm like, actually, really,
really hot.

849
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,960
..two bakers are about to make
their own lives even harder.

850
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,160
Working with chocolate is
not my thing.

851
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,640
I haven't done this before.

852
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,200
I only need one egg.
This is the basket.

853
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,480
I thought meringue was difficult

854
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,960
but working with chocolate
is even worse,

855
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,960
especially when it's
350 degrees Celsius outside.

856
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,080
I'm going to stick it
in the freezer.

857
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,200
It'll be good if that works.

858
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,160
I do a pretty mean Prue impression.
Oh, yeah?

859
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,800
PRU'S VOICE:
Bakers, you have one hour.

860
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,960
OK, that's really scary!

861
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,640
Come out.

862
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,080
It could've been a bit neater,

863
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,080
but I needed to get them
in the oven.

864
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,760
The bakers now face their most
nerve-racking construction so far...

865
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,920
They're very, very, very delicate.

866
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,000
There's a huge amount of risk.
Meringue hates being touched.

867
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,240
..knowing just one slip
of the hand...

868
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,960
..and their delicate building
materials will shatter.

869
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,480
A lot of the fracture lines
I'm putting buttercream on

870
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,880
so I'm hoping that, structurally,
it should still work.

871
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,880
I'm going to check out my chocolate,
so I'm just going to whack it down.

872
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,040
This isn't working.

873
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,040
Oh! Oh, my God!

874
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,240
Oh! I did crack it.
I cracked my head off.

875
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,720
The fact they're sticking to another
one will hopefully be all right.

876
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,400
I'm just, like, decorating it now.
I'm just using gold dust

877
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,960
just to give it, like,
a little bit of a sheen.

878
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,080
The heat is killing me.
Pressure's on.

879
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,440
PRUE:  Most of them have got
a bit of cracking.

880
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,200
Stacey, one of her
flamingo necks cracked.

881
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,160
This I've managed to put back on.
Still not set.

882
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,960
PAUL:  I noticed Sophie's
has cracked quite badly.

883
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,680
The intricacy is quite impressive.

884
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,040
It's going to be a bit of a frenzy,
assuming nothing goes wrong now.

885
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,720
Looking at the colours in Kate's,
I think the vibrancy's there.

886
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,120
Steven's looks quite
a weight to be held up.

887
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,480
I'm not clear on how
this is going to look.

888
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,280
Or whether it will all
stay together.

889
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,720
A little bit stressful.

890
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,480
From now on, every action could
make or break the centrepieces...

891
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,240
I'm going to start
assembling the insides.

892
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,240
..as each element added puts more
strain on their fragile meringue.

893
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,080
I've got the ganache and then
a mousse, and that three times.

894
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,600
Bakers, you have half an hour.

895
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,600
Just 30 minutes remaining, bakers.

896
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,040
This is supposed to be a nest.

897
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,240
Right, creams.
Not a lot of time left.

898
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,200
Little bit of a gap.

899
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,240
That's cracked as well now.

900
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,760
Oh, right.

901
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,760
That's not good.
Not good at all.

902
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,840
Not great.

903
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,920
This is the mousse.

904
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,920
Does he have to be here now?

905
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,200
STEVEN:  The heat's starting
to rise a little bit

906
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,200
and I can hear it around
the room as well.

907
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,400
You all right?  Cracks.

908
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,960
I'm going to try and cover them up.

909
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,960
Oh, look at my basket!

910
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,720
Ugh.

911
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,840
That's how hot it is in here.

912
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,840
It is literally melting chocolate.

913
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,600
It's holding!

914
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,080
OK, bakers, you have
five minutes.

915
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,040
Five minutes.

916
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,160
This is horrible to watch.

917
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,120
I'm a bit worried about this one
cos it's got a crack in it.

918
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,120
It's just sitting quite nicely
on itself.

919
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,680
Stop faffing around with it,
that's what I need to do.

920
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,600
It's very, very fiddly.

921
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,080
Start piping anywhere there's
sort of a hole or a crack.

922
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,760
God, that crack is bad, isn't it?

923
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,240
Just got to get the clouds on.

924
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,240
They're supposed to be kissing.

925
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,640
Oh, my God.

926
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,640
I hate rushing.

927
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,120
One minute left.

928
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,120
Argh, do not crack on me.

929
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:17,200
Bakers, unfortunately
your time is up.

930
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,200
Step away from your Showstopper.

931
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:41,000
Please put your Showstoppers
at the end of your benches.

932
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,400
The semifinalists'
meringue centrepieces

933
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,320
now face the judgment
of Prue and Paul.

934
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,320
My showstopper wasn't as good as it
has been, but hopefully it's enough.

935
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,720
It doesn't look too bad.

936
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,560
If this is the end of
the road for me,

937
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,240
I'm leaving happy
with what I've done.

938
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,560
I don't really know how it
stands up to anyone else's.

939
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,200
All I know is,
the rainbow stands up.

940
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,400
There's so much there that's wrong.

941
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,400
I hope they see the effort
that went into it.

942
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,040
Sophie, please bring up
your meringue centrepiece.

943
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,680
It looks like a hat.
Oh, no, it's not, it's a tutu!

944
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,080
It does look like a hat.

945
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,440
I would love to see you wear that.

946
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,160
What, the tutu or the hat?
Seriously, I'm game for both.

947
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,080
I think the design
is very, very good.

948
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,480
I think your piping is good.

949
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,160
I think the bake on the bottom...
Is that the French meringue?  Yes.

950
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,160
It's split an awful lot.

951
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,200
Wow.

952
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,800
Very nice meringue.  The Swiss
and the French is very good.

953
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,320
Baked well, as well. Crispy, which
is what you need it to be, the base.

954
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,600
How many layers have you got
to this opera cake?

955
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,520
Nine, I think.  It should be seven.

956
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,280
Well, you know, I had to fill it up.

957
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,280
Mmm.

958
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,600
Is that not good?
It tastes amazing.

959
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,040
The coffee mousse lightens
it up, because the ganache

960
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,720
is quite heavy,
because it's so thick.

961
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,200
If you'd done the ganache
a little thinner, it would've been

962
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,480
ten out of ten.
Well, I'm highly impressed.

963
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,480
Awesome.  Very well done.
Thank you very much.  Thank you.

964
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,400
SHE EXHALES
Thank God for that.

965
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,080
Kate, would you like to bring up
your meringue showstopper, please?

966
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,840
PRUE:  Oh, wow!

967
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,920
It's colourful. A bit childish.

968
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,640
The colours are just amazing.

969
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,800
They just shine out at you.

970
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,720
I just love the look of it.
I think it's fantastic.

971
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,280
The rainbow itself
is a little uneven.

972
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,280
You need it to be neater.  Yeah.

973
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,040
Every single colour
is a different fruit flavour.

974
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,840
Definitely raspberry.

975
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,840
I like that.

976
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,600
Yeah, I get the different flavours.
They're a bit like sweets.

977
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,480
I think it's wonderful.

978
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,400
I've got an Italian meringue
on the bottom,

979
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,400
which I've lightly blowtorched.

980
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,040
Delicious. The flavours, the creams,
the Swiss meringue,

981
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,560
all absolutely lovely.

982
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,400
It's a bit of a splat
of flavour and colour.

983
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,280
For me, it sort of
freaks me out a little bit.

984
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,240
You have to release your mind.

985
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,600
This is an absolute celebration

986
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,680
of fruit and cream and meringue.

987
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,600
That is Kate on a plate!  Yeah!

988
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,600
I love that.  Thank you.
Well done, Kate.  Thank you.

989
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,400
Stacey, would you like to bring
your meringue showstopper

990
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,400
up to the table?

991
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,520
A centrepiece needs to be easily
recognisable for what it is.

992
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,040
They are obviously birds.

993
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,880
It's quite simplistic,
but you've thought it through well.

994
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,880
I hope it tastes as good
as it looks.

995
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,000
It's a nice meringue, that.
Very good.

996
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,720
It's chewy.

997
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,720
Now, this is the Italian meringue.

998
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,520
It's just too sweet and sticky

999
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,560
and you can only bear
a little bit of that.

1000
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,320
It's just very, very soft.

1001
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,200
One is filled with a vanilla
panna cotta and raspberry coulis,

1002
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,880
and the other is filled with
a raspberry and lemon mousse.

1003
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,840
It's like a takeaway dish, isn't it?
It is, it is!

1004
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,200
It's probably not the best thing
in the world,

1005
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,200
but it is very practical
for what it does.

1006
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,480
It's just very tart.  Sorry, too much
coulis.  It's very nice.

1007
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,200
You have the sweetness underneath.

1008
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,200
It's very creamy.

1009
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,560
That's quite tart as well.

1010
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,880
All of that meringue is so sweet,

1011
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,440
you really do need something
sharp to go with it.

1012
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,440
Well done, Stacey.  Thank you.
Thank you.

1013
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Steven, please bring up
your meringue centrepiece.

1014
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,920
It was a hot-air balloon
and a basket.

1015
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,720
It got too close to the sun!

1016
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,560
Icarus!  Exactly, yes.

1017
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,760
The colours are just lovely.

1018
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,040
I love those pastel shades.

1019
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,560
I imagine if the chocolate basket
was in still intact,

1020
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,920
you'd get it,
but just looking at that,

1021
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,840
I would think it was a tree.
NOEL:  A psychedelic tree.

1022
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,880
Yeah, a psychedelic tree.
I wouldn't think it was a balloon.

1023
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,520
What happened with the cracking?

1024
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,520
It took one crack and then
the weight just...did that.

1025
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,520
That shouldn't have happened.

1026
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,200
If you make a centrepiece, you need
it to last for four or five hours.

1027
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,560
OK.  So, the top one is an Eton mess.

1028
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,560
Balsamic strawberry
and a clotted cream.

1029
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,960
The flavour's nice.

1030
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,720
Execution, probably not,
and that comes down to the bake.

1031
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,360
What you should have done was bake
it for longer to dry it out totally,

1032
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,080
to give it a more stable base.

1033
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,960
It's such a pity,
because it's so delicious.

1034
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,280
Now, this is the Italian.

1035
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,280
That's the Italian meringue
with the lemon drop pie.

1036
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,160
It's so good, isn't it?

1037
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,760
It's great.

1038
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,760
Very light.

1039
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,600
I love the flavours.
They taste amazing.

1040
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,960
I mean, beautiful.

1041
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,560
I just think the method,
the way you've done it,

1042
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,760
is not up to normal Steven standard.

1043
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:40,000
Thank you, Steven.  Thank you.

1044
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,240
NOEL:  Prue and Paul must now decide
who deserves Star Baker

1045
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,960
and who must miss out on the chance
to become Bake Off champion.

1046
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,040
Showstopper. It's the semifinal -
couldn't be more important.

1047
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,280
Who stood out for you?

1048
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,200
I really like Kate's
because it looks fantastic.

1049
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,720
The colours are wonderful.

1050
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,320
I thought the flavours and
textures - spot-on.

1051
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,960
What about Sophie?  Sophie showed the
most skill in the Showstopper with

1052
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,880
the meringue, which is perfectly
baked and exactly the right texture.

1053
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,000
So does that mean that Sophie and
Kate are both in line

1054
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
for Star Baker?  Yes.
But it is ridiculously tight.

1055
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,480
I have to say,

1056
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,480
I'm really none the wiser in terms
of who is going to be leaving us.

1057
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,600
Coming into today, Stacey was in a
very difficult position.

1058
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,080
She was down at the bottom.

1059
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,600
I think when you break it down,
what she has done is very simple -

1060
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,320
she has piped a flamingo,

1061
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,040
baked them off and leaned them
against a couple of puddings.

1062
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,840
But it does look like a centrepiece
and it tastes delicious.

1063
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,680
I think Steven has been so
ambitious that

1064
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,680
he hasn't quite achieved it.

1065
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,080
I loved the colours and I loved the
flavours.

1066
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,560
If it's not clear-cut, which it
seems it isn't,

1067
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,640
do you then give yourselves the
luxury of having a look back?

1068
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:55,640
Initially, we've got to look at this
weekend very closely, and then

1069
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,400
if that still doesn't draw any
obvious answers and it's so close,

1070
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,400
then, yes, we have to look back
retrospectively on the whole series.

1071
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,760
It's only happened a couple
of times.

1072
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,240
This is utterly horrifying.
It's so close.

1073
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,240
You just don't want to make
the wrong decision.

1074
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,040
I just wanted to say before you hear
the results,

1075
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:30,040
this has been the hardest decision
that I've been involved with

1076
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,240
in eight years of the Bake Off.

1077
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,960
Right, let's start with
the good news.

1078
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,680
So, I get to announce Star Baker.

1079
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,280
This was a person who delivered
Les Miserables and made everybody

1080
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,280
extremely happy, who danced away
with the Showstopper.

1081
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:49,040
This week's Star Baker is Sophie.

1082
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,840
That means I've got the horrible job
of announcing which one of you guys

1083
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,400
is not going to make it to the
final, which, at this stage, I know,

1084
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,480
is the cruellest blow.

1085
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,360
It was so tight, as Paul said.

1086
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,360
Sadly, the person who won't be
joining us in the final

1087
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,160
of The Great British Bake Off is...

1088
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,720
..Stacey.

1089
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,720
Sorry.  OK.

1090
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,880
Sorry about that.  It's OK.

1091
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,800
So close.

1092
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,200
You did an amazing job.
An amazing job.

1093
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,200
I'm pleased I've gone out on a high,
you know.

1094
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,200
It was really, really difficult
decision for them and that's great.

1095
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,880
PRUE:  I think Stacey should
be really,

1096
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,240
really proud of what she's
achieved. I mean, she'll be

1097
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,240
disappointed today, but truth is,
she has done something remarkable.

1098
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,880
I can go back to being a good mum,
so it's OK.

1099
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,880
I could've waited another week,
but it's fine.

1100
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,800
It's fine.

1101
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,560
I had accepted my fate.
I was going. I was going home.

1102
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,000
But I'm in the finals.
I cannot believe it.

1103
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,320
I cannot believe it.

1104
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,440
We have three great bakers
going into the final.

1105
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,040
They're exciting, they're vibrant.

1106
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,800
They bring new flavours,
new textures into the tent.

1107
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,200
I think the final should be amazing.

1108
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,720
Thanks.

1109
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,320
I got Star Baker in week nine,

1110
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,920
but it's now all about the final, so
actually what happened today kind of

1111
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,560
doesn't mean anything any more,
cos it's all about next week.

1112
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,680
I'm expecting someone to come over
and go, &quot;We're only messing.

1113
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,640
&quot;Go on, off you go.&quot;

1114
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,320
PRUE:  You made it through to the
final.

1115
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,280
KATE:  Hiya, Dad. Are you OK?
PHONE:  Hi, Kate. Are you OK?

1116
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,960
I got put through to the final.

1117
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,240
HE CHEERS OVER PHONE

1118
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,240
Nine weeks of trying harder than
I've ever tried in my life.

1119
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,640
I want this more than anything.

1120
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,720
I think they were happy for me!
SHE LAUGHS

1121
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,680
Next time...

1122
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,680
I'd like to ask the three finalists
to step forward.

1123
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,160
The winner of
The Great British Bake Off...

1124
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,280
I haven't breathed,
I haven't looked up.

1125
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,600
..2017...

1126
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,600
No pressure.  ..is...

1127
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,440
HE EXHALES SLOWLY

1128
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,440
HE EXHALES

1129
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,160
Are you a Star Baker in the making?

1130
