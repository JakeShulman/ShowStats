1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GBBO S08E02

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,640
It's week two in the Bake Off tent.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,560
One baker has already departed,
11 remain.

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,000
Another great day of baking ahead.
I've got the flour.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,240
Wow, that's a big bag.
How are you going to get it

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,880
out of the wheelbarrow?
Self-raising.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,360
I don't think I've forgotten
anything.  Well, apart from...

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,760
BOTH:  Welcome to
the Great British Bake Off!

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,600
Do you want a lift?
No, you're all right.

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,480
Sure? OK. I'm picking up Prue.

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,160
Last time...  Going in.

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,800
Let's be brave.  ..the competition
began with some unreal baking.

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,000
Wowsers!  Look at that.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,480
Despite Flo and Sophie's
stunning cakes...

15
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,680
Gosh!  ..Steven became this year's
first Star Baker.

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,840
This is perfect.
HE SIGHS

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,880
And although and Chris
and Stacey stumbled...

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,080
Am I going to put it in the bin?

19
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,640
..Peter was the first to leave
the Bake Off tent.

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,640
I don't know what to say, mate.
That's all right.

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,040
This week...

22
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,800
..it's biscuits...  Ta-dah!

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,440
..for the Signature Challenge
that's all about precision...

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,880
It's so tough,
it's offering me up for a fight.

25
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,440
..a mind-bending Technical...

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,240
Aargh! So frustrating!

27
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,760
..that's an Oriental mystery...

28
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,760
That looks more like
a Cornish pasty.

29
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,880
..and a game-changing biscuit
Showstopper...

30
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,320
This is me stressed.

31
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,800
..that's never been attempted
before.

32
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Ah!  Chin up.

33
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,800
I'm going.  No, you're not!

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,000
I mean, the interesting thing
about the word biscuit is it

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
comes from the Latin for bis,
meaning twice, and coquere, cooked.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,520
Twice cooked, because the original
way in which they made them...

37
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,120
Have you eaten all those biscuits?

38
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,880
I thought I'd do some eating stuff

39
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,040
while you're doing
some speaking stuff.

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,240
Wow, you literally take the biscuit.

41
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,760
It's Biscuit Week.

42
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Is there not even a crumb left?
Yeah.

43
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,040
The bakers are about to face
three biscuit-based challenges

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,320
over the next two days,

45
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,360
but who will be
our second Star Baker

46
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,360
and who will be the second to have
to leave the Bake Off tent?

47
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,880
Morning, bakers, and welcome
to your Signature Challenge.

48
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,400
Today, Prue and Paul would love you
to make 24 sandwich biscuits.

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,360
There should be
two separate biscuits,

50
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,880
neatly sandwiched together, with a
flavoursome filling of your choice

51
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,920
that should compliment
your style of biscuit.

52
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,160
You have two hours and 15 minutes
to make your sandwich biscuits.

53
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,160
On your marks...  Get set...  Bake!

54
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,440
The Signature bake this week is
a devilishly difficult challenge,

55
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,600
I think, because you've got
to make 48 biscuits to

56
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,120
make 24 sandwich biscuits,

57
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,520
so they've got to think of how
they're going to break those

58
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,520
so they're all equally sized and
equally coloured at the same time.

59
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,080
PRUE: One of the risks is that
the filling will be too soft.

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,120
When you get it in between
your teeth,

61
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,040
out comes the lemon curd
or the buttercream.

62
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,400
If you combine a hard biscuit
with a soft interior,

63
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,240
it will go all over your lap.

64
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,400
Hello, Liam.  Hello.  Tell us
about your sandwich biscuits.

65
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,800
It's a pecan
and malt flavoured biscuit.

66
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Like at a diner. I always get
a malt and chocolate milkshake.

67
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,000
This sort of reminds me
of the '50s, Back To The Future.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,520
And it's, like, slightly subtle,
but it creeps up.  Yeah.

69
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,000
It's like, &quot;Hello, I'm here.!

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Liam began baking just four years
ago, inspired by his mum, Eleanor.

71
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,240
Where is that carrot cake?
Just taste the food, boy.

72
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,520
Sorry.

73
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,200
He's sandwiching coffee
buttercream between pecan

74
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,480
and malt shortbread.

75
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,280
We used to be given malt
cos it was good for us

76
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,360
after the war.

77
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,640
Which, the First World War?
Yeah, First World War.

78
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Such a delicious flavour.

79
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,840
So the whole thing
is going to be crunchy?  Kind of.

80
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,760
It's cookie or is it biscuit?
It's a biscuit.  So it will snap?

81
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,560
So you're looking for
a soft snap, yeah?  Soft snap.

82
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,920
A soft snap...

83
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
THEY LAUGH

84
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,720
Whatever texture the bakers
are aiming for...

85
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,640
The softest centre and a bit
of crunch on the outside.

86
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,160
..they can ruin it
when trying to introduce flavour.

87
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,560
225g.

88
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Too many wet or dry additions
to their basic dough now...

89
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,560
..can drastically alter
the bite of their baked biscuit.

90
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,120
This is pistachio extract
that I couldn't find

91
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,840
anywhere in England.

92
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,240
So when I went to Russia last time,
I went to these baking shops,

93
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,960
and I found it there,

94
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,200
which was quite good.

95
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,680
Julia left Siberia to live in
Crawley with her husband, Matt,

96
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,880
and their dog, Ned.

97
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,960
Ned! Ned!

98
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,880
Her pistachio and cardamom
biscuits will sandwich a vanilla

99
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,160
and rose jelly.

100
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,640
Flavours give you
instant memories, don't they?

101
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,080
They remind you of something.

102
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,960
When I bite into them, I think of
Turkey, the time I met my husband.

103
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,520
Aw! Was it very romantic?  It was.

104
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,440
He kind of came up to me
and started chatting me up.  Uh-oh!

105
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,200
Then, literally, we walked
with each other for like two hours,

106
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,560
ended up talking about everything
and nothing.

107
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,920
And you kind of know whether
it's the right person or not,

108
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,360
you kind of feel it.

109
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,760
Do you know, that's marriage -
everything and nothing.

110
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,480
That's exactly
what marriage is like.

111
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,000
Steven's also flavouring
his biscuit dough with a little

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,200
holiday romance.

113
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,520
There's some amaretto.

114
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,960
I was in Rome years ago, one
of the fondest memories was sitting,

115
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,360
having a coffee and an amaretti

116
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,880
biscuit, and it was a warm Sunday

117
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,160
morning, so the bells were tolling,
and it was incredibly romantic.

118
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,040
Steven's love of romance
even extends to the music

119
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,880
he listens to as he bakes.

120
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,880
He has lovingly adapted
a classic amaretti dough

121
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,600
recipe for his coffee cream
filled biscuits.

122
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,840
What's gone into this mixture,
then, for the biscuits?

123
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,800
Semolina flour. So, semolina gives
like a softer, chewy texture.

124
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,600
A bit of crunch outside, soft dough,

125
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,720
and then squashy coffee middle.

126
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,640
And then you should have the classic
Italian combination

127
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,880
of amaretti and coffee.

128
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,800
Let's hope they are.

129
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,080
The classic flavours
in Yan's biscuit dough

130
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,080
were born in Enfield, North London.

131
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,080
I'm making peanut butter.
But they're no less romantic.

132
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,120
It's based on something my wife
likes to eat

133
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,320
after she goes to Zumba.

134
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,920
Usually she has peanut butter
and banana on toast.

135
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,840
Yan met her wife, Marianne,
at the local football club,

136
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,240
and they've been together
for 16 years.

137
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,720
Her peanut butter cookies will have
a banana cream filling and she

138
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,400
has another one of her scientific
tricks up her sleeve.

139
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,320
I'm going to roll it caster sugar,
so when it bakes, it will rise.

140
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,040
And then when you take it out,
it will fall

141
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,040
and it'll have a nice crack on it.

142
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,160
Puts muscles on you, this.
Gets rid of your bingo wings.

143
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,080
There's me dough done.
And just put it in the fridge.

144
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,760
Unless the dough is chilled
until it's firm,

145
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,800
when it comes to cutting
and shaping,

146
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,560
producing 48 identical biscuits
will be impossible.

147
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,160
I'm happy.  But before
they can start chilling...

148
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,160
We are looking for uniformity,
don't forget.  ..Steven,

149
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,320
James...  Here we go.  ..and Tom...

150
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,240
They're going to go in the freezer
just for two minutes.  ..have given

151
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,680
themselves even more work to do.

152
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,720
You need to chill them
so they hold their shape.

153
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,920
If you put them in the warm oven,
they just seep away.

154
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,440
They're hand piping and then
chilling every single biscuit.

155
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,640
I'm not very good at getting
everything the same size,

156
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,320
so I've put a little template
underneath to give me a rough guide.

157
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Accuracy is vital in James's work
as a finance project manager,

158
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,400
but things got a little less
precise

159
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,200
when he's teaching his sons
Ollie and Ethan how to bake.

160
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,760
THEY LAUGH

161
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,600
His piped dough will be the basis
of his take on a Viennese whirl,

162
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,200
crossed with his favourite
pudding - rhubarb and custard.

163
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,880
Following the feedback last week,

164
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,960
presentation is going to be key
this week.

165
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,720
Going in the fridge.  No problem.

166
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,480
To perfect his presentation,
Tom is having to work his piping bag

167
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,240
twice as hard.  Just piping
the base of the biscuits now.

168
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,880
They are different to the top
because they are going to be flat
instead of fluted.

169
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,320
I do have quite a steady hand
because, with work,

170
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,520
I have to draw quite fine things.

171
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,160
But when you're in here,
the nerves do affect that slightly.

172
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,000
Tom's keen architectural eye
will see him

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,560
plan his bakes in almost
as much detail as his buildings.

174
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,240
His time-consuming design
features two contrasting

175
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,160
piped coffee biscuits
filled with alternating coffee

176
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,040
and amaretto buttercream.

177
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,920
They all have to be identical,
so I need 48 biscuits

178
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,400
and I'm going to make 70,
just so I've got a few spare ones.

179
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,680
And I've already done
four really messily,

180
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,640
which I've had to scrape off
and redo.

181
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,240
But that's fine, I've got time.

182
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,240
Whilst her dough is in the fridge,
Flo gas begun preparing her filling.

183
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,400
This is my raspberry stewing
in raspberry gin.

184
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,680
You can get drunk on this!

185
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,680
At 71, Flo and all her girlfriends
still meet up for a few cocktails.

186
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,440
# I'm all about the base
about the base, no treble. #

187
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,080
Her gin jam and vanilla buttercream
will fill two shortbread

188
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,440
biscuits shaped like
slices of bread.

189
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,920
Do you think you'll have any gin
flavour at all, though?

190
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,880
If you've boiled it with the jam,
you've lost all the alcohol.

191
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,760
I put a bit in the buttercream.

192
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,520
Ah! Clever girl.

193
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,160
A bit of booze where we know
we can taste it.

194
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,800
Gin always makes me a bit weepy.

195
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,280
Am I going to be crying
when I eat this?  No. I hope not!

196
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,840
And Flo's not the only one
who's turned to drink.

197
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,800
Adding my whisky. Just gives it
the most incredible flavours.

198
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,080
Chris's love of fine whisky
is matched

199
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,280
only by his passion
for the high seas.

200
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,520
Perfect job.

201
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,280
His whisky and orange filling
will sit between chocolate biscuits

202
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,760
made with chia seed
and even more whisky.

203
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,440
We know you're good with flavour
already, we've learned that.

204
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,560
So, you're going to bite in,
taste the chocolate,

205
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,880
then the hit of the whisky,
then you get this lovely finish

206
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,280
of a bit of orange afterwards.
There's a lot of flavours in there,

207
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,960
but they do all go together,
don't they?

208
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,600
Well, it's not, like, in your face,
your eyes watering whisky,

209
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,280
but you get this whisky.

210
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,320
I've got one question for you...

211
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,720
Can I have your shirt?

212
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,920
As long as I don't have to have
you on with your spandex again, yes.

213
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,360
THEY LAUGH

214
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Sophie is also hoping to blow
the judges away

215
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,000
with an adults-only filling.

216
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I've just come back from Italy,

217
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,800
Just teaching military
personnel how to ski.

218
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,320
I drank lots of limoncello,
still have some of it.

219
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,880
Didn't drink it all.

220
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,080
Since leaving the Army,

221
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,960
Sophie has also begun training
to be a stuntwoman.

222
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,920
For a real lemon kick,

223
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,080
her curd filling will have a large
double shot of limoncello.

224
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,280
I have to put a lot in
to get any of the flavour.

225
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,360
But it does mean that it
doesn't set very well.

226
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,920
The judges will be looking
for a filling that won't ooze

227
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,600
out when the biscuit is eaten.

228
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,440
If I add too much banana,
it becomes very wet,

229
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,320
but I want the flavour
to come through.

230
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,120
But whilst most of the bakers
are looking to stiffen things up...

231
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,120
This is the rose water jelly.

232
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,480
We need it to set.

233
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,080
..Stacey is aiming for something
a little softer.

234
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,160
Marshmallow fluff,
my kids' favourite.

235
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,600
I came down for breakfast yesterday
and the jar was open...

236
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,160
and a massive scoop taken out of it.

237
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,840
The morning routine at Stacey's
house...  Thanks, Mum.

238
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,080
..is usually too hectic
for treats at breakfast.

239
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,440
Love you.  Thanks, Mum,
I love you, bye.

240
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,880
Her marshmallow fluff will sit
between chewy chocolate cookies,

241
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,440
dusted with edible glitter.

242
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,920
I'm not quite sure I want that
metallic flavour in my mouth.

243
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,960
There isn't any flavour.  Taste
the bling, Paul.

244
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,560
It's just to look good.  Do you like
a bit of bling?  Yes.  Don't you?

245
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,200
Cos you made a sort of
designer handbag.

246
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,560
I haven't any girls in my life,

247
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,760
so I like to, where I can,
put a bit of glitter in.

248
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,320
But now Paul has worried me if I've
got too much glitter.

249
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,400
We'll see.  Good luck.

250
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,400
He likes to put the fear
of God in you, doesn't he?

251
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,280
What are you doing?
Making a sandwich biscuit.

252
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,920
Yeah, I don't think you've
completely got the hang of it.

253
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,680
Baker s, you are halfway through
the time for your sandwich biscuit.

254
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,760
Do you want a bite?
Yeah, thanks.

255
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,280
MUMBLES: Mm! Delicious. Mm!

256
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,560
I know.

257
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Just taking this out of the fridge
and just rolling it out now.

258
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,160
These are just little dowel rods

259
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,000
I usually use
to support stacked cakes,

260
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,600
and they're just a nice guide.

261
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,600
The judges will expect every single
biscuit to be identical in thickness

262
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
and shape.

263
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,320
Make sure I weigh it precise.

264
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,280
As long as I have it round, gravity,

265
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,520
science will take care of it.

266
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,240
They probably won't be completely
identical. I'm not a magician.

267
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,120
I feel like the thickness
has to be perfect.

268
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,480
I kind of wanted to be, like,
just under a centimetre,

269
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,200
like more biscuit than filling.

270
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Because I love a little biscuit.

271
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,920
I'm happy with that.  To cut perfect
shapes from their biscuit dough...

272
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,360
I didn't want to do anything
too simplistic.

273
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,680
..Kate and Flo
have been improvising.

274
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,200
You have to be good
at arts and crafts

275
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,480
when you come to the Bake Off.

276
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,960
Not just baking,
it's making things like this.

277
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,320
A corned beef tin.

278
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,880
I'm quite proud of that.

279
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,560
I adapted a round mould
and I put it in a bench vice,

280
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,280
and then shaped it
into a shell shape.

281
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,440
The shell shape is used in quite
a lot of Edwardian designing.

282
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Kate also satisfies her passion
for history by restoring antique

283
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,560
furniture.

284
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,760
And it's a fascination
with family history that's led

285
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,920
to an ambitious, highly decorated
coconut biscuit, filled with

286
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,480
coconut-rum cream
and pineapple curd.

287
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,560
Rum, coconut and pineapple,
that's a pirate's biscuit.

288
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,960
Yeah.  Is that what you're going
for?  It is Titanic-themed.

289
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,160
When I researched into recipes
on board the Titanic,

290
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,600
coconut sandwich biscuits were
actually served for afternoon tea.

291
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,240
And I had a relative on board.
And he survived, actually.

292
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,440
He was a passenger, was he?
No, he was engine room.

293
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,800
Engine room, and he got out?  Yes.

294
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,840
PRUE:  He was very lucky.
Yeah, very lucky.

295
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,640
PAUL:  Wow. Thank you, Kate.
Good luck.  Thank you.

296
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,080
Going in. Right.

297
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,080
The bakers now face
a multitasking nightmare.

298
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,280
Rotate when it comes to, like,
six minutes.

299
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,920
Every single biscuit should be

300
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,800
baked to the same colour
and texture.

301
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,640
I have to watch them like a hawk.

302
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,960
I don't want them
to get too much colour.

303
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,440
But with 48 to perfect
in the remaining time...

304
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,960
Oh, no.  ..and only one oven...

305
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,880
I'm only going to put one at a time.

306
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,960
..they'll now have to perfectly
time their brakes

307
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,880
and prepare new batches
for the oven...

308
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,560
..simultaneously.

309
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,240
It should be quite tight.

310
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,560
It should've been in the oven, like,
20 minutes ago.  Nine minutes.

311
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,920
12.

312
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,280
SHE SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN

313
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,160
When it is a stressful atmosphere,
I can't count in English.

314
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,080
Watch them burn.

315
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,920
Yep.

316
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,880
Another couple of minutes.

317
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,880
I hate feeling like I'm not going
to be ready for something.

318
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,320
BEEPING

319
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,080
At any point,
they can slightly over bake.

320
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,840
The reason why rotate them
is so that they can get, like,

321
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,920
an even bake.

322
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Oh, look at them babies!

323
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,280
Going to do another two batches.

324
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,440
A little bit longer.

325
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,440
SHE BLOWS RASPBERRIES

326
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Better give them another
two minutes.  Ta-dah!

327
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,240
OK.

328
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,880
Bakers, you've got 30 minutes left,
30 minutes.

329
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,800
I want them to be a bit more golden.

330
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,520
I just need them to cool now,
really quick.

331
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,760
The filling is so soft

332
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,200
that any sort of heat on it
will just melt it,

333
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
and the sandwich will fall apart.

334
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
They're perfect.

335
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,200
They're a bit dark.

336
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,880
Just got to really concentrate.
I can't afford to drop any.

337
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,280
Eek!

338
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,880
Oh...!  One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

339
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,280
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

340
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,360
Two, two, two, one.

341
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,320
Right. Here goes.

342
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,880
Let the squeezing commence.

343
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,840
Just starting to assemble them now.

344
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,680
Trying to do it as quickly as I can

345
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,120
without mucking up.

346
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,040
This is the worst bit, isn't it?

347
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,040
The last ten minutes. You can
feel the panic around the room.

348
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,920
It's not quite even, but I think
that's quite a nice amount.

349
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,880
I'm filling them 7g at a time.

350
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,400
People are sitting at home going,
&quot;Who does that?&quot;

351
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,040
Not good. In a bit of a rush.

352
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,280
I just thought I was going
to have more time than this.

353
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,840
Should I put more gin in?

354
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,240
I just want to taste it.
Oh, yeah, go for it.

355
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,280
You are always licking my chocolate.
SHE GASPS

356
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,920
Sex, isn't it?
Orange and... Sex?  Well done!

357
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,880
I wasn't getting sex,
but I was looking at you, Chris.

358
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,640
But maybe for that filling, I'd be
on the turn for you.  Good Lord!

359
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,880
You never know.

360
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,560
Fiddly.

361
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,520
I feel as if I should've used
all the time up.

362
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,760
The problem is,
of having a bit of time to spare,
you probably feel a bit nervous.

363
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,320
I feel as if I should've gone
over them a bit more.

364
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
There we go. Steady hands.
Steady hands.  Oh!

365
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,320
That, James, is a thing of beauty.

366
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,720
Paul is a little bit
scared of the glitter.

367
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,560
I think he should try and embrace
it, do you know what I mean?#

368
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,760
We should be making him up
like David Bowie.

369
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,760
Ah, bum, bum, bum.
I've got on the jelly.

370
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,600
My hands are shaking so much.

371
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,080
Three, six, nine, 12...

372
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,440
19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.  24!

373
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,800
You've got one minute,
one minute left!

374
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,080
Do they have to be on the plate?

375
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,560
I've just run out of time, I'm not
going to have time to ice them all.

376
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,440
Do you want a hand?
Yes, please, please, please, please.

377
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,240
I will be as careful as I can.
It's OK.

378
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,720
If they fall apart, they fall apart.

379
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,960
My hands are shaking so much.
Don't worry.

380
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,520
Two, four, six, eight, ten, 11, 12.

381
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,920
Five, six, seven, eight...

382
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,160
It keeps getting lopsided.

383
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,640
There you go. You're going to do it,
you're going to do it.

384
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,840
Bakers, you've got ten seconds!

385
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,840
Two...

386
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,720
Time up, I'm afraid, bakers.

387
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,280
Please put your sandwich biscuits
at the end of your benches.

388
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,840
Thank you, guys.

389
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,800
Tom, don't touch.

390
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,800
I'm just straightening them up.
No touching.

391
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,760
Want to try mine?

392
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,040
They are so good. That is sick.

393
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,000
That's really nice.

394
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,680
It's judgment time for the
signature sandwich biscuits.

395
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Hi, Liam.  Hello.

396
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,200
All uniform.  Nice.
All the same colour, and there's 24.

397
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,000
Tick, tick, tick.  So far.

398
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,520
Right, let's have a look.

399
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,320
Gosh, they are a bit squishy.
Got it, totally got it.

400
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,200
I'll just stand here and catch
Paul Hollywood's drippings.

401
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,720
That's actually what's
happening here.

402
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,680
But I think, from a flavour point of
view, they're very interesting.

403
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,680
You get a malt kick.  Yes!  Coffee
kick.  Yes, yeah.  It's really good.

404
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,720
But this is a meal.
I think they're too chunky.  Yeah.

405
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,720
&quot;See me.&quot; That's what it says
on the bottom of your work.

406
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,600
You've made 24 almost-identical
biscuits.

407
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,800
Very delicious.

408
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,840
I'm getting vanilla. Certainly
getting rhubarb, which is lovely.

409
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,640
I didn't get the custard,
but it's vanilla,

410
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,000
so you're giving that sensation
of rhubarb and custard.

411
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
But the quality of the biscuit
is fantastic.

412
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,280
Very rich, bitter chocolate.

413
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,600
The whisky is... Wow, it's coming
through at the end.

414
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,080
Yeah, beautiful, isn't it?
Do you know? I think it's too much.

415
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,080
It's got the concentration of
a chocolate truffle.  Oh, OK.

416
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,640
They do look absolutely
perfectly even.

417
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,960
Oh, sorry about that, bit oozy.

418
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,080
No denying the banana...

419
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,840
And peanut.  If the cream filling
would have set,

420
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,840
it would have been a fantastic
biscuit.

421
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,400
It does look very intriguing.
Filling looks a little squashy.

422
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,360
Your biscuit is quite hard.
I think you've worked that too much.

423
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,280
Think so?  Yeah.  There's no gin
flavour, but I think

424
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,280
the flavour is wonderful,
especially the raspberry jam.

425
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,160
I love that chewy middle,
and it is still quite crisp outside.

426
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,840
The only issue is the slightly
irregular sizes.

427
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,880
Yeah.  But the flavours and the
texture of the almond and the coffee

428
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,880
together, and the slight chewiness
in the bite, perfect.  Thank you.

429
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,560
The icing's a little bit dodgy,
isn't it?  Very dodgy.

430
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,200
It's so tough, it's offering me out
for a fight.

431
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,760
It is too tough.
A story of two halves.

432
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,760
The pineapple's there.
Delicious flavour, yum.

433
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,160
I think they look amazing.

434
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,200
Thank you.  You've got consistency.

435
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
I think they look very
neatly-filled.

436
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,200
I'm almost a little bit concerned
about that amount of glitter.

437
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,120
Tastes great.  Thank you.

438
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,480
Crispy on the outside, soft and
cookie-like on the inside,

439
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,880
and the marshmallow's set
beautifully so when you bite in,

440
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,640
it doesn't pour out.  And in fact,
with fluff, like that, which is

441
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,440
pure sugar, it's clever not to
have the biscuit too sweet.

442
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,840
As a sandwich biscuit, you've ticked
all the boxes. Well done.

443
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,840
Thank you.

444
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,400
They're dancing biscuits.

445
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,120
Aren't they? Yeah, look at them!
Boi-oi-oing, boi-oi-oing!

446
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,440
HE CHUCKLES

447
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,440
That's great, that!
They're a little bit scruffy.

448
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,840
Very different, but because
everything's a bit strong,

449
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,800
it's too much.  You have this mix
of rose water and cardamom which

450
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,560
isn't particularly pleasant, but
very daring of you to do it there.

451
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,120
And the most fun we've had so far.

452
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,200
Oh?  Yeah, I'm just going to do that
one more time.

453
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,200
That's just lovely.
It's quite incredible.  Yeah.

454
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,920
You were asked for 24 absolutely
identical biscuits

455
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,040
and I think you might have hit it.
They look incredible.

456
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Sharp, nice, clean lines,
distinction between the two sides.

457
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,280
Bit of drippage.

458
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,280
That's delicious! Can't really taste
the limoncello. You just get

459
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,600
a beautiful citrus flavour.
Beautifully-cooked, very tart.

460
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,760
What's not to like? It's wonderful.
Thank you, thanks so much.

461
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,880
I like the look of them!
I think the bake's good.

462
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,080
I think the size is good.
Tell us about the filling?

463
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,120
The chocolate one is just a
chocolate ganache.

464
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,680
The central one is coffee
and amaretto.

465
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,640
The cream's very rich in chocolate.
The amaretto flavour is delicious.

466
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,520
The biscuit, though, is a triumph.

467
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,480
Thank you.  Never mind about running
out of time.

468
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,400
I did it! There was 24.  Bravo.
Finish on the word triumph, Tom,

469
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,400
and don't... Stop speaking.
Stop speaking. Save triumph.

470
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,040
I feel good! Yes!

471
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,720
I don't want to get too excited,
but that has given me a boost

472
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,760
that I needed. I would have liked it

473
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,960
if Paul got glitter
all over his face.

474
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,720
OK, brilliant, I can breathe.

475
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,240
I'm trying to use different flavours
in everything I'm making,

476
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,200
and I keep getting it wrong!

477
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,040
Last week, it was good bake,
improve on flavours.

478
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,040
This week, good flavours,
just texture was wrong.

479
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,480
Can I not just marry the two,
and it'll be fine?

480
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,280
The bakers could practise for their
Signature Challenge, but now,

481
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,280
they'll have no idea what biscuit
they'll be asked to bake next.

482
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Time for your Technical Challenge,
which has been set for you by Paul!

483
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Any advice, Paul?
Don't fold under the pressure.

484
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,080
Well, that covers the whole of it,
right. Off you two pop!

485
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,080
Off we pop.  Right, Paul would like
you to make 12 fortune cookies,

486
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,880
six almond cookies,
and six orange patterned cookies.

487
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,360
Each cookie must contain
a fortune inside.

488
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,760
No idea how that works, but I'm sure
you've got the mad skills.

489
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,440
You've got two hours to complete
this challenge.

490
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
On your marks... Get set...

491
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,760
BOTH: Bake!  Oh, my God.

492
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,720
The bakers all have
identical ingredients and

493
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,240
the same basic recipe.

494
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,800
If we have a Chinese take away,
we often get fortune cookies,

495
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,400
so I've got a good sense of
how to shape them.

496
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,160
I've seen them on TV and stuff,
and, like, films and that.

497
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,480
Funnily enough, I nearly made

498
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,600
fortune cookies a while back,
and I thought,

499
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,320
&quot;Nah, that's too much of a faff!&quot;
And I didn't do it! Argh!

500
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,240
Paul? Fortune cookies.  On paper,
you think, &quot;That's very easy.&quot;

501
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,520
Bit actually, this is a very
difficult Technical Challenge.

502
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,560
You have an almond flavour
and you have an orange flavour.

503
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,600
They have a little pattern.
Now this is all about timing.

504
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,880
You can't put all of them into the
oven at the same time.

505
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,200
Two and three at a time, possibly,
no more than that,

506
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,960
and it must just brown
on the outside.

507
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,880
And when they come out, you only
have a very short period of time to

508
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,160
create that fortune cookie shape
before they set.

509
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,160
So it's all speed and dexterity?
But the killer thing is snap.

510
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,040
Yeah, it breaks.

511
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,320
It says, &quot;You will be working with
a man with blue eyes.&quot;

512
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,640
There you go, you see?

513
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,640
Well, that means I keep my job till
tomorrow, at least. Good.

514
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,240
The first instruction is to write
12 fortunes.

515
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,920
What are you supposed to write?

516
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,800
NOEL:  &quot;Look after your feet,
and the rest will follow.&quot;

517
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,720
I like that.
&quot;Speak your mind, for it is...&quot;

518
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,480
Stupid.  I do them as I go along,
unless I think of a funny one.

519
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,960
Can I read one?  What, in the
beginning? Of course, they're all

520
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,880
pretty much the same.
&quot;Make it count.&quot; &quot;Keep on smiling.&quot;

521
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,640
Yes!  I like these.
They're quite punchy.

522
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,360
&quot;Make it count.&quot; You've gone for
&quot;make it count&quot; again.

523
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,600
Because you should really
make it count, you see?

524
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,320
You should really make it count.

525
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,960
It says, uh, mix the
egg whites, oil, and water.

526
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,760
Ahh!

527
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,200
I shouldn't look at other people,
just do what I'm doing.

528
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,560
They need to be light, but they
don't need much air.

529
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,960
People are using mixers.

530
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,480
I'm guessing this'll be like a
twill-like consistency, so

531
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,400
spreadable, but not too runny.

532
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,240
Looks a little lacklustre.
And then divide the batter into two.

533
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,320
Form two circles of almond butter.

534
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,320
How big is a fortune cookie, though?
No idea.

535
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,960
Probably a teaspoon of mixture,
and just smooth it round.

536
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Just try it with one.
I know they're supposed to be thin.

537
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,760
Absolutely no idea how long to put
these in for.

538
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,240
I am very nervous at the moment.

539
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,960
We're going in.  I'm going to start
with three minutes.

540
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,920
That seems a lucky Chinese number,
I guess?

541
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,840
I'm going to go for
lucky five minutes.

542
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,600
I'm going to sit here
and monitor this.

543
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,040
Slightly golden, OK.

544
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,640
I thought they'd be done like that,
but actually, they're quite

545
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,200
slow to cook, because it's
quite a low oven temperature.

546
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,280
Take the first one out.

547
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,080
Going in. Think they're too thick.

548
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,080
&quot;Once baked, place a fortune in the
centre and seal.&quot;

549
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,520
Ohh! I wish I had asbestos fingers!

550
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,520
Ooh!  Super-hard.
You have to work quite quick.

551
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,560
WHISPERING:  I don't know what's
happened to it.

552
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,480
That folds like that.

553
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,280
&quot;Seal using the rim of a glass.&quot;

554
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,280
Put it over a glass and shape?

555
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,520
It's as simple as that!
That's it, yeah.

556
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,720
SHE SIGHS

557
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,800
So I'm going to put a fortune in,
fold them in half, and then I'm just

558
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,920
squishing it at the edge to give it
that line underneath.

559
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,400
And they're not sticking.

560
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,840
What's that for?  Because it'll
set off quite hard.

561
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,400
I'll just put it in there
so they don't fold out too much.

562
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,400
It's like origami, isn't it?
Yeah.  I love how you don't panic.

563
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,000
Is everyone else panicking?
Can you not feel it?  No, not really.

564
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
That's why I like being at the back.
Yeah, there's panic happening.  OK.

565
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,920
I didn't expect them to get hard
as fast as they do.

566
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,000
You've got to be really,
really quick.

567
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
They just crack,
as you've just seen.

568
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,560
They look like real cookies
and everything!

569
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,160
It's just not right.

570
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,880
I'm trying to create a shape
and I just can't get a shape.

571
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,560
Ooh, you're cracking on me.

572
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,560
...the hell is this?

573
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,480
That looks more like a Cornish
pasty.

574
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,720
That's not a fortune cookie shape
in the slightest.

575
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,720
There's my two. I just can't do it.

576
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,080
I've only made two.  Got ten to go.
I can't, can't, can't give up now.

577
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,080
OK, put some more in.  Just putting
it in.  Come on, you babies.

578
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,400
Give me some bread, give me some
pastry, give me something...

579
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,360
wholesome. Fortune cookies.

580
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,000
On the almond ones, I need to melt

581
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,560
some chocolate and chop up some
hazelnuts.  Very lovely.

582
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,640
Give that some...  That one's a
disaster.  Oh, why?

583
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,440
Yeah, there's me fortune cookie.

584
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,200
Give that a really good bash.
That'll make you feel better.

585
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,800
I know.  That's it!

586
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,200
OK! Now you're laughing!

587
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,440
Mine aren't going brown.

588
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,080
That's about there.

589
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,920
OK, they'll get cold very, very
quickly.

590
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,880
So it says press to seal, but then
it says use the rim of the glass.

591
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,880
What if it goes like that,
then like that?

592
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,560
They're just so rubbery.

593
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,880
Do you want to put an apron on,
and have a go?  No.

594
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,760
Oh, man! I'm so doing these for
my next dinner party!

595
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,520
Ohh, so frustrating!

596
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,280
They're poor.  Tell you what,
let's read one of these,

597
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,160
see if you can get any advice from
your own advice.

598
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,160
You dance great.
Has that helped you any?

599
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,400
Bakers, you've got one hour left!

600
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,240
I'm gonna flavour
the orange one now.

601
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,440
So that's got orange essence and
orange colouring in, as well.

602
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,920
I don't like using too much

603
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,640
food dye. It tastes all
synthetic and horrible.

604
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,640
Orange circle... Looks more like a
fried egg, if the yolk split.

605
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,440
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot...

606
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,440
Oh, yeah, cos this works.

607
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,320
&quot;Create pattern from the dots, using
a cocktail toothpick.&quot;

608
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,360
So I'm cracking into the middle.

609
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,160
The idea was to make it
look like segments.

610
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,160
I'm just going to put these in...

611
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,360
No, it's a disgrace.

612
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,800
Bakers, you've got half an hour
left!

613
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,440
They're so bad.

614
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,440
This is the last batch going in.

615
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,520
The orange could be a little bit
stronger.

616
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,040
I did it! Did it, that's it.

617
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,640
-Ish, -ish!

618
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,080
So how the hell did I do it?

619
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,080
Have I got time? Uh, &quot;dip almond
cookies in melted chocolate,

620
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,320
&quot;and coat with chopped,
toasted hazelnuts.&quot;

621
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,680
Last batch coming out.

622
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,360
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes left!

623
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,760
Oh, my God! Only managed
to make five.

624
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,040
And this will be it.

625
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,600
I'm going to see if I can do
another two.

626
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,520
We're doing that. These aren't
quite cooked, these ones.

627
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,800
One, two, three, four, five, yeah.

628
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Hold up.  I'm not good at
Technicals at all, man.

629
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,200
All I have to do now is the dipping
and the nutting.

630
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,320
Bakers, that's the end of your
Technical Challenge!

631
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,120
Well, I'm going to get
annihilated here.

632
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,040
Chin up.  I'm going.  No, you're not.

633
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,480
Please, bring your fortune
cookies up, and place them

634
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,920
behind your photos.

635
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,240
Paul and Prue are expecting
12 perfectly-shaped,

636
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,240
crisp fortune cookies and
they won't know whose is whose.

637
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,480
Come on.  OK.
They've got the shape to them.

638
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,160
And they're actually quite even.
That cracked beautifully.

639
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,840
It says, &quot;Keep smiling.&quot;

640
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,360
I can taste the almond.
And I can taste the orange.

641
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,800
Moving on, they are pretty even.
There is a shape.

642
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,440
However, these are
a little bit rubbery.

643
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,840
No crack. That one
is absolutely delicious.

644
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,560
They're just slightly underdone.

645
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Yeah.  Moving on. There is not enough
colouring in there at all.

646
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,200
It cracks well.

647
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,560
You could break your teeth on them.
They're a bit thick.

648
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,560
I don't think they ever got to the
oven, did they?

649
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,240
Raw batter's not much fun.

650
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,320
OK, moving on. All look the same,

651
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,320
orange needs to be a stronger
colour.  That really cracked nicely.

652
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,480
Nice orange flavour, just needed
more colour in there.

653
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,960
OK, they are quite raw. The almond
ones have lost their shape,

654
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,600
and you can unfold them.

655
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,360
They don't really snap.
They're just not baked enough.

656
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,000
These look pretty good!  The orange
one has got a stronger colour,

657
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,360
which I like. Nice break.
Got a nice flavouring.

658
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,160
That's a rather good one.

659
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,360
Now, these look good. Do you know?
I think they're very beautiful.

660
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,880
That is a very good little heart.

661
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,880
Oh, its crack is
a little bit rubbery.

662
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,880
Are we going to say this? &quot;Today,
you will mostly poo candyfloss.&quot;

663
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,440
Well, they have followed
that up with,

664
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,680
&quot;You will get bored
of writing fortunes.&quot;

665
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,320
Nice orange flavour, as well.

666
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,320
Yeah. Oh, this is not
a very happy picture.

667
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,000
I don't think they were quite ready.

668
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,400
They haven't managed to seal it up
before they bend it.

669
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,080
Oh, beautiful, crack! But they
aren't the right shape, are they?

670
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,040
No. Right, moving on to whatever
these are.

671
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,640
I've made a right mess of this.

672
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,400
I think he just invented that.

673
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,360
They're raw.  Although, I am getting
the almond flavour in there.

674
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,720
Moving on. Uh, the orange ones
look quite pretty.

675
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,400
That's got a bit of a cylindrical
shape to it before it's been bent.

676
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,200
Start with this.
Ooh, broke very well.

677
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,240
Very good.  The almond's coming
through nicely. It is crispy.  Mmm.

678
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,200
Nice flavour in there, nice.
Very good.

679
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,240
&quot;Prue and Paul will now
rank the fortune cookies

680
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,200
&quot;from the worst to the best.&quot;
In 11th place is this one.

681
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,760
Whose is this?  Me.
I had a little bit of a struggle.

682
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,680
Tenth place, we have this one.

683
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,960
Oh, Flo. They're the wrong shape,
aren't they?

684
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,440
Ninth spot is this one.
That's me.  They are raw.

685
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,720
Yeah, I just couldn't get my head
around the whole shape.

686
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,720
&quot;Kate is eighth. Liam is seventh.
Stephen is six, Tom fifth,

687
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,840
&quot;and Julia is fourth.&quot;

688
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,600
In third spot is this one. Nice
shape, and nice pattern as well.

689
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,240
Nice snap. Well done.  Thank you.

690
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,200
This is excellent. Who's number two?

691
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,840
Sophie, they look
absolutely beautiful.

692
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,280
In first place, obviously,
is this one.

693
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,280
Nice colour, nice shape.
You ticked all the boxes.

694
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,560
Before I left, my brother said to
come back number one Technical,

695
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,000
or don't come back at all.
That's what he said!

696
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,120
Prue and Paul's comments were
probably quite fair.

697
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,120
However, when they spat them out...
Well, that did hurt a little.

698
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,800
Paul read out, &quot;I've made a right
mess of this.&quot;

699
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,680
He got that right, anyway!

700
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,400
I also wrote, &quot;I'm never
baking these again.&quot;

701
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:32,000
Which is true, that will come true.

702
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,800
SANDI: One final biscuit
challenge remains

703
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,800
and it's a first for
The Great British Bake Off.

704
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,080
Morning, bakers.

705
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,360
Welcome to your
Showstopper Challenge.

706
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,840
OK, I think this is going to be
one of my absolute favourites.

707
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,240
We are so excited.

708
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,400
This is some Willy Wonka
stuff right now.

709
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,120
Today, you're going to be
making biscuit board games.

710
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,720
It needs to be at least
40 centimetres in diameter,

711
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,640
it needs to have at
least eight elements.

712
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,840
The biscuits can be
any flavour or any type

713
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,040
but the main thing is you must
be able to play your board game

714
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,600
and then eat your board game.

715
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,080
Yeah, preferably in that order.

716
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,840
It's not going to work
the other way round.

717
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,440
You've got three-and-a-half hours.

718
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,840
On your marks...  Get set...

719
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,040
Bake!

720
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,520
NOEL:  Creating a functioning
board game from biscuits

721
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,880
is the ultimate test
of the bakers' ability

722
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,960
to create stunning biscuits
on a grand scale for their boards

723
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,960
whilst also delivering exquisitely
detailed biscuit playing pieces.

724
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,920
PAUL:  You've got to be a designer.

725
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,160
You've got to be very artistic

726
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,600
to really highly decorate
the biscuits and the players.

727
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,840
PRUE:  Board games are
all about the detail

728
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,600
so it's got to be very neat.

729
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,400
The colours must be sharp edged,

730
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,640
the writing must be legible.

731
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,560
PAUL:  You could create the most
amazing board game in the world

732
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,160
but, actually, it's got to taste
good. This is the Bake Off.

733
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,120
Time today is so tight.

734
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,560
There's no room for error.

735
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,800
I've got to get three doughs
done in about half an hour

736
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,480
otherwise the game
won't be finished.

737
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,960
Hopefully I can get everything
baked in the first two hours.

738
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,480
I've got like an hour to decorate,
which would be chill.

739
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,600
NOEL:  Every dough will
need to result in a biscuit

740
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,360
that's robust enough to hold
its shape when it's played with...

741
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,880
In practice, it hasn't gone well.

742
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,520
The biscuits have crumbled a lot.

743
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,560
..while still delivering a
texture that's a pleasure to eat.

744
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,920
When I rehearsed this, I demolished
about a quarter of the chequerboard

745
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,280
in about 30 minutes,

746
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,040
so  I  thought it tasted OK.

747
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,960
SANDI: Sophie is making a simple
Snakes and Ladders board,

748
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,880
but it requires 50
individual chocolate biscuits

749
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,600
and another 50 flavoured
with lemon and bergamot.

750
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,280
So, have you done this before?

751
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,360
Sort of.  &quot;Sort of&quot;?
What does that mean?

752
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,200
I've not done beginning to end
timed or anything like that.

753
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,360
And your Snakes and Ladders,
how are you going to show us them?

754
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,600
They are all going to
be royal icing flooded,

755
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,840
So pipe the outline and then
flood it with royal icing.

756
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,560
I like the idea of the flavours.
I think the lemon, the chocolate,

757
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,800
and the bergamot is going
to give it a nice, little kick.

758
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,080
You seem to be under control.

759
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,520
That's because I've no idea
what my timings should be.

760
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,600
LAUGHTER

761
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,240
Ignorance is bliss.

762
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,200
NOEL:  When it comes
to Snakes and Ladders,

763
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,840
Sophie won't be playing alone.

764
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,560
I'm doing the architect's take.

765
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,000
It's Drains and Ladders.

766
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,560
The board itself is going to
be made to look like a house.

767
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,400
Tom will need to find time to
cover a cinnamon and nutmeg board

768
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,400
in fondant, spray paint it and pipe
numbers, ladders and drainpipes,

769
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,480
and make chocolate and
peppermint playing pieces.

770
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,440
Did you design it
on a drawing board?

771
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,400
I did. It's a bit childlike.

772
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,840
Shall we call it naive?
Let's call it naive.  It's naive.

773
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,280
Do you think you've nailed
your timing?  Not at all.

774
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,840
You're just a free spirit.

775
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Time, who needs it?  Who needs it?

776
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,440
Who needs that sort of construct?

777
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,400
If Paul and Prue say
&quot;You ran out of time,&quot;

778
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,360
say, &quot;What does time mean?&quot;

779
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,680
SANDI: For James,

780
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,800
this Showstopper Challenge is
a chance to go back in time.

781
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,920
The baked is based on an
old board game called Coppit.

782
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,640
My wife got the board game
when she was four.

783
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,400
It's been in the family ever since,

784
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,160
so it's one that's in our games
cupboard that comes out regularly.

785
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,120
James is making a board
from spiced orange, chocolate

786
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,360
and ginger shortbread

787
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,160
and he'll colour more spiced
orange dough for his playing pieces.

788
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,400
In the winter, we play a board
game on a Saturday night

789
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,680
and it's always Coppit that
the kids want to get out.

790
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,000
So, it gets quite competitive

791
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,040
especially with the two
boys playing it as well.

792
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,720
NOEL:  Stacey's biscuit board game

793
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,800
also has a strong family connection

794
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,760
but it's never been played before.

795
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,640
I made up a game called
Get To School

796
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,120
because there's all the
challenges of getting them to school

797
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,520
and all the things they've got
to do and things they forget.

798
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,120
You're always shouting at them.

799
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,960
Only a mum would
come up with this game.

800
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,720
Players have to move across a
fondant-covered, chocolate board

801
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,280
to try and win a
good boy star biscuit

802
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,120
featuring Stacey's sons'
favourite flavours.

803
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,840
I'm doing a plain chocolate biscuit,

804
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,200
cos my kids love that,

805
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,760
and then I'm doing breakfast
based vanilla and strawberry.

806
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,400
I'm using freeze dried strawberries.

807
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,880
The thing about freeze dried
strawberries, they are strong.

808
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,080
I really wanted to make sure
you could taste the strawberry
and I think you can.

809
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,480
While Stacey has gone with
classic, everyday flavours,

810
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,360
Kate's risking everything
on an obscure ingredient

811
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,520
she's found in one
of her history books.

812
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,120
These are grains of paradise.

813
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,600
They're, like, an ancient spice

814
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,120
that's been, like, long forgotten.

815
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,000
It takes kind of like gin.

816
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,120
Grains of paradise

817
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,680
will flavour Kate's board

818
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,040
and orange and cardamom
playing pieces

819
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,280
will complete a game inspired by
another period of ancient history -

820
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,640
the 1990s.

821
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,160
This is my Jumanji board game.

822
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,920
It's like one of my favourite
films from when I was small

823
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,840
and a lot of animals come
out of the board game.

824
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,560
I admire the fact that you're using
something slightly different -

825
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,800
grains of paradise.
Also the orange and cardamom.

826
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,480
Two fascinating flavours. If it
works together with the board...

827
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,160
It's about getting
the time to decorate.

828
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,520
He was fussy about the icing
on your Signature biscuits,

829
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,280
so just bear it in mind.

830
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,240
Flo is hoping her choice of game

831
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,080
can kick-start her
recovery in biscuit week.

832
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,120
It's a take on Operation.

833
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,120
I don't do nothing easy so
I'll have a go at that one.

834
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,040
Flo's Almond biscuit patient

835
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,560
will lie on a vanilla
biscuit operating table

836
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,840
and everything will be
covered in coloured fondant

837
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,680
she's chosen to make herself.

838
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,880
I'm going to put borders
round it in red

839
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,760
and then the man's in,
like, a flesh colour.

840
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,160
And I'm hoping I've got time
to put a pair of shorts on him.

841
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,800
Not looking for a lot, am I?

842
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,280
THEY LAUGH

843
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,800
It sounds really complicated.

844
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,880
Bring it on.  &quot;Bring it on.&quot;

845
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,800
Getting the game's board
baked early is crucial.

846
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,120
I need to get a crack on if I want
to get my middle triangle bits done.

847
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,920
Not only will these giant
biscuits need to cool completely

848
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,520
before they can be iced...

849
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,760
Mine is about decorating

850
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,520
and I can't do that if I
don't have a board to work on.

851
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,040
..the bakers will also need to
quickly free up their ovens

852
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,720
for all the other biscuit components

853
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,960
that will ensure their
games are playable.

854
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,160
Just have to go like the
clappers when it comes out.

855
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,440
NOEL:  Whilst Sophie's simple
Snakes and Ladders board

856
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,080
is proving complicated...

857
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,120
I need to get this
bit as nice as I can.

858
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,520
..Julia's simple board's...
I think yes.

859
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,760
..is for a game that has a pretty
straightforward explanation.

860
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,360
My game is...

861
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,320
A British Baking Game.

862
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,000
Julia's ginger and lime board

863
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,440
will have a path of chocolate and
orange liqueur stepping stones.

864
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,120
Whoever lands on and eats
the most Star Baker biscuits

865
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,760
is her Bake Off winner.

866
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,440
Making my own game,

867
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,120
I was just hoping to be original

868
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,840
and show that I can be creative.

869
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,600
But Julia's creation may
not be that original.

870
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,000
My board game's called
Adventures In Bakeland.

871
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,560
Yan's lemon and matcha tea

872
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,840
orange and cardamom biscuit squares

873
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,920
will lead the winning player
to a biscuit Sandi and Noel.

874
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,800
Because it's going
to be a chequerboard,

875
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,080
they spread ever so slightly

876
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,120
so I'm going to put them
a little spaced apart,

877
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,320
bake them and then
they come together.

878
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,840
Bakers, you are halfway through the
time for your biscuit board game.

879
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,240
God.

880
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,360
How long have you
been standing there?

881
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,720
Slightly too long.  I hate that.

882
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,400
Thanks.

883
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,240
JULIA HUMS

884
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,880
NOEL:  Even with the largest
items in the oven...

885
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,600
this Showstopper is
about to get much harder.

886
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,840
I'm making the good boy stars.

887
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,120
They're very soft today.

888
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,720
They're not usually as soft as this.

889
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,280
There are now hundreds
of intricate and fragile

890
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,360
biscuit playing pieces to complete.

891
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,600
Now I need to hurry up.

892
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,000
That's Sandy and Noel.

893
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,840
I've nailed him.

894
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,480
When I make my little hats,

895
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,960
I put about ten grams of
biscuit into the bottom

896
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,200
and cook them that way up.

897
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,080
but I have to oil them well
otherwise they won't come out.

898
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,720
SANDI: Liam doesn't have just one
set of playing pieces to make...

899
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,000
he has three.  I've designed
a multifunctional board game.

900
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,400
So, if you want to play Noughts
&amp; Crosses, you can play that.

901
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,760
If you want to play Snakes and
Ladders, you can play that.

902
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,080
You can play Draughts.

903
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,880
How many pieces are
you bringing to this?

904
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,440
Oh, I've got loads.

905
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,640
Liam's classroom games compendium

906
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,520
will feature a chocolate
orange shortbread blackboard

907
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,560
and over 30 individual
playing pieces

908
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,880
full of flavours straight from
his family's recipe book.

909
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,400
Because my nan always
believed in remedies and stuff,

910
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,800
whenever I was ill, I always
had lemon, ginger and honey.

911
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,040
That's my biscuit.

912
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,240
To make us feel better.

913
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,640
Just a little bit.  Right, OK.

914
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,960
After my fortune cookies.
THEY LAUGH

915
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
NOEL:  Whilst he's only
making one game...

916
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,200
Measuring out all the pieces that
are going to sit on top of the map.

917
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,400
..Chris' individual biscuits
will have to represent

918
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,080
the whole of Great Britain.

919
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,960
I apologise to Cornwall now.

920
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,720
I think I've chopped them off.

921
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,240
Chris' rum and ginger pieces

922
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,320
will sit on an orange
and cardamom biscuit board

923
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,680
to create a game that fuels

924
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,960
his nautical ambitions.

925
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,480
I'm making a Great British Sail Off.

926
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,000
I'm going to have a seal, a dolphin,

927
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,840
I'll put a few land mounts
on Stonehenge, Big Ben, etc.

928
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,960
Instead of a dice,
I've gone for a compass.

929
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,800
You spin it. Whatever number
determines how far you go.

930
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,520
It is quite a big board game.

931
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,080
You're trying to create a
lot of different shapes.

932
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,320
Have you made this before?

933
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,680
Not in three-and-a-half hours.
I need nearer six.

934
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,920
So, as long as the judges
don't keep me talking too long,

935
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,520
I might just do it.  OK.

936
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,680
So, one more question...
HE GROANS

937
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,040
I'm kidding.

938
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,560
SANDI: Steven's Showstopper

939
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,600
will see him attempt to make more
playing pieces than anyone else.

940
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,320
I made it the other day and,
just as I was doing it,

941
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,960
I thought, &quot;This is insane,
what have you done to yourself?&quot;

942
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,280
Of course it's too late by then.

943
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,040
He's planned an entire
coffee gingerbread chess set

944
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,000
complete with a Union Jack-coloured

945
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,800
spiced orange biscuit board.

946
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,680
32 chess pieces, 3-D biscuits.

947
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,560
3-D biscuits?  3-D biscuits.

948
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,280
And each one will have a
different fondant top.

949
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,120
How many pieces are
you having to make then?

950
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,160
100 individual pieces.

951
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,200
That's a lot of work.

952
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,640
SANDI: 90 minutes remaining.

953
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,120
Perfect.

954
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,600
I just want to check that I've
done all the pieces I need to do.

955
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,720
Alarm clock, toothbrush,
blazer, school.

956
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,400
I'm going to check it
every five minutes

957
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,480
cos some of the pieces
are smaller than the others.

958
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,520
I'm, like, massively
behind timings right now.

959
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,720
I'm making fondant, very sticky job.

960
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,160
SHE GROANS

961
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,880
It just takes icing sugar upon
icing sugar to get it right.

962
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,520
I'm not making my own fondant.

963
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,000
I figured I'd rather finish
and use shop-bought.

964
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,160
These are little
individual cupcakes, pawns.

965
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,600
This is the slow, fiddly bit.

966
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,920
I have got a lot to do.

967
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,440
So, I'm starting my black
chalkboard royal icing.

968
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,840
It's getting there.

969
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,600
It's a terrible job, this.

970
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,960
I hate it.

971
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,720
A couple of them are
slightly overbaked.

972
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,440
This is going to be the compass.

973
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,000
12, 14.

974
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,920
Biscuits are still cooking.

975
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,040
Because it is so crumbly
when I've moved it, crackage.

976
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,040
Not as bad as my last one, which
had literally all shattered.

977
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,520
Ahh!

978
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,360
My base broke.

979
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,920
It's all cracked.

980
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,560
Aw. Is she OK?

981
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,880
There's fondant going over it.

982
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,480
Might be a nightmare but
I'll have a go.

983
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,280
SHE SIGHS

984
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,320
Bakers, you've got one hour left.

985
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,400
So, I'm just going to start icing.

986
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,560
Need some fondant to
make a sea effect.

987
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,120
I thought I'd do this first so
at least I've got a decent board.

988
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,120
I've got two white sides,
two blue sides.

989
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,400
There's a bit of a gap.
I can fix it.

990
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,080
Maybe I'll just leave it rustic.

991
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,640
How does a Union Jack work?

992
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,280
Right... White, white, white.

993
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,320
So, I'm just setting up these gates

994
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,680
so when I spray my roof,

995
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,240
the red doesn't bleed all
over the rest of the board.

996
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,080
This is going to be the
main part of my board.

997
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,240
Just trying to get
variation in colour.

998
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,640
This just takes time.

999
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,000
It takes a lot of filling in.

1000
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,400
HE SIGHS

1001
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,120
I feel really nervous about this.

1002
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,840
HE EXHALES

1003
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,080
Shaking so much.

1004
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,400
Just royal icing the black sections.

1005
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,720
This is hot, granulated sugar

1006
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,720
so it just holds them in place.

1007
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,360
Ahh!

1008
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,400
Don't know my own
strength sometimes.

1009
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,960
Let's see if they come out.

1010
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,120
As long as you just play it
just there, we're good.

1011
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,080
That's it, can't move it
round the board at all.  Yeah.

1012
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,240
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

1013
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,040
I know it doesn't look like much,
these are going to get spray gunned.

1014
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,440
Doing the monkeys.

1015
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,440
It needs to be really precise
but I haven't got time.

1016
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,400
There's just something innocent
about them not being decorated.

1017
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,360
Oh!

1018
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,440
I've just literally
sprayed that all over the...

1019
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,680
HE GROANS

1020
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,920
I need to be so much
further ahead than this.

1021
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,400
I'm quite far behind,

1022
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,400
so I need to glue them
together and then start piping.

1023
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,760
My game is supposed to
be a little bit playful,

1024
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,520
so if it's not really
neat, then it's OK.

1025
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,520
That's my story anyway
and I'm sticking to it.

1026
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,040
Bakers, you only have
five minutes left.

1027
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,120
HE EXHALES

1028
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,320
This is me stressed.

1029
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,640
Oh, I've got so much to do.

1030
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,760
I've still got to do my
drainpipes and everything.

1031
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,760
Like a duck, graceful underneath.

1032
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,400
This is probably the hardest
thing I've ever done in my life.

1033
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,400
This challenge.  I don't know
if I'll finish on time.

1034
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,320
Oh, my God. This is terrible.

1035
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,760
It is not the Showstopper.

1036
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,360
I'm running out of time.

1037
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,520
Anything I can help with?

1038
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,880
It depends. I don't know what
your piping skills are like.

1039
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,480
They're powerful.  Are they?

1040
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,480
I'm known as the Powerful Piper.

1041
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,120
I had to rush to
get it done in time.

1042
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,840
One minute.

1043
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,840
Six, one, two, five.

1044
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,040
OK, bakers, your time is up.

1045
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,640
SHE GROANS

1046
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,400
God, I'm so unhappy
with that, but whatever.

1047
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:01,000
Looks like a bomb's hit it.

1048
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,880
It's judgment time for the
bakers' Showstoppers.

1049
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,880
Sophie, please bring up your
biscuit board game.

1050
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,600
Well, I must say,
it's very beautifully neat.

1051
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,640
You haven't had to ice
the whole thing.

1052
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,080
The blocks all look equal.

1053
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,480
Dice look very good.

1054
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,680
Beautiful dice.

1055
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,680
I think we need to try some of this.

1056
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,000
Love the lemon flavour. Bergamot.

1057
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,600
Afterwards, you get...  There's
a little bit right at the end.

1058
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,960
OK, yeah.  But it works,
it's beautiful, crispy, snap.

1059
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,760
Snakes and ladders is a classic game
and I think you've done a very,

1060
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,440
very good job.

1061
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,920
That was a lot better
than I expected.

1062
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,920
Well done.

1063
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,480
I love the colours.

1064
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,000
Bright as anything. The edges
are terrific, it's very neat.

1065
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
The board is a mixed spice.

1066
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,000
Very spicy and Christmassy.

1067
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,600
And soft. As a biscuit, that's too
soft for me.

1068
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,160
But the overall design is fantastic.

1069
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,160
Very much an architect's piece
of work.

1070
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,760
The overall game
is a little disappointing.

1071
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,640
Yeah.  The biscuits are delicious.

1072
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,720
Aren't they?  There's not much ginger
coming through,

1073
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,680
but there's lots of lime. Texture is
very, very good, as well.

1074
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,680
You make your way around the board
towards Noel and Sandi.

1075
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,240
It's a shame all this is broken up,
cos what you've essentially done

1076
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,320
is made a lot of different biscuits
and piped different numbers on them.

1077
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,200
The lemony one's lovely.  The
biscuit's been overworked, slightly.

1078
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,200
It's quite rubbery. The matcha comes
through, that's pretty much it.

1079
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,800
James, I love the colours.

1080
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,240
I mean, they're my kind of colours.

1081
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,520
They're bang in your face.

1082
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,040
Exactly.  I really love them.

1083
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,280
Cones have sort of worked.

1084
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,680
Every time I move it, a little bit
more falls off.

1085
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,560
Is that part of the game?
It has to be a quick game.

1086
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,720
I must say the texture
is nice to eat.

1087
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,720
The chocolate's delicious, melts in
the mouth, the flavour's very good.

1088
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,280
The actual board game, the way
you've set it up, is a nice idea.

1089
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,360
Thank you.

1090
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,400
Flo, please bring up
your biscuit board game.

1091
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,400
Do I have to?  Yes.

1092
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,920
That's Mr Neverwell.

1093
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,040
I'm not surprised.

1094
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,560
LAUGHTER

1095
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,880
So you pick these up...  Yeah.
..and you try and pick up one

1096
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,400
of these things here.  Yeah.

1097
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,800
Very good. It certainly
looks striking.

1098
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,360
But it is a bit messy, isn't it?

1099
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,080
You made your fondant, didn't you?

1100
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,400
Yeah.  And you didn't need to.

1101
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,240
No. The man's almond.

1102
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,240
The yellow one is vanilla.

1103
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,680
There's not a lot of difference
between them.

1104
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,120
Not a lot of difference
between the two.

1105
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,480
They're both great biscuits, they're
crumbly, they break easily,

1106
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,960
there's no chew to it at all.

1107
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,960
Simplistic, but actually
it does the job.

1108
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,240
Well done, Flo.

1109
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,400
He's getting bin bagged.

1110
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,400
I'll have to sedate.

1111
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,360
You spin the compass, and depending
on which number it lands on,

1112
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,120
is how many spaces
you move.

1113
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,800
That works quite well, doesn't it?

1114
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,280
It's a bit rough and ready.

1115
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,880
It's colourful,
which is a good thing.

1116
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,400
And the little boats are quite neat.

1117
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,360
The landmark is rum and ginger.

1118
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,800
That's Scotland leaving England.

1119
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,800
LAUGHTER

1120
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,360
You do want your own teeth,
I'll just tell you.

1121
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,760
Both the biscuits are burnt.
The flavour's OK.

1122
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,760
I think the most impressive thing
is your compass.

1123
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,520
No-one's ever said that
to me before.

1124
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,880
Not your strong point, then.

1125
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,880
LAUGHTER

1126
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,200
I think it does look a little bit
messy.

1127
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,000
I just didn't have time to, like,
decorate it in the way I wanted to.

1128
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,240
I think it looks a little bit more
like a jungle swamp.

1129
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,960
That's the lemon and paradise one.

1130
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,880
I'm not getting the grains
of paradise.

1131
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,200
I can't taste it. It's a little bit
solid. I don't think eating that is

1132
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,200
going to be a huge pleasure.

1133
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,600
It looks a bit unfinished, because
once the board was done,

1134
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,240
you just spent the rest of the time
cutting out these shapes.

1135
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:27,240
You could've decorated them a
little bit more.

1136
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,880
Fantastic flavour.  The lemon, honey,
and ginger is delicious.

1137
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,080
To get the honey,

1138
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,440
the lemon, and ginger altogether
is quite tricky to do.

1139
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,720
The board game is a chocolate orange
and cinnamon.

1140
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,680
And it's got chocolate chips in it?
Mmm-hmm.

1141
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,080
I have to say, I think
it's absolutely delicious.

1142
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,880
It's just crumbly and melting
and yum.

1143
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,560
I'd like to see more decoration,

1144
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,920
but the biscuits are the star
of the show.

1145
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,880
Which game do you want to play?
Noughts and crosses.

1146
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,880
OK, you be the noughts.
OK, cool.

1147
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,560
You could've won.  I know, I know.
Paul!

1148
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,880
I would never do that.

1149
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,880
LAUGHTER

1150
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,880
Well done.
We're getting drunk tonight.

1151
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,760
Steven, would you like to bring
your biscuit board game up?

1152
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,560
I think I'm going to help.

1153
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,880
This is a bit scary.

1154
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,040
LAUGHTER

1155
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,040
OK.

1156
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,280
That is exceptional.  Thank you.

1157
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,560
The work that you've got on the top
is sublime.

1158
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,920
It's very delicate.

1159
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,920
It's a little masterpiece.

1160
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,400
You have a great bake.

1161
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,360
It's a great tasting gingerbread.

1162
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:57,360
It's very good because the fondant
isn't too thick.

1163
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,800
The orange flavour is delicious.

1164
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,800
It's very well designed, and it's as
neat as a pin.

1165
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,960
Very, very clever.
Well done, Stephen.  Thank you.

1166
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,600
Well done.  Oh, mate.

1167
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,600
Stacey, please bring
up your biscuit board game.

1168
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,280
The board game is a made-up game
called Get To School.

1169
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,800
There's three players,
I've got three boys.

1170
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,520
It is so neat, and so beautifully
done. The piping is good,

1171
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,520
and the sweet little school blazer
is just exquisite.

1172
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,680
That's vanilla and strawberry.

1173
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,440
Slightly chewy.  Yeah.
Quite rubbery.

1174
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:48,440
Sorry.  I'm not getting much flavour.

1175
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,040
From an eating point of view,

1176
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,040
that's much more icing than you need
on that bit of biscuit.

1177
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,560
The chocolate, dry as a bone,
the texture's all wrong.

1178
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,400
It just crumbles into nothing.

1179
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,440
It's a beautifully conceived game,

1180
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:23,000
but the flavour and the texture
is not so wonderful.

1181
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,360
Do you not think we look like four
people who'd couldn't agree

1182
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,920
what game they wanted to play?

1183
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,840
So we cut them all into bits.

1184
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,600
I loved this challenge.

1185
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,200
I mean, an incredible array
of imagination on display.

1186
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,200
Absolutely, and some terrific skill,
too.  Steven's was exquisite.

1187
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,640
And then Tom's, I mean, that could
have come out of a magazine.

1188
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,680
It's the same
when you look at Sophie's

1189
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,680
and the taste of those
biscuits were divine.

1190
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,920
Chris came into the
Showstopper in trouble.

1191
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,000
His problem was that he just
never got near the end.

1192
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,960
Stacey's, although they look great,
the biscuits were bone dry

1193
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,280
and her cake struggled as well.
She didn't finish her bake.

1194
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,640
She's too ambitious.

1195
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,320
Flo didn't do brilliantly today and
she was not pleased with herself.

1196
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,040
So it's not as clean-cut
as you think

1197
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,440
when you look down at the bottom.

1198
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,680
That's going to be more of
a conversation, who's going.

1199
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,960
But I think we'll agree
on who's Star Baker.

1200
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,960
I think so.

1201
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,000
That's my head!  I know.

1202
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I'm short enough.

1203
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,000
Well, bakers, thank you
for some wonderful board games.

1204
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,480
I've got the lovely job of
announcing Star Baker.

1205
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,120
The Star Baker this week
produced some exquisite

1206
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,000
detail in the Showstopper.

1207
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,040
The Star Baker is

1208
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,040
Steven.
APPLAUSE

1209
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,040
So, of course, that means
I have the difficult

1210
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,040
job of announcing who
is going to be leaving us.

1211
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,320
The baker leaving the tent is...

1212
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,600
..Chris.  Aw! What a surprise.

1213
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,160
Come on, let's have a hug. Come on.

1214
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,760
APPLAUSE

1215
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,760
I'm disappointed I never got to make
any breads, any pastries,

1216
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,160
the things that
fit my style of baking.

1217
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,160
I'm just so honoured and privileged
to have got in that tent.

1218
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,080
Everything fell to pieces for him.

1219
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:33,080
It's a real shame, you know, cos
he's got some fantastic ideas.

1220
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,640
All right, mate. Well done.
Everybody will miss Chris.

1221
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,640
It's one of the sad things about
Bake Off, is seeing people go.

1222
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,640
Are you happy to get through?
Just a little bit.

1223
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,240
Gulp!

1224
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,320
Dodged a bullet there but,
yeah, happy that.

1225
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,120
You turned out all right,
didn't you?

1226
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,840
THEY LAUGH
It's all right.

1227
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,200
It's all right.  All right?

1228
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,080
I'm not disappointed I didn't get
Star Baker. Maybe another week.

1229
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,800
The double.
Oh, you're going for a double.

1230
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,160
No, I mean, he's done the double.

1231
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,160
I don't think I'll ever get
used to this feeling.

1232
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,480
It's alien to me.

1233
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,480
I've bullied myself so much
all my life that finally I'm getting

1234
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,840
praise, I don't know what
to do with it.

1235
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,000
This week, I let myself
down terrible.

1236
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,320
I expected to go home.

1237
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,680
Come here.

1238
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,200
You're not getting rid of me
that easy, are you?

1239
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,440
Next time...  We expect
perfection.  ..it's a bread week.

1240
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,320
No pressure.
But who will impress Paul...

1241
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,200
I feel like you're trying to psych
me out.  ..with a fruity signature...

1242
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,480
Ah, they've sunk!  I don't think it's
baked.  No, that's not good.

1243
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,920
..a two-tiered technical...

1244
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,440
Oh, my God.
..that's all about the detail...

1245
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,720
The bottom of my bread has eaten
the top.  ..and the most ambitious...

1246
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,440
This is where the trouble starts.
..multicoloured bread sculptures

1247
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,640
the Bake Off has ever seen.

1248
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,640
That is ridiculous.

1249
00:57:48,160 --> 00:58:13,000
