1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,679
It's week seven, there's only
six bakers left

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,559
and, boy, are they going to need
some skills today!

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,879
Hey, Sandi, what are you doing?
I'm making pizza.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,719
Paul's been teaching me how to toss.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,720
He is an expert.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Welcome to The Great British Bake Off.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,199
Last time... I hate rushing.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,239
It's not me... the bakers got to
grips with pastry.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,919
Sophie came close again.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,479
Beautifully done.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,559
But it was Liam...

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,839
Spectacular! ..winning Star Baker
for the very first time.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,519
I am so embarrassed.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,359
Kate and Stacey were close to cracking.

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,799
Meh! But it was Julia who crumbled
under the pressure...

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,959
My pastry is absolutely rank.

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,159
I'm so sorry.

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,439
...becoming the sixth
baker to say farewell.

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,440
Now for the first time ever, it's
Italian week on Bake Off...

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,279
Si, buongiorno, come stai?

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,399
...with temperatures to match.

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,559
Oh, it is boiling.

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,919
The bakers take on one of Sicily's
favourite street foods...

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,119
What am I doing?

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,719
...tackle a classic that's not as
simple as they think...

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,399
Absolute disaster.

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,279
...and attempt the most complex of
Italian pastries.

28
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,759
Hell, is what it is.

29
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,760
Hell.

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,919
Are you sure this canal goes all the
way from Berkshire to Venice?

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,199
Yeah, it's one of Britain's best
kept secrets.

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,319
A bit like the fact that we're doing
the first ever Italian week on

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,959
Bake Off. I am so excited, I cannot
wait to get started.

34
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,599
Me too. Actually though,

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,159
I think this might take a bit longer
than I thought.

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,199
If you're a gondolier, shouldn't you
be singing to me?

37
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,919
Yeah, fair enough. What do you want?
Rage Against The Machine?

38
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,319
Kanye West? Do you know? I think
I'll walk.

39
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,599
I could do something smoother.

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Luther Vandross? No longer
listening, start the show.

41
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,919
It's shaping up to be the hottest
day in the tent... ever.

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,679
It is going to be like Valley of the
Kings in that tent today.

43
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,879
Valley of the Cakes, I think!

44
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,880
If we have to do the naked Bake Off,
so be it.

45
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,599
I'm still here, can you believe it?
They can't get rid of me!

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,239
Hopefully they won't get rid of me
this week either.

47
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,479
Star Baker last week was...
Yeah, it was sick,

48
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,439
but literally I enjoyed it
for, like, one day.

49
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,559
I've got to crack on with Italian
week now.

50
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,719
Oh, Italian week.

51
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,519
It's like boot camp for bakers.

52
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,319
I absolutely love Italy.

53
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,239
Hopefully by the end of the weekend,
I still will!

54
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,479
Morning, bakers, or should I say,
buongiorno, bakers!

55
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,839
I'm so excited about Italian week,
I've designed my own Italian shirt.

56
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,479
Italian stallion.

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,959
Pony. More of a pony!

58
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Right, Prue and Paul would like you
to make your version of the Sicilian

59
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,159
classic cannoli, so those little
fried pastry tubes.

60
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,160
Apparently every self-respecting
Sicilian mother, and even one or two

61
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,119
with no respect at all, has her own
version of this recipe.

62
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,079
The judges would like you to make 18
with three different flavoured

63
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,359
fillings. Obviously your tubes must
be identical.

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,519
Nobody wants mismatched tubes.

65
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,599
No, that is painful.
You've got 2.5 hours.

66
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,600
On your marks... Get set...
BOTH: ..infornare!

67
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,319
Ciao, bellissimo.

68
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,639
Isn't that Italian? I don't-a know!

69
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,799
The one thing I have learned is that
you respect Italian food

70
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,999
and Italians.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The Sicilian cannoli is a tube of
deep-fried pastry,

72
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,839
filled with a ricotta sweet mixture.

73
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,479
Just to make it a little harder,

74
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,239
we've told them they have to have
three different fillings.

75
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,399
The most difficult thing about
making a cannoli is getting the
shell right.

76
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,599
They must be beautiful golden brown
and it must have bubbles

77
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
when you're frying it. This is very
characteristic of a cannoli.

78
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,679
The luscious filling,
it mustn't run out.

79
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,680
You should be able to eat it in your
hand without a mess.

80
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,679
All right, it's very hot today and
we're asking the bakers to make

81
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,239
cannoli, but they make them in
Palermo in the middle of summer

82
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,839
and that can be 45 degrees.

83
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,479
No excuses.

84
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,480
So, I'm just making my
dough for my 18 cannolis.

85
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,559
We're going to add vinegar, quite an
unusual ingredient.

86
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,560
This is the science bit.
Vinegar evaporates quickly and
creates bubbles.

87
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,039
Getting the balance right...

88
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,799
160g.

89
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,479
...is crucial to achieving the
perfect cannoli shell.

90
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,439
I don't want to put too much in.

91
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,119
I don't want it to be a sticky mess.

92
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,519
Good morning, Liam. Hi, Liam.

93
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,999
Hello. Right, tell us all about your
cannoli.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So, my cannolis are inspired by me,
basically, how I am as a person.

95
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,639
I love that, it's a narcissistic
cannoli!

96
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,039
HE LAUGHS

97
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,119
My mates say I have a cheesy sort of
sense of humour.

98
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,359
So I'm going for a lemon cheesecake
cannoli,

99
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,360
and then I eat a lot of Turkish food
in my spare time, so my second one

100
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,279
is inspired by baklava.

101
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,839
As well as his lemon cheesecake flavour,

102
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,479
and baklava-inspired honey and nuts,

103
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,879
Liam's third filling

104
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,959
is marshmallow and chocolate.

105
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,119
My dad took me camping a couple of
years ago.

106
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,799
Camping always reminds me of
marshmallows and chocolate.

107
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,079
I love the idea of the flavours.

108
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,039
Have you been practising?
Yeah, 100%.

109
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,199
I don't know how many cannolis I've
been through this week, but...

110
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,679
You haven't been practising,
have you? I have! Why don't
you believe me?!

111
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,359
He's like the godfather of the
Bake Off tent!

112
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,919
One egg plus yolk.

113
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,319
For Steven, every week is Italian week.

114
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,279
I have family in Italy.

115
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,280
My grandfather was Italian,
but unfortunately,

116
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,119
it's not done much to help me here today

117
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,879
because I don't think I ever saw him
make cannoli.

118
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,880
Steven's adding Italian style to his
cannoli with coffee and hazelnuts,

119
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,240
almond praline and Italian lemon curd.

120
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,999
The reason I'm using Italian lemons
is not just because it's Italian

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,039
week, but they are incredible,
the flavour and the smell.

122
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,040
They do produce some incredible food
and that's why we love it.

123
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,679
Hello, Stacey. What are you doing?
What's your cannoli?

124
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,359
I have a jam roly cannoli.

125
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,360
It was jam roly-poly cannoli but I
took out the poly.

126
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Stacey is also making cheesecake and
tiramisu fillings.

127
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,359
And she's adding cocoa powder
to her dough.

128
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,359
I decided to do a new twist.

129
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,360
How are you going to know when your
cannoli shells are cooked,

130
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,639
because they're going to be brown,
aren't they?

131
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,919
Yeah. I just sort of know.
I feel like I know.

132
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,920
But I might not, we'll see.

133
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,959
This is going to chill out in the
fridge.

134
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,399
I'm just going to start my fillings now.

135
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,400
The bakers are aiming for flavours
that will make their cannoli truly

136
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,120
eccezionale.

137
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,519
I'm just creaming together my
marshmallow and meringue,

138
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,520
and then my other batch,
walnuts and pistachios.

139
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,999
I'm doing Kate's happy hour,
Italian cocktail cannoli.

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
This is my favourite drink
of all time. Have a bit!

141
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,519
Kate's minibar is officially open!

142
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,999
Oh, it's so good!

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,519
So good! Hwah-ha!

144
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,479
Kate's cocktail flavours will
include limoncello,

145
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,319
Negroni and espresso martini.

146
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,320
It's not a proper night out if you
don't have at least three espresso
martinis!

147
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,519
What you don't want to do is put too
much alcohol in it,
it just overwhelms everything.

148
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,159
I had one once, an espresso martini,
and at the end of drinking it,

149
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,039
I gave away all my jewellery to
strangers!

150
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,999
A terrifying drink.

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,639
Kate's not the only baker heading
for the cocktail cabinet.

152
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,640
These flavours have come from
a night out.

153
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,319
Yan's filling one with
Amaretto-infused mint,

154
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,799
rose and lime.
Another with honey and Amaretto.

155
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,519
The third is passion fruit and
vanilla, and like Stacey,

156
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,679
she's also adding cocoa powder to
her dough.

157
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,959
Do you get the telltale bubbles on
your cannoli?

158
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,199
Yes, I do. But what I'm finding is,

159
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,839
I can't see it when it turns the
correct colour to take them out,

160
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,840
so I'm relying on instinct.

161
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Now I'm just making the base for all
18 cannoli across three flavours.

162
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,519
The thickener, that's the most
important thing.

163
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,839
Hopefully my filling will be nice
and tough

164
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,359
and not fall out of the tube.

165
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,360
I'm going to add the ricotta.
It's the ricotta base one.

166
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,639
Ricotta is the traditional base

167
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,599
and most of the bakers are sticking
with this Italian favourite.

168
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,799
I don't want to play around with
classics, especially Sicilian,

169
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,439
because I imagine they'd probably
get quite cranky.

170
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,279
I'm doing ricotta.

171
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,559
I just didn't want crowds of angry
Italians saying,

172
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,999
"That's not traditional! What is she
doing? She's messing around."

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,399
I'd probably find a horse's head in
my bed the next day if I did that.

174
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,799
But one of the bakers...

175
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,679
We're not here to do exactly as per
the Sicilians,

176
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,439
we're here to sort of put our
own spin and adapt recipes.

177
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,839
...isn't afraid to take on
tradition.

178
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,439
Are you using Sicilian sheep's milk,
ricotta?

179
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,239
I'm not using any ricotta.

180
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,319
Sophie's filling one with
Amaretto and almond,

181
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,320
another with limoncello cream and
the third with a mix of chocolate

182
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,679
and hazelnuts. Where's the ricotta?

183
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,039
I'm using mascarpone. What?!

184
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,599
In a cannoli? Yes.

185
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,279
Why? I think the texture's a lot
nicer.

186
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,399
Oh, God, what? It's a cannoli!

187
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,639
It has ricotta in it. Does it have
to be ricotta?

188
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,959
Obviously an apple pie's got to have
apple in it,

189
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,839
you can't make it with pear.
It's highly unusual.

190
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,599
It's not really that weird.

191
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,119
It is if you're in Sicily.

192
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,359
How does this set then?

193
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,719
I am using gelatine.

194
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,319
Gelatine as well! Are they still
going to be recognisable cannoli?

195
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,159
They will definitely be cannoli.

196
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,160
They're a little twist.

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,359
Bakers, according to the pasta clock,

198
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,759
you are halfway through your challenge.

199
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,760
I can assure you, this guy is
usually pretty accurate.

200
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,440
I've got my dough.

201
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,919
I'm passing it through the pasta roller.

202
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,399
This gets rolled out quite thinly.

203
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,400
What's important is that it's thin
enough for it to be nice and light,

204
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,839
but it's thick enough to make bubbles.

205
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,239
It needs the bubbles.
It's a balancing act.

206
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,559
Do I look like I know what I'm doing?

207
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,719
It's just, how thin am I going to go?

208
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,079
I've gone for, like, a
one millimetre thickness.

209
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,639
Too thick and the pastry won't cook.

210
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,439
Too thin and the bubbles won't appear.

211
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,519
There's a set of rules that you have
to follow and if you don't,

212
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,520
then you get stung.

213
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,159
Right, cut it.

214
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,160
I'm going to roll this out.

215
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,679
Are you all right?
I'm just hot.

216
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,239
The winner of this gets to lie down
in a child's paddling pool full of

217
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,559
ice cold water. Everyone should lie
down in a child's paddling pool!

218
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,599
Ah! That's quite nice, isn't it?

219
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,159
Today the tent is hotter than Palermo.

220
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,479
And they're deep frying, poor things.

221
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,480
It's about to get even hotter.

222
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,639
Cos what you want to do in this
heat is put more clothes on.

223
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,599
Don't want to burn myself.

224
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,119
Health and safety first.

225
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,120
If we're splashed with hot oil, it's
going to really, really hurt.

226
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Let's do this.
In they go.

227
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,560
This bit is the most important bit.

228
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,919
I just hope they don't separate.

229
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,759
Seal the edges.

230
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,679
If you don't seal them, it just
comes straight off the form

231
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,680
and just floats to the top
like a poppadom.

232
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,359
Great, it's poppadom week!

233
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,919
Why did that just ping off the mould?

234
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,920
I'm not impressed. Oh, God!

235
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,359
Some of them are just floating up.

236
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,199
So that is one minute 15.
That's not enough.

237
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,919
Ew!

238
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,119
I can't tell when it's done.

239
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,159
What I do find fascinating is,

240
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,039
Stacey and Yan added a little bit of
cocoa powder to the mixture.

241
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,159
It's quite dark.

242
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,239
How will she know when it's fried?

243
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,240
I tell when I'm deep frying
something by the colour.

244
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,999
Are you all right?

245
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,319
Oh, dear, that's not good!

246
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,239
And this is what it's not supposed
to look like.

247
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,199
It was a shame because that was a
good-looking one.

248
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,759
It's not the day, is it? No.

249
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,799
Yeah, I totally want to do this
on a really hot day.

250
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,119
Do you want me to somehow block the sun?

251
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,120
If you could, that would be great.
I'll put a call into the moon. Thank
you, my darling. See you in a bit.

252
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,919
They're making bubbles.

253
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,519
You want the bubbles on the surface
of it.

254
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,839
Bubbles are really important.

255
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,840
Some of them haven't got as many
bubbles as I'd like, so I'm going to
do those ones again.

256
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,239
And I really don't want to run out
of time.

257
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,959
Right, fillings.

258
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Smashed up almond praline.

259
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,319
The chocolate espresso one is under way.

260
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,320
Lemon cheesecake.

261
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,799
Bakers, you have 15 minutes.

262
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,279
You see, these are better.
I've got 15 minutes.

263
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,559
I'm not going to have time to fill
them if I don't get on.

264
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,559
It's weird, it's not as thick as it
is normally.

265
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,519
As soon as it hits the really hot
weather here,

266
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,199
it's getting quite liquid already.

267
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,719
Oh, my God, it's all coming out the
sides.

268
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,519
This is a disaster!

269
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,519
Just a disaster.

270
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,799
SHE SIGHS
Stop shaking.

271
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,999
I think I'm one short.
I've lost a shell.

272
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,199
Bakers, you have just ten minutes.

273
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Oh, under pressure, immense pressure.

274
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,959
Hey, Stace, I'm coming in, but only
briefly and then I'm leaving.

275
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,960
OK, I'm going out. I'll come in,
you go out. Sorry!

276
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,439
The little tube has fallen off.

277
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,440
What am I doing?

278
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,160
Oh, man!

279
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,719
You've got one minute, bakers.

280
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,759
60 seconds to make it count.

281
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,760
You can do it, come on.

282
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,679
I can't believe what I've done.

283
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,879
The raspberries were supposed to go
at the end of these,

284
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,880
but I've only gone and put them on
the other ones, haven't I?

285
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,479
I'm so upset.

286
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,480
My hands always shake when it comes
to the last couple of minutes.

287
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Bakers, time's up.

288
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,920
It's too hot.

289
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,000
They look a mess.

290
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,320
The bakers' cannoli now face
the judgment of Paul and Prue.

291
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Hi, Stacey. Hi.

292
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,479
Is that not meant to be like that?
No, and I'll tell you why.

293
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,639
What's basically happened is,

294
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,719
I put the raspberries on the end of
the wrong ones.

295
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,239
I dipped them in the wrong thing.

296
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,559
It's formed bubbles, it has got some
bubbles on there.

297
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,560
Tiramisu? Yeah.

298
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,079
Great flavours, tiramisu.

299
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,199
That cheesecake one is absolutely
beautiful.

300
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,799
But the pastry, it's a bit doughy.

301
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,959
Let's have a raspberry one.

302
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,399
A bit chewy. It shouldn't be chewy.

303
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,519
It's underdone.

304
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,679
The pastry dough started off brown.

305
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,239
It's very difficult to tell looking
at it when their deep-fried enough.

306
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,959
When you were holding that one,
I couldn't tell what was fingers
and what was cannoli.

307
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,679
I think you should rename them,
Hollywood Fingers!

308
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,680
Do you know what? I might do.
Little Stumps!

309
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,239
Great shell. Really beautiful
bubbles.

310
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,839
OK, let's look at this marshmallow
chocolate.

311
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,199
Well, OK. It's pouring out, isn't
it?

312
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Yeah. Probably not the best choice
for a filling.

313
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,719
The lemony one is delicious.

314
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,519
Very good. What's this one again?

315
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,239
Pistachios, walnuts, ricotta.

316
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,240
You can really taste all of that,
sensational. Cheers.

317
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,759
Look at the bubbles on that, it's
perfect.

318
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,760
We have milk chocolate, honey
and almond praline.

319
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,839
I love the flavour. The praline in
there, particularly, is very good.

320
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,319
Steven, that mocha one is very
unctuous, lovely.

321
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,320
This is Italian lemon curd.

322
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,639
Very sharp.

323
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,719
It is sharp.

324
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,119
The flavour of that with the
Italian lemon is delicious.

325
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,120
It's so sharp. Well done.

326
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,839
My biggest concern is, I don't see
too many bubbles on them.

327
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Some of them look quite flat,
without too much activation.

328
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,079
The pastry itself is very, very thin.

329
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,239
Remind us of this one.

330
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,039
Mint, lime and rose.

331
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,519
A nice bit of tartness.
The flavours in that are lovely.

332
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,520
Honey and amaretto.

333
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,480
I don't think that's mean to happen.
Bartender's always ready for you!

334
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,439
Your pastry is too tender.

335
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,999
Because I didn't squish that hard,
it just fell to pieces.

336
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,759
The cocoa has fooled you into
thinking it's ready. Probably could
have done with a little bit

337
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,760
longer. Think your shells
have let you down. Hm.

338
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,879
They're certainly not quite
identical, are they?

339
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,479
Some of them are a bit shorter,
some of them are more bubbly.

340
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,559
Got quite a few bubbles on some of them.

341
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,560
This is the Martini one, is that
right? Yeah, espresso, yeah.

342
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,599
Not a very alcoholic.

343
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,119
I'm a little disappointed, I thought
there would be more.

344
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,120
This one? Limoncello.

345
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,759
I think the alcohol is all right.

346
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,119
This is the negroni.

347
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,239
Very orangey. The ricotta in that
one, particularly, you can taste,

348
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,240
which is delicious. Thank you.

349
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,479
So, I have a lemon, lime and ginger,
an amaretto and almond,

350
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,999
and hazelnut and chocolate.

351
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,959
I've tried it with ricotta, I just
prefer them with mascarpone.

352
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,639
Right, it's going to be fascinating
to try it with the mascarpone.

353
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,640
It's going to be interesting to see
how this set in the shell itself.

354
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,280
This is a real test!

355
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,959
Mm!

356
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,479
It doesn't pour all down, it holds.

357
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,199
Yeah, very good. This not at all
sloppy.

358
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,919
I think you might have converted me.
Awesome, thank you.

359
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,920
The almond and amaretto. Mm!
That is heaven.

360
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,519
You've got a slight dryness coming
through in the flavouring as well.

361
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,079
OK.

362
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,679
Yeah, I think you've got three
very good cannolis there.

363
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,479
If cannoli on the streets of Sicily
tasted like these,

364
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,079
I'd be very happy. I'm not sure I'd
be welcome after my use of
mascarpone, though!

365
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,679
I think you should take that in when
you get your next spray tan,

366
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,679
for the colour!

367
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,519
I think you should take that one in!
HE LAUGHS

368
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,439
Thank you very much indeed.
Very good. Thank you.

369
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,440
I was a little bit concerned, but
that went a lot better than I
thought it was going to.

370
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,119
He was playing with his jaw
and I thought,

371
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,839
I know that feeling. You know when
you eat something really sharp,
it gets you right here.

372
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,719
You cannot afford even to mess up
a little bit here now.

373
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,479
Every single challenge counts.

374
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,480
It's very, very, very stressful.

375
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,679
Ciao, bakers, it's time for Italian
week's technical challenge,

376
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,039
set for you by the lovely Signora Prue.

377
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,439
Do you have any advice for the
baking bambinos?

378
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,440
ITALIAN TRANSLATION:

379
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,359
Well, I don't think that could have
been any more helpful.

380
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,360
Judges, I'm going to have to ask you
to leave the tent, please.

381
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,639
Prue, you can get on with your novel.

382
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,599
Paul has enroled in a mime class.

383
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,479
For today's technical challenge,

384
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Prue and Paul would like you to make
an Italian classic, pizza!

385
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,439
We want a perfectly made margherita.

386
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,319
You've got an hour and a half. On
your marks... Get set...

387
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,320
BOTH: Infornare.

388
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,959
I don't actually know what pizza is.
No, I'm joking!

389
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,960
Basically, it's bread with a bit of
cheese on top.

390
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,999
What's the worst that could happen?

391
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,919
So, Prue, why have you chosen a
pizza margherita as the technical

392
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,079
challenge? Well, it's one of those
things that everyone thinks is easy,

393
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,639
and actually it's quite difficult
to get right.

394
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,719
The dough, it's got to stretch
because you want it to be really,

395
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,119
really thin. Have you left them with
rolling pins?

396
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,679
No, we took their rolling pins away.

397
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,759
We thought they might fling it up
and get it round.

398
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,359
A bit of throwing, press with the
fingers, a bit of throwing?

399
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,360
That's the traditional way to do it.
You've got the classic Italian flag,
the white, the red and green.

400
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,959
It's a sacred thing, the pizza
margherita to the Italians.

401
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,039
It really is important if they're
going to use basil to put it
on at the end.

402
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,999
It tastes better raw.

403
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,359
It has to be cooked until it just
begins to blacken.

404
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,519
Crisp dough, on the outside,
bending over in the middle.

405
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,520
I think they will find it tougher
than they think.

406
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,760
"200g of flour,
half a teaspoon of fine salt,

407
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,359
"2tbsp of olive oil."

408
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,360
"Add the yeast to the remaining
dough ingredients to make the
dough. Knead."

409
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,319
I'm not really sure what a pizza
dough is meant to be like.

410
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,320
Prue said something like...
Na-na-na, na ah, nah!

411
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,599
Magra is thin.

412
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,439
Bellissima means beautiful.

413
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,399
She also said croccante, at the end,
which means crispy.

414
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,839
HE LAUGHS

415
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,839
It's almost there, bouncing back.
Come on, baby.

416
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,840
Give it like a couple more kneads
and then be able to prove.

417
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,240
I don't think we need the proving
drawer in this temperature.
I'm just going to clingfilm it.

418
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,079
Right, prove it for an hour?

419
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,399
I don't know how long.

420
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,519
Usually you leave it until it has
doubled in size.

421
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,319
BEEPING

422
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,119
Are you playing a video game, Liam?

423
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,759
It just says make a tomato sauce,
which is helpful.

424
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,359
Chopping some garlic.

425
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,360
They give you no quantities
on the tomatoes, olive oil, garlic
or lemon juice.

426
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,959
Can I hold that for you?

427
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,559
You how much we love you!

428
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,519
I'm not sure how much garlic to do.

429
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,959
What do you think?

430
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,959
Just put the tomatoes in.

431
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,959
Making sure it's probably nice
and thick and rich.

432
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,119
Now they've got lemon juice in
there. Strange.

433
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,439
I'm sure you add the lemon juice at
the end.

434
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,319
I might do a little bit now.

435
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,320
A pinch of caster sugar in to
balance it out.

436
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,400
I'm sure I've done it wrong.

437
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,599
I've just chopped the end of my
finger off on the fan.

438
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Don't worry. Oh, God, I'm going to
faint.

439
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,240
Do you want a glass of water? What
happened? My finger went in the fan.

440
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,519
Someone has badly stitched the
health and safety inspector.

441
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,079
It's all fine, I've had a look, it's
fine.

442
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,319
Have you finished massacring yourself?

443
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,679
Yeah. I once took a plaster off and
I actually passed out.

444
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,439
In terms of stories for dinner parties,

445
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,440
I wouldn't lead with that one.

446
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,160
Bakers, you are halfway through your
pizza delivery time.

447
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,519
What are you doing? I'm being the
leaning Tower of Pizza.

448
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,959
OK, I'm going now. OK.

449
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,279
It should be double in size for the
dough so that's perfect.

450
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,280
Shape and toss enough of the dough
to make a 30cm base.

451
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,680
There's no rolling pin.

452
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,439
Sneaky. Sneaky, Prue.

453
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,119
Of course you don't have a rolling pin.

454
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,839
I've never done freehand like this.

455
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,840
The whole point of that,
you've got equal force going around
all the entire pizza, so it brings

456
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,879
it all out, but it could fall on the
floor and I'd have to make it again.

457
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,799
Now? Not yet.

458
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,279
OK. It's too scary, man.

459
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,639
I don't know!

460
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,119
I might sort of flatten it out by hand.

461
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,239
I'm just going to stretch it like this.

462
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,359
I'm not going to toss it because I
can't because I've injured myself.

463
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,559
What about now? No, not yet.

464
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,239
Go on, I'll take responsibility.

465
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,240
Go on. Go on, go on, go on.

466
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,480
A bit higher. I'm not.

467
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Oh! Are you kidding me?

468
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,159
It's too elastic now.
I knocked all the air out, dammit.

469
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,079
I'm going to prove it again.

470
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,080
One more toss and then I'm done.

471
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,479
Hey, are you all right?

472
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,959
I'm basically down to the wire cos I
had to reprove my bread.

473
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,799
It's fine, no worries.
You look like a pizza. I know.

474
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,799
Pretend to be my pizza, please.
I'll just lie down in front of Paul.

475
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,800
He'll prod you and go,
"A bit overworked."

476
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Bakers, you've got 30 minutes left
to finish your yeasted flat breads

477
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,079
topped with cheese and tomato sauce.

478
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,359
I do think it sounds better if you
just say pizza.

479
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,239
Bakers, you've got 30 minutes left
to finish your pizza.

480
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,919
Pizza topping, here we go.

481
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,920
I think mozzarella should be torn
onto a pizza.

482
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,199
I think I should have done big
chunks of mozzarella.

483
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,399
Little bits of basil on the top.

484
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,359
If I put the basil on now, it will burn.

485
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,039
The bakers are using traditional
Italian peels to get their pizzas

486
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,799
into the hot oven.

487
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,800
And it's crucial they're handled
correctly. That is super annoying.

488
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,160
I should have decorated it on here
because it's just gone a funny
shape.

489
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,240
It might have made it a bit shorter
in the process.

490
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,679
That's going to go in for as long as
it takes to cook.

491
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,119
BEEPING
Ten minutes.

492
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,079
Whoo! Got it in the oven.

493
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,359
My pizza's not a good shape but...

494
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,799
Let's have a look.

495
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Oh, come on. Come on.

496
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,280
My pizza's stuck. God's sake!

497
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,679
Oh, man.

498
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,959
Right, this is actual disaster zone.

499
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Oh, my God!

500
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,920
Oh, my word! Absolute disaster.

501
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,999
Oh, you beauty. Good girl.

502
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,199
How long have I got?

503
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,879
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes.
Hai quindici minuti.

504
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,439
I can totally do it. Come on.

505
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,440
You know we said we had no rolling pin?

506
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,599
There you go. I can toss it.

507
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,799
30 centimetres. Yes, baby.

508
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,800
I can't remember. I don't think
they... I haven't time for this.

509
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,999
Oh, look at it. That's the worst
thing ever.

510
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,919
Let's fan ourselves.

511
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,399
Absently horrendous.

512
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,639
Nobody can know how hot it is.

513
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,479
Of course we've now got ovens on.

514
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,119
Yes, I was six foot tall this
morning and now look at me!

515
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,959
That looks good. It's all right,
isn't it?

516
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,159
I think I'm in the wrong business.
Why, do you think you should be
making a pizza?

517
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,160
I should be making pizzas.
And it's in.

518
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,639
Not far off, you know.

519
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,640
Yeah, it's good.

520
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,839
I don't know if this is going to
work. Definitely time to

521
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,759
come out, I'm not going to overcook
this baby.

522
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,839
It would be nice if it was a bit
more rounded.

523
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,840
I've just taken some of the basil
off cos it doesn't really look
very nice when it's been cooked.

524
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,840
Bakers, that's the end of your
technical challenge.

525
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,039
Bring your pizzas up and stick them
behind your photo.

526
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,239
Be proud.

527
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,879
Can I put mine in the bin?

528
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Absolute disaster.

529
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,920
NOEL: Paul and Prue want to see
a classic home-made margherita with

530
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,400
a crispy base topped with passata,
mozzarella and fresh basil.

531
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,799
We'll start with this one over here.

532
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,800
Cooked on the bottom and nice and
soft in the middle.

533
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,880
I like the end of the slice just to
tip over a bit.

534
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,479
Very good.

535
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,159
It's got a beautiful flavour. And
the dough is well flavoured.

536
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,879
The bread is well flavoured.
It's a nice pizza. OK, very good.

537
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,199
I think that pizza, it is actually a
little thick.

538
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,200
This is more like an English pizza,
rather than an Italian pizza.

539
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,159
A little bit of tang.

540
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,119
Nice tomato coming through at the
end, not bad at all.

541
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,039
So, this one, a bit of a disaster.

542
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,040
I think mainly because the baker put
the topping on the pizza before

543
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,479
putting it on to the peel.

544
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,480
It's very thick because it's
concertinaed up.

545
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,199
Raw dough is not particularly nice
to eat.

546
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,200
This one, I think the mozzarella has
been cut up too finely.

547
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,319
When you chop of little bits of
mozzarella,

548
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,839
you sort of lose it in the passata.

549
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,559
The whole thing is, white, green,
red, the Italian flag.

550
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,239
Let's have a look.

551
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,240
It's too thick, it's under seasoned,
it's just not very exciting to eat.

552
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,760
Right, this one, it's not absolutely
perfectly round but it looks really

553
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,959
good. I like the basil on there as
well, nice green basil.

554
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,960
I love the fact that the edges are
charred a bit.

555
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,199
The flavours are there. The tomato
is good. And it's lovely and thin.

556
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,719
OK, moving onto another one which
looks like it's got stuck on the
peel again.

557
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,279
It's massively under baked.

558
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,639
That is definitely undercooked.

559
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,640
But overall, you could eat most of them.

560
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,240
SANDI: Paul and Prue must now rank
the pizzas from worst to best.

561
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,799
In sixth place is this one.

562
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,119
Whose is this?

563
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,799
Right, you got it stuck an the peel,
I take it? I did. Hence, sixth.

564
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,799
Fifth place is this one.

565
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,479
Yan, it is undercooked
and a bit misshapen.

566
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,199
Stacey came in fourth and Sophie, third.

567
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,200
It's very tricky between
first and second.

568
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,679
In second spot is this one.
Whose is this?

569
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,879
Well done, Liam.

570
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,759
The flavour was very good, the
tomato was good.

571
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,199
I think you made a nice pizza.

572
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,279
So that leaves this one.

573
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,359
Steven, it's a beautiful pizza.

574
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,919
It's very thin, right amount of
scant topping.

575
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,920
The flavour is lovely. Well done.

576
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,160
I love making pizza. I just went off
my own intuition and it worked.

577
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,079
I think I'm in the wrong business.

578
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,199
I should make pizzas. No, I'm
joking!

579
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,199
No, it was really good, really good.

580
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,839
They spotted straightaway that I'd
had issues transferring it

581
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,839
from the palette thing
to the pizza stone

582
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,359
and then it just all went wrong from
there, really.

583
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,879
That plan of trying to nail the
technical to keep myself safe

584
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:08,000
didn't go to plan!

585
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,439
It's the bakers' last chance to make

586
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,119
a winning impression on Paul and Prue.

587
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,039
The show stopper.

588
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,679
One more attempt to keep their place
in the tent.

589
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,239
For the technical challenge, it
seemed quite simple.

590
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,439
Pizza - it's a classic Italian dish,
but it's actually quite tricky.

591
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,159
Steven, he smashed it. He had the
best pizza.

592
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,239
I think he's coming back because
he's had a couple

593
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,999
of weeks of really struggling.

594
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,879
The thing that pleased me so much is
that Liam's pizza was good.

595
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,079
It was vying with Steven for the top
spot.

596
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,759
He's got stronger and stronger as
the competition has carried on,

597
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,599
and Sophie, actually, she got
the cannoli spot on.

598
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,399
Who, for you, is in trouble this week?

599
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,919
I think Kate. She was last the
technical.

600
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,919
Yan didn't do very well either and
her cannoli wasn't great.

601
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,839
Actually Yan is in real trouble.

602
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,359
Stacey's hovered in the middle for
quite some time now.

603
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,279
Stacey's problem is that she panics.

604
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,479
She's like the John McEnroe of baking!

605
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,439
She is. You might get a saucepan in
the face, or you might get a hug.

606
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,759
Today's going to be even hotter.

607
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,319
As temperatures rise, they fluster
more, and when you fluster more,

608
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,320
you make mistakes.

609
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,359
Buongiorno, bakers.

610
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,279
Welcome to your second day here in
sunny Italy.

611
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,679
So for your show stopper Italiano,

612
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,439
the judges would like you to make
shell-shaped filled pastries of

613
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,599
campana sfogliatella.

614
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,679
I'm sure you know, sfogliatella
means thin leaf, so once baked,

615
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,680
your delicate multi-layered pastries
should resemble crunchy rustling

616
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,360
leaves. The judges would like you to
make a batch of 24 perfectly flaky

617
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,839
pastries, but the filling is up to you.

618
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,839
You have 4.5 hours.

619
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,759
On your marks... Get
set...

620
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,760
BOTH: Infornare!

621
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,079
50 grams of sugar. I know this
recipe off by heart.

622
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,159
I need to do really well today

623
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,999
otherwise I'm in danger of going home.

624
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,079
Quarterfinal. It's like my absolute
goal.

625
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,239
Sfogliatella - it was developed

626
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,839
about 200 years ago in Italy by a nun.

627
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,799
It's layered, a bit like a filo pastry.

628
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,039
It's akin to a lobster tail.

629
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,119
When you bite into it, it cracks in
your mouth.

630
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,479
Inside has to be the most luscious
filling.

631
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,239
We've asked the bakers to make 12 of
them in one flavour,

632
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,679
12 of them in another favour.

633
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,599
The biggest mistake they could do

634
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,759
with this is not building those
layers correctly.

635
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,359
If they don't, they'll all just fall
to pieces in their hands.

636
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,199
It is so, so delicate.

637
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,639
Even I struggled when I was in Italy
making it myself.

638
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,279
I think this challenge is pure murder.

639
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,280
It's the most complex pastry
challenge ever set on Bake Off.

640
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,919
This is leave it to the professionals...

641
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,759
Or six insane bakers in a hot tent.

642
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,199
Knacker me out. Right, our Sicilian
lemons.

643
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,559
Boiled them for an hour.

644
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,079
The lemons are for Steven's
Sicilian-style marmalade.

645
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,080
The other half will be filled with
chocolate, orange and ginger.

646
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,079
I love the idea of the flavours.

647
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,080
This challenge, what did you think
is the trickiest bit of it?

648
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,160
It's getting that flair of leaves
and I was researching this.

649
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,319
Italian chefs that were making this
were saying, A - don't bother,

650
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,439
or B - it's three days.

651
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,239
4.5 hours is all you've got.

652
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,559
And you have to bother. It is
doable.

653
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,239
It is. It's just very complicated
and it can be extremely...

654
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,240
Don't smile, you picked it!

655
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,999
I've got my dough resting in the
freezer.

656
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,119
So I'm just preparing my filling.

657
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,879
Semolina with some ricotta.

658
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,759
It's basically the thickener for the

659
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,519
sfogliatella. Everybody's doing this
bit.

660
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,519
While the semolina's hot,

661
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,519
I'm going to fold this chocolate so
it combines into it.

662
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,479
So tell us about your sfogliatella.

663
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,599
It's inspired by my trips to Canada.

664
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,639
During the Women's World Cup,

665
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,199
I went to a bakery every day to get
the most delicious lemon,

666
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,399
blueberry scones.

667
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,599
Yan's filling her other half with

668
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,079
maple, pecan, topped with bacon dust.

669
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,439
Maple, bacon, pecan, that's so Canadian.

670
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,359
How come you go to Canada so often?

671
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,559
Because my wife used to work for a
Canadian bank.

672
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,479
They offered her a job over there.

673
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,719
OK. She took redundancy because
we're Londoners.

674
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,199
Londoners through and through.

675
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,719
I've got a maple pecan sfogliatella.

676
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,959
I know Yan's doing maple pecan as
well, but she's added bacon.

677
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,399
To be fair, I have bacon in
the fridge and I was going to do it,

678
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,439
but I was like, "Nah!"

679
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Liam's other filling is orange, rum
and raisin.

680
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,919
And he's found a unique way to
display them.

681
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,559
I've got fake ice.

682
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,239
It looks like lobster tails, right?

683
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,239
So the whole theme is, like, just
caught them from the sea.

684
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,999
My grandad used to deliver all

685
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,479
different types of seafood to different

686
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,359
restaurants and places across the
country.

687
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,360
I love the personal sort of aspect
of it.

688
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I'm just starting to put it through
the machine.

689
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,560
To make just 24 sfogliatella will
take a lengthy 14 metres of pastry.

690
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,799
Is anyone else enjoying this?

691
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,999
Nope. Taxi!

692
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,599
It's very labour intensive.

693
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,479
So much pastry.

694
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,480
If it tears, you just need to start
again.

695
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,439
It's a bit of a beast at the moment.

696
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,159
This can't be right.

697
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,079
Are you OK?

698
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,519
I'm OK. I'll just put these through
again.

699
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,799
So I'm starting to roll my dough now.

700
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,439
This is kind of the important bit.

701
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,359
This is what forms the leaves.

702
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,559
I'm just spreading some lard over it.

703
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,560
That's where you get the flaky,
crunchy thing that you want.

704
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,039
I'm going to stretch it out.

705
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,679
This is going to be one massive sausage.

706
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,239
Show us how you do it. That's only

707
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,719
that wide and I need to get 24 out
of it anyway.

708
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,239
I'm just stretching it out gently
because if you do it too

709
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,959
much, you make a hole.

710
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,679
Why is it not a technical challenge?

711
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,399
Why is it a show stopper? Time.

712
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,679
It takes hours and hours to produce.

713
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,359
It seems like a massive technical
show stopper.

714
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,879
It is, isn't it?

715
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,959
Really hard. Have you seen one
before?

716
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,759
No, my mum and dad went on honeymoon
to the Amalfi Coast and I'm just

717
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,760
going off purely hearsay, what they
say it is.

718
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,919
Kate is filling half with an Italian

719
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,479
style mix of chocolate and hazelnuts,

720
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,919
and the other with a less
traditional lemon and tahini.

721
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,679
Tahini? Tahini.

722
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,479
That's quite savoury, isn't it?

723
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,399
I took a bit of a risk but I decided
to do it just because I like

724
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,799
experimenting with new flavours.

725
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,639
Sophie, though, is keeping it simple.

726
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,640
Mango and passion fruit is a classic
combination.

727
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,720
Her other filling is cherry, almond
and chocolate.

728
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,759
I don't want anything too wacky with
the filling or the flavours.

729
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,559
I just want to think about the
pastry, getting the pastry right.

730
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,119
It looks like a pair of underpants!

731
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,759
Does it? Maybe yours!

732
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,839
Mine don't look like that, Paul!

733
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,039
So tell us about your sfogliatella?

734
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,799
I'm doing two different things.

735
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,599
Citrus and sultanas.

736
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,639
The second one, praline cream.

737
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,599
I've made the praline already.

738
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,239
It's there.

739
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,240
Stacey's giving her praline creme
pats sfogliatella an extra boost by

740
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,479
lining them with choux pastry.

741
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,679
So you're just putting the choux
paste inside?

742
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,319
Yes, and hopefully the choux paste,

743
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,559
the choux part will puff up and I'll
be able to fill it.

744
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,839
The only problem is, as soon as you
put them in the oven,

745
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,639
they've got a mind of their own.
It's a gamble but I'm doing it.

746
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,359
The ones you practised, nine times
out of ten, they came out fine?

747
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,360
The ones I practised, nine times out
of ten, they didn't.

748
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,119
Two hours in. It's boiling hot.

749
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,919
Yes, we're trying to get an Italian
atmosphere for you.

750
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,839
Oh, right!

751
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,039
The temperature has hit 40 degrees.

752
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,999
Oh, it is boiling!

753
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,919
And rising heat...

754
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,920
It's sticky, which I would prefer
that it wasn't.

755
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,120
...makes rolling wafer thin pastry
easier said than done.

756
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,399
In this heat, the last thing you

757
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,400
want is anything that's going to
melt. Oh, the butter's melting.

758
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,239
It's just ruining my pastry, this heat.

759
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,719
I think it's beyond repair now.

760
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,799
How's it going? It's splitting and
it's hot.

761
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,800
Look at her, she's like a machine
over there.

762
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,039
I could just walk around like that
for you.

763
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,839
When I was at school, I always had,

764
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,279
"Stacey has the potential to do
really well.

765
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,399
"However, she doesn't concentrate."

766
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,159
When I don't concentrate, things go
wrong and unfortunately,

767
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,160
I can use about that much. I just
don't have enough dough.

768
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,680
Bakers, you've got one hour remaining.

769
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,079
Cut it into 24 pieces.

770
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,080
It's the moment of truth.

771
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,839
Time to see if their rolling has
been a success.

772
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,840
I'm just about to start the shaping
of my sfogliatella.

773
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,600
It's supposed to resemble a lobster
tail or wheel of lamination.

774
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,279
Lamination is baker talk for
multiple layers.

775
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,519
Can you see all those layers?

776
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,239
No lamination...

777
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,959
These are no good.

778
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,799
These are going to be ugliatelle!

779
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,719
...may mean going home.

780
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,959
Well, they look like lobster tails.

781
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,719
What? What sort of lobster have you
seen?

782
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,319
I've got a pet lobster and his tail
is exactly like that.

783
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,119
Please don't look at them.

784
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,039
They're fine! There's nothing to see
here!

785
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,040
This is the choux pastry one, which
is so tiny.

786
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,639
I'm sure someone said they wanted
them to be really small,

787
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,759
and very uneven in size.

788
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,760
Yeah, mine aren't even. Don't even
talk about yours!

789
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,119
God, they're looking stunning, Sophie.

790
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,399
Thanks, mate! Just 23 more of them
to do!

791
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,359
I'm going to present 24
sfogliatella, whether it..

792
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,399
It might well kill me.

793
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,479
They never said I had to be alive to
take the judgment.

794
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,079
If you die, I will step in for you.

795
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,159
Thank you, avenge my death.

796
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,119
Anything I can do to help?

797
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,120
To be honest with you, you're the
least of my problems!

798
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,519
This is hot.

799
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,239
I'm sitting on an ice bath just to

800
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,279
stop it literally melting in front
of me.

801
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,280
God, look at this state of them.

802
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,639
They're just absolutely melting.

803
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,279
It's just hell.

804
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,039
They're just melting.

805
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,999
It's just not right.

806
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,279
God, Almighty!

807
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,280
Oh, God, that will just be a
makeshift one.

808
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,680
Oh, he has to come when it's the one
that's flopped.

809
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,399
Look at my other ones in the fridge!

810
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,400
Please?

811
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,199
Such a wind-up merchant.

812
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Oh!

813
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,359
Bakers, you have 30 minutes.

814
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,279
Trenta minuti.

815
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,159
I'm so far behind.

816
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,559
The dough isn't behaving itself.

817
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,479
I'm just going to stick these in the

818
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,719
freezer for a sec because they're
melting.

819
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,319
Not worth the calories.

820
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,239
You don't want to get that from free.

821
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,199
Anyone for a canape?

822
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,399
Can you imagine if you got that in
the shop?

823
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,879
You'd be like, "How much? I'm not
paying for that!"

824
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,880
Let's just get this pain over and
done with, shall we?

825
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,839
I'm going to put these in for 15, 20
minutes.

826
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,079
As the fat cooks, it will just push
the layers apart.

827
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,839
Come on, little babies, laminate.

828
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,239
It's all about when it goes in the
oven and how it looks.

829
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,399
You just don't know.

830
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,079
Time? Not doing great,

831
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,080
because I've got 16 minutes to put
them in the oven for half an hour.

832
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,400
I think the reality of the situation
is mine are pretty terrible.

833
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,999
And they're going in. Oh, no
lamination.

834
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,759
I'm going to get screwed over.

835
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,719
No lamination? No lamination.

836
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,719
Oh, man. I don't think no lamination
is the end of the world.

837
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,720
You know, I'm not laminated and I'm
having a great time!

838
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,280
When I look at it, they freak me out.

839
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,879
You have ten minutes.

840
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,839
Dieci minuti.

841
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,840
Have you got enough time to bake
them? God, no!

842
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,640
On the hottest day of the year, he
puts gloves on!

843
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,640
It's a very stressful gig, this.

844
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,759
That is it.

845
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,559
Crapalatelle!

846
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,119
My choux puffed too much because the
whole thing has gone...

847
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,719
It's very depressing.

848
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,839
Look at the state of them. What do
you want, bigger?

849
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,319
Bigger gaps? Bigger. Everybody wants
bigger, don't they?

850
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,039
Different colour? Just everything
but what they are.

851
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,879
The filling does taste great. I
haven't got it in yet. Let's

852
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,880
just see if I can get it in without
it all spilling out.

853
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,679
Absolutely ludicrous.

854
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,519
It's melting.

855
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,879
Come on.

856
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,880
Come on. At least yours are cooked!

857
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,040
The pastry cream is leaking out
everywhere.

858
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,679
Shooting out of every orifice.

859
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,639
That is weather related. And that's

860
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,879
a bit of a problem for me because
the only reason why I did the

861
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,759
choux pastry in the first place was
to put the lovely creme pat inside,

862
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,119
so it's gone from disaster to
disaster to disaster.

863
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,319
Three, two, one, now.

864
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,320
Bakers, you've got one minute left.

865
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,880
Maybe drop them? I can see her over
there, cool as ice.

866
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,079
If all else fails, put on some icing
sugar!

867
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,199
Five... Four...

868
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,479
Three... Two...

869
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,119
One...

870
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,719
It's very upsetting.

871
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,359
Bakers, that is the end of your show
stopper challenge.

872
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,399
The last Italian challenge.

873
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,359
We can all have a nice espresso martini.

874
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,360
Out you go from this unbelievably
hot tent.

875
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's definitely the heat. It's not
my fault!

876
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,320
It's judgment time for the bakers.

877
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,519
Pfft!

878
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,520
Liam, would you like to bring up
your sfogliatelle?

879
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,599
Liam, I think that presentation is
just fantastic.

880
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,799
Lobster tails on ice.

881
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,559
It's just amazing to look at.

882
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,560
They're inconsistent in size, but I
think you've got great lamination.

883
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,600
I think the layers are fantastic.

884
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,719
Maple and pecan, delicious.

885
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,039
What have you got inside this?

886
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,599
Rum-soaked raisins, orange zest.

887
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,759
The orange comes through in that
one, actually.

888
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,959
Flavour's lovely.

889
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,960
I know that took hours,
and it's a hell of an achievement.

890
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,640
Steven, please bring up
your sfogliatelle.

891
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,959
Proper showstopper.
Lobster tail, excellent lamination.

892
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,959
Style. Come on, substance!

893
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,960
Style box is ticked...

894
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,439
...and substance.

895
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,719
Yes!

896
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,479
The chocolate, that little bit of
heat that comes from the ginger is

897
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,199
delicious. Sicilian lemon tastes
really Italian.

898
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,200
It goes rather flaky in your mouth
because the pastry is so perfect.

899
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,159
What you've done is sfogliatelle
which are authentic.

900
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,599
I think you could sell them
in any pastry shop in Italy.

901
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,600
Well done. Thank you.

902
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,279
Great lamination.

903
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,999
You've got that classic lobster tail
running all the way through.

904
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
The time that you've spent on it,
you can see the intricacy.

905
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,599
So this is the cherry? Yeah.

906
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,600
Mmm. It's got a nice bitterness
to it which I think works inside.

907
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,639
I think that's like crisp leaves,
chewing it,

908
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,879
you get the passion fruit and mango.

909
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,880
It is quite a showstopper.

910
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,200
I must say I'm a bit disappointed,
not only in the way that they look,

911
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,799
the sfogliatelle,

912
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,800
but also because this was supposed
to be showstopper presentation,

913
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,559
and it doesn't look
as if you're proud of them.

914
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,719
Lamination, there's big problems
with that.

915
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,720
These look as though they've been
sat on.

916
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,479
Hazelnut chocolate. Certainly got
the hazelnut.

917
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,119
Tahini and lemon.

918
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,599
Actually it's quite pleasant.

919
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,399
If you close your eyes and eat it
you think, that's great.

920
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,400
But then you open your eyes and see
it and go, "Ah."

921
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,079
You're not getting much lamination.

922
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,879
Oh!

923
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,479
Maple and bacon, it's extremely
Canadian.

924
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,480
The flavour's lovely, but
the consistency is quite doughy.

925
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,680
The creme pat and the blueberry,
these ones are quite raw.

926
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,039
You're obviously disappointed,

927
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,879
and in a way we're a bit
disappointed, too.

928
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,880
Bit of a mess. Total mess.

929
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,240
Stacey, please bring up
your sfogliatelle.

930
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,199
Um...

931
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,759
Sfoglia... Sfogliatini, so
they're for the kids. Oh, I see.

932
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,639
The lamination is very poor
and there's too much icing sugar

933
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,359
on there, which is unusual for you,

934
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,479
normally you smash something like
this and it looks good.

935
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,879
It's the heat, I think.

936
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,079
Citrus and raisin.

937
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,679
I like that filling.

938
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,680
I think it's the right degree
of sweetness.

939
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,999
It's very runny for a creme pat.

940
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,999
You were so ambitious to do a choux
paste middle.

941
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,439
Your nightmare's come true,

942
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,440
the choux bun's burst out and, on
the top there, you have raw dough.

943
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,239
I appreciate the fact
that it's extremely difficult to do,

944
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,319
but everyone was in the same boat,
and we have to judge accordingly.

945
00:52:53,320 --> 00:53:02,000
I agree. This one, I think you've
let yourself down a little bit.

946
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,279
I think it was close to, in old
money, 100 degrees in the tent.

947
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,959
Have either of you ever worked
anywhere that was hotter?

948
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,960
I worked in Hong Kong in July, in
an un-air-conditioned hotel kitchen.

949
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,719
I can better that.
THEY LAUGH

950
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,199
When I was working in the bakery

951
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,039
and the temperature was 50 degrees,

952
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,279
all I had on was shorts.

953
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,359
When I was a fire juggler, I lived
on the edge of the volcano...

954
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,359
THEY LAUGH

955
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,799
...but I got on with it.

956
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,399
So getting to this, Sophie and
Steven both in a very good place,

957
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,839
is that still the case? Yes,
that's certainly the case.

958
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,399
Both Steven and Sophie are very
skilful with their fingers.

959
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,399
Liam's was a little bit tardy

960
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,559
on the overall size differences

961
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,999
but the lamination he
managed to get, very clever.

962
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
So Liam, Sophie and Steven for Star
Baker, and who's in the danger zone?

963
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,159
PRUE: Yan struggled
and she knew that.

964
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,639
I mean, she didn't
achieve any lamination.

965
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,159
They were undercooked.

966
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,599
I mean there was a whole heap
of things wrong with Yan's.

967
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,519
Yan's struggled,
hasn't she, all weekend?

968
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,159
She has. I think Yan's
had a terrible week.

969
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,559
I think Kate's there as well.

970
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,079
It did look hideous.

971
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,279
SANDI: What about Stacey?

972
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,479
Not worth the calories.

973
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,480
My ultimate test.

974
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,919
Fantastically well done to everybody.

975
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,679
I have never seen anybody have to do

976
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,680
such a tremendously difficult
challenge in this astonishing heat!

977
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,439
It was really, really tough.

978
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,440
It is my pleasure to announce
this week's Star Baker.

979
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,039
The Star Baker is the person who
brought the flavours of Italy

980
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,679
absolutely bursting into
our mouths with the cannoli

981
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,680
and whose sfogliatella was
a laminate perfection.

982
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,599
The Star Baker is Steven.

983
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,600
APPLAUSE

984
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,279
Obviously that means
I've got the horrible job

985
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,159
of announcing the baker
who's leaving us.

986
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,160
The person who's leaving
us this week is...

987
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,280
Oh, my God.

988
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,079
...Yan. I'm sorry. It's OK.

989
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,839
We'll always have Basil.

990
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,039
I'm so sorry.

991
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,479
That's OK. Don't be sorry.

992
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,479
I thought it was me. I know you did,
I could see it on your face.

993
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,999
It was close!

994
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,359
You did really well.

995
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,199
Thank you. I'm amazed
how far I've come.

996
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,399
It's been a difficult, tough...

997
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,799
An amazing experience.

998
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,719
It's been...

999
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,519
...the best.

1000
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,959
I'm so sorry.

1001
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,799
I'm not sorry, it's OK.

1002
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,559
I've had a wonderful adventure.
Have you had a good time?

1003
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,839
A totally wonderful adventure.
Thank you so much. Poor Yan.

1004
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,840
I mean, everybody loves Yan and I'm
as sorry as anybody to see her go.

1005
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,439
Come here. I love you.

1006
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,359
Come here. It's OK, don't worry.

1007
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,719
I'm still in shock.

1008
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,799
I'm super excited but
I'm super upset for Yan.

1009
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,839
Absolutely gobsmacked.

1010
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,039
Gobsmacked.

1011
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,559
When they said "Yan" I
nearly fainted off my chair.

1012
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,359
I'm just so shocked, I'm so sorry,
I'm shocked to my core.

1013
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,039
No, no, no, but I'm not. Well done.

1014
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,039
Thank you. Steven's back!

1015
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,359
He had style and substance.

1016
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,079
I'm floating on that cloud again.

1017
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,239
I've gone all this way.

1018
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,679
It's mad, mad.

1019
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,239
Mad, mad, mad, mad.

1020
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,679
So good.

1021
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,719
I feel proud but more shocked, I think!

1022
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,159
I'm a quarterfinalist in
The Great British Bake Off.

1023
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,159
It's brilliant. Next week...

1024
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,239
Who has ever heard of this before?

1025
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,599
...the tent goes back in
time with forgotten bakes.

1026
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,319
Maybe you know what you're doing?

1027
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,999
Come on now! A signature
that's sweet AND savoury...

1028
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,839
Nice clanger. Sounds delicious.

1029
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,479
...a technical tart
full of bygone booze...

1030
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,079
No more rum. Whoo!

1031
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,039
...and in a feat of
Victorian engineering...

1032
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,559
Go big or go home.

1033
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,479
...the most elaborate
sponge Showstopper...

1034
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,679
Cake's in. Macaroons.

1035
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:28,680
...the bakers have ever faced.

1036
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,960
Easy!
