1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GBBO S08E04

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Can you guess what I'm thinking?
Probably not.  I was thinking,

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,720
if we were wasps,
we'd be going crazy right now.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,480
That wouldn't have been my first
guess but I think you're right.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,160
I can almost smell it from here.
Oh, it's heaven.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,320
THEY SNIFF

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,480
BOTH:  Ah.

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,840
It's Caramel Week.

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,880
Getting to caramel...

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,240
Oh, I love a bit of kneading.

11
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,000
..meant getting past bread...

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,080
Put your finger in it.

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,400
..and Paul.

14
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,600
I feel like you're trying
to psyche me out.

15
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,920
Despite Steven's comeback
in the Showstopper...

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,760
Unbelievable.
It's delicious.

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,760
..Julia's stunning toadstool and
snail saw her crowned Star Baker.

18
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,880
No-one's ever done something
like that on Bake Off before.

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,240
And, although Liam
struggled again...

20
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,080
Sometimes I just have
to have self-belief.

21
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,720
I couldn't boil an egg at your age.

22
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,720
..we had to bid Flo
a fond farewell.

23
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,000
I've enjoyed the ride.
I've met some lovely people

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,360
and I'll remember
that for the rest of my life.

25
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,240
Now, for the first time...

26
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,280
How long have I got left?
You can do this.

27
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,480
..it's Caramel Week.

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,840
With a luxurious
layered signature...

29
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,240
I don't think the texture
of anything is right.

30
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,240
..a technical
where the bakers go Dutch...

31
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,600
Waffles, innit?

32
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,200
..and the stickiest showstopper...

33
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,760
..It's all just melting.

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,720
..in the history of
The Great British Bake Off.

35
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,720
It's not as much as an erection
as I wanted it to be.

36
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,400
Caramel Week.

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Kind of excited
because I love caramel.

38
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,680
Not saying I'm good at it,
but I love it.

39
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,680
This is the week I practised most
and, yeah, it hasn't gone that well.

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,160
So, er, yeah, we'll see.

41
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,040
I must have put on a good stone,
and it's all caramel.

42
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,040
The tricky thing about caramel
is pretty much everything!

43
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,720
Our nine remaining bakers
are about to tackle

44
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,120
three increasingly complex
challenges...

45
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,400
SHE EXHALES

46
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,480
..all centred on
the most delicious but fickle

47
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,000
home-baking confection there is.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,160
YAN EXHALES

49
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,000
Morning, bakers,
I hope you're all raring to go.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,360
Now, as you know, I'm part wasp, so,
it's my favourite time of the year.

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,560
It's Caramel Week.

52
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,320
For your Signature Challenge today,

53
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,120
Prue and Paul would love you to make
18 millionaire's shortbreads.

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,000
They have to be identical,
otherwise Prue will kick off.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,680
Yeah, and nobody wants to see that.

56
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,720
You've got two hours
and 15 minutes

57
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,680
to create
your millionaire's shortbread.

58
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,680
On your marks.  Get set.  Bake!

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,760
How am I feeling about caramel?
Oh, my God!

60
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,120
SHE LAUGHS

61
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,000
Caramel will do what it wants to do.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,160
You've just got to go with it
and hope it works out.

63
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,720
You've got to be careful
making it.

64
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,200
I've already lost fingerprints
from burning myself.

65
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,640
What we're looking for
in a millionaire's shortbread

66
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,360
are three distinctive layers.

67
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,360
A beautiful soft shortbread.
A gooey yet firm caramel

68
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,560
and a gorgeous thin
chocolate coating on the top.

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,920
The skill comes in getting
the caramel just right.

70
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,240
It has to be firm but not chewy.

71
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,880
They could put coffee in it
or rum in it or orange in it.

72
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,960
I'm looking for something
a bit special

73
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,920
and I'd like something
I've never had before.

74
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,840
I'm just getting my dough ready.

75
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,240
Most of the bakers have begun by
preparing a traditional shortbread.

76
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,240
So, it's three-two-one. Three parts
flour, two of butter, one of sugar.

77
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,720
But Julia is already tinkering
with this British classic.

78
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,360
I check the nuts are done
by the smell.

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,960
If it smells like nuts,
they're done!

80
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,640
Julia's adding pecans to her
shortbread she'll top with a caramel

81
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,400
inspired by her mother-in-law's
lack of a sweet tooth.

82
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,760
My mum-in-law doesn't normally
like shortbreads but she loves mine,

83
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,200
apparently so.  Impressive.

84
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,080
So, tell us about
the salted caramel?

85
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm adding two teaspoons
of sea salt.  Gosh that's a lot.

86
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,040
You'd better get the caramel right
if you have that much.

87
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,280
That's the thing, you kind
of have to get it more salty

88
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,440
than you normally would
for salted caramel sauce.

89
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,600
Well, you seem to be under control
and very calm, Star Baker.

90
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,880
Star Baker!
She's going for the double.

91
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,840
PRUE: Why not?
Good luck, Julia.  Thank you.

92
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,840
If it goes wrong,
blame your mother-in-law.

93
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,280
James is also attempting
a pecan shortbread.

94
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,800
But his inspiration is
far from the family home.

95
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,880
So, it's maple pecan.

96
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,800
I used to live in Chicago for three
years.  I was going to say, American.

97
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,280
Yeah. So, very American flavours.

98
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,200
They love their tray bakes
and things like this

99
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,800
so I've gone back
to my American roots.

100
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,800
James' pecan shortbread will
be topped with a maple caramel.

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,400
And, in another nostalgic nod
to time spent in the Windy City

102
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,400
with his wife Anne, he's hoping
to add a touch of American glamour.

103
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,080
If I've got time, it will be brushed
with a bit of gold leaf.

104
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,800
Need some bling on your shortbread.
What does it taste of?

105
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Never tried it. Try a bit.

106
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,520
Doesn't taste of anything.

107
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,400
Hilariously got gold
on your teeth, ha!

108
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,200
Actual gold teeth.
Am I like Goldie now?

109
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,640
I might take up rapping.

110
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,760
THEY LAUGH

111
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,440
For Tom, shortbread
couldn't be closer to home.

112
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,720
I probably should have
the upper hand, being Scottish.

113
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,760
I don't know that I will.

114
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,800
But even he's going nuts.

115
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,600
I'd normally just make
a plain shortbread.

116
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,800
But I thought it might be nice
to add a bit more crunch.

117
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,520
Tom's making two giant
almond shortbreads

118
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,560
which he'll top with
stem ginger caramel,

119
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,320
and tempered milk
and white chocolate

120
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,120
before cutting them into portions.

121
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,400
It will be a race
to get them in the oven.

122
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,200
And just get it in
and cooled quick enough

123
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,600
to be able to get the caramel on.

124
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,240
Whilst it may be quicker to get
larger shortbreads in the oven...

125
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,320
Right.

126
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,920
The main thing is getting it all
done so I've got time to chill it.

127
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,720
..they may take longer
to cool, layer and cut.

128
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,680
I was going to cut them
but, with this time pressure,

129
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,120
it's basically easier to pop them
out and slide them off.

130
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,080
I'm not good at cutting,
so, I've just decided

131
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,720
to make my life a little bit easier
and just put them in moulds.

132
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,360
But those making
individual shortbreads...

133
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,160
I've got the same amount
in every single mould.

134
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,160
..face layering with caramel,
then, chocolate, 18 separate times.

135
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,440
I don't know if it's the right
technique but I'm going with it.

136
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,920
It's too late to change now.

137
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,920
And Steven's separate layers
will be bigger than most.

138
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,600
They are literally about that deep.

139
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,480
So, it's pretty much a dessert,
not a snack.

140
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,840
His large layer of macadamia nut
shortbread will be matched

141
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,240
with a deep helping
of orange caramel

142
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,480
and a thick chocolate topping
flavoured with coffee liqueur.

143
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,680
Are you enjoying these?  I really
like them.

144
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,040
They're quite substantial.
It's a handful for me.  And for me.

145
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,560
I think we'll do it with two hands.

146
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,200
Whilst hers may end up
smaller than Steven's...

147
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,280
Let's see the other one.

148
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,600
..Sophie still has size issues.

149
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,760
I kind of thought far too long
about the proportions

150
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,280
than one really should.

151
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,440
So, what I've done for
the shortbread is that,

152
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,920
it's about eight millimetres.
About the same of caramel.

153
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,720
Then, it's got just a couple
of millimetres of ganache,

154
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,280
and then a very thin bit
of tempered chocolate on the top.

155
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,200
Sophie's the only baker
attempting four layers,

156
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,960
all aimed at recreating the flavours
of her favourite chocolate treat.

157
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,440
So, I am doing a Jaffa-Cake-inspired
millionaire's shortbread.

158
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,040
Yes! Jaffa! Very excited.

159
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,440
And what shape are you doing?
They are going to be circles.

160
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,360
I'm actually doing it
quite a laborious way.

161
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,520
I'm cutting out the shortbread

162
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,040
and then putting a little collar
of acetate around it,

163
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,840
and then filling it up.
You're making acetate collars?

164
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,320
It's laborious and you tend to get a
little bit of leakage.

165
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,800
It is a good idea cos you will be
able to see the layers.

166
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,680
You'll know exactly what your
proportions are.  Yes.

167
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,880
Going in.

168
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,280
Whilst everyone's shortbread
is in the oven,

169
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,920
Caramel Week can start in earnest.

170
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,160
HE EXHALES

171
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,160
All caramel begins with sugar
and precisely monitored heat.

172
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,480
I've done caramel a few times, which
is now going to be the curse of me

173
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,360
because, the second you say that,
it's all going to go wrong.

174
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,280
The bakers now face an agonising
wait for the sugar to melt.

175
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,720
I'm really worrying
about burning the caramel.

176
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
That's the most likely thing
to go wrong.

177
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,000
If I go away and do something else
it will just,

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,560
by the time I get back,
it will just have gone.

179
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,840
You're leaving it for as long
as you can to get that amber colour

180
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,840
and it's basically playing
caramel chicken. Sounds delicious!

181
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,480
But avoiding burnt sugar
is just the beginning.

182
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,920
Caramel has a very naughty habit
of crystallising.

183
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,240
So, I'm just wiping some
water around the edge of the pan.

184
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,160
So, I'm brushing down the sugar
that's gone up the side of the pan

185
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,000
because, if it crystallises
and then gets back into the caramel,

186
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,880
the whole caramel then just
starts to crystallise as well.

187
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,080
It's very annoying.

188
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,600
If it crystallises, it's game over.

189
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,360
You've got to throw
the whole thing away.

190
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,600
What I'm doing is putting in
liquid glucose which helps

191
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,600
stabilise the sugar molecules so,
hopefully, it shouldn't crystallise.

192
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,160
Well, I've crystallised this.

193
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,920
I mean, it might well come back but
I haven't got time to muck about,

194
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,280
so I'm just going to redo it.

195
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,760
Stacey's second attempt at caramel
will sit on vanilla shortbread

196
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,000
and be topped with
lime and chilli chocolate.

197
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,960
So, I'm putting this
really nice spiced rum

198
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,640
which I stole from the drinks
cabinet.  Now, don't drink it.

199
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,440
I'm just going to have a little go.

200
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,960
I'm sorry, darling,
I knew he'd drink it.  It's OK.

201
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,000
We're only putting
one tablespoon in.

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,720
That's quite a lot of flavours.

203
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,320
I like the idea of
the rum and the lime together

204
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,560
because those two
are a great mixture.

205
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,000
The whole thing tastes very
different with rum in it.  Wow!

206
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,880
But actually it works with the rum
I think, but we'll see what you say.

207
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,360
It's like pirate's tears.

208
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,560
Liam's also planning
to flavour his caramel.

209
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,960
Looks all right.  But with
something a little less grown-up.

210
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,400
I love the combination
of salt-sweet.

211
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,520
I've been developing it
for quite a while now.

212
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,840
Put it this way, every time
my friend comes to my house,

213
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,280
there's always
a jar of caramel in my fridge.

214
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,560
So, he's been to my house a lot.

215
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,160
Liam's friend Jamie has repeatedly
approved his peanut butter caramel

216
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,880
which he'll sandwich between vanilla
shortbread and dark chocolate.

217
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,200
So, what I've done,
I've made my own peanut butter

218
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,760
and then,
once I've made the caramel,

219
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,200
I'll add a couple of tablespoons
of peanut butter into that.

220
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,840
How does that react
with the caramel?

221
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,320
To be fair, it kind of helps me,

222
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,120
in the sense of getting
the caramel to set.

223
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,600
Like, salted caramel
is pretty sweet as it is.

224
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,520
Like, the salty peanut butter
sort of balances it out.

225
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,880
Got a good feeling about this.

226
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,880
You know what you're good at is
very strong flavours.  Thank you.

227
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,840
Bakers! You have one hour left.
Crack on.

228
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,600
Everything's back on track.

229
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,720
Touch wood,
this is looking quite good.

230
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,760
I've got some cream and some maple
syrup and some butter to get into it

231
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,000
and then it'll thicken up.

232
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
It gets so hot, it's like lava.
Quite lethal.

233
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Once butter and cream
are added to molten sugar...

234
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,720
..caramel gets
even harder to perfect.

235
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,520
Add the cream in, and then,
I'm going to leave it to boil

236
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,920
roughly ten minutes
so it gets thick and nice.

237
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,080
The judges will expect a caramel
that holds its shape when cut.

238
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,920
It can't be chewy,
you shouldn't be, like, argh!

239
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,680
But it has to be firm enough
so that it doesn't start oozing out.

240
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,000
Unless the mixture is heated
to a precise temperature,

241
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,960
the resulting caramel will be runny.

242
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,240
I've been bringing it up
to a soft boil stage

243
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,240
which is probably around 115, but
I'm going to go a little bit higher.

244
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,800
But, overheat it,
or cook it for too long...

245
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,000
That needs two minutes more.
Just remember that.

246
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,480
..and the caramel will harden.

247
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,560
HE CHUCKLES

248
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,000
This is stressing me out.

249
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,840
And, whilst precision
is important for some...

250
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,360
Need to get to 118 degrees C.

251
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,920
..Yan has other ideas.

252
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,400
Not using a thermometer
may be my biggest downfall.

253
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,480
We'll see. We'll see.

254
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,800
Without the aid of a thermometer,
Yan plans to make a salted caramel

255
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,520
to join a hazelnut
and crystallised ginger shortbread

256
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,520
with a chocolate orange topping.

257
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,840
All I'm using as a guide is that
I know that the amount of butter

258
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,400
and cream that I've used,
if I drive off the moisture,

259
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,960
once all the moisture, which
is why I keep looking like this,

260
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,960
once it stops steaming, that's all
of the moisture gone and it's ready.

261
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,640
Yep. They're looking good.

262
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,880
Nice.

263
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,080
I'm just putting this
in the freezer.

264
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,800
Whilst their shortbread cools,

265
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,720
if they're happy
with the consistency...

266
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,920
You can see it's really
thickening up.

267
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,720
..they can begin adding
their flavours.

268
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,280
Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom.

269
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,320
And, while some are relying
on the classics...

270
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,400
So much salt.

271
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,440
..Kate's up to her old tricks again.

272
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,920
I have got a little herb tree
at home, a little bay tree.

273
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,600
It's had a bit of a haircut
this week

274
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,160
because I've been practising,
so, it looks a bit bare.

275
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,000
Her salted-and-bay-flavoured caramel
will sit on a walnut shortbread

276
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,520
and it's the result
of yet another delve

277
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,000
into her beloved history books.

278
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,920
I chose bay because of
the Roman meaning behind it.

279
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,640
It's like wealth and status,
so it goes.  Oh, that's interesting.

280
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,080
Kind of like that herbal thing
with sweet desserts as well.

281
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,480
My instinct is that
too much caramel is too sweet,

282
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,720
maybe the bay is the answer?

283
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,280
Maybe. We'll have to wait and see.

284
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,600
I'll just have to be careful.

285
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,040
I'm going to take
this off the heat now.

286
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
Key moment.

287
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,800
I'm going to cool it in here.

288
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,640
I've just put my caramel in,
like, a chilled baking tray

289
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,360
for it to cool down
so it's pipeable.

290
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,560
The caramel took
a lot longer than I'd hoped.

291
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,360
It was just
catching on this hob.

292
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,280
You've got that slight
sheen of sweating.  Oh, yes.

293
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,320
Stress sheen.
It is.  That's what I call it.

294
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,640
The shortbreads seem
to have cooled down nicely.

295
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,640
Right, it's come to
a nice pouring consistency.

296
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,840
You want really good layers.

297
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,840
I'm just piping it, it just allows
me to get an even amount in each.

298
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,120
It won't be, like, bang on,
because I'm not weighing it.

299
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,640
It's not ideal
but it's what I came up with,

300
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,520
so, I've got to stick with it.
It will be fine.

301
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,120
This is it. Three more to do.

302
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,000
I've got some walnuts.
It needed a bit of crunch to it.

303
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So, I'm going to put it in the
freezer now to set. Hopefully set.

304
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,360
If the bakers attempt
to add their chocolate

305
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,000
before the caramel
has cooled and set...

306
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,720
HE EXHALES

307
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,320
..the distinct layers the judges
are looking for will be ruined.

308
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,320
I'm not patient. That's something I
don't have, unfortunately, patience.

309
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,960
Not my thing.

310
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,040
What are you doing?

311
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,040
I am cooling my caramel a little
bit.  Right. In a bowl of ice.

312
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,440
In a bowl of ice. Very, very
rapidly running out of time.

313
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,440
Got to pour the chocolate on.

314
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,760
I'm just putting the chocolate
on top with the coffee liqueur.

315
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,240
It's not going to set.

316
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,000
Just dragging through
and make little hearts.

317
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,240
Slightly overdosed
on the chocolate layer.

318
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,760
So, I need to do it all the same
now, which is really annoying.

319
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,920
I need it to be even.

320
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,840
I just don't think
the caramel's going to be set.

321
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Oh. I just tried to pour my
chocolate into it and...it's split.

322
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,760
Bit of a panic.

323
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,320
HE INHALES DEEPLY

324
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,040
We are really low on time
at the moment.

325
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,760
I've got to get these
in the freezer.

326
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,440
If they come out and they sink,

327
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,840
there's not a great deal
we can do.

328
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,480
We're on the clock here.

329
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,640
How long do we have left?

330
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,360
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

331
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,800
Ten minutes to bling up
your millionaire's shortbreads.

332
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,840
Ah! Very, very quickly
running out of time.

333
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,000
Let's trial them.

334
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,160
I'll take them out
and put them back in the fridge.

335
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,320
Not sure what's going to happen.
I'll just give them the full tray.

336
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,960
Let's have a look.

337
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,960
If these come out in one chunk...

338
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,120
There we go.

339
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,680
Just worried they might not pop out.

340
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,120
All right.

341
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,720
The caramel's holding.

342
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,160
I wanted to make sure
they set,

343
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,560
otherwise they'll start oozing
out of the sides.

344
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,560
It's very, very hot in here,
and caramel doesn't like the heat.

345
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,040
How are you doing this? Like Banksy?
Like a sort of stencil?

346
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,600
That's what I want. It's Prue.
Wow.

347
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,080
Maybe you are Banksy.
Because no-one knows who Banksy is.

348
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,080
I'm not Banksy.  Only a true Banksy
would say he wasn't Banksy.

349
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,160
They're still hot.

350
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,760
Now, I'm just serving them a slab.

351
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,760
I'm just going to shove the rest
on the platter just as they are.

352
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,800
Bakers, that is it! Your time is up.

353
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,760
SHE GASPS

354
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,760
12, 14, 16, 18.

355
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,200
Well, I've only got
two to give them.

356
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,000
Two giant sheets of shortbread
as opposed to 18!

357
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,960
It's judgment time for the Signature
millionaire shortbreads.

358
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,080
Hello, Kate.  Hiya.

359
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,240
I do like this pattern on the top,
it's quite delicate,

360
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
but it makes it look quite pretty
as well.

361
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's just that they've run over
the edge a bit.

362
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,120
I think the biscuit's beautiful
and soft, but it holds its shape.

363
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,200
I think you've got
the texture spot-on, actually.

364
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,360
I do like the flavours.

365
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,600
You get a slight aromatic flavour
from the caramel.

366
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,200
That aromatic thing
is actually the bay.  Yeah.

367
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,200
I really like it.

368
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,880
There's a huge difference between
the shortbread in these two.

369
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,880
It's quite doughy.  Mm.

370
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,760
The flavours are sort of there.
The textures aren't, though.  Yeah.

371
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,160
I think your issue is the base -

372
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,240
it hasn't got the texture
of a shortbread.  Yeah.

373
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,240
Maybe it's got too much pecan.
It's a little unpleasant.

374
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,760
I do like the design on top. I mean,
you've got some lips there.  Yeah.

375
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,360
I'd like to see that nice and flat.

376
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,360
The caramel's bulging out on all
of them, which makes them equal.

377
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,360
PRUE CHUCKLES

378
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,840
I love the shortbread. Very nutty.

379
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,840
Gives it a nice edge, a nice little
bit of crunch to the softness.

380
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,840
The caramel is a little too salty.
OK.

381
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,840
I like the picture of Prue
on the top.

382
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,840
I like the flavours. It's more
toffee-like than caramel.

383
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,920
I don't think that the texture
of anything is right.

384
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,520
The nutty biscuit was quite coarse,

385
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,880
and the chocolate's thick.

386
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,880
That's disappointing.

387
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,560
Obviously they're not identical.

388
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,840
You've had a bit of an issue
with time as well.

389
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,480
But I can see it was going
to be really interesting.

390
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,120
The disc on top of the ganache

391
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,080
on top of the caramel
on top of the biscuit.

392
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,640
It's a four-layer job.

393
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,640
Yes, which probably
didn't help matters.

394
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,960
Mmm. It's very orangey.

395
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,360
The base, it's a bit dry.

396
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,240
However, the taste,
the soft, silky caramel,

397
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,040
with the orange as well,
together, works.

398
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,320
It is delicious.
It is very, very good.

399
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,960
They look hideous...
THEY LAUGH

400
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,960
but they taste amazing.

401
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,520
They're supposed to be identical
and they look pretty identical.

402
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,760
You can see the layers. My issue is
the thickness of that biscuit.  Yeah.

403
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,000
It's the overall size of it.

404
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,680
Oh, it drops through
very well, though.  Mmm.

405
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,720
Look at that.

406
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,600
Mm.  For the first time,
I don't like the flavours.  OK.

407
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,760
And I don't like the texture
of that caramel.

408
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,280
It's far too bitter.

409
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,040
I know, but I'll tell you
what, Steven,

410
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,400
I mean, for me, I love that caramel.

411
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,000
I love the bitterness of it.

412
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,440
I don't like really, really sweet
things, and the slight bitterness,

413
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,800
the orangeyness, the macadamia,

414
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,800
everything mitigates the caramel.

415
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,880
They are so pretty,
and they are identical.

416
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,880
They are very neat and very sharp
from the side as well.

417
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,200
The flavours are pretty strong.

418
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,240
The rum comes through
very strongly, the chilli.

419
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,960
It's a grown-up taste, but I don't
really like the rum flavour.

420
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,400
The biggest issue I have is
the depth of that chocolate.

421
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,400
It's too thick.

422
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,200
It looks to me as if you had
a little time problem.

423
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,640
I decided to leave them in the tins

424
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,840
cos I didn't want to have,
sort of, 18 splodgy messes.

425
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,840
Oh, a lovely, cracky top.

426
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,320
The flavour is great.

427
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,120
The caramel is not the right
texture, because it's too soft,

428
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,120
and you didn't finish it.

429
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,160
What's all this?  So, do you know
Tetris?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.

430
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
So I don't know why,
but I really wanted to

431
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,680
make a Tetris-themed
shortbread...look.

432
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,200
I love the chocolate on top, because
it's nice and neat and flat.

433
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,440
The simplicity of it works.

434
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,080
You've got a few issues with
the caramel pouring out the side.

435
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,080
The proportion's two-to-one.
I like that.  Sick.

436
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,640
Can you really eat
that much caramel?  Yeah!

437
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,640
LAUGHTER

438
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,080
The peanut butter in there, that's
very clever. It's set beautifully.

439
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,480
It's crunchy enough,
but again, soft enough.

440
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,360
You've got that nice balance
between the two.

441
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,800
But I love...

442
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,280
..that flavour.

443
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,480
Oh, yes!
APPLAUSE

444
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,280
That is crazy!

445
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,880
Oh, my God!
Good job.  Thank you.

446
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,560
Well done.  Thanks.  Well done.

447
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,120
That's mad!

448
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,280
Oh, my days, Paul Hollywood
shook my hand

449
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,440
cos I baked something really good.

450
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,920
I was like...

451
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,000
Crazy, crazy.

452
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,680
It was all right, wasn't it?

453
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,640
SHE GIGGLES

454
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,640
I added quite a lot of complexity
to that one, and stupidly,

455
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,400
obviously I should have just, you
know, kept it really, really simple.

456
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,960
I'm still irritated at myself,

457
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,160
cos I know I can finish it
and I know I can do it well.

458
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Do you know what, the scariest thing
in there was disappointing them.

459
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,880
Because...

460
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,680
..it's the best feeling in the world
when they like it.

461
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,680
So...

462
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,680
Caramel Week isn't about to get
any easier.

463
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,560
Right, bakers, time for
your Technical Challenge,

464
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,960
which has been set for you today
by Prue.

465
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,120
Prue, what caramel trickery
have you conjured up?

466
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,640
We're asking for a Dutch treat.

467
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,920
A Dutch treat.
Yeah, I had one of those once.

468
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,880
I can only remember the first bit
of the weekend!

469
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,560
LAUGHTER

470
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,840
Off you go. Hold hands. Skip away.

471
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,960
So cute.

472
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,600
Right, for your Technical Challenge,
Prue would like you to make

473
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,200
12 stroopwafels.

474
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,360
&quot;Stroop&quot; is the Dutch for &quot;syrup&quot;.

475
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,960
And &quot;wafel&quot;...

476
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,280
..means &quot;waffle&quot;.  Yeah.

477
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,640
LAUGHTER

478
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,800
You've got an hour and 45.

479
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,800
On your marks.  Get set.
BOTH: Bake!

480
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,600
A stroopwafel.

481
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,760
Never heard of them before
in my life.

482
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,960
Uh... Well, I know they're Dutch.
That's about it.

483
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,680
Well, they're very flat, sort of
caramel waffles, aren't they?

484
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,560
Well, I'll give it a crack.
If it doesn't work out then, yeah,

485
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,360
I didn't really know
what it was supposed to be like!

486
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,920
Prue, why have you chosen
a stroopwafel?

487
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,920
Because, with any luck, none of
our bakers will have made one.

488
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,200
Oh, you're cruel!

489
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,640
And they have yeast in them,
which is unusual in a waffle,

490
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,400
but because they're so thin,
if they don't have any yeast

491
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,960
it's just too brittle.
If they overcook the waffle,

492
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,240
they'll also be so brittle,
they'll break anyway.

493
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,920
They've got to get it exactly right,

494
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,960
and that is the colour
they're looking for.

495
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,760
The caramel inside should be
very, very thin.

496
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,400
When you break it like that,
that caramel should stretch a bit.

497
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,240
Ah, that's perfect.
Mmm. They're great, aren't they?

498
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,160
The trick is, you have to go
low and slow

499
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,960
so that you don't get grainy sugar.

500
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,920
There are plenty of things
that can go wrong,

501
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,760
and they've only got one
to practise on.  Wow.

502
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,080
Brilliant.  I'm beginning to feel
a bit mean now!

503
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,160
No, don't.

504
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,120
I've just read the recipe
about 12 times.

505
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,680
So I'm making a dough by rubbing
the flour and butter together,

506
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,200
which I've done.

507
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,440
Some yeast, cinnamon and sugar.

508
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,320
Get it in there, give it a mix,
and then add the wet.

509
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,760
I'm going in with my hands, now.
Going in. I have washed them.

510
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,880
These waffles I've made before
would be like pancakes,

511
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,080
and now we have a dough.

512
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,840
I've never used a yeasted product
that I haven't kneaded,

513
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,240
so I'm just going to give it
a little knead.

514
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,880
Two more for luck.

515
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,840
I'm now resting for 30 minutes,

516
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,080
and then I'm going to start
the caramel.

517
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,400
&quot;Make the caramel by melting
the sugar and the butter.&quot;

518
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,600
A bit sparse!

519
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,880
Sometimes you can stir it,
sometimes you can't.

520
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,600
I'll probably give it a stir anyway.

521
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,440
It's hard to tell if it's up
to the right temperature,

522
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,800
as we don't know
what the right temperature is.

523
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,680
&quot;Cook to the right
correct consistency.&quot;

524
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,520
I mean...what the hell
does that mean?

525
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,360
For stroopwafel caramel,

526
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,560
if the sugar isn't melted slowly
over a low heat

527
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,680
before the rest of
the ingredients are added,

528
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,120
it will become grainy and won't
have its unique stretch.

529
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,480
Not loving it.
JAMES SIGHS

530
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,800
I can't figure out
whether it's smooth or not.

531
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,720
I just feel like
it's a little bit grainy.

532
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,520
Maybe they won't notice...the
judges?  They will notice.

533
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,040
When caramel was invented,
do you know what it was used for?

534
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,880
An adhesive.  Leg waxing.

535
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,680
Ooh!  Yes!  Oooh!

536
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,320
Well, they still call it
sugar waxing.  Yeah, absolutely.

537
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,840
I like that you know
about leg waxing.

538
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,640
Of course I know about leg waxing.

539
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,040
I know about lots of things.

540
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,560
That's not caramel.

541
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,720
I decided to make a second caramel.

542
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,720
I'm just going to see what happens
if I do one more.

543
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,680
How's your second one looking?  It's
still a little bit grainy, but...

544
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,560
WHISPERS:  I don't know, I don't know.

545
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,760
My round two is
the same as round one.

546
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,440
This is absolutely rank.

547
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,400
I'm not happy with the caramel
at all.

548
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,960
It's horrible. I mean,
I would not want to eat this.

549
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,960
I honestly have not a clue
how to make that right.

550
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,440
SHE SIGHS

551
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,880
Bakers, you have one hour left.

552
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,720
Right. On with the dough.

553
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,280
We've got to split the dough
into 13 balls.

554
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,680
&quot;Make the test one by placing the
ball of dough in the waffle maker.

555
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,480
&quot;Press down and bake.&quot;

556
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,320
Prue's recipe allows
for just one practice waffle.

557
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,920
This is really nerve-racking.

558
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,800
The fact that we've only
got enough mixture

559
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,760
for one mistake is not very good.

560
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,600
So how long do I cook these for?

561
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,480
God forbid it should tell you!

562
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,120
Are you supposed to leave it like
that, or is it locked, or what?

563
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,800
I'm doing two minutes,
and then I'll see.

564
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,600
But the thing is, if you cook them
too long, they're going to burn.

565
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,200
Argh! I need to take it off.

566
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Why is that not opening?
It must have a lid.

567
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,440
Here, give me that. Give me that.
There you go.

568
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,600
Goodness sake!

569
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,520
Good at baking -
not very good at the tools!

570
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,480
Cor, they don't cut easily, do they?

571
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,800
Seriously, to be a baker you need
to be really muscly.

572
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,200
How are you meant to cut these?

573
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,640
I'll have to use a sharp knife.

574
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,120
Ow!  Ow!

575
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,000
I don't get how it's meant to
split in two.

576
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,160
The trouble is you haven't
got that many to test with.

577
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,760
No. What a nightmare.
Not cooked.

578
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,200
I wonder if I'm overbaking it.
Yeah, a bit overdone.

579
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,400
They're kind of bendy. Waffles are
not meant to be, like, crisp.

580
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,400
I'm just toasting them both sides,
so they're nice and crispy.

581
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,920
Mmm!

582
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,560
The stroopwafel is
a Dutch national treasure,

583
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,800
the biscuit equivalent
of Rutger Hauer.

584
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,520
But it had humble origins,

585
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,440
before racing to success
with the film Blade Runner.

586
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,480
Oh, no, wait, that was Rutger Hauer.

587
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,480
Here's a film about stroopwafels.

588
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,520
The Dutch city of Gouda is
known for its namesake cheese,

589
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,520
but is equally celebrated for its
distinctly patterned stroopwafel.

590
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,760
The earliest reference to
the stroopwafel was in 1784,

591
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,760
when it was branded &quot;armenkoeken&quot;,
meaning &quot;poor person's biscuit&quot;,

592
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,120
made up of stale bakery leftovers
stuck together with caramel.

593
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,360
But it's since evolved
into a national delicacy.

594
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,360
Mike van den Berg's family
have been making them since 1864.

595
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,560
Nice. Nice sticky handshake.  Yeah!

596
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,880
Is that from all the stroopwafeling?
Yeah.

597
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,480
This is the machine
for baking the stroopwafels.

598
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,840
We open it...  Wow, that's hot.
Yeah. 200 degrees Celsius.

599
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,520
200?!  Yeah.
OK, so don't lean on that.  No!

600
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,520
So, put it there in the middle,
and then we wait for 35 seconds.

601
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,960
Mike's bakery now uses machines
to mass-produce his stroopwafels,

602
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,920
but I'm learning the old school way.

603
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,960
Shall I cut that?  Yeah.
I'll cut that baby open.

604
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,800
Yikes!

605
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,160
OK... And then we take the caramel.

606
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,640
It's quite gloopy, isn't it?  Yeah.

607
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,160
Mike's caramel is
a closely guarded secret,

608
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,120
but traditionally,
a Dutch stroopwafel caramel

609
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,480
uses molasses or dark treacle

610
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,720
heated with sugar, butter
and cinnamon.

611
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,520
Mmm. They're good when they're warm,
aren't they?  Yeah, yeah.

612
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,360
How many of these do you make a day?

613
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,960
25,000 waffles.  25,000?!
Yeah.  Wow.

614
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,520
Well, if you want, I could stay on.

615
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,520
I reckon I could do
at least...four an hour.  Yeah!

616
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,440
The stroopwafel - the rags to riches
tale of how bakery leftovers

617
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,440
glued together with caramel became
the national cookie of Holland.

618
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,080
The next 12 stroopwafels must be
presented to Prue and Paul.

619
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,600
Ooh, that's better.

620
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,760
It does look better. Beautiful.

621
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,120
A bit brown on the outside.
I think that's all right.

622
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,240
This is like a little Smash alien!

623
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
I love those guys!
They were excellent.

624
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,800
What happened to them? One advert
and they never worked again.

625
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,040
Yeah, one-hit wonders!

626
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,440
One of them went on to do films.

627
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,160
One's just a bin...in South London!
Yeah!

628
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,800
I'll have to start taking them off,
getting the next one on,

629
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,240
then cutting and filling.

630
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,280
Really grainy caramel going on here.

631
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,320
I'd have just put it in the bin
if I was at home,

632
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,920
but I need to serve something.

633
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,120
So, I'm just sort of making sure
I get it right up to the edges.

634
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,280
It's very nice.

635
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,920
I want to try and keep them
quite tight and neat.

636
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,120
Waffles, innit?

637
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,720
I'm making another caramel
because this is just...disgusting.

638
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,600
Grainy, grainy, grainy.

639
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,480
I might have to go
for a third time.

640
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,480
So I've done high heat -
let's try low heat. Uh...

641
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,800
Bakers, you've got 30 minutes left!

642
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,840
Amster-damn, that's gone quick!

643
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,120
How many more have I got?
Two, four, five...

644
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,400
Six, eight, ten.

645
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,920
God, loads more to do.

646
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,720
Multitasking.

647
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,960
I've got to get
a bit of a shifty on now.

648
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,960
I've only got five.
I am always rushing in this tent.

649
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,880
This isn't going
to be all right too.

650
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,120
I still don't know
how to make it right.

651
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,120
You can do this, you can do this,
you can do this.

652
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,680
Do you want to press down on that?
Yeah, I'll press down on that.

653
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,920
Oh, it's hot!

654
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,120
Well, this one's burnt.
That is not good.

655
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,840
That's not very pretty, is it?

656
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,400
Ugh! Come on!

657
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,760
Right, bakers, I know there's still
a lot to do,

658
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,480
but you have...
Five minutes left!

659
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,640
We've got five minutes?!
You can do this, bakers.

660
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,280
Yes!  Come on.

661
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,600
Best out of a bad lot.

662
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,120
Going to the wire.

663
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,640
Honestly, this is just gross.

664
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,640
This is it, my last one. I'm fine.

665
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,680
OK, gorgeous bakers,
I'm afraid your time is up!

666
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,880
SHE SIGHS

667
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,440
The judges are not going
to like any of that.

668
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,720
Troops, we need to see your stroops.

669
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Bring up your stroopwafels and place
them behind the photo of yourself.

670
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,000
Paul and Prue are expecting

671
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,520
12 identical firm
but flexible stroopwafels,

672
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,520
filled with a stretchy caramel, and
they won't know whose is whose.

673
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,400
Let's start with this one.

674
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,720
Thickness-wise, they're about right,
aren't they?

675
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,080
And they're all the same colour.

676
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,480
Shall we crack one?  Yeah.

677
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,960
Right texture.

678
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,760
But the caramel's not right.  The
caramel's not right. Very grainy.

679
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,640
Right, shall we look at this one?
They are all the same.

680
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,640
The texture of the waffle is good.
It's quite firm, but it's flexible.

681
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,040
It tastes rather nice.

682
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,120
Same problem - it's very grainy.

683
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,280
Wow. It's identical to
the first one!

684
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,960
Now these look like
they've been slightly overdone.

685
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,600
They're quite dry. It breaks
very easily, doesn't it?

686
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,120
It doesn't bend at all.  No,
and I think it's very grainy.

687
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,560
Yeah, it is - it's just sugar.

688
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,960
They look beautiful, but this
one's got too much filling in,

689
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,520
and it's all at one side.

690
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,280
Very grainy on the sugar again.

691
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,000
Did none of you get
the caramel right?

692
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,360
Colour? Quite mottled, aren't they?

693
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,280
Much too much filling.
This is, again, too grainy.

694
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm really looking forward
to getting one right.

695
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,600
The waffle's good.
A nice bend to it, that one.

696
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,840
Mmm.  Very grainy on the sugar again.

697
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,040
It's a pity, because the waffle
is perfect.  Mm...

698
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,320
Whoever this is
struggled with the cutting.

699
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,440
These ended up being cut by a knife.

700
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,360
How about the middle?
Same old problem.

701
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,240
This is going to be tricky,
judging this lot!

702
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,680
They're all pretty much even,

703
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,640
there's a couple of little darker
ones there.

704
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,240
Not much of a bend there, is there?

705
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,240
Grainy.
This is the one I pray will work.

706
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,720
It's probably
the worst one we've seen yet!

707
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,520
It's an enormous amount of sugar.

708
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,440
Slightly over-baked,
it breaks very easily.

709
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,880
Yes. A bit of a mess.

710
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,240
So even if somebody wins,

711
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,760
it's not going to be
a complete triumph, is it?  No.  No.

712
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,760
So, who deserves to claim
a bittersweet victory?

713
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
In ninth place...

714
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,840
these stroopwafels.

715
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,840
They're overbaked and, as you know,
your caramel is very grainy.

716
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,320
Eighth spot is this one.

717
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,520
Yan, overbaked,
and the sugar wasn't melted.

718
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,680
In seventh spot is this one.

719
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,680
There's too much caramel inside,
and it's very grainy.

720
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,280
NOEL:  Kate is sixth, Tom, fifth,

721
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,080
and Sophie is fourth.

722
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,960
PRUE:  Number three.

723
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,840
Liam. They look beautiful,
a bit unevenly filled,

724
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,960
and the caramel is grainy.

725
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,560
In second place is this one.

726
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,120
Got a little bit of a bend to it,
which is good, nicely shaped,

727
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,240
colour's fairly even,
but grainy sugar.

728
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,160
Which leaves number one,
which is Stacey.

729
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,240
Stacey, they are
beautifully coloured,

730
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,040
just the right flexible texture,

731
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:40,040
you filled them very neatly, but you
failed on the graininess.

732
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,520
I mean I'm pleased, obviously, that
I'm not the worst of a bad bunch.

733
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,040
I'm the best of a bad bunch.

734
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,680
However, you know, it
would've been nice to get first

735
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,360
after everybody did really well!

736
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,040
Not brilliant for anybody.

737
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,040
If I'm going to be safe, I really,
really need to perform tomorrow.

738
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,680
It's kind of the worst
I've done so far.

739
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,120
I just hope that tomorrow
I'm going to be good.

740
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,640
There's extra pressure on me now.

741
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,080
I'm not giving up.

742
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,720
Never give up.

743
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:11,000
WHISPERS:  Never surrender!

744
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,920
One challenge remains before
Paul and Prue choose their

745
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,920
fourth Star Baker, and the next
person to leave the Bake Off tent.

746
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,520
Caramel week. Total triumph?

747
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,720
I think in the millionaire's
shortbread,

748
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,000
we had a lot of triumphs.

749
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,960
In the Technical Challenge, however,
we had a lot of failures.

750
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,680
I know we're trying to draw a veil
over the Technical,
but Stacey did come first.

751
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,040
She's doing well, I think. I mean, I
loved her millionaire's shortbread.

752
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,640
And the other one I think is doing
really well is Liam.

753
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,480
I always love Liam's flavours.

754
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,160
Kate, it sort of feels to me like
she's one of those steady horses

755
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,200
that sort of comes up on the inside.

756
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,200
If Kate pulled off a great
Showstopper, she could be
Star Baker, couldn't she?

757
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,400
Yes, she could, I mean,
I think she did...

758
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,000
I think she came
sixth in Technical.

759
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,160
I think her Signature was very good.

760
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,160
So, yeah, I think she is
in a good position.

761
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,440
Who are we worrying about?
Tom?  Not his finest week.

762
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,560
His actual millionaire's
shortbread tasted fine.

763
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,800
The problem is it was still
in the whole tray.

764
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,960
James was certainly
in difficulty with his.

765
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,240
I mean, the base was awful.
NOEL:  OK, what about Yan?

766
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,640
Because I loved her little Banksy
stencils of the Queen.

767
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,520
PRUE:  I think she spends a lot
of time over-complicating things.

768
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,120
The flavours were fine, but I just
thought all the textures were

769
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,840
slightly off and she came eighth
in the Technical.

770
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,840
So, again, she's
in a bit of trouble.

771
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,520
Hello, lovely bakers, and welcome to
your Showstopper challenge.

772
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,240
Today, Prue and Paul would love you
to make a caramel cake.

773
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,520
So, it needs to be
a one-tier cake

774
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,320
with three layers
of delicious sponge,

775
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,920
any filling you like, and don't
forget it's a Showstopper.

776
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,960
We want to see some powerful
decoration.

777
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,600
You've got to show us some mad
skills on the caramel front.

778
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,800
And there must be some spun sugar,
cos we are crazy about the spinning.

779
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,440
You've got 3? hours.

780
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,440
On your marks...  Get set...
BOTH:  Bake!

781
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,320
After yesterday, caramel is
obviously a sensitive subject
for everybody.

782
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,720
We've got to bring it home today,
because we are all at risk.

783
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,400
All it takes is one
unset load of caramel

784
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,080
and that's the end of
your time here.

785
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,080
This is their chance to really go
to town and show us what they know

786
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,720
about that beautiful thing
called caramel.

787
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,960
There may be caramel in the icing,
there'll be caramel in the fillings,

788
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,520
and there'll certainly be caramel
in the decoration.

789
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,360
But there's obviously a danger
that it will be too sweet.

790
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,280
You sometimes need another flavour,

791
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,680
so that your palate is distracted
from the pure sugar.

792
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,320
I would concentrate on making a
beautiful cake first and then

793
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,680
go to town with the sugar work.

794
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,760
Make that cake dance.

795
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,000
It is Caramel Week,

796
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,280
so I think the emphasis will be on
the caramel decoration.

797
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,360
Morning, James.  Hi, there.
Hello, James.  Right.

798
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,960
Tell us all about your
caramel cake.

799
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,640
So, the sponge is a caramel flavour,

800
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,960
so it's got dark muscovado sugar
in there.

801
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,600
I've left it a bit gritty, so you
get little spots of it through,

802
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,320
so you get that little toffee taste.

803
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,440
Oh, a bit like the Technical
Challenge, nice one.

804
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,280
James will layer his sugar-flecked
cake with buttercream and praline

805
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,920
before decorating with six different
caramel elements.

806
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,920
I've got sugared hazelnuts,
peanut brittle, sesame brittle,

807
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,360
spun sugar springs, a little basket,
and some honeycomb.

808
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,720
This is a huge amount of sugar work.

809
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,800
I think I can cheat a little bit
with the spun sugar,

810
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,360
in that I can dip my nuts

811
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,840
and then use the leftover
to do the spinning, so...

812
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,280
I don't think you should say
&quot;dip your nuts&quot; on television.

813
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,480
Certainly not in caramel.
But thank you, anyway.

814
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,800
Thank you very much.  Cheers.

815
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,800
Like James, Liam is also going
for a big sugar hit.

816
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,800
I'm just pouring my black treacle
into my sugars and my butter.

817
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Yeah, all the good stuff.

818
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,920
Liam's dark caramel sponge will be
offset with ginger and cinnamon,

819
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,480
and decorated with spun sugar,
praline and a spiced caramel drip.

820
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,040
What's a spiced caramel drip?

821
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,320
So, it's like a really
trendy thing that...

822
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,080
Yeah, it's a trendy thing!

823
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,360
It's literally just a salted
caramel but, like,

824
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,000
you can drip it on the side,
so it looks like a drip effect.

825
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,960
Oh, it runs down.  Yeah.
It's very, like, artsy.

826
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,320
Whilst Liam is using spice,

827
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,320
Kate is using fruit
to enhance her caramel flavours.

828
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,520
I'm doing a toffee apple cake
and I've got dried apples.

829
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,280
I want quite a caramel-y,
apple-y type of flavour

830
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,320
and the dried stuff seems
to give that more, like,

831
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,600
treacly sort of flavour.

832
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,680
Kate's toffee apple cake is
a big hit with her family

833
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,400
on Bonfire Night,
although there's usually a fight

834
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,400
about who gets to eat
the spun sugar fireworks.

835
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,840
The emphasis will be, obviously,
on the decoration,

836
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,120
but it's a baking competition,
so it's got to be about
the cake as well.

837
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,440
Tom is also using fruit
to flavour his sponge.

838
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,480
I'm doing a hummingbird cake,

839
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,640
which is banana and pineapple.

840
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,360
Oh, delicious!  I do actually bake
this quite often,

841
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,880
but I normally do it as cupcakes,
like little muffins?

842
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,320
Tom will decorate his upscaled
sponges with just two

843
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,320
types of caramel - a praline
and a spun sugar nest.

844
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,960
Are you using caramel in anything
else at the moment?

845
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,760
No, I'm not.  Just in those two?
Just those two.

846
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,040
Don't put the fear of God in him
straight away!

847
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,120
Give him a minute.

848
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,000
Thank you very much indeed.
Thank you.  Good luck.  Good luck.

849
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,880
Er, it's really important that I get
this spot-on, actually,

850
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,360
after yesterday. Erm, Paul was
sort of questioning whether or not

851
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,360
I had enough caramel in it,
but I'm hoping the nest is just

852
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,960
going to be, sort of, perfectly
formed and he'll be happy with that.

853
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,360
We'll see.

854
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,400
But in order to have enough time
to perfect

855
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,240
the all-important caramel work

856
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,160
the bakers need to get their
sponges into the oven.

857
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,120
I really need to impress them today,
so when they cut into the cake

858
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,560
visually it's got to be good
and it's got to taste good.

859
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,560
So, I'm going to do a tiger-stripe,
orange and chocolate cake,

860
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,080
so when you cut into it,
it looks like tiger.

861
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,080
Yan's tiger-striped sponges will be
decorated with a caramel rainforest,

862
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,760
featuring praline trees,
a sugar-spun canopy

863
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,480
and a caramel waterfall,

864
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,720
complete with honeycomb rocks,

865
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,640
and a praline forest floor.

866
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,320
I am ambitious, but usually, I mean,

867
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,320
it looks better in my head sometimes
than translated onto a plate,

868
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,840
but if I held back
it wouldn't be a Showstopper.

869
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,840
Right, I'm going to go in
with the cakes.

870
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,960
That should bake in like
half an hour.

871
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,960
Great. Sponge in the oven, done.

872
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,920
That's one job out the way,
but there's still plenty to go.

873
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,680
I'm just trying to get as many jobs
on the go at the same time as I can,

874
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,280
cos I'm going to have to be really
efficient with my time today.

875
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,200
I've got my caramel sauce
going on there,

876
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,040
and then I've got the Italian
meringue for the buttercream.

877
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,040
I did Italian meringue buttercream
for my first signature,

878
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,360
which is the one that got me the
handshake, so I'm doing it again.

879
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,160
NOEL:  Sophie's handshake-winning
buttercream

880
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,280
will sandwich her
hazelnut sponges,

881
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,480
which she'll cover in a chocolate
mirror glaze

882
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,400
and four different types of caramel.

883
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,240
Not trying to be funny, you know
when we did the Signature Challenge

884
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,600
only yesterday
and you ran out of time?

885
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,000
Yeah.  Erm, how you going to do this?

886
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,840
Maybe, if we leave you alone,
do you think? OK.

887
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,840
NOEL:  Stacey has also taken on an
ambitious amount of caramel work.

888
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,560
Basically, I was reading my little
boy The Hungry Caterpillar,

889
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,560
so I had an idea of doing a theme of
the life cycle of a butterfly.

890
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,480
Sitting on a caramel-glazed
chocolate and coffee cake

891
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,400
will be Stacey's ode to
The Hungry Caterpillar -

892
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,480
a 30cm-high centrepiece

893
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,560
constructed from spun
and moulded sugar.

894
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,840
That seems quite intricate
for caramel.

895
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,000
I did a practice on Friday,

896
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,560
and right at the end of the 3?-hour
challenge, bang.

897
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,240
Just as long as it doesn't fall
over, it'll be fine.

898
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,240
Let's check my cake.

899
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,840
OK, I think this is done.

900
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,440
Oven off, thank God for that.

901
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,440
It seemed to rise nicely, so it
should be nice and fluffy.

902
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,080
Got a bit of sinkage in the middle.

903
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,080
Don't know why, maybe a bit too much
baking powder.

904
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,280
Why is it so flat?

905
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,280
They're bad cakes. Really bad cakes.
I'm going to make them again.

906
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,560
I think I'm going to remake them.

907
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,560
Oh, James. James, it's
falling apart.  Me and you both.

908
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,440
Bakers, we are halfway through,

909
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,160
halfway through your
Showstopper Challenge.

910
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,040
I don't want to be the timings guy
again, you know?

911
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,760
Not what I want.  Granulated sugar...
Just getting some caramel on the go,

912
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,080
to just get a start on my
decorations.

913
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:38,080
This is my first caramel, for my
shards and my spun sugar.

914
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,880
Julia's spun-sugar dome will sit
atop her poppy seed sponge,

915
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,360
along with caramelised walnuts
and dramatic decorative shards.

916
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,520
My sugar kind of crystallises,
so annoying.

917
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,360
Thing is, I don't stir it,
don't do anything to it at all,

918
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,320
and it just goes...
SHE BLOWS A RASPBERRY

919
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:03,320
Going back in with number two.

920
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,680
Please be OK. Please be OK.  Going to
crack on with the sugar work there.

921
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,880
It's a race against the clock again.
The focus for me is solely
on caramel.

922
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,440
I've got to get this, get the
caramel absolutely right.

923
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,160
In fact, as I'm doing one thing,
I'm weighing up the ingredients

924
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,400
for the next thing and the next
thing and the next thing.

925
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,000
NOEL:  As usual, Steven's going
all-out for his Showstopper,

926
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,160
creating a caramel crown encasing

927
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,280
a mirror-glazed red velvet cake.

928
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,280
I do love the royal family. They
are... They are my second family.

929
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,680
So, Your Majesty, I present to you,

930
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,680
today, the Crown Jewels in sugar.

931
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,200
Just take the heat out the pan
so it stops cooking.

932
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,720
That's come out a lovely colour.

933
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,360
Oh! Heavy pans.

934
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,000
Worked first time, so I'm dead
chuffed with that.

935
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,120
I'm spilling this round just to get
it relatively thin, then it'll set,

936
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,120
and I'll just lift it off the
paper, and snap it into pieces.

937
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,840
I'm just making my macadamia nut
brittle.  Sesame seed brittle's next.

938
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,640
This is going to be the almond,
praline trees.

939
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,080
This is for the firework going on
top of the cake, the decoration.

940
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,880
I like things to be bright
and colourful.

941
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,120
NOEL:  Oh! What's that, pea soup?

942
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,120
This is going to be...
Washing-up liquid?

943
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,080
This IS part of a tree and it's
burning.  OK.  So, let me just
quickly...

944
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,080
It looks hot, that. I'm going
to get out your way.

945
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,560
You're all right. I just need to
pour it into a jug.  Basically, my

946
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,280
face is all I've got...
There's no jug, there's no jug.

947
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,520
You need a jug.

948
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,960
Jug, anyone?

949
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,440
Is this big enough?  Thanks.

950
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,080
I found that in a bin outside.

951
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,080
Do you know how much I care
at the moment?

952
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:41,080
JAMES:  Back on track.

953
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,040
The cakes are definitely
better than they were,

954
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,040
but they're still not exactly
what I would like.

955
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,160
OK, bakers, we've got half an hour

956
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,160
before we stop the show
to show your Showstopper.

957
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,040
I'm trying to caramelise my nuts,

958
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,040
well, just do whatever I can with
them, really.

959
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,280
Loads of stuff to do. I haven't got
any room for error here.

960
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,840
I'll just do
a few more toffee apples.

961
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,840
Just filling my egg moulds
with the caramel.

962
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,880
The only thing I've got to do left
is spun sugar which is

963
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,680
a necessary requirement.

964
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,160
Spun sugar is a bit of
a patisserie chef kind of thing.

965
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,360
And if there's one thing that spun
sugar does not like,

966
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,880
it's heat and moisture, so we
are all up against it, today.

967
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,000
You've got to be part baker,
part artist, part engineer.

968
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
As you flick the fork back and
forward, it solidifies in mid air,

969
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,920
and just makes a little sugar
string.

970
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,720
It's a weird sensation,
to think this is sugar.

971
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,720
It feels like an old lady's hair
full of hairspray.

972
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,520
No, this is just not
stringing at all.

973
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,520
NOEL:  Bakers, you have 15 minutes
left to spin, spin sugar.

974
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,080
I'm just going to make
a cage using a ladle.

975
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,480
Handy bit of plumbing pipe
that I found in the garage.

976
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,440
I'm hoping the nest is just
perfectly formed,

977
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,000
and that I can prove to the judges
that I'm not bad at caramel.

978
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,560
Very messy job.

979
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,040
Quite a lot of sugar in
your hair.  Yeah.

980
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,440
Is that supposed to be in there?
Well, I'm thinning anyway.

981
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,000
But, that's a quick way to replace
hair that's lost, spun sugar.

982
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,160
You could just have spun sugar
hair, yeah.

983
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,400
Spun sugar ponytail.

984
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,400
We could sell them, Noel and
Steven's sugar spun ponytails,
?3.99.

985
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,080
Right, bakers - ten minutes to go.
I know you can do it!

986
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,080
Come on!  Right, cakes are cool.
I'm going to ice them.

987
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
It's never going to be super, super
polished, because I can't do that.

988
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,240
I think I might be quite
a good plasterer, actually.

989
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,640
I'm just good to go round the edges
and encourage it to drip.

990
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,640
Sometimes, it can just look like a
hot mess, so I don't want that.

991
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,720
YAN:  I'm trying to get as smooth
a finish as I can.

992
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,680
Kind of sexual, isn't it?

993
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,160
Ah! Yeah, it's not supposed to look
like that.

994
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,160
It's supposed to be all
on the sides.

995
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,200
This is my apple
on top of the firework.

996
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,920
Thing is, it's just getting so hot,
it's getting very sticky.

997
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,360
I just want it to stick, I just want
it... I just want to get on.

998
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,720
My fingers are so sticky.

999
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,120
This is going to be fun.

1000
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:33,120
It's stuck, probably because
the caramel is so bad.

1001
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,280
It's not as much of an erection
as I wanted it to be.

1002
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,600
My spun sugar, it just didn't work,
so at least need to do something...

1003
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,600
Do not move!  Bakers!
You have five minutes left. Five.

1004
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,440
This is going to be
the canopy of the tree.

1005
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,680
It's not working.  Right, my gorgeous
bakers, you have one minute.

1006
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,680
Please don't forget that your spun
sugar must be on your cake.

1007
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,760
Everything's going, &quot;bleurgh&quot;.

1008
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,760
Oh, mine's just sticking
and melting.  So is mine.

1009
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,720
Bakers, your time is up.

1010
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:33,000
The spun sugar's just going,
&quot;bleurgh&quot;.

1011
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,480
SANDI: It's time for the
caramel showstoppers

1012
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,760
to face the judgement
of Paul and Prue.

1013
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,760
Sophie, would you like to
bring up your caramel cake?

1014
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,080
Very, very elegant.

1015
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,920
Thank you.  Obviously,

1016
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,920
humidity has attacked the caramel
cos the nest was much bigger.

1017
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,280
But beautiful mirror glaze.

1018
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,200
Oh.

1019
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,760
Hazelnut chocolate.

1020
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,240
What's not to like?  Yeah.

1021
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,120
The light buttercream you've got
in there, as well, is delicious.

1022
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,240
Like silk.

1023
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,320
Delicious.

1024
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,000
I'm very impressed with the eggs.

1025
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,600
They've got salted caramel inside?

1026
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,720
Yes, they have. Yep.

1027
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,640
SHE LAUGHS

1028
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,720
How can you eat that much caramel?

1029
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,040
Paul?  It's a skill.

1030
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,040
That is magnificent.
Thank you.  Thank you.

1031
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,920
It's a little bit...

1032
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,560
..on the simplistic side.

1033
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,720
You have spent so much
time on all the extras,

1034
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,720
and they're not really
part of the cake.

1035
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,080
The flavour's lovely.

1036
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,800
Real caramel taste.

1037
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,240
I like the brittle.
Feel it in your teeth.

1038
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,760
It tastes like you've
overmixed the sponge,

1039
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,760
cos it's a bit rubbery.

1040
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,800
I think it looks really appetising.

1041
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,480
And I love this drip
effect, as well.

1042
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,520
It works, you know?

1043
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,080
Great colour on that cake.

1044
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:13,080
What's so good is the contrast of
the buttercream and the cake.

1045
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,640
Hm.

1046
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,920
Gingery, treacly.

1047
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,960
Lovely.

1048
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,080
The bake is good.
The texture's good.

1049
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:27,080
I think you should be very proud
of yourself with that cake.

1050
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,920
I love the colours, I
love the butterflies.

1051
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,960
It's just wonderful.

1052
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,040
The cake, however...

1053
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,720
The icing on that cake, more
specifically, is too thin.

1054
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,120
It's just run off.

1055
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:46,120
It looks slightly slimy,
rather than luscious.

1056
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,440
Delicious chocolate cake.

1057
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,680
Texture's perfect.

1058
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,000
It's got a delicate flavour in
there, and it's baked well.

1059
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
My big issue is the finish.

1060
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,880
The shards are nicely done.
They're nice and thin,

1061
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,800
and I bet they're cracky.

1062
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,800
But on the walnuts, I think your
caramel was a bit too thick.

1063
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,200
I actually love the taste of the
cake, I think it's beautiful.

1064
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,440
And the poppy seed
really works in it,

1065
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,320
I think you've created
quite an elegant cake.

1066
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,320
You've ticked all the boxes.
Well done.  Thank you so much.

1067
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,240
And I think that is fantastic.

1068
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,000
The spun sugar, the toffee, the
caramel river.

1069
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,240
Genius, yeah.  Very original.

1070
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,040
So, we've got an animal print
in the middle of our cake.

1071
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,040
Wow.  It's very clever.

1072
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,840
The sponge is a little bit tough.

1073
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,680
Love the flavours. It's that blend
between

1074
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,920
the chocolate and the orange,

1075
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,920
works really well.
It is slightly over baked.

1076
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,560
It looks like something out of Game
of Thrones. It is very, very clever.

1077
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,560
The mirror glaze is absolutely
extraordinary. It's so shiny.

1078
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,920
The, um... OK.

1079
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,640
How do you get in there?

1080
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,560
Crunch.

1081
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,560
Oh, look at that.

1082
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,680
The cake is far too stodgy.

1083
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,880
It's too solid.

1084
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,240
Overall, a bit disappointed.

1085
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,560
I think the look's great,

1086
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,560
but inside, that's the issue.

1087
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,280
You've got the spun
sugar as the nest

1088
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,160
and you've got a bit of
nut brittle on the side.

1089
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,680
It's quite basic, isn't it?

1090
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,680
Because this is a caramel cake,
the centrepiece should be caramel.

1091
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,080
Although, they're very
pretty, the flowers,

1092
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,480
I think they've not
done you a service.

1093
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,480
OK.

1094
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,440
Oh, Tom.

1095
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,440
It's gooey. It's under baked.
It's got no crumb.

1096
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,960
How did you manage, with those
beautiful ingredients,

1097
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,680
to create that?

1098
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,080
Did you make it at home?

1099
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,640
Yes. But as muffins.

1100
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,520
So, I think just because they're
smaller, they cook better.

1101
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,480
In hindsight, as a cake, probably
not the right recipe to use.

1102
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,840
The butter icing's nice.

1103
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,440
HE LAUGHS

1104
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,920
That's something.  It's got passion
fruit. And I'm glad to see

1105
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,320
you've left the pips
in, which I love.

1106
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,320
I like the crunch.

1107
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,640
There are so many colours in there,

1108
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,360
and they're really clear and bright.

1109
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,080
I love the toffee apples.
They look great.

1110
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,080
I just can't wait to
try this, actually.

1111
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,480
Wow.  Wow.

1112
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,280
Wonderful apple flavour.

1113
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,680
Really good and light.

1114
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,280
Wow, that's beautiful.

1115
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,200
The apple, I've just had a big
piece of apple with the cake,

1116
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,800
that's delicious.

1117
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,520
And actually, the cream cheese
frosting when you eat it together,

1118
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,920
again, another level.

1119
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,920
But the apple is masterful in there.

1120
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,800
And the cake is sensational.

1121
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,680
Very well done.  Well done.

1122
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:16,000
Very well done.  Thank you
very much.  Thank you.

1123
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,960
What did you think of their mad
caramel skills?

1124
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,360
I was really impressed with the
imagination of what they did.

1125
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,640
Kate did very well.

1126
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,880
Do you know, I think that was the
best-tasting cake.

1127
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,360
I asked her for the recipe cos

1128
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,120
I have got to know how
to make that cake!

1129
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,760
And Liam stayed up there, didn't he?

1130
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,520
He did. Again, beautifully spiced

1131
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,440
and with a hint of ginger that sits
on your tongue at the end.

1132
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,600
It was very, very good.

1133
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,200
When you look at the people that
were in a little bit of trouble,

1134
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,520
I'd say Tom. That, unfortunately,
was not a good cake.

1135
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,800
I felt for him, though...

1136
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,480
Oh, I feel for him, too.  ..cos I
think he knew he had an off day.

1137
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,400
James's cake was dry.

1138
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,600
He went caramel on everything,
but the problem was,

1139
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,160
he didn't put the caramel parts
on the cake.

1140
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,520
It's like you're having a bag
of sweets with your cake.

1141
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,800
Well, we don't envy you having
to decide,

1142
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,800
but what Noel and I
both want to know is

1143
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,520
how sick you're feeling, Paul.

1144
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,600
Oh, dear. The amount of sugar!
LAUGHTER

1145
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,360
I crave a bag of crisps.

1146
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,360
Oh, good. Something healthy to get
yourself back on track.  Yes!

1147
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,560
Well done, bakers,
on your caramel crusade.

1148
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:27,560
Now, this week, I've got the great
job of announcing Star Baker.

1149
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,640
And the Star Baker this week made
some pretty fine shortbread,

1150
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:36,080
but in the Showstopper,
produced a cake so banging

1151
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,680
that the judges wanted the recipe.

1152
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,680
Set off the sugar fireworks,
cos this week's Star Baker is...

1153
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,480
..Kate.

1154
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,480
Are you joking me?

1155
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,600
Well done!  Amazing.  Well done.

1156
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,600
So, that means I get to do the next
bit, which I absolutely hate,

1157
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:04,120
but I'm afraid somebody has
to leave the tent.

1158
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,400
And the person that we are saying
goodbye to today is...

1159
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:18,560
..Tom. I'm so sorry.

1160
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,240
Justified!
HE CHUCKLES

1161
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,720
It was a bad cake.
It was a terrible cake.

1162
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,320
Unlucky, buddy.  No, no, it's fine.

1163
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,880
Disappointed to be leaving,
but I did a really bad cake,

1164
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,560
and everyone else did
excellent cakes,

1165
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,080
and I think it's totally fair.

1166
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,360
I'll miss ya.

1167
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:37,480
Poor Tom, because he really did make
a mess of it.

1168
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,320
That cake was raw.

1169
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,640
It was just an off day for him,
but, unfortunately, in Bake Off,

1170
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,640
one slip and that's it.

1171
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,200
You were a little bit lucky.

1172
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,680
Yes, I know.

1173
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,960
Scraped through again.
I need a beer!

1174
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,880
I'm sad for Liam, cos he thought he
was going to get Star Baker.

1175
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,720
Oh, my days!

1176
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,720
You want to stay up there.  Yes.
Because you really are flying.

1177
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,120
So close.

1178
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,520
Didn't expect that at all.

1179
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:08,080
I'll be walking around all week
with, like, a massive smile.

1180
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,240
That cake was fantastic.  Thank you.
It really, really was.

1181
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,160
Kate's apple cake, today, was,
I think,

1182
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,880
the best cake I have ever eaten
in my life.

1183
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,480
Hey, Mum, you OK?

1184
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,880
Guess what? I got Star Baker
this week!

1185
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,880
CHEERING ON PHONE

1186
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,280
Next time, it's puddings.

1187
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,000
A steam-powered signature...

1188
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,360
Argh!  ..a technical meltdown...

1189
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,960
Oh, they look horrible.
That's absolutely raw, look.

1190
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,640
..and a Showstopper...  Oh, look!
..not to be trifled with.

1191
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,680
Massive disaster.
Dribbling, it's dribbling loads.

1192
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,760
I don't like rubber. Disappointing.
