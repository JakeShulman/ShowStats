GBBO.S08E10.The.Final.srt

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,120
In the beginning...

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,360
Look at that.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,040
I love you, Flo.  I love you too now.

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,280
..there were 12.

6
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,480
Ohhhh!

7
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,400
Oh, pum, pum, pum, pum...

8
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,600
It's all right, I'll just hold it
like this.

9
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,400
Chin up.  I'm going.

10
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,760
No, you're not!

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,120
Now...

12
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,560
Keep calm.
Keep the nerves under control.  Yeah.

13
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,960
..there are three.

14
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,720
Not very happy with the ciabatta.

15
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,200
Oh... No pressure.

16
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,200
HE EXHALES

17
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,280
HE EXHALES AGAIN

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,360
BIRDSONG

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,080
Three remaining bakers.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,880
Breathe in.

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,640
Breathe in for the apron.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,760
Three final challenges.

23
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,240
From the beginning,
Steven seemed unstoppable.

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,480
You wouldn't think that wasn't
bread.

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,360
But his ingenious designs...

26
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,320
That is ridiculous.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,760
..haven't always been matched
with great flavours.

28
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,640
Overall, it's a bit bland.

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,920
But the three-time Star Baker fought
his way to the final.

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,800
I've ticked every box.
Handshakes, Star Bakers.

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,960
There's that huge box
that needs one big tick in it.

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,480
The winner.

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,840
Kate's road to the final has been
rocky.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,240
SHE GASPS

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,200
So nearly worked, didn't it?

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,560
But her creativity...

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,840
I love that octopus.

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,320
..historic inspiration...

39
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,760
I researched into the recipes
onboard the Titanic.

40
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,280
..and her bold flavours...

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,080
The mango with the curry just works.

42
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,560
Very clever.
..ensured a steady rise.

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,160
The cake is sensational.

44
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,640
I do want to win but I'm not going
to be arrogant enough to think

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,640
the other two bakers in there
aren't fantastic.

46
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,080
Through the outset, Sophie has
marched through the challenges with

47
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,800
military precision.
Oh!  That's delicious.

48
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,400
But for the two-time Star Baker,

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,680
there's one enemy
that threatened defeat.

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,760
Bread, bread, bread, bread!

51
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,200
The dough's quite underdone.
I hate bread.

52
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,760
The apples don't
really look that green.

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,760
It's a dark art
that I'm yet to master.

54
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,840
We never thought I'd get this far.
It's just like a big thumbs-up.

55
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,840
Yes, this is what you're meant to
do.

56
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,480
Morning, bakers,

57
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,240
many congratulations on making it
through to the Bake Off final.

58
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,440
Now, for your final
Signature Challenge,

59
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,120
Paul and Prue would like you to bake
a batch of 12 small loaves.

60
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,080
But obviously they're not going to
make it that easy for you.

61
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,200
No, they want you to make
three different types of bread,

62
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,360
so four of your loaves need to be
intricately shaped, so I don't know,

63
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,640
plaited, for example.

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,080
Four need to be flavoured,

65
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,000
and four need to be made with
an alternative grain such as spelt

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
or buckwheat. You've got three hours
to make 12 small loaves.

67
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,040
On your mark...  Get set...

68
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,800
Bake!

69
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,240
Good luck, guys.

70
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,120
This is the final. I woke up
this morning so excited.

71
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,960
Whoever wins, it'll be amazing.

72
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,000
The Signature is something
I particularly love.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,600
Bread. We've asked the bakers to
produce 12 loaves.

74
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,040
Three different types.

75
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,800
Different baking times,
different proving time.

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,680
It would be very easy to get into
a muddle.

77
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,280
It's critical to remain calm,
be absolutely confident

78
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,280
about what you're doing
and create baking magic.

79
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,200
Hello, Sophie.  Hello, Sophie.  Good
morning. How are you?  Finals day.

80
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,680
Yes.  Excited?  Nervous, yup.

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,520
Sophie's attempting
round spelt loaves,

82
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,760
ciabattas flavoured with
wild mushrooms,

83
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,720
and plaited brioche
flavoured with orange.

84
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,280
You've picked two breads
that take a long time to make.

85
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,480
Brioche, technically overnight.
Ciabatta, a long prove.

86
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,120
Yep, because I thought
that was a great idea.

87
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
Not really realising that I'd
stitched myself up a little bit.

88
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,200
Yeah.  You'll be more impressed,
though, if she pulls it off, right?
Exactly.

89
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,800
You will have shown three skills,
never mind all the others,

90
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,480
shaping and flavouring.

91
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,200
It's the final, you've got to go
for it.  Got to go for it.

92
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,600
Kate is playing this final Signature
a little safer.

93
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,560
I'm keeping the doughs quite simple,
and just want a good bake on it.

94
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,480
She'll shape her simple white dough
into flowers,

95
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,360
and she's also making spelt loaves,

96
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,280
and a flavoured loaf
filled with curry,

97
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,720
sweetened with yet another
one of her discoveries.

98
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,600
Jaggery gur?  Bit of jaggery.
Do you want to try some?  Yeah.

99
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,440
It's basically a sugar.

100
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,200
Like a cane sugar type thing?
Yeah.

101
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,840
SHE COUGHS

102
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,720
Wow. My whole body's perked up.

103
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,520
That's fanta...
What a lovely flavour.

104
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,280
I kind of got into jaggery when I
found it in, like, this little shop

105
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,120
back home in Liverpool
on Bold Street.

106
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,680
Do you just go round shops trying
to find things nobody's heard of to
cook with?  Yeah.

107
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,240
Rummaging in the back
of the supermarket shelves.

108
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,640
Ah! Here's a thing!

109
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,920
NOEL: Whilst Kate and Steven's first
doughs are ready for proving...

110
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,560
That's going to go for an hour.

111
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,360
..Sophie's brioche is already
proving time-consuming.

112
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,920
Enriching the dough
and it's a lot of butter.

113
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,560
A lot of butter!

114
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,960
Right, er...
For his second flavoured dough...

115
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,600
Baked garlic.

116
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,120
..Steven isn't holding back.

117
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,800
I'm going to whole-roast
these garlic,

118
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,160
and you'd think three bulbs
in four loaves is a lot,

119
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,160
but it just becomes a really sweet,
mellow flavour and it's really good.

120
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,000
Steven's making flavoured loaves
with garlic, rosemary,

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,560
and fontina cheese.

122
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,480
He's also making spelt and rye
loaves, and his shaped loaves,

123
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,400
filled with chocolate and cinnamon,

124
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,760
have been inspired
by his boyhood hobbies.

125
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,120
The shaped one is going to be a
Winston knot.

126
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,240
A what?  A Winston knot.  What's that?

127
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,480
I think it's a tie knot, isn't it?
It's got three strands to it,
hasn't it?  Yes.

128
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,200
I remember doing knots when I was
in Scouts just because I wanted to

129
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,320
get that badge.
Channelling your childhood.

130
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,160
I did get my badge. And for baking.

131
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,640
Steven began baking long before
he joined the Scouts.

132
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,400
Did you cut your own hair?

133
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,960
I think I might have let
my friend do it.

134
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,200
Steven and I both share
a passion for cooking.

135
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,040
He was always clearing up after me
in the kitchen.

136
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,840
I don't think my mum realises
just how much she influences him

137
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,840
and how much she helps him,
how much of a guide she is to him.

138
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,560
I think my mum would be quite
surprised to...to realise

139
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,520
that a lot of this is
to do with her.

140
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,520
I am immensely proud.
He's my Star Baker.

141
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,200
That is flavoured dough.

142
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,320
The more doughs
the bakers complete...

143
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,160
That's going to go down
for an hour.

144
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,000
..the more complicated this final
Signature Bake becomes.

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,480
You leave it in this
until it's about doubled in size.

146
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,840
Each dough will have
a different proving time,

147
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,080
and it gets harder.

148
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,560
They'll need to budget enough
remaining time for a second prove,

149
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,080
then the baking itself.

150
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,960
The second prove will vary depending
on how well they've done.

151
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,960
And if nine variable timings
wasn't enough to contend with...

152
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,440
I'm to do number three.

153
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,440
..all three finalists are attempting
a dough using spelt flour.

154
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,640
I'm doing this one by hand because
it's very easy to overwork spelt.

155
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,920
You just end up with a chewing gum.

156
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,880
How's that doing?
This is spelt and rye.

157
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,280
It's the same stuff the Roman Army
would've eaten with olive oil.

158
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,840
Obviously I'm going to do
something historic, aren't I?

159
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,640
And I'm obsessed.
My favourite film's Gladiator.

160
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,240
So I've got a running joke
with my dad about that.

161
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,800
There you are, Kate,
by the Pyramids.

162
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,400
Growing up, she was into
many different things.

163
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,840
It started with dance school, drama.

164
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,800
Fishing, doing her martial arts.

165
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,880
Horse riding.

166
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,920
Brownies.

167
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,000
Go-karting.

168
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,800
Then she started baking.

169
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,040
Even practising for the Bake Off
hasn't slowed Kate down.

170
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Katie is doing a Masters degree in
occupational health and safety, as

171
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
well as doing her full-time job, as
well as practising all the recipes.

172
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,040
I remember the phone call to say,
&quot;Dad, I'm going to be on Bake Off.&quot;

173
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,880
And I was really a bit choked.

174
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,040
The next minute she'd actually
got a place in the final.

175
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,560
It's just amazing. It really is.

176
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,280
As well as three doughs with
three different proving times...

177
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,280
I'm just going to go
get another timer.

178
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,920
..Kate's given herself something
else to keep track of.

179
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,000
This is for the inside
of my flavoured breads.

180
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,480
Like a peshwari filling.

181
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,520
So I'm just putting some jaggery in
now, which will just sweeten it up.

182
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,320
And she's not the only one
spending time on a filling.

183
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't know what they'll think of
wild mushroom ciabatta. I like it.

184
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,160
That's all that matters.

185
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,440
Is that your christening?
That is my christening.

186
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,120
She's always been very determined,
yes.

187
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,920
Even as a little girl.

188
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,200
She did like to bake
her own big cakes.

189
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,200
The ballet school. I think she would
have carried on with the ballet,

190
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,440
but she just got too tall.

191
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,480
The army was
the most surprising one.

192
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,240
When she puts her heart into
something, she goes and gets it.

193
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,080
Very proud of Sophie,
I've always been proud of Sophie.

194
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Sophie did not apply for Bake Off,
I applied. I put it in for her.

195
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,840
I'm incredibly proud of Sophie.

196
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,760
To come up with some of the stuff
she's done is quite amazing.

197
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,200
Absolutely incredible.

198
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,000
If I heard Sophie's name being
called out and she's been crowned

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,360
best baker in Britain,
even from an Irish perspective!

200
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,600
You got to the end
and you might win!

201
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,480
Well...  You'd be famous.

202
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,960
Can't go to Tesco's
in my pyjamas any more.

203
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
You just want to get bread
over with, don't you?

204
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Yeah, and do you know what, that's
not really the feeling I should have

205
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,440
on finals, but I know I'm not
great at it, so it's kind of like,

206
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,480
let's just get it over and done
with.  Get that one done.  Yeah.

207
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Bakers, we are halfway through
your final Signature Challenge.

208
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,080
Anyone need anything?
You warm enough?

209
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,760
Current tent temperature.

210
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,280
I've had bad experiences
with this proving drawer.

211
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,920
Best just to stay clear of it.

212
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,320
It's had half an hour.  Now the maths
gets even more complicated.

213
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Yeah, I've got about 15 minutes
until I make the Winston knot.

214
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,040
No, I've got two minutes
until I make the Winston knot

215
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,800
and 15 minutes in which to do them.

216
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,240
The judges will expect loaves that
are uniform in size and shape.

217
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,560
I'm just bread-measuring.

218
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,360
I think we should give them Roman
soldier names cos this is what

219
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,600
the Roman Army used to eat.

220
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,240
Yeah.  So that's Maximus.

221
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,560
Maximus.  Decimus, Aurelius,
and, erm...

222
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,480
Stuart?  Stuart.

223
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,280
But every minute spent weighing
and shaping...

224
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,640
These two get crossed over.

225
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,920
..is a minute they won't have
for a second prove and baking.

226
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,360
Apparently it's like a French sort
of design.

227
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,440
It's a bit different to, like,
the traditional knot shape.

228
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,120
You'd think it would be easy to get
things to look the same but it's

229
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,560
not. I'm glad I went to Scouts.

230
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,440
I'm not sure it did much
for my knot-making skills.

231
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,360
That is now going to prove again.

232
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,440
I'm just going to give them,
like, 20 minutes.

233
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,720
I have to get it in there.

234
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,600
That's cinnamon sugar
and chocolate chips.

235
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,240
Weighing out my ciabatta so it can
go on for its second prove.

236
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,120
This is called a couche, which is

237
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,440
French for &quot;bed&quot;, and it just gives
the dough a little bit of support

238
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,320
while it's rising.
I'm putting it to bed.

239
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,000
Once upon a time
in the Bake Off tent...

240
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,400
there was a girl who was terrible
at making bread.

241
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,440
There's a kind of a knot
used in nautical,

242
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,920
it's called a monkey's fist.

243
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,920
And that looks exactly the same.

244
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,120
You're going to miss me.  Terribly.

245
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,120
There's just 45 minutes remaining
in the final Signature Challenge.

246
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,960
I'd really like to give it
a long time to second prove,

247
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,280
but I'd rather it be baked in the
oven, so I need to get them in.

248
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,640
We're running out of time,
they've got to go in, ready or not.

249
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,040
This is the flavoured dough.

250
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,960
It's only going to get
a little bit of a prove.

251
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,800
Right, I need to get a wriggle
on now.

252
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,400
That was a bit of a balls-up one.

253
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,080
HE TUTS AND SIGHS

254
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,800
I'm starting them off quite high
temperature, they'll get a nice

255
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,600
crust on them,
and then I'll drop it down.

256
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,200
I wanted to give them
another 15 minutes' proving,

257
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
but I would rather they were baked.

258
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,120
Bakers, you only have half an hour
left.

259
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,520
Not the best they've looked,
but also not the worst.

260
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,400
I don't think I'm going to have
enough oven space, so what I'm going

261
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,520
to have to do is move these
all onto one baking sheet.

262
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,560
Right, let's get these babies
in the oven.

263
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,600
These actually have puffed up
quite quickly.

264
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,040
These are my spelt loaves.

265
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,520
I'm scoring them cos as they rise,
if I didn't, they'd burst out

266
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,320
at the weakest point,
which is usually on the bottom.

267
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,320
That's annoyingly misshapen.

268
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,840
It's really not enough space.

269
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,280
That's everything in now,
by the skin of my teeth,

270
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,280
so hopefully they won't be
underbaked.

271
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,680
One has split horribly
in the middle.

272
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,360
Probably in my haste to get them
in the oven.

273
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,840
Ah! No pressure!

274
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,680
I'm concerned there won't be enough
air bubbles in my ciabatta,

275
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,040
but I'm afraid my spelt will be
like bricks.

276
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,400
SHE LAUGHS

277
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,400
I feel I want to do
one of those yoga poses.

278
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,360
Oh, oh, actually...

279
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,400
Oh!

280
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,960
SHE LAUGHS

281
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,120
What's happening in there?
My loaf has split.

282
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,600
That's OK, though, isn't it?

283
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,800
It's not the end of the world,
it's just irritating.

284
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,000
Mmm. Imagine if it was the end of
the world.

285
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,640
Your loaf split
and everything went...  Phoar!

286
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,360
Should have got them in sooner.

287
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,400
I'm going to whip them out
with about one minute to go.

288
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,560
Well, hopefully the taste will carry
me a little bit.

289
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,880
How long have we got left?

290
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,000
Just one minute remaining.

291
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,800
I really don't want to
drop any of these

292
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,800
because that would just be horrific.

293
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,200
This is what happens when you rush.

294
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,600
Ah!

295
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,200
Oh... Ah!

296
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,200
God, they've all split open.

297
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Bakers, your time is up!

298
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,320
Not very happy with the ciabatta.

299
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh, God, everyone's looks beautiful.

300
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,800
It's judgment time in the final
Signature Challenge.

301
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Hello, Sophie.  Hi. How are you
doing?  Hello, Sophie.  Hello.

302
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,680
I think they look very good.

303
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,640
I do like the plait. It's a little
bit under proved but not much.

304
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,320
The naan bread looks interesting.

305
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,120
I wouldn't call that a ciabatta
really.

306
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,440
Well, let's see how it tastes.

307
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,520
I must say that I'm impressed by the
look of them,

308
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,280
especially the spelt ones.

309
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,640
It looks really good.

310
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,840
It sounds good.  It is slightly under
proved.

311
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,360
And, therefore, what follows is it's
slightly under baked.

312
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,000
I tell you what, the flavour is
lovely.

313
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,560
Mm.  Really nice flavour.

314
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,960
Great flavour.  Spelt is not the
tastiest.

315
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,880
That's a good start.  Let's look at
this ciabatta, shall we?

316
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,280
I always cut ciabattas this way
because you get more of an

317
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,720
indication of the overall structure.
A pretty nice structure but not

318
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,600
as open as it could be.

319
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,760
Smells really mushroomy.

320
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,680
They were dried mushrooms, weren't
they?  Uh, some dried, some sauteed.

321
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,880
It works. It brings you two
different textures in.

322
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,640
And they do taste very, very good.

323
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,200
I wouldn't call it a ciabatta
though.

324
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,040
Right, let's have a look at this.

325
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,000
Great structure. Great.

326
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,200
Look at that.  And, you know, the
orange really works.

327
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,680
I didn't think it would.  Excellent
flavour.

328
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,360
Soft crumb. Great texture on the

329
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,640
outside and the plaiting is very
good as well. Thank you very much.

330
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Thank you.

331
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,680
Hmm. They definitely do look a
little different, don't they?

332
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,200
Yes.  That one does not look much
like that one.

333
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,800
They do look pretty terrible.
We're looking for consistency.

334
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,240
They do look awful.  So,

335
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,920
the bread has the garlic running
through it and then there's some

336
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
cheese and rosemary in the centre.
Smells good.

337
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,280
It's actually a little disappointing
because it's quite tough.

338
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,680
Your dough needed more water.

339
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,160
OK.  Dry dough will split wherever it
wants to go and that's what's caused

340
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,480
that and that to be totally
different.

341
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,280
Yeah.  These don't look good either.
It's massively under proved.

342
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,360
Rye bread tends to rip.
Yeah.

343
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,520
Look at that one there.

344
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,040
I agree with it trying to pull away.

345
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,600
It instantly means that you've under
proved it.  Yeah.  But let's have a
taste.

346
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,200
It's probably going to be slightly
doughy inside.

347
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,200
And it tastes like
that. It's gluey in your mouth.

348
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,080
Nice flavour, though.  Beautiful
flavour.

349
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,400
Just right, the rye and the spelt.

350
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,400
The knots.  They are so artisan
and real and beautiful.

351
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,200
It's always tricky when you put
something into the middle.

352
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,600
Does it destroy the crumb?

353
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,520
And I think you've done quite well
on the sweet one there.

354
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,880
That is very good.

355
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,880
It's delicious. I think the
chocolate's really good and you've

356
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,280
got just enough cinnamon. It's not
overpowering.

357
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,120
Under proved, under proved, perfect.

358
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,120
Thank you very much, Steve.  Thank
you.  Thank you.

359
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,760
I must say, I think these are
interesting and they look absolutely

360
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,240
beautiful.  Now, this is the spelt.

361
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Yeah.  It's got a little rip but a
nice neat pattern.

362
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,040
I'm not going to quarrel with the
actual flavour,

363
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,000
except that I think if you'd had a
little salt in there you'd have

364
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
enhanced it.  Uh, I quite like it.

365
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,640
You push it, it springs back,
which is a good sign.

366
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,640
Let's have a look at these. Nice.
That's the sound I like to hear.

367
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,280
Great structure. You can tell, you
see where the knife drags the dough,

368
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,720
doesn't cut through like a cake,

369
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,320
it's pulling so you have this
tension there.

370
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,960
I think the texture's perfect.
Nice and crisp on the outside.

371
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,640
I'm getting a little bit of flavour
in there as well, which is good.

372
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,560
OK.  That's a good one.  All right,
now, let's look at these ones.

373
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,560
It's the filled one, isn't it?  Yeah.

374
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,400
Oh, no.  Are you all right?

375
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,080
What's he thinking?  You can never
tell.

376
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,360
I'll tell you what I think. I think
it's got a lovely texture.

377
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,640
I think it's properly baked.

378
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,360
I like the curry and I like the
flaky edge.

379
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,600
It tastes divine. The structure's
spot on.

380
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,000
I like the filling. Something I
might even look at.

381
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,080
I think overall you've done very
well.

382
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,080
Well done, Kate.  Thanks.

383
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,320
It was much better than I expected.

384
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,800
Woo. Woop-woop.
SHE LAUGHS

385
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,400
Yeah... Ah... I mean...

386
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,960
Mm...

387
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,000
I did it as well as I could have
done in the time.

388
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,480
I thought bread was going to be my

389
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,240
undoing and it's nice to know I'm
not starting from behind.

390
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,880
I am frustrated with myself.

391
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,880
But then I think, &quot;What's the point,
it's not going to change anything?&quot;

392
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,080
Now the finalists face mastering not
one but two levels

393
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,760
of absolute baking precision.

394
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,720
Time for your final Technical
Challenge,

395
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,360
which today has been set for you by
Prue.

396
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Prue, have you been kind to the
finalists? No.

397
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,160
It's all about the bake.

398
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,560
No trouble.  It's all about the bake.

399
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,200
As ever the technical will be judged

400
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,520
blind so I'm going to have to ask
you crazy kids to skedaddle.

401
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,520
Off you go. For your final Technical
Challenge Prue would like you to

402
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,040
make ten ginger biscuits baked to
perfection with a powerful snap.

403
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,160
Prue wants half of them to be oval
and the other half to be square.

404
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,000
But they all need to be intricately
iced.

405
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,760
You have two and a half hours.

406
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,600
On your marks.  Get set.
Bake.

407
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,600
The finalists all have
identical ingredients...

408
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,360
and Prue's pared down recipe.

409
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,120
It seems quite straightforward,
which worries me.

410
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,120
Some lace pattern does look
complicated.

411
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,760
This is the Bake Off final,

412
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,760
and what could be more of a classic
British bake than a ginger biscuit?

413
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,640
They are exquisite.
It's all royal icing.

414
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,480
As we've said it must be exactly
these decorations.

415
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,480
They should be able to look at that
and know that they should first pipe

416
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,800
the outline and then flood it.

417
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,200
Of course, you'll need a thicker
icing for the baubles than you need

418
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,200
for the flooding. Although the icing
is very intricate and difficult to

419
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,680
do we want a really crisp perfect
biscuit.

420
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,360
Beautiful.  So we are looking for a
really nice snap with these

421
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,960
biscuits, aren't we?  It should make
a crack.

422
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,840
I love the fact that you're dunking.
I'm too posh to dunk.

423
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,760
Are you?  You didn't see.  You're
never too posh to dunk.

424
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,680
You're dead right.

425
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,480
It just says make the ginger
biscuits using the creamer method.

426
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,400
After this morning I'd like to do
much better

427
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,960
into this afternoon's technical.

428
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,360
It's a bit hard to get
tablespoons of beaten egg.

429
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,360
One, two. I'm expecting that to be
quite a stiff dough.

430
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,480
I've done it wrong.
I've put too much egg in.

431
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,080
I was focusing so much on the
muscovado that I

432
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,960
put too much egg
in. Awkward.

433
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,680
Right, try again.

434
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,760
After each stage they need to be
frozen.

435
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,320
It's quite a wet dough.

436
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,760
I expect it will firm up when it
gets in the fridge.

437
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,520
There is no indication of thickness.

438
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,520
I'll just go for a couple of
millimetres.

439
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,560
You want them nice and thin.

440
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,160
How's it going to fit?
It's not going to fit.

441
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,640
Kate's done it wrong again.

442
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,640
This isn't ideal. This is human
error in action.

443
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,520
Two hours remaining in the final
Technical Challenge.

444
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,520
Make eight by eight square templates
and a ten by seven oval.

445
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,200
This is not ten by seven.
So I'm going to have to freehand.

446
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Ovals freehand, I'm assuming,
which'll be unamusing.

447
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,200
I've never drawn an oval before in
my life.

448
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,880
I do feel I'm back at, like, a
school art class.

449
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,080
Not very ovaly. That's annoying me.

450
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,640
Yeah, that's probably close enough.

451
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,520
So yours is more like a sort of,
uh...  Don't, no, no...

452
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,800
No?  I was going to say egg.

453
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,720
Don't say egg.  It's a little egg
like.

454
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,640
It looks like
something From Mork &amp; Mindy travels

455
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,480
in.  I used to love that show.  I just
want to make sure I can get five.

456
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,480
So, one, two...  Three...
Idiot!

457
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,960
It needs to be quite a lot bigger.

458
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,680
I'm just going to freeze those and
then stick them in the oven.

459
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,160
They shouldn't take that long to
bake.

460
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,200
I'm going to cut them out afterwards
because I don't want the outsides to

461
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,200
burn. All about finesse.

462
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,120
Bakers, you are halfway through your
ginger biscuits.

463
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,240
Let's get these in the oven.  It
doesn't even say how long to bake

464
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,960
the biscuits for.  Just this bake.

465
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,360
So, I'm going for seven minutes and
check them thereafter.

466
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,080
Eight minutes, that sounds about
right.

467
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,560
I'm doing it at five minutes, I will
keep an eye on it, though.

468
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,920
It's all about the bake.

469
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,560
Prue said, you know, all about the
bake.  It's all about the bake.

470
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,160
This is royal icing.

471
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,400
Icing sugar, egg whites and lemon
juice.

472
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,760
Alls I can taste is just sweet air.

473
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,200
Trying not to mix it too hard
because the icing sugar will get

474
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,200
away with me.  Right, that's five
minutes.

475
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,680
Hm. I can see them browning around
the edge.

476
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,560
This is how I normally do it because
I just didn't want the edges to
burn.

477
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,120
I'm tempted to put them back in
actually for a couple more minutes.

478
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,880
I'm going to put the squares back
in. They just feel a little softer.

479
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,560
I'm going to get them back in the
oven.

480
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,560
Hm.

481
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,520
Just doing them in increments of two
minutes just to see how they look.

482
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,520
It needs a little bit longer because
they've got to have a nice snap to
them.

483
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,680
I think I'm happy with those.

484
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,640
They're nice and thin. They smell
good.

485
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,040
A couple more minutes. Just take a
minute.

486
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,880
They've just spread a little bit.
I didn't freeze them long enough.

487
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,880
Ah, snap.

488
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,200
Put them back in for a little flash
of, like, a minute.

489
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,440
Bakers, you have one hour left.

490
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,960
How much time is that per biscuit?

491
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,560
Six.  Minutes.
Six minutes.

492
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,160
Which one's the minutes again?
Go away. Go on.

493
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,400
Pipe flower pattern onto the oval
and pipe lace onto the square.

494
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,600
Simple, right?  Let's give it a go.

495
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,600
A bit too dark.
I burnt my biccies.

496
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,680
I hate rushing decorating.

497
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,600
Definitely the fastest I've ever
iced.  Is it enjoyable?

498
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,240
SHE MUMBLES

499
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,800
At home it
took me all day to ice 12 biscuits.

500
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,520
You've got four and a half minutes
per biscuit left.  Right.  Yeah.  OK.

501
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,640
I'm just thinking they're looking...
They're lovely, they look beautiful,

502
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,520
they're a little on the plain
side.

503
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,280
I'm having two different
consistencies

504
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,600
for piping and for flooding.

505
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
A lot more to do than perhaps I
first thought.

506
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,240
No time to redo anything.

507
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,520
There's so much intricate detail on
here.

508
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,360
If I can just get some basics done
on these.

509
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,240
Draw the line and then it kind of
semi-sets.

510
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Flood the white icing and then pipe
the flower straight on top.

511
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,920
I should have just done that in
hindsight but I decided to flood ice

512
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,920
everything.  What I'm going to do is
do the same on each one and then go

513
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,680
back and add detail.

514
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,720
I think everyone's got their own
technique for flood icing, though.

515
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,200
If I run out of time, just have to
serve them, won't I?

516
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,520
My hand is surprisingly steady
actually considering

517
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,160
how nervous I am.

518
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,960
I think everybody needs to learn how
to speed pipe.

519
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,480
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

520
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,160
Just not enough time at all.

521
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,160
If I can just get as much done on
these coloured ones.

522
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,280
I'm just going to pipe some dots
around the flooded ones.

523
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,120
I literally can't give you eye
contact right now unless you're a

524
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,720
biscuit and you need some icing on
you.

525
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,480
I mean, look how many biscuits are
uniced.

526
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,440
Do you want me to do one for you?
No.

527
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,720
I haven't actually taken more than
about three breaths in the last two

528
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,240
minutes.  I haven't breathed.

529
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,240
I haven't looked up. They're looking
increasingly messier.

530
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,400
It's actually really hard going on
your hand.

531
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Oh!  My back's killing me.

532
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,200
Bakers, time is up.

533
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,360
Step away from your nozzles.

534
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,040
They look good, mate.  Have you both
finished?

535
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,560
Prue and Paul are expecting ten
exquisitely delicious

536
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,000
ginger biscuits with

537
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
a perfect snap, and they'll have no
idea whose is whose.

538
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,040
Shall we start with this one then,
Prue?

539
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,520
They're beautifully even.
Likewise with the oval.

540
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,240
There has been flooding.
The icing is nice and thin.

541
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,040
It could have been a little bit
thinner in order to flood it better

542
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,760
because this is a bit lumpy.

543
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,760
That went snap.  It did.
Nice and crisp.

544
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,400
That is a very good ginger biscuit.

545
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,440
Lovely flavour.  There's a couple of
issues with this one.

546
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,040
One, they're not finished. Two,
they're very different.

547
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,680
They aren't the same as that.

548
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,680
No.  But they might be redeemed by
the bake. Nice crunch.  Mm.

549
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,240
It's a bit dark, that one, actually.
Tastes good.  Texture is beautiful.

550
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,960
Yeah, but the problem is, look,
there's nothing on them.

551
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,640
These are quite neat, actually.

552
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,320
Mm-hm.  Uh, they're quite big, you
know, the blobs on them.

553
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,360
Yeah.  But they are finished. The
biscuits aren't very square.

554
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,040
They've spread a tiny bit in the
oven but this still looks really

555
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,680
good biscuit.  Yeah. Nice snap.

556
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,840
Flavour's very good, texture's very
good.

557
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,280
Let's have a look at the other ones.
It's flooded well, this.

558
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,840
I just think it's lost something.
The piping here is not blobs.

559
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,600
If the icing had been a bit thicker

560
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,080
you would have got that perfect
bobbly edge.

561
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,480
But who has triumphed in the
last Technical Challenge?

562
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,320
This is third place.

563
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,400
Oh, what a surprise.

564
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,480
Well, Kate, you know you didn't
finish.

565
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,880
Yeah.

566
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,320
Second place...

567
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,760
..is this one.

568
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,360
The consistency of the icing was

569
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,280
slightly off and some of your
biscuits

570
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,200
were slightly round. But they were
all finished, so well done.

571
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,880
That leaves Steven in first place.

572
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,280
Steven, the icing isn't perfect.

573
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,280
No.  But it is more intricate and you
have tried hard to get the shape.

574
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,400
It's a really good crack at a nice
biscuit.  Thank you.

575
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Oh! I was willing that. I was
willing that to happen.

576
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,160
There is a chance but everything

577
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,240
tomorrow's going to have to be bang
on.

578
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,640
Fair enough, came third, didn't
finish them.

579
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,800
I mean, I had a good bake on the
bread and going into the Showstopper

580
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,360
I think everyone's going to be

581
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:40,000
starting from roughly the same
point.

582
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,760
Just one challenge remains
in this year's competition.

583
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,400
In just a few hours,

584
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,040
at a very special garden party for
family and friends we'll discover

585
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,360
the winner of
The Great British Bake Off.

586
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,720
Coming into today,
I think what we've got is two

587
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,080
challenges that turn everything
upside down.

588
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,840
Initially, we'd put Kate on top,
close to Sophie and then Steven.

589
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,240
The technical was then Steven,
Sophie and Kate.

590
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,000
So it is literally reversed.

591
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,240
The fact of the matter is, whoever
wins the Showstopper is going to be

592
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,400
the winner.  What happens if they're
all even at the end of

593
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,200
the Showstopper?  I'm walking out.

594
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,200
You win, Noel.
Do I?  Yes.  Amazing.

595
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,320
Morning, bakers. Welcome to the last
ever Bake Off challenge before one

596
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,920
of you is named champion of 2017.

597
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,640
For your final Showstopper,

598
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,920
Paul and Prue would love you to make
a large entremet.

599
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,920
As we all know, an entremet is
a thing that Sandi knows about.

600
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,520
An entremet is a light, delicate,

601
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,560
multi-layered cake that was
originally served as a dessert

602
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,560
between courses.  Your entremet must
have a minimum of five elements,

603
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,520
one of which must be sponge.

604
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,600
The entire cake should be covered in
perhaps a glaze.

605
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,000
Or maybe a ganache, whichever you
choose,

606
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,320
your entremet should be decorated to
the highest of standards.

607
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,480
And, when sliced, should hold
together perfectly with each of the

608
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,440
delicate layers clearly visible.

609
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,240
You have five hours.

610
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,240
BOTH:  On your marks, get set, bake!

611
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,440
This is the most unforgiving final
Showstopper in Bake Off history.

612
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,080
A perfect entremet is a flawlessly
decorated mousse cake,

613
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,200
filled with distinct, delicate
layers,

614
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,640
delivering contrasting textures and
complementary flavours.

615
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,360
The three bakers are probably very,
very nervous.

616
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,160
This is technically a very difficult
challenge to get right.

617
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,840
The sponge is one element of it, but

618
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,680
they need to bring in other
elements, too.

619
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,400
A mousse, a bavarois,
a jelly, a meringue.

620
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,080
But you've got to get it all working
in unison.

621
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,520
If you've got five, or six, or
seven, or eight different elements,

622
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,520
when you get a mouthful, whatever's
in that spoon must be delicious.

623
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,480
They've got to work backwards.
How long have I got to make this?

624
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,920
How long does it take for the jelly
to set, the sponge to be cool?

625
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,920
It's very, very tricky.

626
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,840
I've been so impressed with those

627
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,920
bakers and I know that they can
all do

628
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,800
incredibly well, so I want every one
of them to be so good that we

629
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,120
struggle to choose a winner.

630
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,600
Hello, Sophie.  Hello, morning.

631
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,760
Hi, Sophie. What are you doing?

632
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,440
I have named mine
The Ode To The Honey Bee.

633
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,600
I just love honey. I find it
fascinating.

634
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,000
I think it's incredible just how
different it can taste.

635
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,720
It's like wine, really.  A tempered
chocolate honeybee and flower will

636
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,120
decorate a marbled white chocolate
mirror glaze entremet,

637
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,880
containing several layers, featuring
honey custard, blackberry jelly,

638
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,120
orange blossom sponge,
hazelnut feuilletine,

639
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,240
lemon curd and a lavender mousse.

640
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,000
Do you think all these things go
together?

641
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,480
I think actually the honey,
and the lemon, and the lavender,

642
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,240
I think it all harmonises
quite well.

643
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,680
I'm trying to think,
lemon and lavender.

644
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,000
I think that could...

645
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,960
I think that will work. Honeybees
like all those things, don't they?

646
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,160
So why shouldn't we?  Let's hope
there's no sting in the tail.

647
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,360
Do you see what he did there?

648
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,840
I'm going to take him away now and
put him in a dark room.

649
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,360
Come with me. Even at the

650
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,240
beginning of this final Showstopper,
the bakers will have to move fast.

651
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,800
I want the whole thing to be

652
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,040
freezing within two and a half
hours.

653
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,920
My countdown timer is everything.

654
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,520
Unless they set their individual
layers quickly,

655
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,200
they won't be firm enough to stack

656
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,120
so they can construct their
entremet.

657
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,040
It's such a process to get
everything chilled.

658
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,840
You can't just stack it all on top
of each other and hope for the best.

659
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,200
What I'm doing here is custard.

660
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,800
This is what I want to get done
first because it's got to freeze.

661
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,120
Got some blackberries, some
sugar and some lemon juice.

662
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,720
I'm just going to mush that down and
make it into a puree.

663
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,760
So, a couple of jobs on the go at
the same time.

664
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,560
This is what we call concurrent
activity and this is an actual

665
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,080
principle of war.

666
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,200
In the battle for the Bake Off
crown...

667
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,640
Multitasking is a principle of war.

668
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,600
..Kate's opened up an Eastern front.

669
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,600
I've coloured my lychee jelly with
red food colouring because the whole

670
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,240
entremet's going to be white and I
really just wanted a flash of colour

671
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,440
in the middle. So that's like the
Japanese flag.

672
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,040
Kate's jelly will sit at the heart

673
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,960
of a Japanese inspired white
chocolate

674
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,960
mirror glazed entremet, decorated
with shards of black sesame tuile,

675
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,160
dragon fruit dice and a tempered
chocolate butterfly.

676
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,800
And all her layers will be encased

677
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,600
in a set custard known as a
bavarois,

678
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,480
flavoured with an oriental twist.

679
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,680
What's that?  Yuzu juice.

680
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,520
Yuzu juice. It's like lemon.

681
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,480
It's like lemon, mixed with
mandarin, yeah.

682
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,280
You look calm.  Do I?
The bake's all about Zen today.

683
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,880
So that's what I'm channelling.

684
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,360
What are you going to do if you win?

685
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,400
If I do, I'm going to do something
ridiculous.

686
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,920
Streak?  Streak!

687
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,280
Through the tent?  I'm going to do a
naked cartwheel.

688
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,240
THEY LAUGH

689
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,400
This is the first layer of custard.
I'll get this freezing.

690
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,640
One thing down, another six to do.

691
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,160
It's the rising sun.

692
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,160
Kate's not the only one headed to
the Far East.

693
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,600
But Steven's given himself twice as
far to travel.

694
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,400
It's a big entremet. It's two
halves.

695
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,840
It'll be a yin yang.

696
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,160
A yin yang is a representation of
light and dark.

697
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,680
And the two can't exist
without one another.

698
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,000
Caramelised bananas with run,
creme brulee, raspberry coulis,

699
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,360
chocolate mousse,
honeycomb feuilletine

700
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
and hazelnut genoise
sponge will be

701
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,400
layered in two separate moulds.

702
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,280
And if 14 elements wasn't enough,

703
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,320
the two halves will have contrasting
decoration.

704
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,320
One will be mirror glaze with a
galaxy scene of the Northern Lights

705
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,080
streak. The other half will be

706
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,360
sprayed warm chocolate onto
the frozen

707
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,800
surface, and it leaves what looks
like velvet.

708
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,240
Is this inspired by something?

709
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,440
I was in Sweden when I applied for
the Bake Off.

710
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,600
I remembered the snow on the ground
and you could see the galaxy in the

711
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,160
sky. You saw the Northern Lights.
It was a most beautiful scene.

712
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,000
That's when I applied for the
Bake Off.

713
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,680
You see how inspirational
we Scandinavians are?

714
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,040
Cool, right.

715
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,720
A nice honey set custard.

716
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,280
Usually I'd set overnight.

717
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,320
So I've had to put more gelatine in
than I'd want to.

718
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,320
Rather than setting one layer at a
time, with so much to get through,

719
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,480
Steven is planning to set three
at once.

720
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,720
A layer of custard and a layer
of banana,

721
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,600
then a layer of custard underneath.

722
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,640
But as well as perfectly set
layers...

723
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,560
That's going back in the freezer.

724
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,360
..the judges will expect contrasting
textures.

725
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,280
I'm starting the genoise now. This
is going to be the sponge element.

726
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,280
I picked genoise because it's light
and airy, but it has structure.

727
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,800
This is for my orange sponge.

728
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,000
It's a financier recipe, which is
like a little petit four.

729
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,360
It's almost got a chewy texture.

730
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,840
It's going to be right at the
bottom.

731
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,240
I'm using this pan to just get it as
flat as I can.

732
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,440
When you're stacking, everything is
a little bit out.

733
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,800
There is a cumulative effect.

734
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,600
I'm going to cut it into a circle so

735
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,400
it doesn't need to be neat around
the edges or anything like that.

736
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,600
It's going to go in the oven.

737
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,600
This is the last layer of custard
going on top of the bananas and

738
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,520
we're going to do a final freeze to
get it solid.

739
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,480
I knew this would take a while, but
it is the star of the show.

740
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,320
Right.

741
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,840
Bakers, you're halfway through.

742
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,880
You've got two and a half hours
left,

743
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,280
and then Blue Eyes comes in
and destroys us all.

744
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,320
Lemon curd.  As well as their set and
sponge layers...

745
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,960
Right, what now?  ..all the finalists
are hoping to deliver an element of

746
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,360
crunch.  This is the coconut
dacquoise.

747
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,000
Essentially it's like a meringue
with coconuts.

748
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,920
I'm making a bunch of honeycomb and
I'm going to crush that up and it's

749
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,040
going to go in between chocolates.

750
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,120
My feuilletine layer is basically
like a really

751
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,400
posh Rice Krispies cake.

752
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,600
It's like the Honey Monster's heart.

753
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,440
It's nice, isn't it? I'm just going
to look at this for a bit.

754
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,440
It's making me sort of wistful.

755
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,720
Yeah. Nice and springy.

756
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,560
Look at that.

757
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,720
This is the frozen inserts.

758
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,520
I want to get it cut so I can get
it back into the freezer,

759
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,560
just to give it a little bit more
chilling time.

760
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,160
There you go. Easy does it.

761
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,400
Before they can begin assembling
their final Showstopper,

762
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,800
Sophie, Steven and Kate...

763
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,120
There's so many processes.

764
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,680
..need to perfect a mousse to encase
their entire entremets.

765
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,960
This is a chocolate mousse.

766
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,040
My mousse, it's white chocolate and
lavender.

767
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,480
So, this is the yuzu and white
chocolate bavarois.

768
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,880
It's got a really unique flavour.

769
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,280
It's a bit experimental and that's
what I wanted to do.

770
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,480
Most of the flavours I think,
are terrific.

771
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,720
I think Kate's coconut and yuzu will
be very good together.

772
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,840
They're not too aggressive.

773
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,880
Sophie's gone for the most diverse

774
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,920
flavours I think I've ever heard of
in the Bake Off tent.

775
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,320
Just put the lavender there.

776
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,520
Smell it.  Lavender and lemon.

777
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,000
I initially went really subtle with
it. I'm putting a fair amount in.

778
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,960
I'm a little bit worried about
Steven's.

779
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,560
Chocolate is so dominant.

780
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,400
Has he bitten off more than he can
chew?

781
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Yeah.  He's often come to a point
where timing has been his downfall.

782
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,560
I want all of them to finish what
they set out to do.

783
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,960
Me too.  Is Steven going to finish?

784
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,880
I think Sophie's is very
complicated.

785
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,120
And, actually, is Kate going to be
able to give it the finesse that she

786
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,800
very often lacks?

787
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,640
Just got to give yourself as much
time as possible to concentrate on

788
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,880
the assembly, which is why I'm
trying to fly through these bits.

789
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,920
I'm going to go and retrieve those
inserts.

790
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,640
Hopefully they've set just enough.

791
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,120
Unless they're built quickly...

792
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,480
Everything is just about to set and
I can go ahead.

793
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,560
..there won't be enough remaining
time for the assembled entremets to

794
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,120
set again...  It's all got to be spot
on first-time.

795
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,120
..so that they can be decorated
before the final judging.

796
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,160
It's a bit too sloppy.

797
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,920
Let's get it out. This is the lemon
curd.

798
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,320
I'm going to let it freeze for

799
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,120
another ten minutes, just to reset
everything.

800
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,840
Push the sponge.

801
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,080
Caramelised honey.  I'm trying to use
every single spare second.

802
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,680
It means that I'm prepared for the
next step.

803
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,000
This is the feuilletine.

804
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,400
That is Japan in a cake tin.

805
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,400
This is raspberry coulis going
over the sponges.

806
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,200
Back in the freezer. Just set for as
long as I can.

807
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,000
This is going to set now.

808
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So, I'm going to start doing all my
decorations.

809
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,080
I'm going to start off by doing
honeycomb.

810
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,600
I'm going to use a bit of bubble
wrap.

811
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,600
This is going to be messy. I'm going
to have to do it.

812
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,720
I'm just tipping these into the
moulds.

813
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,720
OK. They're in.  This is cocoa
butter on acetate,

814
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,720
then I'm going to use melted
chocolate on top of this.

815
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,720
Take half the jam with me.

816
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,320
This is going to be my honey bee.

817
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,000
I stuck down little strips of tape
and painted cocoa butter on.

818
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,200
So the chocolate will show through
and he'll have stripes.

819
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,560
Don't know why it's a he.
Well, it is a he, isn't it?

820
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,920
Because only the queens...

821
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,920
Right, my gorgeous finalists.
You've got one hour left.

822
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,560
The entremet needed half an hour
more than it's going to

823
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,560
get in the freezer.

824
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,440
It's got a nice shine on
it, hasn't it?

825
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Come on, come on, freeze, freeze,
freeze.

826
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,400
This is a dragon fruit. It's going
to be decoration for the top.

827
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,200
So soft. I'm worried it's not going

828
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,200
to hold when I take it out the
mould.

829
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,560
STEVEN EXHALES

830
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,520
I have got a chocolate collar.

831
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,920
This is going to be a tuile if it
hopefully works.

832
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,720
Keep calm. Keep the nerves under
control.  Yes.

833
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,720
Here, sweetie.
Thank you so much.

834
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,000
I probably should have done bigger
wings.

835
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm going to get it out and have a
look at it.  Is it set enough?

836
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,920
Right, just carry on, carry on.

837
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,880
I've got an entremet, whether it's
a good entremet remains to be seen.

838
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,880
Yes, that's set fine.

839
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,400
I'm going to
work on my mirror glaze.

840
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,880
Let me get this entremet out.

841
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,280
It's holding its shape, I've just
got to be so careful.

842
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,240
It needs to be 30 degrees C.

843
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,240
Bakers, just 15 minutes before the
entire Bake Off of 2017 is over.

844
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,480
It's going to be close,
going to be close.

845
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,520
That is white chocolate and
cocoa butter.

846
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,520
Right, I think I'm going to go
for it.

847
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,280
Right, that's the best you're
going to get out of that.

848
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,520
God, don't inhale cocoa butter.

849
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,520
Moment of truth.

850
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:27,360
Just make it a bit
more like marble, less squiggly.

851
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,560
Wish me luck.

852
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,960
If I can't present something
beautiful, I'll present what I can.

853
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,960
I've got to add
the chocolate collar.

854
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,960
Oh, no. A bit of a crack.

855
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,040
I need to get it on the cake stand.

856
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,040
Yin needs to meet yang.

857
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,400
It's on.

858
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,960
Not the beautiful entremet
I imagined.

859
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,520
There's cracks all over the place.

860
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,520
Bakers, you have one minute.

861
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,880
Where are me balls?  Come on, Steven.

862
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,720
What's he doing?
What are you doing?

863
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,640
Come on, come on.

864
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,760
Bakers, your final
challenge is over.

865
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,720
Wow.

866
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,640
What a relief.

867
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,640
It's all over. It's all over.

868
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,640
Well done. You did it.
Congratulations.

869
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,080
You got through it.  Well done.

870
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,720
Bless you.
Our kids have all grown up.

871
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

872
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,800
I'm crying now.

873
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,120
Quite beautiful.

874
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:39,000
Baked our little socks off.

875
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,480
SANDI: Outside the tent, the bakers'
friends and family have arrived,

876
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,760
along with a few familiar faces.

877
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,160
I had butterflies this morning
coming back to the tent,

878
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,480
which is ridiculous,
considering I'm not baking.

879
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,400
It is really amazing to be back.
I've missed everyone so much.

880
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,880
&quot;Hi. How are you?&quot;
It's sort of like a reunion.

881
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,680
If I had to pick a winner, erm...

882
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,480
I'm not going to choose. It'd be
like choosing your favourite child.

883
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,480
They are all fantastic bakers.

884
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,320
I want Stevie to win.
He has taught me so much.

885
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,880
As long as he doesn't do
rubbery jelly, he'll be fine.

886
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,600
..I'd probably say Sophie, you know.

887
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,320
Being a northern lass,
I'd like Katie.

888
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,240
I honestly don't know
who it's going to be.

889
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,240
WHISPERS:  Steven.
HE LAUGHS

890
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,120
NOEL:  It's judgment time for
the final show-stopping entremets.

891
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,800
Sophie, please bring up
your final Showstopper.

892
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,400
Thank you, Sophie. Can you tell us
all about your entremet, please?

893
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,880
So, I've named my entremet
Ode to the Honeybee.

894
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,960
There's an orange-blossom
financier sponge.

895
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,320
Then there is a blackberry jelly.

896
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,320
Then there is a feuilletine
caramelised honey custard,

897
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,240
a set lemon curd...
SHE LAUGHS

898
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,440
..a white chocolate and
lavender mousse and a mirror glaze.

899
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,840
I think the overall look
is absolutely beautiful.

900
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,640
It's original. It's pretty.

901
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,520
The marbling is absolutely stunning.

902
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,560
The colour has broken up
a little bit,

903
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,800
but the honeycomb with the bee,
with the flower,

904
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,760
with the marble, I think,
is exceptional.  Thank you.

905
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,760
Wow. Knife just fell through.
That's great.

906
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,040
Look at that.

907
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,800
That is just set,

908
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,800
and they're not running
into each other, the layers.

909
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,600
Very neat. The jelly, especially.
And it's just holding together.

910
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,640
That is amazing.

911
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,640
Mm! Lemon and lavender
has got to be the new taste.

912
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,080
SHE CHUCKLES

913
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,280
HE SIGHS

914
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,480
I love it.

915
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,040
Being the theme of the entremet
is the honey,

916
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,880
that's the first thing you get,
and it's not overly sweet.

917
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,400
The jelly,
with that little tartness...

918
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,200
The sponge is just right

919
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,080
cos it gives it a little bit of bite
to the whole thing.

920
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,880
And even the lemon
and the lavender work, as well.

921
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,840
Every one of the creamy,
jelly layers

922
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,760
is the right degree of gelatine.

923
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,920
It's not rubbery. It's not liquid.

924
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,240
And on top of all that,
it tastes fantastic.

925
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,160
Thank you.  Thank you.

926
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,160
Thank you so much.

927
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,520
SHE EXHALES

928
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,320
Kate, would you like to bring your
entremet up to the table, please?

929
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,880
Ooh!  Flew off.

930
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,600
Kate, remind us about your entremet.

931
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,040
It's yuzu
and white chocolate bavarois

932
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,200
on top of coconut dacquoise,

933
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,160
with lychee jelly
and a yuzu zest sponge,

934
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,680
and then a yuzu
and white chocolate glaze.

935
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,200
It's tremendously unusual
and beautifully done.

936
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,880
The glaze is as shiny
as a bathroom tile.

937
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,280
The mirror finish you've got
on the top is beautiful

938
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,520
and the colour choices are superb.

939
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,520
Well, that dropped through well,
actually.

940
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,560
Oh, look at that.

941
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,560
They're big and they're bold
and they're equal.

942
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,120
I think that yuzu flavour

943
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,000
is just so sharp and delicious
and surprising.

944
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,120
It starts off
tasting like grapefruit

945
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,120
and then you know it's not
grapefruit. Mm, it's lovely.

946
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,240
I love the flavour combinations.

947
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,720
The bavarois,
it's that light citrus.

948
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,800
Have you put that
in the jelly, as well?

949
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,200
Because it's got this beautiful
citrus hit, as well, in there.

950
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,800
That meringue and coconut

951
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,400
is a little stroke of genius
because it's a different flavour.

952
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,560
It's very harmonious
with the lemony flavours,

953
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,080
and it's drier than the bavarois.

954
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,880
So, you get the contrast of texture
and the contrast of flavour,

955
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,560
and I think
it's really beautiful.  OK.

956
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,320
The jelly melts in the mouth.
Not too much gelatine in there.

957
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,840
The sponge, and then
that light bavarois is sublime.

958
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,080
I'd eat that all day.  Thank you.

959
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,080
Well done.  Thank you.

960
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,760
Well done, Kate.
That's good, mate. Well done.

961
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,680
Good luck, Steve.  Thank you.

962
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,680
Steven, please bring up
your final Showstopper.

963
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,240
Steven, tell us all about
your entremet, please.

964
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,560
So, inside, there is
a hazelnut dacquoise,

965
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,760
genoise sponge
with a raspberry coulis.

966
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,000
There is bananas and custard
surrounded by a chocolate mousse.

967
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,080
On the yin side is
white chocolate flocking,

968
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,400
and on the yang side,
galaxy mirror glaze.

969
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,760
That is extraordinary glazing.

970
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,760
It looks like a shell.
It looks amazing.

971
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,960
The contrast is there, but
I almost want this to be smoother

972
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,640
and a little bit more refined.

973
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,760
This looks a little
as if it's unfinished.

974
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,760
I'm going to go for the mirror.

975
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,240
The distinctive layers
upsets me a little bit.  Mm.

976
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,880
Because this all
comes down to timing,

977
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,200
which I've said before.  Yeah.

978
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,240
The mirror glaze is not quite set,
and so the knife is taking

979
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,920
the colour through
to the next layer,

980
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,920
and the next layer's being pushed
through to the next layer.

981
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,480
Love the bananas.
Love the chocolate mousse.

982
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,280
If I was to close my eyes
and eat that,

983
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,640
that's a chocolate mousse
with a bit of banana in.

984
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,800
You're not getting
too many textures in there.

985
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,200
I want to cut a bit
of the other side

986
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,640
because that blue glaze
is making a muddle.

987
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,320
To me, it's exactly the same.

988
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,760
You've got bleeding
of each of the layers.

989
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,560
It's hard to distinguish any layers

990
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,920
except the dominant ones -
the chocolate and the banana.

991
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,600
It's almost too much
of a good thing.

992
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,280
It's very rich and sweet.

993
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,280
I don't think you'd be able
to eat a lot of it.

994
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,600
I just think
you missed a trick here.

995
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,720
Mm.  I think you missed a trick.

996
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:20,000
Thank you very much.  Thank you.

997
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,880
Paul and Prue now have
a huge decision to make.

998
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,920
The three bakers came into
the Showstopper pretty even,

999
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,960
so is this a very
difficult decision?

1000
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,440
You have elements in all these
which are just sheer perfection.

1001
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,000
You have something
exceptional from Sophie.

1002
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,560
Sophie's marbling on top
is just amazing.

1003
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,520
You have flavours, and the
mirror glaze from Kate is gorgeous.

1004
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,480
On the other hand, I'm sure
Steven feels a little bit down,

1005
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,160
because I don't think Steven's
is as good as the other two.

1006
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,680
Steven's let himself down
a little bit.

1007
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,680
Well, ten weeks of amazing memories,
but it comes down to this,

1008
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,080
and I do not think
it is an easy decision.

1009
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,200
I came in here thinking
I knew who'd win,

1010
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,880
and the more I think about it,
I'm going to change my mind.

1011
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,720
But I'm not going to tell you who.

1012
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,520
Hopefully, you will eventually.
There's a lot of people out there.

1013
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,800
And then you can tell them!

1014
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,280
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1015
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,400
Oh, my God!
SHE LAUGHS

1016
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,880
NOEL:  Before the winner is revealed,
Steven, Kate and Sophie

1017
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,880
can finally join
their family and friends.

1018
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,160
I'm feeling very nervous.
It could go any way.

1019
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,640
And I will be incredibly pleased
and proud of them,

1020
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,800
especially because
I count Katie and Steven

1021
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,240
very much as my friends now.

1022
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,960
Genuinely, whoever won,
it would be deserved,

1023
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,120
because we've all come so far
from where we started from.

1024
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,120
Hey, Mum.

1025
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,800
I haven't let go
of that dream of winning.

1026
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,920
It left me halfway through the bake.

1027
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,240
It left me. But I clawed it back.

1028
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,320
Come and sit down. Come on.

1029
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,320
I could still win.
HE SIGHS

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1031
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,800
Hello. Thank you all for coming.
The moment's here.

1032
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,320
I'd like to ask the three finalists
to step forward.

1033
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,600
Big round of applause for Kate,
Steven and Sophie.

1034

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1035
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:36,120
Come on, then. Come on, lads.
SHE LAUGHS

1036
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,440
Good luck.

1037
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,120
Right, guys.

1038
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,600
I have the huge honour
of announcing...

1039
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,920
I'm going to cry!

1040
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,200
I have the huge honour
of announcing the winner

1041
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,360
of The Great British Bake Off 2017.

1042
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,320
You three are amazing,

1043
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,320
but I'm afraid there can
only be one champion.

1044
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:00,680
The winner of
The Great British Bake Off 2017

1045
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:05,120
is...

1046
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,880
..Sophie.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1047
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,880
Well done.

1048
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,960
Are you going to cry?
I'm nearly in tears.

1049
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,600
Well done, Sophie.  Thank you.
You deserve it, hon.

1050
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,600
That's yours, my dear.

1051
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,720
You are such a clever girl,
and you deserve it.

1052
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1053
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,560
I... I'm sure it'll sink in,
but it hasn't quite yet.

1054
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,560
Just kind of disbelief, really.

1055
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,360
The idea of winning
is such a minute possibility.

1056
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,600
I don't think I'll forget this
for as long as I live.

1057
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,360
Well done, Sophie.  Thank you.

1058
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,440
Oh, thank you so much, Sandi.

1059
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,440
Well done.
I'm going to pinch myself.  Amazing.

1060
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,000
Oh, my God.

1061
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,160
Can I be honest?
I got a little bit emotional there.

1062
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,240
And it's because Sandi got
a little bit emotional.

1063
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,240
So, I sort of walked off quite
quickly and went, &quot;It's the wind.

1064
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,720
&quot;It's the wind in my eye.&quot;
I'm made up for her.

1065
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,960
Well done.  Oh, my God.

1066
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,480
It's been a real learning curve
for Sophie.

1067
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,480
To come up with that entremet
in the final bake, you know, it...

1068
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,520
I was really shocked
about the standard.

1069
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,640
Sophie seems very calm,
but she's not that confident,

1070
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,200
possibly because
she knows everybody else has had

1071
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,600
more experience than she has.

1072
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,360
Oh, I'm so proud of her. Actually,
I'm really proud of all of them.

1073
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,360
You've done well.
This is not the end of you.

1074
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,880
I've lost to a really brilliant -
really, really brilliant - baker,

1075
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,720
so fair play to the girl.

1076
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,360
Oh, Julia.  Well done.  Thanks.
Well done. I'm so proud of you.

1077
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,360
I know Sophie
can appear quite tough,

1078
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,240
but she's not. She's soft.

1079
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,920
Tom.  Well done.  Thanks, buddy.

1080
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,880
She was as scared
as Kate and I were,

1081
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,000
and for the first time in ten weeks,
I saw vulnerability.

1082
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,880
Hello. Thank you so much.
So proud of you.

1083
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,840
She's put her heart and soul
into this, as we all have,

1084
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,280
but she put her heart and soul
into it and she earned it.

1085
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,920
She really earned it.

1086
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,000
NOEL:  This is the first time
you've lost your cool.

1087
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,160
I'm not really...
I'm going to keep pinching myself.

1088
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,600
Baking - I thought it was
almost like a bit of a calling,

1089
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,560
so to go from just
that sort of idea,

1090
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,320
that sort of initial inspiration...

1091
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,640
But I never dared think about it
until we were here.

1092
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,160
Met some brilliant people,
and then I got to the final,

1093
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,840
and now I'm here.

1094
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,760
It is beyond anything
I thought or dreamed of.

1095
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,800
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1096
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,320
What a privilege.  Well done, Soph.

1097
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,720
Yeah, it's pretty mega.

1098
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1099
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,160
Are you a Star Baker in the making?

1100
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,160
