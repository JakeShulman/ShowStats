1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,400
We're a week in, we've said goodbye to one of the bakers,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,040
11 remain standing and the summer stretches out before us.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,960
- Like my waistline. 
- I wondered what that was.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,680
It'll hit the horizon by the semifinals! Welcome...

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,400
BOTH: ..to The Great British Bake Off.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,520
- Last time... 
- Looking for a crack.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,520
..the Bake Off began with cakes.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,440
You've done these before, haven't you?

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,360
Marie outbaked Tamal, Nadiya and Flora

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,560
to become this year's first Star Baker.

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,480
Every time I go into the tent, I think, "Am I really here?"

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,800
And despite Ugne's closed sponge...

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,640
- It's not good. 
- (Disappointing.)

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,360
..and Dorret's liquid mousse...

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,360
I can't believe this is actually happening.

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,120
- ..it was Stu... 
- Come on.

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,880
..who was first to leave the tent.

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,320
I'll remember this forever.

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,640
Oh, well - back to music!

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,120
Now...

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,360
Good crunch.

22
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,080
..the bakers face biscuits...

23
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,120
I'm happy.

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,000
..with a Signature that's twice as hard to bake...

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,920
It is very wet. Is everyone else's not? Oh, dear!

26
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,280
..a technical that's wafer-thin, French, and baffling...

27
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,320
Is this right?

28
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,880
..and a Showstopper...

29
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,040
Come on!

30
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,360
- ..of edible boxes... 
- Happy with that.

31
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,800
..that takes the biscuit to a whole new dimension.

32
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,760
I wish I'd made it a lot more simple now.

33
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,040
I've never made such a mess before in my life.

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,960
I never go down without a fight.

35
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,560
- Mate, I'm really worried. 
- Why?

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
I feel like a pack of biscuits.

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,840
What kind of biscuits?

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,760
Well, the square ones, with the holes in.

39
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,120
You're crackers.

40
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,200
BOTH: It's biscuit week.

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,480
The bakers will face three challenges

42
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,400
and their first features a variety of biscuit

43
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,560
never seen before in a Signature Bake.

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,760
Morning, bakers, you've survived to week two

45
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,760
and have taken on everything that Mary and Paul throw at you

46
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,720
which is wrong, Mary, to throw things.

47
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,880
Now, bakers, your Signature Challenge for this week

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,680
is to create 24 crunchy...

49
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,480
ITALIAN ACCENT: ..biscotti.

50
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,520
The biscotti can be any shape, flavour, size -

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,800
it's completely up to you, but the biscotti must be identical.

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,200
You've got two hours on the bake so ready yourselves.

53
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,840
- On your marks. 
- Get set. 
- Bake!

54
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,240
Is this two hours?

55
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,920
Plenty of time for this challenge, nothing to worry about.

56
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,480
Biscotti is an unusual biscuit, because it is twice-baked.

57
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,720
Which means that, when you break it, it will snap.

58
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,920
It's got to be dry all the way through

59
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,520
and yet you've got to be able to get your teeth through it!

60
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,440
If Mary was making a biscotti,

61
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,000
she'd probably go for a cranberry, a hazelnut

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,280
and a chocolate.

63
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,640
If I was making a biscotti,

64
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,880
I would go for a cranberry, a hazelnut and a chocolate.

65
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,720
- Morning, Alvin. 
- Morning, sir.

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,480
- Hello, Alvin. - Morning, Alvin.

67
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,040
Tell us all about your biscotti.

68
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,600
Right, my biscotti's going to be flavoured with jackfruits.

69
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,240
Now, I don't know jackfruit. Can you show us some?

70
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,160
Yes, this is jackfruit. It's really fragrant, really sweet.

71
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,440
Very popular in Southeast Asia.

72
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,320
Jackfruit is a nostalgic taste of Alvin's Filipino childhood,

73
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,280
which he often uses in baking for his family.

74
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,080
He's chosen to use fresh jackfruit along with macadamia nuts

75
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,000
to flavour his biscotti.

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,080
How are you going to combat the moisture?

77
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,080
I've strained them and drained them properly

78
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,840
and then, just with a kitchen towel, really dried the whole fruit

79
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,400
and hopefully I'll get away with it.

80
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,520
- Good luck. 
- MEL: Yeah.

81
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,680
I'm looking forward to something quite different

82
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,480
that we haven't tasted before.

83
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,000
All the other bakers adding fruit have gone for dried.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,080
Cranberries, dried barberries as well.

85
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,760
They're lovely, aren't they?

86
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,720
So I'm doing cranberry, pistachio and white chocolate biscotti.

87
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
It's a very classic mix, that, with the cranberries.

88
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,200
But you've got to be careful that they don't just end up like bullets.

89
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,040
Mat's always testing his baking on his fellow London firefighters

90
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,080
and they've approved his use of chopped dried cranberries.

91
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,960
I gave it to a guy at work,

92
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,600
and he said it was the best biscotti he'd ever eaten.

93
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,720
I don't think he's ever eaten biscotti before.

94
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,360
This is unbelievable, this stuff.

95
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,240
Biscotti means twice-baked in Italian.

96
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,600
Probably just got a little bit too much egg in mine.

97
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,360
And if their dough is to survive both trips to the oven,

98
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,320
the bakers need to carefully judge its consistency.

99
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,000
It is very wet. Is everyone else's not? Oh, dear!

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm making a bit of a mess at the moment

101
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
but hopefully they'll end up being biscotti.

102
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,400
So, I'm doing orange, cranberry and rosemary biscotti.

103
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,840
- Right. 
- Interesting that you're using rosemary.

104
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,600
- Yeah. 
- This could be, um, fantastic...

105
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,440
- Mm-hm. 
- ..or it could be disastrous.

106
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,400
Ian's banking on his home-grown rosemary to win round Paul.

107
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,040
His herby biscotti also include almonds

108
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,080
and, instead of ordinary sugar, a blitzed home-made orange caramel.

109
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,400
- Good luck. 
- Yeah.

110
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,680
- Thank you. 
- Thank you.

111
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,120
Does that make you feel better when he says good luck, Ian?

112
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,560
- No, I get quite worried. 
- No, it's a bit worrying, isn't it?

113
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,440
- You'll be fine, mate. 
- Thank you.

114
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,080
I'm just trying to get them consistently the same size.

115
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,680
This should all be uniform because when you cut into them,

116
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,480
you want to have them all the same size,

117
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,160
so I'm hoping it looks all right.

118
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,400
OK, this is a classic Italian technique.

119
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,320
Well, they've asked

120
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,640
for 24 exact biscotti

121
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,880
and I'm never fantastic on anything exact.

122
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,400
Just up in the air...

123
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,040
Sandy teaches baking at her after-school club,

124
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,600
but her precise batch of chocolate chunk and hazelnut biscotti

125
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,120
is a little more advanced than anything she asks the kids to do.

126
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,240
You ask our maths department whether I'm good at maths,

127
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,160
you ask Mr Simpson.

128
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,520
- Good morning, Paul. 
- Morning, Paul, Mel and Mary.

129
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,600
Morning, Paul.

130
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,360
We've caught you with sticky hands. Tell us about your biscotti.

131
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,520
My biscotti is a fig, hazelnut and chocolate biscotti.

132
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,920
Before he became a prison governor, Paul was a Coldstream Guard,

133
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,560
so he's aiming for regimented biscotti.

134
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,080
He's the only baker making a chocolate dough.

135
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,800
When you've got chocolate in there, it's very difficult to tell

136
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,240
- whether it's been baked or not because of the colour. 
- Right.

137
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,120
- Good luck. Thank you. 
- Thank you.

138
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,640
Today, I'm making white wine biscotti.

139
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,160
It's very unusual,

140
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,760
but I tried it and I loved the flavour,

141
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,960
so I'm just going on with it.

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,040
Ugne is putting a superfood in her biscuit - goji berries.

143
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,720
I like to experiment

144
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,000
and I like my fruit and nuts as a healthy diet,

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,920
I love to incorporate it.

146
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,600
Dorret is also gambling on an unusual ingredient.

147
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,000
What's different about them?

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,720
I've added some amber sugar crystals

149
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,320
because they're traditionally made for dunking in coffee.

150
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,760
That will be quite hard to come across.

151
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,280
- Are they actually in there? 
- No, they're just on the top.

152
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,800
- Just on the top. - Oh, nice.

153
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,360
I think it's going to be fascinating to see how they come out.

154
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,960
Underneath the sugar crystals,

155
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,560
Dorret's biscotti will be flavoured with almond and apricots.

156
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,880
I'm not overly worried.

157
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Other people have tested them for me,

158
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,480
people who like biscotti, and I've had good feedback.

159
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,120
I've done a very traditional biscotti recipe,

160
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,640
it's based on a wedding biscotti or a cantuccini.

161
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,280
Flora picked up her recipe when she was travelling in Italy.

162
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,800
Her venetian wedding nutty biscotti

163
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,720
will also contain fennel and sesame seeds.

164
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,560
Going in.

165
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,640
They're baked twice, these biscotti.

166
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,680
They're actually put into the oven to begin with

167
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,000
and then you slice them and after they've been sliced,

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,120
you put them in again to really crisp them up.

169
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,280
And in she goes.

170
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,520
The first bake must be perfectly timed.

171
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,120
Timer.

172
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,160
If the dough is any more than just set,

173
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,960
it will burn on its second bake.

174
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,800
Bakers, you've got one hour left on the challenge.

175
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
Yes, one hour remaining.

176
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,840
We're all just peering in those ovens.

177
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,880
SHE LAUGHS

178
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,960
They look like ciabatta, don't they?

179
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,520
- Morning, Nadiya. 
- Hi.

180
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,040
I'm smelling coconut.

181
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,960
I'm doing a coconut, pistachio and fennel seed biscotti.

182
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,200
So where did the inspiration for all this come from?

183
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,680
Well, we don't have, traditionally, desserts in our culture at all

184
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,720
and coconut features quite a lot in the snacks

185
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,880
that we have before our meals.

186
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,560
Nadiya's transformed one of her mum's Bangladeshi recipes.

187
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,680
Fennel seeds will be added to her biscotti mix,

188
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,120
which will be dipped in coconut brittle.

189
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,600
- So, if it's really good, we have to thank your mum. 
- Yes.

190
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,160
- Good. - Nadiya's mum, we salute you.

191
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,160
- Excellent, see ya. 
- Fantastic, looking forward to it.

192
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,600
The bottom ones are a bit wider than I would have liked.

193
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,480
No, not yet, just a few more minutes.

194
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,800
Same size, same shape. They're the same texture.

195
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,840
Yeah, happy.

196
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,840
They're not as puffed up as I would have liked them

197
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,760
but...

198
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,240
I'm happy.

199
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,640
It's still wet.

200
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,840
Another five minutes.

201
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,080
I'm not going to cut into it if it's wet cos that's going to be disaster.

202
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,640
They look like really beautiful ciabatta.

203
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,880
If only that's what we were making.

204
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,240
- Morning. 
- Good morning.

205
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,320
Morning, Tamal.

206
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,800
Tell us all about your biscotti.

207
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,880
Fruit-wise, I've used three different ones

208
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,640
so dried physalis berries, cranberries and barberries.

209
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,440
- What was the first berry? 
- Physalis.

210
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,160
- Physalis? 
- Physalis.

211
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,440
- Are they also called golden berries? 
- They are.

212
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,920
This is our Golden Berry.

213
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,760
Along with his three berries,

214
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,560
Tamal is flavouring his biscotti with cinnamon and maple syrup.

215
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,800
He's going to top it with his own take on praline.

216
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,240
So I toasted the hazelnuts

217
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,480
and then I made a caramel and poured that on the top,

218
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,320
so this is all going to go in a food processor

219
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,360
and then just be blitzed down so it's crumbs.

220
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,200
How is that going to stick on top of that?

221
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,640
So they'll be dipped in chocolate once they're sliced

222
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,400
and then just sprinkled on top.

223
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,120
Nice. They look like a lovely, comfy pair of slippers.

224
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,480
- They do. 
- I want to slip my foot into one of those.

225
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,960
- Come on, Golden Berry. - Good luck with your second bake.

226
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,000
Thank you.

227
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,920
I'm happy. Took a while.

228
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,400
Unless it's had enough time to cool...

229
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,560
..the baked dough will crumble when sliced.

230
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,400
HE GULPS

231
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,280
No, I'll give them at least a couple of minutes more

232
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,800
and then I can cut them safe.

233
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,000
They've gotta be identical, so the smarter I can make them look,

234
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,720
the better I'll feel, I think.

235
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,360
Oops, broke that one. I'll just stick it back.

236
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,960
If I'm one missing, I'll just have to say I've eaten it.

237
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,120
Regularly baking with her grandchildren

238
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,680
means that the odd mishap rarely fazes Marie.

239
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,800
And she should be able to repair

240
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,200
her pistachio, apricot and cranberry biscotti.

241
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,440
They're just very, very fragile and I don't know why.

242
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,280
I think I might have put too much fruit in it,

243
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,720
it's not able to hold together.

244
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,800
I think I might have eaten three now.

245
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,400
The ones I've eaten...

246
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,960
(Oh, don't. Oh, don't.)

247
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,880
(I'm going home. You've got to be nice to me.)

248
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,280
(I'll tell you what happened. Oh, look at that face.)

249
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,600
I put them, I put them in and took them out too early

250
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,120
so they were a wee bit soft in the middle and when I cut them,

251
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,160
they all kind of...

252
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,800
But I'll glue that together and I'll eat that other one, is that OK?

253
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,760
I like that face, I like it.

254
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,680
OK, bakers, just ten minutes until you snap.

255
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,560
- BISCOTTI CRUNCHES 
- Mmm!

256
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,040
During the second bake, the sliced dough should become just crisp.

257
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,760
Any further and the biscotti will be rock hard and inedible.

258
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,840
- (Oh, they look good.) 
- They're all right, aren't they?

259
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,240
Having issues.

260
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,600
Some of them have caught on the edges a bit.

261
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,680
I made 26, so I've got two that I can bin.

262
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,240
- FLORA SIGHS 
- All right?

263
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,040
Just really stressful.

264
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,760
It's biscotti, why is biscotti stressful?

265
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,680
Yep.

266
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,120
They're not as crisp as I would have liked.

267
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,360
They're looking for a texture that's really dry,

268
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,800
so hopefully when it's cooled down, it will sort of dry more.

269
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,680
How's everyone else making theirs look good?

270
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,520
It's a Vin Santo icing or glaze.

271
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,880
I forgot to put the fennel seed into the biscotti.

272
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,760
I said fennel, they're going to get fennel.

273
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,680
I'll get it in the coconut.

274
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,480
Cool down for a moment.

275
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,160
Right, how can I stack them so they all look the same size?

276
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,400
Oh, I know - Jenga!

277
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,720
Three, three, three, three, yeah.

278
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,400
(23, 24...)

279
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,240
24!

280
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,440
OK, bakers, that's time up.

281
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,200
If you'd like to move your bakes to the ends of the benches

282
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,080
and just funnel them into my open mouth, thank you.

283
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,320
Come on then, Flora, do your bit.

284
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,720
Paul and Mary are looking for 24 identical biscotti,

285
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,160
full of flavour and with a crisp crunch.

286
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,480
MARY: To me, they look good.

287
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,880
They look like soldiers, they're beautifully even.

288
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
BISCOTTI CRUNCHES

289
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,120
- Gosh. 
- Good crunch. 
- Very good crunch.

290
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,800
Paul's jaws are like the tectonic plates of the earth moving.

291
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,200
- That's a nice biscotti. Well done. 
- Thank you very much.

292
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,680
HE EXHALES

293
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,040
They all look a very even batch, they're all the right size.

294
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,280
Fennel works really well, little bit of heat in there as well.

295
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,760
It's a fascinating flavour. And just do I like it?

296
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,600
Yeah, I think I do. I think that's a nice biscotti.

297
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,560
Thank you.

298
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,400
I think overall, they don't look too bad.

299
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,880
The uniformity, however, is slightly different.

300
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,280
You've got small, then large biscotti.

301
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,040
They should all be the same size, that's what we were looking for.

302
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,200
I like the chocolate on the top. Has it set?

303
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,480
No.

304
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,640
They were warm when I put it on, sorry.

305
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,640
- A nice crunch. 
- Delicious crunch, isn't it?

306
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,320
It's a shame they're not all the same size,

307
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,440
but I like the crunch and I like the flavour.

308
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,040
I expected to have more ingredients in there.

309
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,960
I'm terribly interested in these goji berries.

310
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,680
- I think the texture's bang on. 
- Oh.

311
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,440
It breaks very easily.

312
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,840
- The flavour is absolutely lovely. 
- Thank you.

313
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,040
They're beautifully, evenly sized.

314
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,000
A little bit soft in the middle.

315
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,920
- The flavours are beautiful. 
- Thank you.

316
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,000
The jackfruit works really well inside it

317
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,560
but they needed to be in there for another five, ten minutes -

318
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,040
- for me, they would have been perfect. 
- Right.

319
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,720
BISCOTTI CRUNCHES

320
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,360
- Mmm, I like that. 
- Thank you.

321
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,440
Hazelnut, chocolate. It's good.

322
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Overall, I think your flavours are fantastic and the bake's very good.

323
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,600
Thank you very much.

324
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,400
I'm not getting much flavour from it, really.

325
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,920
It's not strong enough.

326
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,600
I don't think the sugar works.

327
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,680
You'd be straight down the dentist after having that.

328
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,160
They're absolutely crammed jam-full of interesting things.

329
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,840
I think the flavours are good together,

330
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,800
but there's nothing really over-riding it

331
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,920
and giving it a huge amount of flavour.

332
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,160
Pick one that's your key role and then work everything around that.

333
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,640
The texture is as it should be,

334
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,280
which was a very tricky thing for you to do

335
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,920
because, when you've got chocolate,

336
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,720
you can't tell by the colour and you've judged it absolutely right.

337
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,120
I'd have them again, I think they're great biscotti.

338
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,160
Thank you very much.

339
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,160
I just don't feel that the nuts and the fruit and the chocolate

340
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,240
go together somehow. Not for me.

341
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,360
Not quite uniform on the shape. Very flat.

342
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,720
They're normally smaller...

343
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,640
Yeah, I wasn't happy with how wide they were.

344
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,720
I think you've done very well to not overpower the fennel.

345
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Fennel seed is very, very strong

346
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,480
and you've put a hint in there which complements the rest.

347
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,560
This is the one I've been waiting to try.

348
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,680
- It's all about the rosemary on this. 
- Mm-hm.

349
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,800
That's a really nice biscotti.

350
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,200
It almost gives you a flavour of ginger

351
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,600
and you get that from the orange,

352
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,080
from the richness of the orange blending with the rosemary.

353
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,920
That is a fantastic biscotti.

354
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,160
Well done.

355
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,600
HE SIGHS WITH RELIEF

356
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes!

357
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,360
So, that was a good result.

358
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,400
Um, my rosemary is vindicated.

359
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,560
They liked it, that's good.

360
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,200
That's good.

361
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,640
Just leaves you wondering, "Hmm, OK, where does that leave me?"

362
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,560
But, yeah, it's judging, isn't it?

363
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,760
Already, the bakers have experimented

364
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,240
with a host of flavours,

365
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,880
but historically, biscuits weren't designed to be savoured.

366
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,000
They were an essential staple - hard, bland and indigestible.

367
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,400
Biscuits kept soldiers alive and Navy fleets afloat.

368
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,240
But in 1865, the creation of a mass-produced sweet snack,

369
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,000
named the Pearl, completely reinvented the biscuit.

370
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,640
19th-century biscuits had docker holes,

371
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,560
little pinpricks in the surface

372
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,920
that allowed the steam to escape while they were in the oven.

373
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,200
But the Pearl biscuit was completely different. There were no holes,

374
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,480
so this allowed the dough to rise

375
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,600
and gave it this soft, crumbly texture that the Victorians loved.

376
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,680
An instant sensation,

377
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,200
biscuit makers Peek Frean couldn't keep up with demand.

378
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,840
They soon opened a new factory in Bermondsey so large

379
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,480
that the whole area became known as Biscuit Town.

380
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,760
And, as it grew, so did the success of its snacks -

381
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,400
the Pearl was soon overshadowed by the Garibaldi.

382
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,840
They continued to innovate and make biscuits more and more decadent.

383
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,560
They started putting cocoa in the biscuit dough

384
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,600
and they created the Bourbon biscuit -

385
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,000
two biscuits sandwiched together with chocolate -

386
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,120
and that was an absolute sensation.

387
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,440
Back in our own little Biscuit Town,

388
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,600
the bakers face their next challenge.

389
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,080
They could practice their first,

390
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,160
but this second one will be a complete surprise.

391
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,720
Bakers, welcome to the technical challenge.

392
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,560
Now, this week's recipe comes courtesy of Paul.

393
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,640
Any advice for the bakers, Paul?

394
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,280
Don't rush it.

395
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,200
Right, Paul there just proving that brevity is the soul of wit.

396
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,480
Off you pop now.

397
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,480
They're off to a cookery class. If you'd like to leave the tent.

398
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,120
Paul and Mary, they'd like you to make, please, eight Arlettes.

399
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,680
It's a high-end, light, delicate, cinnamon-flavoured biscuit.

400
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,640
ARLETTES be havin' you. You've got two and a half hours.

401
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,280
- On your marks. 
- Get set. 
- Bake!

402
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,080
Everyone has the same ingredients and the same, very basic recipe.

403
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,160
Never heard of an Arlette.

404
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,560
- FLORA: 
- I have over 100 cookbooks, the majority of them are French,

405
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,120
and I have never heard of this in my life.

406
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,720
They look amazing!

407
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Now, why did you choose this challenge?

408
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,120
Because it's very tricky, Mary, and you know me.

409
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,280
Basically, it's puff pastry.

410
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,800
That is sheer perfection.

411
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,200
It's wafer thin.

412
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,120
You can see all the cinnamon in the sugar there in the spiral.

413
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,160
If you snap that, you see it breaks very easily

414
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,280
and then...

415
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,360
You see what I mean? It's got a bit of bite to it.

416
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,840
It's not like a wafer.

417
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,600
Basically, it's all about the lamination on this.

418
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,040
The layers of the dough and butter, dough and butter.

419
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,120
I'm sure we're going to get a variety of shapes.

420
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,840
Says he, with a huge grin on his face!

421
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,360
They're really helpful instructions, actually.

422
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,240
It just says "make the dough" which is great(!)

423
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,400
Hmm.

424
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,720
It does look like something I've seen before.

425
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,880
I'm presuming it's relatively similar to puff pastry.

426
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,480
This is my flour mixture with the salt.

427
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,040
I just want to make sure they're pretty evenly done

428
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,280
before I start adding in the wet ingredients

429
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,440
so...

430
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,080
50ml of cold water.

431
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,080
I assume he wants kind of a gluten structure built up.

432
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,920
It's a wee bit on the complicated side for a biscuit.

433
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,360
"Knead, then shape into a rectangle and chill."

434
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,360
It's whether it's kneaded enough.

435
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,000
Following it step by step, cos this has got to work.

436
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,560
Got a soft sort of pizza dough.

437
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,160
I'm sure that's not what you want in a biscuit.

438
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,600
It's rectangular-ish.

439
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,120
A lot of chilling going on, apparently, in this recipe.

440
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,120
I put it in the freezer, just in case.

441
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,080
This stage here is the making-the-butter-layer.

442
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,000
It says you have to roll this.

443
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,120
It doesn't look very rollable to me.

444
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,680
"Place the dough in the centre of the butter rectangle,

445
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,200
"then fold the butter over to encase the dough."

446
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,320
It sounds the wrong way round.

447
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,160
Put this one in the middle.

448
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,280
So that's quite unusual,

449
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,720
because you're wrapping the butter around the dough

450
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,280
rather than the dough around the butter.

451
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,040
Is this right?

452
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,080
Roll into a rectangle.

453
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,120
How's it going, Marie?

454
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,600
It's sticking to my clingfilm, I don't know why.

455
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,640
I've never actually come across it sticking to clingfilm before.

456
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,240
"Make a book, turn and chill."

457
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,120
So, that's a book, isn't it?

458
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,240
This is called laminating the dough

459
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,320
and you get defined obvious layers

460
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,800
and it will get another chill.

461
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,600
Unless the dough is chilled completely before each turn...

462
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,320
- Don't you be getting near my shelf. 
- Hmm?

463
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,840
..the butter will melt, wrecking the lamination.

464
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,720
You can't rush, you have to wait.

465
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,680
But after all the chilling and turning,

466
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,960
the bakers need to ensure there's enough time left

467
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,200
to bake the Arlettes.

468
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,240
Oof!

469
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,760
I think I'm all right for time.

470
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,000
I've just transferred the instructions from there

471
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,600
with the timings so that I know what I'm doing.

472
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,360
UGNE YAWNS

473
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,960
One hour remaining.

474
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,760
Mixed the filling ingredients together,

475
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,800
so that's granulated sugar and the teaspoon of ground cinnamon.

476
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,520
It says to put the filling in in one of the layers,

477
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,240
so I'm on my second layer now.

478
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,200
Think about when to put the sugar and cinnamon in.

479
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,520
If I put it in at this stage, what will it do?

480
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,120
If I put it in at that stage, how will it affect things?

481
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,720
I think I'm going to go for the third one.

482
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,200
This is my third turn.

483
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,240
I've decided to add it in the final turn.

484
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,400
Just thought I would add the sugar in at the end

485
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,000
and then you kind of get to keep the texture a bit.

486
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,080
So, I've put it on twice.

487
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,880
I think once it's rolled out to the rectangle,

488
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,600
then you roll it into a Swiss roll.

489
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,120
It's like making sushi.

490
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,640
Maybe I should go that way?

491
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh, I don't know what way to roll it.

492
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,000
If I roll it that way, they'll be really fine discs.

493
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,640
"Trim the ends and cut into eight slices,

494
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,320
"dust with icing sugar

495
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,360
"and roll each slice into very thin ovals."

496
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,840
How thin is thin?

497
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,440
Maybe this thin.

498
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,200
Just don't know how thin it's supposed to go.

499
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,720
Not too thin that it's going to fall apart, just a nervous type of thin.

500
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,240
It's starting to look a bit like a snail.

501
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,920
They are French, so they could be the escargot shape of the biscuit world.

502
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,960
Just hoping that this is what they were looking for.

503
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,880
It says "bake until golden brown, turning once during cooking."

504
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,520
OK, going in.

505
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,000
OK, bakers, you've got ten minutes until you snap and break.

506
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,560
Because of the high butter quantity, they can burn very, very quickly,

507
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,160
which is not ideal.

508
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,360
NADIYA SIGHS

509
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,280
A watched pot never boils and all that.

510
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,200
I don't think my oven's on the right thing.

511
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,400
What do I do?

512
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,560
I don't know, they're not looking clever.

513
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,560
Mine are like...flip-flops.

514
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,600
What's wrong with my oven?

515
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,640
Bakers, three minutes on your cinnamon swirls of doom!

516
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,880
Three minutes.

517
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,560
OK, three minutes, come on.

518
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,880
(How's it going?)

519
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,320
Really bad, the oven wasn't on properly.

520
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,200
I mean, they're coming on now

521
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,680
but I don't know if they're going to be ready.

522
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,400
What have we got? Seconds left, have we?

523
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah, we've got a few seconds left.

524
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,240
They're not cooked at all. No, they're not cooked at all.

525
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,920
OK, bakers, your time is up.

526
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,160
Please bring your Arlettes up to the gingham altar

527
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,200
behind your photos, thank you.

528
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,080
Paul and Mary will have no idea whose Arlettes are whose.

529
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,880
What we're looking for is eight thin Arlettes.

530
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,800
Buttery, crisp and sweet.

531
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,200
We'll start with these over here.

532
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,720
You've got the lines here.

533
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,280
- You've got eight. 
- The appearance of them is very similar.

534
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,920
- Oh, crispy. 
- That's a good sign.

535
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,160
Mm!

536
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,040
- They're a nice texture. 
- It's basically what we're looking for.

537
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,240
It melts in the mouth.

538
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,000
- It's just right, the cinnamon too, isn't it? 
- Mmm.

539
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,560
These are a lot thicker.

540
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,200
Haven't been rolled out very much.

541
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,920
You can still see the lines.

542
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,440
They're a good colour.

543
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,880
Breaks well.

544
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,320
They taste OK, cinnamon's in there.

545
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Now, these look quite dry.

546
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,000
Now, it's crispy.

547
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,800
Slightly chewy as well.

548
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,760
They're uniform and we have got eight.

549
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,240
Moving onto number four, where's the rest?

550
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,640
But they are crispy.

551
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,760
A nice texture inside.

552
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,880
A pity there's not eight.

553
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,160
Now, these, you've just got a couple of swirls

554
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,840
so they've rolled it up the wrong way so it only rolls up twice

555
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,520
rather than rolling it up the long way so you get more curl inside it.

556
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,920
It's flaky and there's quite a bit without cinnamon.

557
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,520
Now, we have got some lamination here.

558
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,120
Quite thin, breaks very well.

559
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,440
That's a lovely texture.

560
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,480
Quite strong on the cinnamon.

561
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,000
Big issues with melting butter here and not rolling it out thin enough.

562
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,680
Nice and crisp.

563
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,640
Large parts here with just dough, no lamination in there.

564
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:24,120
It's sad that we haven't got even distribution of the cinnamon.

565
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,680
Butter pouring out, the rest of the dough, where's it gone?

566
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,560
The flavour's not bad at all but it comes down to the size,

567
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,160
comes down to the lamination and a bit of a rushed job.

568
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,240
- And slightly overbaked as well. 
- Yeah.

569
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,280
The butter's poured out of it again.

570
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,240
Could have been rolled out thinner.

571
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,840
Oh, that's more chewy than a break.

572
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,560
- As you get to the middle, it's more chewy. 
- Yeah, it is.

573
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,960
And the last one.

574
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,880
It looks to me as though it needed a little more baking.

575
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,160
Yeah, for sure, and thinner rolling-out as well.

576
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,320
It's chewy, see? It's underbaked.

577
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,240
Paul and Mary will now reveal

578
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,120
who has baked technically-perfect Arlettes.

579
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,880
In 11th place is...

580
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,560
this one. Whose is this?

581
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,040
First of all, where are the rest of them?

582
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,600
I had a problem with the oven.

583
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,080
I didn't have it at the correct setting, I'm sorry.

584
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,160
In tenth place, who is this?

585
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,040
I just had one spiral.

586
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
In ninth place is this one.

587
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,560
You had a good shape there, needed to be slightly thinner

588
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,400
but, on the edges, they were quite raw.

589
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,200
Tamal is eighth, Ugne seventh,

590
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,480
Alvin is sixth, Mat fifth,

591
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,120
Sandy fourth and Ian is third.

592
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,360
And who is second place here?

593
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,320
They were very good.

594
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,720
And in first place?

595
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,040
You've got a nice spiral all the way through, nice and crisp

596
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,840
and nice and thin, well done.

597
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,240
APPLAUSE

598
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,040
I am trying not to get emotional, I'm trying to be level-headed...

599
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,280
Well done, Dorret, that was very good.

600
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,320
..but inside, I'm doing a little dance.

601
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,120
I feel like I've kind of redeemed myself

602
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,680
and I'm in a middle ground now, I've kind of evened it up.

603
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,640
10th out of 11, it's not a good feeling.

604
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,000
Learn from it and move on. They're the experts.

605
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,400
In hindsight, I should have checked the oven.

606
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,480
My fault entirely. I was silly, silly.

607
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,760
Biscuit week, Paul, who's crumbling?

608
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,920
At the beginning, certainly in the Signature,

609
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,120
Dorret had serious issues with that biscotti.

610
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,880
However, on the technical challenge, she was first.

611
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,120
If she has a bad day again today, we'll just have to look and see.

612
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,920
Tamal had issues as well.

613
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,520
Paul. Marie certainly.

614
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,640
Too early to call a Star Baker at this point, Mary?

615
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,520
Oh, definitely. Because, always,

616
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,520
the Showstopper brings out the best or the worst in people.

617
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,600
But I think that Mat, Ian and Alvin are all up there

618
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,720
for potential Star Bakers this week.

619
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,880
Morning, bakers.

620
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,360
I hope you are all literally ready to stop the show today.

621
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,760
Now, Paul and Mary, please, would like you to bake 36 biscuits today.

622
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,360
But these biscuits need to be presented in a biscuit box

623
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,720
and the biscuit box needs to be

624
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,920
an entirely different kind of biscuit mix

625
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,520
to the biscuits inside.

626
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,240
They can be any shape, size, or flavour that you desire.

627
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,080
You've got four hours on the clock.

628
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,720
- On your marks. 
- Get set. 
- Bake!

629
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,360
It's all on today, basically.

630
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,600
I need to do well.

631
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,080
It's a time to be creative, to showcase what you can do

632
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,800
and I hope I manage to pull that off.

633
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,960
This particular Showstopper is all about precision

634
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,320
and I'd like to see a little bit of architecture going on as well.

635
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,920
It's very important, when you think of that box,

636
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,840
to choose the right mixture.

637
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,520
It's got to be a tough mixture, something like a gingerbread.

638
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,520
I want them to be ambitious,

639
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,680
I want them to show as many techniques as possible,

640
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,920
but most of important of all, they've got to taste really special.

641
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,560
- Morning, Paul. 
- Morning, Paul. Morning, Mary.

642
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:28,600
So what have you decided to do for the biscuit box and the biscuits?

643
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,160
Right, my biscuit box is going to be made of gingerbread.

644
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,640
Biscuits are macaroons, they're going to be coloured pink,

645
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,880
in honour of my wife. She loves pink.

646
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,680
- Nice, OK. 
- Oh, you heartbreaker! 
- It's there!

647
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,120
Now the whole world's in love with you.

648
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,320
Paul's gingerbread chest will be decorated with personal memoirs,

649
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,520
including iced images of himself as a Coldstream Guard.

650
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,480
I look forward to breaching that high-security box imminently.

651
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,680
- HE LAUGHS 
- High-security biscuit box!

652
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,120
The box is going to be made of gingerbread

653
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,960
and I'm going to use royal icing to stick them together

654
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,680
and I'm going to flood the whole sides with royal icing.

655
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,280
Alvin plans to fill his ornate gingerbread casket

656
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,360
with 36 brandy snaps.

657
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,480
It's a bit worrying, but you've got to take some risks, I think.

658
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,600
Seven of the bakers have chosen to build their boxes

659
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,320
out of a gingerbread-style base.

660
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,760
Once it's baked, it's quite strong and quite sturdy,

661
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,160
so it holds really well.

662
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,480
Urgh!

663
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,280
The basic dough is a mixture of flour, butter, sugar and syrup.

664
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,720
This is the yummy treacle going in.

665
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,440
Just have to let this drip in.

666
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,440
The trick is to get the right texture so that, once baked,

667
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,840
it will be robust enough to hold three dozen identical biscuits.

668
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,080
A bit more softer consistency than this, really -

669
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,000
that's what I'm looking for.

670
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,920
It's got to not be soggy, it's got to be very crisp.

671
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,320
- Morning, Nadiya. 
- Hi. 
- Hi, Nadiya.

672
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,440
Nadiya, tell us all about your biscuit box.

673
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,720
So, I'm doing a ginger and cayenne pepper box,

674
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,440
so it's a rounded box...

675
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,800
Well, that's what I'm going to try and attempt to do.

676
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,600
And are you going to decorate the top?

677
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,040
Yeah, I'm going to use sort of the traditional Chinese colours

678
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,200
that bring good luck, so red and gold mainly.

679
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,000
That's why I chose cayenne pepper, cos it's kind of red and spicy.

680
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,600
A really dramatic kind of look you're going for, isn't it?

681
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,000
- Yeah, I'm all about the drama. 
- SHE LAUGHS

682
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,680
To go inside her oval gingerbread vessel,

683
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,800
Nadiya plans to make 36 fortune cookies,

684
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
filled with words of wisdom.

685
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,960
Can I take one? Do you mind?

686
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,520
Can I read one?

687
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,200
It says here, "The male judge will soon be superfluous."

688
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,680
THEY CHUCKLE

689
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,040
It's like a gingerbread but it's not got any ginger in it,

690
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,840
it's sort of a gingerbread-type. I don't know what else to call it.

691
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,000
"Anise bread" sounds a bit... That sounds even more pretentious!

692
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,720
Tamal has flavoured his structural biscuit with star anise.

693
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,080
Chequered shortbreads will nestle inside.

694
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,720
It's supposed to be like a French jewellery box,

695
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,000
or games box.

696
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,400
There's an idea up here that kind of makes sense.

697
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,440
Two of the bakers are making their containers out of shortbread.

698
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,760
This is my honey and lemon dough.

699
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,720
Flora's will take the form of an Indian tea chest,

700
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,840
laden with Earl Grey tea-infused biscuits.

701
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,600
I've got enough for some extras

702
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,680
in case I have a crack or anything goes disastrously wrong.

703
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,120
I'm intrigued by this. Did you make this?

704
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,800
I did, yes, I got some bent aluminium sheets

705
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,120
and the shortbread gets wrapped around here,

706
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,400
and then this goes around the outside

707
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,640
and then it's baked like that

708
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,000
and then it all comes out as a complete cylinder.

709
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,520
It's all about making sure the heat gets all the way around.

710
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,760
You could have one part burnt and the other half raw.

711
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,200
- Yeah, exactly. In my oven at home, it's OK. 
- OK.

712
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,480
Ian's "Sandwich de la Confiture"

713
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
will hold 36 macarons.

714
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,960
A further 23 will adorn his shortbread case.

715
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,120
I always stick a chunk in the middle

716
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,720
and that helps me indicate when the sides are done

717
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,280
once it's all wrapped up.

718
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,160
I've got my templates.

719
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,800
I came up with this idea of the slot effect...

720
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,920
..and a colleague...

721
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,360
A couple of colleagues at work helped me perfect it.

722
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,840
Sandy is the only baker going savoury.

723
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,000
Inside her sundried tomato and oregano hamper

724
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,520
will be 36 Parmesan rounds filled with cream cheese.

725
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,680
I'm going to market these templates.

726
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,120
I'm going in to production,

727
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,800
It's going to put Bradford on the map, is this box.

728
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,600
As you can see, I've got a very high-tech template

729
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,000
that I made at home.

730
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,240
SHE CHUCKLES

731
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,200
I'm making the base of the box.

732
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,400
I'm just going to shape it round this bowl.

733
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,080
I'm slightly regretting making such a ridiculously-shaped box

734
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,280
for my biscuits.

735
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,400
Matt is attempting to create a gingerbread fire engine

736
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,520
to carry his Earl Grey tea biscuits.

737
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,000
He's making the windows from crushed and melted boiled sweets.

738
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,880
No, I'm sure I'll feel better when I...

739
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,360
When it's all in the oven...

740
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,880
I'll be all right, I think.

741
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,080
I've covered them with a piece of parchment

742
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,880
and then put another tray on top,

743
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,960
because it could rise up too much

744
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,520
and not fit in together and just not really be a box.

745
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,920
Please work.

746
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,880
The bakers will be judged equally on their edible box

747
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,160
and the batch of biscuits inside.

748
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,600
For these, Mary and Paul

749
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,800
are looking for uniformity and unusual flavours and styles -

750
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,200
nothing less than biscuit brilliance.

751
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,560
- Good morning. 
- Good morning.

752
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,640
So, Marie, tell us all about your box of biscuits.

753
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,840
My biscuits are going to be shortbread.

754
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,520
We expect you, from Scotland, to be making shortbread.

755
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,600
- Shortbread, of course! 
- No pressure.

756
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,960
Marie's shortbreads will be flavoured with orange and cinnamon

757
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,240
and decorated with piped white chocolate,

758
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,360
her second attempt in two days.

759
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,680
I think they'll be all right -

760
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,000
a nice bite to it, but melt-in-the-mouth hopefully.

761
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,120
SHE CHUCKLES

762
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,680
Today, I am making something Lithuanian.

763
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,920
Lithuanian cottage cheese cookies with cinnamon and sugar.

764
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,520
The cookies will be housed in a jar made from Lithuanian honey cake,

765
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:02,480
and from marshmallow fondant, Ugne will attempt to sculpt a baby

766
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,440
trying to steal them.

767
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,760
I practised. Yeah, I practised. It looked nice.

768
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,080
So hopefully nothing will fail today.

769
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,200
Just concerned about the time,

770
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,960
because of the number of brandy snaps

771
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,760
that I can cook at any given time, which is about six.

772
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,040
So, yeah, feeling the pressure.

773
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,440
Macaroons are something I have made quite a lot before.

774
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,800
Ian's making macaroons, I believe, over there.

775
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,400
I think his are pink as well.

776
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,880
These are my two-tone chequerboard shortbread,

777
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,880
so I've got an alternating lemon and chocolate dough,

778
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,800
which I'm just assembling here.

779
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,360
Right, what have we got here then?

780
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,600
- A box of frogs. 
- A box of frogs? 
- Yes.

781
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,320
- As in "mad as a..."? 
- Mad as a...

782
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,480
Cos you've got to be a little bit crazy

783
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
to put yourself through this.

784
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,760
There's only one place for amphibious shortbreads -

785
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
under a gingerbread lily pad.

786
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,200
They're flavoured with green tea and cocoa beans.

787
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,520
- You've cut them out with a stamp that makes them look a frog. 
- Yeah.

788
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,920
Do you think that's a little bit of a short cut?

789
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,920
Um...

790
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,760
potentially.

791
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,200
I'm now doing the fortune cookies.

792
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,320
I have to make three at a time,

793
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,000
so it's getting those done in time,

794
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,160
but leaving me enough time to decorate the box at the end,

795
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,520
so it's just getting those done.

796
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,760
With only a standard oven,

797
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,640
the bakers will have to prove their organizational skills

798
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,120
at mass production.

799
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,560
SHE SIGHS

800
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,520
I think they're ready. Yeah, they're looking good.

801
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,200
I think we've got something. It looks good.

802
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,920
Get in!

803
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,360
They're huge.

804
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,920
They've come up massive and I...

805
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,440
I don't know why.

806
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,040
Yep, they'll be fine.

807
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,680
Come out, come out, come out.

808
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,440
Yes, ahh!

809
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,280
Right, back in the oven. They need a couple more minutes.

810
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,400
So them's my wheels.

811
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,560
Yeah, success, I think.

812
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,280
Happy with that.

813
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,880
NADIYA GROANS

814
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,120
I shouldn't have put them in the oven.

815
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,040
SHE SIGHS

816
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,560
Just do it again.

817
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,480
Bakers, you are halfway through.

818
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,480
Right, the macaroons are going in.

819
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,000
- SANDY: 
- It's like going into battle.

820
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,000
Matt had the same idea as me.

821
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,680
We're are both doing our biscuits shaped as teabags.

822
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,440
We're going to have a biscuit tea war.

823
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,200
See what happens.

824
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,480
If I can get the fortune cookies done, I could do this,

825
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,440
I could recover it.

826
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,400
I never go down without a fight.

827
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,840
I need to join my fire engine together.

828
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,240
I've got a lot do.

829
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,160
Right, starting assembling.

830
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,120
Can't remember which side's which now!

831
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,000
I'm using a ruler for accuracy. Precision is everything.

832
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,000
It shouldn't be this puffy, really.

833
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,400
Really strange.

834
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,640
I'm shaking.

835
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,800
It's very difficult to keep something like this still.

836
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,960
- FLORA: 
- The decoration is definitely the key element in this.

837
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,400
For it to be a Showstopper, it's going to have to look good.

838
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,800
It's a bit more pink than I wanted.

839
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,080
UGNE: It's a little bit too thin, see, it's runny.

840
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,280
I'm shaking like a leaf, it's awful.

841
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,880
I've never made such a mess before in my life.

842
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,360
Mine is going to be rustic.

843
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,160
We do all that fancy stuff - mine is going to be rustic,

844
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,640
that's what it's going to be.

845
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,000
Matt, it's a fire engine.

846
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,120
Look at that!

847
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,960
Come on, come on, come on.

848
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,000
- It's nearly there, isn't it? Getting there. 
- Yes, it's incredible.

849
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,120
I'm just waiting for my box to cool.

850
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,400
I don't know, cos I can't decorate it cos it's too warm.

851
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,200
I think I'm going home.

852
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,320
Definitely.

853
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,800
OK, bakers, that's 30 minutes until I try your boxes, 30 minutes.

854
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,320
Right.

855
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,880
I've just got so many things to do.

856
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,240
I need to ice this, got brandy snaps to do.

857
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,640
So, yeah, pressure, pressure.

858
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,520
If I'm going to go down, I'm going to go down making fortune cookies,

859
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,120
that's what I'm going to do.

860
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,080
Yeah, really pleased with those.

861
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,880
They look tickety-boo.

862
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,200
I don't know how mine compare to Ian, I've not seen them.

863
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,520
I'd like to go and look, but I haven't got time.

864
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,840
- ALVIN: 
- I'm running out of time.

865
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,320
Really going behind.

866
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,040
Perfect.

867
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,520
I have to start working fast, especially with these,

868
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,960
cos they need to go back in the oven for five-minute intervals

869
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,320
just to crisp them up.

870
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,760
I mean, I'm faced now with the decision just to abandon the box.

871
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,320
I'm going to abandon the box. It's not ready.

872
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,160
I won't be able to put it together. It's still wet.

873
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,120
So I think I'm just going to concentrate on the brandy snaps,

874
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,760
at least I've got something to present them.

875
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,920
That's very, very wet white chocolate, but it'll do.

876
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,360
The thing about chocolate is it runs on its own,

877
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,920
you're not pushing it out, it just comes out.

878
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,840
They're messy. It's not very good.

879
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,200
Quite worrying that nobody else is doing savoury biscuits.

880
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,240
SHEEP BLEAT

881
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,200
Bakers, that's five minutes, until Pandora's box is opened.

882
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,120
I am making fondant baby legs.

883
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,800
It will be climbing in to the box, hopefully.

884
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,640
FLORA GROANS

885
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,200
And I've just snapped it.

886
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,960
I just... I just wrecked it.

887
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,280
I literally can't believe I did that. I'm s...

888
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,480
I'm mortified. How can I make amends?

889
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,720
Well, if I leave, you're coming with me.

890
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,960
I'll take that.

891
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,080
I've got some brandy snaps, I'm presenting them with something.

892
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,000
- TAMAL: 
- It would be funny if they didn't all fit in.

893
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,840
- PAUL: 
- There we go, can't change it now.

894
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,560
- MEL: OK, bakers... SANDY: 
- Ta-da.

895
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,920
..time is up on your Showstoppers.

896
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,000
Step away from your creations,

897
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,200
otherwise I will have to box your ears.

898
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,080
Mary and Paul have asked

899
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,240
for an architecturally impressive biscuit box

900
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:47,360
containing an intriguing and identical batch of 36 biscuits.

901
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,920
It looks great fun,

902
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,520
and you've made good macaroons.

903
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,880
Obviously the cylinder that you baked it in works,

904
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,360
which I'm impressed with.

905
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,720
PAUL GROANS

906
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,640
Let's have a look, take a few of these fellows out.

907
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,320
They all look quite perfect from here.

908
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,040
They're fantastic, really good.

909
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,280
- Let's try the box. 
- Great. Yeah.

910
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,920
- The flavour's there. 
- Great.

911
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,640
Beautiful, buttery shortbread.

912
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,520
It's a great box, that.

913
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,800
- Well done. 
- Thank you.

914
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,040
What an ambitious box you've made.

915
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,920
Doing so much, I think maybe you got a bit rushed at the end

916
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,800
- and a bit sort of panicky and that's what happens. 
- Definitely.

917
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,400
It's got a great bake on that lid.

918
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,040
The piping's very good on it.

919
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,240
I can get the tea. I thought I wouldn't, but I can.

920
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,320
It is a great bake. Thank you, Flora.

921
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,120
Tell us about your box.

922
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:04,760
The component of the box is made of gingerbread, and um...

923
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,840
Sorry.

924
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,640
Well, you had such great plans and a huge sadness

925
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,480
that you just didn't have time to put it all together.

926
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,880
It's a shame about the box,

927
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,400
but I think we need to try it first anyway.

928
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,320
It's a really beautiful flavour.

929
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,720
It's a nice biscuit.

930
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,200
I can see some absolutely smashing brandy snaps.

931
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,480
Mmm!

932
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,280
The flavour of them is so good,

933
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,240
but having a filling makes it rather wet.

934
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:44,800
But...the flavour of those things, the colour, the bake, is excellent.

935
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,080
Shame about the box.

936
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,280
Shame about the box.

937
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,040
I think the box looks quite elegant.

938
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,360
Roses look a bit... Actually, they look all right -

939
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,720
a bit thick, a bit clumsy,

940
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,520
but I think we need to look inside there.

941
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,800
I think the biscuits look quite, um...

942
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,480
..plain.

943
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm hoping the flavour comes through.

944
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,560
It's a good Scotch shortbread biscuit.

945
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,960
I'm not sure about the biscuit.

946
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,360
I think the flavours are a little bit muddled up inside.

947
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,400
We ought, really, to taste the box as well.

948
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,760
It isn't really crisp, it's a little bit soft.

949
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,720
I think it looks absolutely smashing. It's breathtaking.

950
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,480
It's a little bit of a jigsaw puzzle, and I like that.

951
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,400
I'm not getting too much sundried tomato, though.

952
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,600
Let's have a look at a few of these guys.

953
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,720
They're delicious, but they're a bit soft.

954
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,760
Biscuits look pretty good.

955
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,560
It's quite difficult to get those exactly right.

956
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,760
They're a good flavour and they are crisp all the way through.

957
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,000
I think we need to try the lid.

958
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,120
It's softened up slightly, but I'm not surprised - it's so thick!

959
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,560
The star anise comes through beautifully.

960
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,280
Checkmate. Bang on, mate.

961
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,000
Looking at it, it's really a bit over the top,

962
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,880
it's a bit garish for me.

963
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,760
The inside is quite solid. It's just the outside will soften

964
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,120
because of the icing that you've got covered in.

965
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,720
Nice flavour, though. I am getting the mixed spice.

966
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,280
Let's have a look at some of these.

967
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,120
- These are traditional, aren't they? 
- Yeah.

968
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,280
- I don't like them. 
- OK.

969
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,880
- I love them. 
- Oh!

970
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,160
They're crisp. I'm not getting much flavour there.

971
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,080
I am getting a flavour, it's just I don't like the flavour.

972
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,400
OK.

973
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,800
It's quite bitter.

974
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,080
Let's try this lid.

975
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,440
It's a nice gingerbread, but it's soft.

976
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,520
The flavour of the gingerbread is fantastic.

977
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,200
My issue is the flavour of the biscuits inside.

978
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,880
I think, obviously, we were expecting a dome.

979
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,200
There was a dome.

980
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,600
I broke it.

981
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,280
- YOU broke it? 
- I broke it.

982
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,400
OK. It does look quite plain.

983
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,360
Yeah, it was going to be decorated,

984
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,920
but it was still too warm to put anything on it,

985
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,680
but I was adamant to give you a base and some sort of a lid.

986
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,840
Wow, that heat as well.

987
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,640
That's great. I like that.

988
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,920
These fortune cookies, never seen that before on Bake Off.

989
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,840
Every one is equal.

990
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,240
Let's have a bite.

991
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,320
They're great.

992
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,760
Shame about the base, but that is...

993
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,600
Oof! That packs a punch.

994
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,280
The overall appearance is clean-cut.

995
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,560
Just really interested in seeing what happens inside.

996
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,680
They are different sizes.

997
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,680
I think you've been a little overgenerous with the filling,

998
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,960
the chocolate is rather overpowering.

999
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,760
Nice, crispy, full of flavour -

1000
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,080
- that lid is very, very good. 
- Thank you.

1001
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,600
Nice and crisp, looks fantastic.

1002
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:39,040
I mean, it looks fun. Let's see what's inside.

1003
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,120
- A lot of teabags. 
- I like that.

1004
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,760
They're an even bake.

1005
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,120
The flavour of the biscuits is good.

1006
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,520
I'm not getting the lemon, but I am getting the Earl Grey.

1007
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,600
- Let's see what the lid's like. 
- Yeah.

1008
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,920
- Beautifully crisp. 
- Is it?

1009
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,520
Tastes great, well baked. Well done, mate.

1010
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,240
Choosing a Star Baker this week will be fairly straightforward.

1011
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,480
Really?

1012
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,120
Mat's done well. I thought that fire engine was fantastic.

1013
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,200
- I think Ian did well. 
- He's had a brilliant weekend.

1014
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,320
I actually think Sandy could be up there as well.

1015
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:16,600
Her box was beautiful, but I think the other side of the coin,

1016
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,040
that is going to be a little bit more difficult.

1017
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,840
There's been a lot of erratic performances over this weekend,

1018
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,400
most notable, I think, is Dorret, who came top in technical.

1019
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,960
How do you think she fared?

1020
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,360
On Bake Off, we expect something more than just stamping out a biscuit.

1021
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,920
We certainly do.

1022
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,520
I think Alvin, you know, he never gave us a box.

1023
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,160
Yes, that is an issue, surely, for you as judges -

1024
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,760
- he didn't fulfil the brief. 
- It is.

1025
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,440
He didn't fulfil the brief, but the brandy snaps were beautiful.

1026
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,800
MEL: Marie has had a fairly tricky weekend.

1027
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,440
Marie started off quite poorly.

1028
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,160
She wasn't certainly in the top half, as far as I'm concerned,

1029
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,200
she was at the bottom on technical,

1030
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,040
and coming in to this challenge,

1031
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,560
the biscuit was quite soft and very bland.

1032
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,760
There was no specific flavour in her biscuit either that came through.

1033
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,680
It's all been very, very simple, very plain.

1034
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:09,920
She has a comfort zone and she hasn't really lifted herself out of that.

1035
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,240
Paul has also had a few tough times this weekend.

1036
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,160
Has this done enough, do you think, to redeem him?

1037
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,680
I think the box was baked beautifully,

1038
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,280
but he was tenth in the technical,

1039
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,560
right alongside Marie, although just one point ahead of her.

1040
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,560
In contention to go, I think Paul, I think Marie,

1041
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,840
and then we have to think seriously about Dorret as well.

1042
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,400
Bakers, well done.

1043
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,920
It's been a tough old weekend of biscuit-making.

1044
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,640
I've got the great pleasure in announcing Star Baker,

1045
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:55,080
and it goes to somebody who formed a very, very beautiful double act

1046
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:59,080
with rosemary. It was bold, it was beautiful.

1047
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,800
Ian, you are Star Baker, well done.

1048
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,800
Brilliant.

1049
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,720
This week, I have the short straw.

1050
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:15,240
Today, we do have to say goodbye to somebody,

1051
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,120
and that person is...

1052
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,760
..Marie.

1053
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,080
Aw. We'll really miss you, darling.

1054
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,840
- MARIE: 
- 'I am very, very proud that I was part of it all,'

1055
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,400
because it's such a high standard.

1056
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,040
And it's incredible that I was part of it.

1057
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,640
I'm amazed and delighted.

1058
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,320
I'm so sorry, Marie.

1059
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,480
It's OK. I've really enjoyed it. Don't worry.

1060
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,680
It's very sad about Marie cos I can see a very steady baker in there,

1061
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,040
but what we're looking for is someone to really push the envelope.

1062
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,520
MARY: 'When you just stick to classics,

1063
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,240
'they've got to be absolutely perfect,'

1064
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,200
but they weren't always perfect,

1065
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,200
so sadly we had to say goodbye to her.

1066
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,240
Very pleased and very relieved, to be honest with you.

1067
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,560
Yeah, I was expecting...

1068
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,400
I was expecting the worst.

1069
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,960
- IAN: 
- 'I'm just amazed that I've been picked for Star Baker.'

1070
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,080
In my village, which is 400 houses,

1071
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,480
I'm yet to win the Best Male Baker prize,

1072
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,320
and here I am getting Star Baker this week,

1073
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,520
which is just extraordinary.

1074
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,160
So I'm a little bit...

1075
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,560
I'm in shock right now, cos I was ready to go home,

1076
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,440
I was like, "Yeah, yeah, you're going to go home."

1077
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,320
But I have to come back and bake some more.

1078
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,960
I'm so scared!

1079
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,960
MEL: Next week, it's bread week.

1080
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,440
- MAT: 
- Got dough everywhere.

1081
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,640
Dough-verload!

1082
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,760
The bakers strive to stand out with speedy Signatures...

1083
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,680
He's totally copying me.

1084
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,040
..try to conquer a French classic...

1085
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,280
How hard can it be?

1086
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,960
..and attempt to create their own yeasty masterpiece.

1087
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,080
It just looks like a lot of manhandled bread.
