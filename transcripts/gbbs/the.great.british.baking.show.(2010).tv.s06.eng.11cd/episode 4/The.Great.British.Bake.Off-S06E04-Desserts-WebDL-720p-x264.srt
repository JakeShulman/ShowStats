1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,800
I'm so glad we get to film the show in the summer.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,880
Well, at least we've got these big sun visors

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,400
- to protect us from all this sun. 
- Yeah.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,560
Oh, hang on. You've got a bit of summer on you.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,680
Thank you.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,560
- Welcome... 
- BOTH: To The Great British Bake Off.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,120
- Last time... 
- They're looking like monsters.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,040
..Paul's bread week proved too much of a challenge for Dorret...

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,880
It's raw.

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,320
..and Ian triumphed.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,840
Nice little work of magic there.

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,600
..to win Star Baker for the second time in a row.

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,480
This is getting weird now.

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,560
Now...

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,280
- HE MIMICS TRUMPET 
- Oh, yes.

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,880
..it's time for dessert...

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,120
The cake stand's hot.

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,320
..with a signature that sends everyone into a wobble...

19
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,120
The right wobble would be...that.

20
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,320
..a technical challenge of crumbling construction...

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,120
It's the most feminine version of plastering you could imagine.

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,880
..and a stackable Showstopper...

23
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,520
That's going to be a bit of a pain.

24
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,720
..that might just...

25
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,320
The challenge was souffles, yeah?

26
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,400
..end in tears

27
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,040
What have I done?

28
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,040
THUNDER RUMBLES AND RAIN LASHES

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,440
- I'm cold.. 
- I'm wet

30
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,680
..and soggy.

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,880
We're alone again.

32
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,440
I guess we've got our...

33
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,800
BOTH: Just desserts.

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,560
Over the next two days,

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,840
the nine remaining bakers

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,480
will have to make a staggering 144 desserts.

37
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,400
After which, if they can still stand,

38
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,640
Mary and Paul will announce the next Star Baker

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,600
and who will have to leave the tent.

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,800
Morning, bakers. Lovely to see you all here.

41
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,640
Now, Signature Bake this morning.

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,640
Mary and Paul would love you, please,

43
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,280
to make 12 identical creme brulee.

44
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,920
Mm, finally a Signature Challenge

45
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,360
where it's OK to burn the living hell out of everything.

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,320
Now, this can be ANY flavour that you like,

47
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,280
but Mary and Paul would like you to brulee them

48
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,600
in the traditional manor.

49
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,040
None of your fancy blowtorches,

50
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,600
these have to be bruleed under a grill.

51
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,240
So, you've got two hours on your Signature Challenge, bakers.

52
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,040
- On you marks... 
- Get set... 
- BOTH: Bake.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,320
I'd rather not be at the front.

54
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,480
I'd like to hide a bit more, do you know what I mean?

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,000
It's like being at school. If you can hide at the back, fine.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,520
Get away with a lot more at the back.

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,440
To make a brulee, it's a very deceptively difficult challenge.

58
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,240
For me, a brulee has to be just set.

59
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,960
If it's over set, it's probably going to split,

60
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,640
if it's under, then it pours out like soup -

61
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,640
so, you're looking for that delicate little wobble.

62
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,920
The texture of the cooked creme should be beautifully smooth,

63
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,960
then you put that caramel topping and that sugar on top.

64
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,000
There weren't such things as blowtorches when I was young

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,640
and you did it under a grill and that was it.

66
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,680
It's tricky.

67
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,000
The bakers' first task is to make a basic custard,

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,840
by heating cream and adding it to a beaten mix of egg yolks and sugar.

69
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,040
- Good morning. 
- Morning.

70
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,160
- Good morning. - Morning, Mat. 
- Good morning.

71
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,400
So, what kind of creme brulee are you going to make?

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,560
OK, so I'm making coconut and lime creme brulee -

73
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,880
but it's quite refreshing.

74
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,400
I've tried a few and they were quite sweet and a bit sickly.

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
but I found this a bit lighter, really.

76
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
- Do you not think coconut's sweet, then? 
- It is sweet, yeah, but...

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
I just found it quite light.

78
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,640
The custard for Mat's creme brulee

79
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,680
will be garnished with candied lime peel

80
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,560
and topped with desiccated coconut.

81
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,800
What do you think's going to be the tricky part of this?

82
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,360
I think, cos I've got reasonably large ramekins,

83
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,960
getting them cooked and cooled down in time -

84
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,240
because they're quite deep.

85
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,520
It's not so much the depth,

86
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,160
it's all about the distance for the heat to penetrate to cook.

87
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,640
Yeah, I had a couple of issues

88
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,000
where they weren't as set as I would like them to have been so...

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,240
Yeah, obviously, leave them in the oven long enough,

90
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,400
- so that I can get them cool again. I think that's my main issue. 
- OK.

91
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,200
The flavours for Sandy's custard

92
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,280
are even less traditional than Mat's.

93
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,640
I'm using Pontefract cakes and lemon.

94
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,480
Well, a Pontefract cake is a little... It's a liquorice...

95
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,400
It's a little piece of liquorice like that.

96
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,640
It's really nice, I'm making them into a syrup.

97
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,640
Sandy's Pontefract cake syrup

98
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,320
will sit beneath her fresh lemon custard.

99
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,240
Why have you chosen those flavours?

100
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,840
I've grown up with liquorice

101
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,520
and, actually, the combination

102
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,040
and the subtleness of liquorice

103
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,000
against the milkiness of the cream is absolutely sublime.

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,240
- Good luck. 
- Thanks.

105
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,120
Adding hot milk or cream to cold eggs

106
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,680
should be done slowly,

107
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,360
otherwise they may cook.

108
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,680
That's the ultimate danger,

109
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,160
is not getting scrambled eggs from what you do.

110
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,280
It hasn't happened to me yet.

111
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,760
To get the perfect custard, you have to reach 80 degrees Celsius.

112
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,840
When you're eggs are cool and you put hot cream into it,

113
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,400
temperatures from boiling goes down to a perfect 80.

114
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,040
Hopefully, it's not going to fail now.

115
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,720
You know what it is like, it's always better at home,

116
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,520
but it always goes wrong in the tent.

117
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,280
Ugne's precisely heated custard

118
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,200
will be combined with a fruit flavour

119
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,160
that's a long way from home.

120
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,960
I'm putting marula fruit liqueur to flavour them.

121
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,560
Show us this unusual fruit.

122
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,920
It's marula fruit liqueur

123
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,240
which comes from marula fruit in Africa.

124
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,800
When it gets ripened on the tree, it gets... Drunken fruit, literally.

125
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,200
- It's fairly... 
- Ooh, that's very nice.

126
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,040
MARY: It smells like an Irish liqueur.

127
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,680
It's very similar to an Irish liqueur,

128
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,080
but it has this little flavour which is a bit different.

129
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,440
Share the love, Paulie. Shall we all have a little...?

130
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,800
- Do you want some milk? 
- Yes, please. Isn't that nice?

131
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Nice? It's absolutely delicious.

132
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,920
Alvin has also put his ingredients through a taste test.

133
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,560
My consultant in the hospital is one of my official tasters.

134
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,040
She tasted them and she said to me I could step back a bit with the cream

135
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,560
cos it did taste like a baked double cream,

136
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,520
which you don't want really.

137
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,960
Alvin's hospital colleagues

138
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,600
have given his vanilla and blackberry creme brulee

139
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,320
a clean bill of health.

140
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,600
Now, you're putting the blackberries in the base

141
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,200
and then the brulee mix on top of that.

142
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,680
Do you ever get any bleeding coming from the fruit into the brulee?

143
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,960
No, sir, that's why I did not cut them.

144
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,440
You're putting the brulee onto a plate...

145
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,280
Decorating with some fresh berries on top.

146
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,600
I'm still waiting for the edible pansies to come,

147
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,560
but if it doesn't, it will work, I'm sure.

148
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,760
Edible pants?

149
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,840
Edible pansies.

150
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,600
Oh, pansies. Sorry, I thought you said edible pants.

151
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,400
They are little pieces, but I left them on the train yesterday.

152
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,640
Don't leave your edible pansies on the train, Alvin.

153
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,800
Never do that.

154
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,080
Good luck, Alvin.

155
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,160
- Thank you. 
- See you.

156
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,040
The bakers who have chosen to add fruit,

157
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,920
caramel or liquorice to the base of their brulees

158
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,080
need to make sure it's cooled before adding the custard.

159
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,200
I've tried this recipe on the family and my neighbours

160
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,840
and it got a thumbs up from them,

161
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,720
so let's hope they agree with Paul and Mary.

162
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,200
Ian's pomegranate two ways creme brulees

163
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
feature seeds in his custard

164
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,000
and molasses in his base.

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,640
Pomegranate molasses,

166
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,920
I've never had that before.

167
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,360
It's quite a sharp taste, so it goes nicely against the caramel.

168
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,800
I think they literally just get the pomegranate juice

169
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,920
and boil it and boil it, and boil it,

170
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,960
- until you get a thick syrup. 
- MEL: Amazing.

171
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,120
- Interesting. 
- It's going to be fascinating to see

172
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,960
how those pomegranates work at the bottom.

173
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,080
Yeah. Just a little bit of fruitiness

174
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,600
to offset all the custard.

175
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,640
Nadiya's also putting fruit at the bottom.

176
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,080
It's something I have made before without success

177
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,520
and then not tried it again.

178
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,640
Once I practised it,

179
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,800
it was actually quite fun to do

180
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,760
and I realised the kids quite liked it, so that was good.

181
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,360
Her creme brulee is a blend of

182
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,720
English breakfast tea flavoured custard

183
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,320
on top of a traditional English jam.

184
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,960
That's just a blackberry jam and it's got fresh mint chopped into it.

185
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,840
Did it set when it got in the bottom?

186
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,400
Well, I got it up to 105 degrees and it did...

187
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,960
- Wrinkle? 
- It did wrinkle on the plate, so, yeah.

188
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
And the brulee - what are you using? What sugar?

189
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,120
Caster sugar.

190
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,560
But it'll be interesting to see what its like in the grill,

191
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,560
cos I'm used to the blowtorch method.

192
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,360
Well, not everybody's got a blowtorch.

193
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,160
Tamal's putting more than just fruit at the bottom.

194
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,320
A rhubarb compote and then little bits of stem ginger in there as well

195
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,880
and then maybe some rhubarb crisps -

196
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,520
but they haven't really worked out,

197
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,960
so I might not put them in, so don't tell anyone.

198
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,800
Tamal's doing everything to ensure his custard

199
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,840
complements his rhubarb and ginger base perfectly.

200
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,320
Now, tell us about your actual custard.

201
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,600
What's different about it?

202
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,320
The actual custard mix is a two-to-one mix

203
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,240
of double cream and creme fraiche

204
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,200
with some ginger syrup from the stem ginger, in there, as a sweetener.

205
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,440
I like the idea.

206
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,120
I think the blend of the stem ginger

207
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,000
with the rhubarb should be beautiful,

208
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,520
but it's all down to the poaching, really.

209
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,880
It is down to the poaching.

210
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,280
- I want you to have brulees, not scrambled egg. 
- Good luck.

211
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,040
- Cheers. 
- See you. 
- See you later.

212
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,200
I've practised a fair amount this week.

213
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,320
I was happy with the brulees from the beginning

214
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,840
and I did them another time, just to reassure myself,

215
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,520
so it shouldn't be too bad actually.

216
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,000
As confident an exterior as I can give.

217
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,440
Paul is scattering flaked almonds on the top of his custard

218
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,320
and flavouring it with an almond liqueur.

219
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,840
Knock it back in one, Mary.

220
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,960
It's very strong, but it's definitely strong of almonds.

221
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,240
- It's lovely. 
- I wanted the brulee to be more of an adult-themed brulee

222
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,960
with the almond liqueur in it, it was nice and subtle -

223
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,160
and it was something you could eat the whole pot

224
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,960
- without feeling it was too much, too rich. 
- Right.

225
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,280
- We look forward to it. 
- OK, thank you.

226
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,000
Before the bakers can top their brulees with a layer of caramel,

227
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,040
they need to cook the custard.

228
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,000
The traditional way is with a bain-marie.

229
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,200
Basically, it's a more gentle way of cooking them,

230
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,360
because the water can only get to 100 degrees,

231
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,760
so it means the ramekins

232
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,200
are surrounded by a bath that's at 100 degrees -

233
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,000
so they can't get any hotter than that.

234
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,560
The time between it being undercooked and overcooked...

235
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,440
The window is really small.

236
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,320
The trick of gauging if the custard is cooked,

237
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,520
is to give it a shake.

238
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,880
The wobble should be like my backside.

239
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,640
Too little time in the oven and it won't have set.

240
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,960
I got that wobble in the centre, which I'm looking for.

241
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,760
Too much time and it will turn into scrambled egg.

242
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,920
Definitely not set.

243
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,960
They're a bit over-wobbly.

244
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,400
I've got to chill them right down now.

245
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,160
- HE MIMICS TRUMPET 
- Oh, yes.

246
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,120
- How is your wobble? 
- Hot, hot, hot.

247
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,000
Your brulees that is.

248
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,040
That's perfect.

249
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,280
Where are your brulees? Where are they?

250
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,480
- In the freezer, because I had to take drastic action. 
- Why?

251
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,120
Because they were still wobbling.

252
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,000
Cos I was testing the wobble as to whether the wobble was like that.

253
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,240
What wobble you looking for?

254
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,280
Are you looking for a Kim Kardashian?

255
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,080
Are you looking for a Jessica Rabbit?

256
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,200
- What are you looking for? 
- I was going for...

257
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,960
The right wobble would be...

258
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,480
that.

259
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,720
That's a brief wobble.

260
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,440
These have got to come out.

261
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,040
Not looking good, not looking good.

262
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,480
They've not worked.

263
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,080
Did you put them in there longer, then?

264
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,960
No, same time as I always do at home, but they've not done it.

265
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,880
Are you going to put them in for longer, then?

266
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,880
No, because it's just going to burn, then, isn't it?

267
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,440
Are they supposed to crack?

268
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,400
No. You can see that, the way they've gone,

269
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,800
they've just not set at all.

270
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,840
Damn.

271
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,720
In Flora's oven, there's more than just custard to worry about.

272
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,080
I'm tuilling.

273
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,920
I'm just about on track.

274
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,280
As long as these can cook

275
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,120
and dry out in time.

276
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,680
Flora's tuille biscuits

277
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,880
will accompany her rhubarb and custard creme brulees.

278
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,200
You do know this is a creme brulee challenge?

279
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,720
I'm doing tuilles as a creme brulee challenge

280
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,800
and I'm doing rhubarb crisps as the creme brulee challenge.

281
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,280
What are these, Flora?

282
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,360
Those are a very fine pair of spectacles.

283
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,920
Or cuffs?

284
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,800
- I like my food to have multiple... 
- Just a minute, you may break them.

285
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,480
- If you break them, Mel... 
- Are these being used for your thing?

286
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,080
- Yes! 
- They weren't, maybe, going to be, but... 
- I'm so sorry!

287
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,000
I thought they were just trial runs.

288
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,120
I'm so sorry, Flora.

289
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,520
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes.

290
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,280
15 minutes, you un-brulee lot.

291
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,960
This is the bruleeing bit.

292
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,000
This makes them what they are,

293
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,200
otherwise they're just pots of creme.

294
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,480
I'm trying to evenly spread the sugar, really,

295
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,680
so it caramelises properly.

296
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,800
I'm doing it, I think, quite a different way -

297
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,840
which I think is to caramelise the sugar,

298
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,520
let it cool down and then whizz it back up into sugar

299
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,920
and then put that on top.

300
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,360
Then it just needs a short amount of time under the grill.

301
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,120
I want to put these on top of my caramels,

302
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,680
it's very cold in here, so it sets quite quick.

303
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,520
Please fit.

304
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,560
Yes! Oh, come on.

305
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,200
Under the grill, just seconds could be the difference

306
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,160
between a crisp caramel topping...

307
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,600
Burning flesh.

308
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,000
..and one that's burnt.

309
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,000
Watch them like a hawk.

310
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,760
I feel like I'm sat here like David Attenborough.

311
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,240
"If we just sit very quietly here,

312
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,640
"we'll soon see the brulees coming out."

313
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,600
Oh, nearly, nearly, nearly.

314
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,840
All cooked through nicely.

315
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,560
Nice colour, so I'm happy with that.

316
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,280
I did not caramelise them.

317
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,960
I forgot to hit the grill.

318
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,760
- You what? 
- I forgot to hit the grill.

319
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,280
Bakers, you've got two minutes left on your Signature Challenge.

320
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,760
Two minutes?

321
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,000
Don't be ridiculous.

322
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,960
Bit more.

323
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,480
All right, I've got to bring them out anyway.

324
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,280
Ah! Where am I going?

325
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,120
Where am I going?

326
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,640
Be careful.

327
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,200
OK, bakers, that's it. Time is up.

328
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,720
Please stop tinkering with your brulees now

329
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,000
and move them to the end of your benches.

330
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,880
They've got a nice snap on the top.

331
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,200
- Looks a bit grainy inside with the sugar. 
- Yeah.

332
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,840
The combination of flavours

333
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,080
is very good indeed

334
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,800
and you should be delighted that

335
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,200
that fruit at the bottom is totally separate,

336
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,160
but the one fault is that it is a little bit separated, the custard.

337
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,720
The flavour's fantastic with the cinnamon.

338
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,200
HOLLOW TAPPING That is the right amount on top.

339
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,160
- Scrambled egg. 
- As I suspected.

340
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,800
Boozy scrambled egg, but tasty.

341
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,920
PAUL COUGHS

342
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,600
- Too strong. 
- Wow, that's probably been part of the problem.

343
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,920
The alcohol.

344
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,360
It's the first brulee that's ever given me a hangover.

345
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,200
For that, I commend you, sir.

346
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,560
How pretty they look.

347
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,920
The actual caramel on the top...

348
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,240
HOLLOW TAPPING ..sounds good.

349
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,960
And the rhubarb is down at the bottom.

350
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,680
Rhubarb's at the bottom.

351
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,120
I didn't think it had set.

352
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,680
It needed another... five minutes, perhaps?

353
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,520
When you got it out, did you give it a shake?

354
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,000
A bit too much of a wobble going on.

355
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,840
That's just about the right thickness.

356
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,880
That is just set

357
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,000
and there's not a bubble in sight.

358
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,640
I think the custard is absolutely perfect.

359
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,880
Good.

360
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,000
I think the caramel is perfect.

361
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,280
However...

362
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,800
I do have issues with the pomegranate.

363
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,160
You almost ruined it by putting them down at the bottom.

364
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,960
- Right, OK. 
- Ian should stick to pomegranate one way.

365
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,880
- Yes. 
- Or no way. 
- No way. 
- HE LAUGHS

366
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,120
I can't see the gloss and shine

367
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,880
from the caramel on top.

368
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,240
Did you put the caramel on top?

369
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,880
- I did, I tell you, I ran out of time. 
- It needed longer in the oven.

370
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,120
- Yeah, I just ran out of time. 
- And you have a liquid too.

371
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,480
- I do, yeah. I thought that would be the case. 
- Bru-lake!

372
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,360
I think it's a huge mistake

373
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,760
to put desiccated coconut

374
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,240
on top of the caramel.

375
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,240
It all comes down to the bake for me,

376
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,280
- and it's just not good enough. 
- No. Absolutely. All right.

377
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,240
I think, overall, you have an issue with the graining of the caramel.

378
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,360
There's no caramel. It's just sugar on top of custard.

379
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,720
That is a set custard

380
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,800
and that is what we've been wanting.

381
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,600
Now, that holds its shape.

382
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,480
I think the flavour is delicious.

383
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,280
The custard is fantastic too.

384
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,120
I think my biggest issue, when you look at all of these,

385
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,360
- is the caramel... 
- Yes. 
- ..needed longer.

386
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,840
I can see the blackberries.

387
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,160
One or two have, perhaps, bled a little.

388
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,520
What's actually happened is it's the water coming from the fruit

389
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,760
that breaks up the custard...

390
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,640
- Right. 
- ..and that's why it looks, in parts, like scrambled egg.

391
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,200
I can see...

392
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,480
I might be wrong, but the actual custard is...

393
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,000
- Oh, dear. 
- ..hasn't set. 
- Yep.

394
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,960
- That's soup. 
- Bru-lake again.

395
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
How did you do that?

396
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,800
Well, they were in the oven for half an hour.

397
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,000
- Was it on? 
- SHE LAUGHS

398
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,560
- Half an hour? 
- Yeah.

399
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,280
When you stir a custard

400
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,880
with the liquorice,

401
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,240
it over powers it for me.

402
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,480
I like the flavour, I like liquorice -

403
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,880
but it's a shame you didn't turn the oven on.

404
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,720
I think the rhubarb is delicious,

405
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,680
it's quite sharp.

406
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,880
Blends really well with the ginger,

407
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,640
so, overall, your flavour combinations are spot on.

408
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,040
The custard - it's kept its shape.

409
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,000
It's like velvet all the way through.

410
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,600
I think that's pretty good.

411
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,080
Lovely flavours.

412
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,240
HE LAUGHS

413
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,040
- Thank you very much. 
- Thank you.

414
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,240
They really liked the flavours,

415
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,640
the custard was set just right - so, yeah, really pleased.

416
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,280
I've done 20 or 30 at home,

417
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,160
they didn't blow up like they did in the oven at home.

418
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,720
They were creamy and smooth and the flavour was fine.

419
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,520
So, what went wrong? I don't know.

420
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,000
It was on. The oven was on.

421
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,480
SHEEP BLEATS

422
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,320
The second dessert challenge is a mystery from Spain...

423
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,720
via Austria.

424
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,080
Welcome, bakers, to your fourth technical challenge.

425
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,640
A fiendish challenge set by Mary, no less.

426
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,000
Any words of advice?

427
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,200
Read the recipe thoroughly...

428
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,200
..and then try and visualise EXACTLY what it should look like at the end.

429
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,080
She's gone very New Age, hasn't she?

430
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,440
I'm going to ask you to leave now

431
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,920
and attend that intergenerational foam party in Woking

432
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,680
I know you're gagging on going to.

433
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,200
- Have a good time, guys. 
- Take it easy! 
- Foam up!

434
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,440
Remember - loads of bubble, lots of trouble.

435
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,720
So, what they would like you to do today

436
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,160
is make Mary's version

437
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,240
of Spanische Windtorte.

438
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,560
That's right.

439
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Sounds like something I went to the doctors for

440
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,440
when I was on holiday in Majorca.

441
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,440
Now, this is the mother ship

442
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,920
of the meringue cake.

443
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,960
Two types of meringue, cream,

444
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,360
strawberries and raspberries.

445
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,480
The other thing you need to know about this Spanische Windtorte is

446
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,800
it's Austrian.

447
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,400
You've got four hours on your bake.

448
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,880
- On your marks... 
- Get set.. 
- Bake!

449
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,400
Never heard of this before at all.

450
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,840
It's just because I don't know how it looks like, really,

451
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,200
and how it's supposed to look like. I can only imagine.

452
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,000
The instructions are very vague.

453
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,080
Sort of, "make this," and "make that."

454
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,000
So, you have to know how to make it.

455
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,960
Mary, what were you thinking setting this as a technical challenge?

456
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,560
Those poor bakers.

457
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,280
We are testing them on their meringue skills.

458
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,320
Cos they have to make the French meringue and the Swiss meringue

459
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,400
and be able to build this construction,

460
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,280
so it supports itself

461
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,960
and looks elegant,

462
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,560
and beautifully decorated with violets.

463
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,680
Oh, yes. Let's see what sort of cut I get in this.

464
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,320
You've got that lovely crunch as you put the knife through

465
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,480
and then the lovely softness of the cream in the middle.

466
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,600
It's just a meringue fest, isn't it?

467
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,840
Two different textures,

468
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,800
that soft marshmallowy

469
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,120
with the outer crust coming from the Swiss meringue

470
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,360
and that beautiful crunchy French meringue.

471
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,640
It's very rewarding.

472
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,560
I just hope they have read the recipe thoroughly.

473
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,920
I haven't done many Austrian desserts.

474
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,360
Is Angel Delight Austrian?

475
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,200
What's familiar is the meringue...

476
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,840
so I'm going to start from there.

477
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,080
Mary's recipe asks for the French meringue

478
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,480
to form the structure of the Windtorte.

479
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,200
I've just got to get this whisked up so it's pipeable -

480
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,560
so at least I know it's got to be pretty thick.

481
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,880
A classic mix of egg whites and sugar whisked up until stiff.

482
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,080
So, we've got to make two meringue discs to start with.

483
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,520
The caster sugar should be added a spoon at a time

484
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,280
to form a thick, glossy structure.

485
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,320
HE WHISTLES

486
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,200
The layers must be evenly piped if they're to stack neatly.

487
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,800
It doesn't say anything about

488
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
how tall your rings should be,

489
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,640
which is a bit worrying,

490
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,560
but I want them to be fairly tall.

491
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,400
Timing and temperature are critical.

492
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,640
Overbaked meringue will crack and lose its white sheen.

493
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,080
I'm totally praying every time I put something in.

494
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,880
Every time I put something in, I'm fully praying.

495
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,520
It just says, "make violets." 13 violets.

496
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,280
Violet, violet, violet...

497
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,080
I'm trying to remember what a violet looks like.

498
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,800
The last couple of days, I've been looking into edible flowers.

499
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,320
Not a violet, unfortunately.

500
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,760
Have you ever seen a violet?

501
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,000
I think it's a flower.

502
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,760
They're crumbling.

503
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,600
It's probably cracked a bit more than I thought. It just gets messy.

504
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,320
Put two meringue rings, one by one, on top of this.

505
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,280
So, these have got to stack on top of that with extra meringue on it.

506
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,160
That's going to be a bit of a pain.

507
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,640
The Windtorte's fragile foundations

508
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,480
should be cemented and coated

509
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,760
with the remaining French meringue.

510
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,960
It's the most feminine version of plastering

511
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,880
you could imagine, isn't it?

512
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,640
"Bake the shell and the REMAINING meringue disc AGAIN."

513
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,840
It doesn't say, "Take it off the cake stand."

514
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,200
Each time it goes in the oven,

515
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,600
the risk of a ruined meringue is increased.

516
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,160
Following the instructions, I'm making...

517
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,720
..Swiss meringue for the decoration

518
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,880
and I just whisk it over the hot water.

519
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,360
Swiss meringue must be heated gently as it's mixed

520
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,960
to give it its distinctive marshmallowy middle.

521
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,320
Well, I've whisked up the egg whites and the sugar over a bain-marie.

522
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,240
It's got to reach 70 degrees centigrade.

523
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,920
You've got to have a good consistency,

524
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,080
but you've got to make sure the sugar's dissolved.

525
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,240
Once it's got to 70 degrees, you take it off and then,

526
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,680
I think, as far as I know,

527
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,640
you keep whisking it until it's really cooled down quite a lot.

528
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,560
I'm trying to get it quite thick and glossy, I guess.

529
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,160
Just like a Labrador.

530
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,240
Bakers, you've got one hour left on the clock.

531
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,720
The cake stand's hot.

532
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,160
SHE LAUGHS

533
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,000
"Pipe a decorative border about the base, middle

534
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,080
"and top of the meringue shell

535
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,160
"and around the edge and middle of the remaining disc."

536
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,640
Right.

537
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,520
When it comes to piping, it's all about precision.

538
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,480
Mary and Paul will be looking for a neat, ornate finish.

539
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,360
I'm making the lid.

540
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,000
If I decorate that up,

541
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,160
then I just lift it up

542
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,040
and it should be slightly...

543
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,600
SHE EXHALES SHARPLY

544
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,080
OK, bakers, gale force warning.

545
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,560
Windtorte in 30 minutes, thank you.

546
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,000
Windtorte in 30.

547
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,400
SHE MIMICS TRUMPET NOTE

548
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,840
OK, it's soft...

549
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,920
- Still... 
- OK. Keep it shut, keep it shut. Let's leave it in there.

550
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,320
I want to see happy Alvin.

551
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,160
I'm going to bring it up to 150.

552
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,640
Is that wise?

553
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,600
Let's be brave.

554
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,280
Look at that.

555
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,720
Setting aside their meringues to cool...

556
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,280
- These are piddly little strawberries, aren't they? 
- Yeah.

557
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,400
..the bakers have to whip up a cream and fruit filling,

558
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,720
being careful not to let it curdle.

559
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,960
So, now I've gone and over-beaten the cream.

560
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,040
A pretty simple step in the process.

561
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,840
Burned it a little bit, but there you go.

562
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,480
SHE MIMICS BELL RINGING Meringue, my lord?

563
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,920
You've got two minutes to go, bakers.

564
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,160
Two minutes to go.

565
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,240
Does it say "V?"

566
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,440
No, it says, "Fill the meringue case with a shell,

567
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,280
"top with the meringue disc."

568
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,360
It doesn't say HOW.

569
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,360
Well, a disc tends to be a flat disc.

570
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,560
Very shaky.

571
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,120
- IN FAUX AUSTRIAN ACCENT: 
- The Spanische Windtorte challenge is over, my darlings.

572
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,520
Please bring up your delicious meringues

573
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,800
and pop them behind the photos of yourself. Well done.

574
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,240
Well done, guys.

575
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,920
Mary and Paul are looking for

576
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,720
crisp rings of French meringue stacked high,

577
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,280
neatly piped Swiss meringue decoration

578
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,120
and delicate fondant violets.

579
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:55,520
These Windtortes should be an extravaganza of beautiful meringue,

580
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,000
decorated with delicate little violets.

581
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,240
OK, shall we start from this side, Mary?

582
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,680
Interesting lid.

583
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,400
Not that easy to cut into this.

584
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,120
It tastes very good

585
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,040
and there are very good, crisp layers of the French meringue.

586
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,680
- The Swiss meringue is a little bit too sticky... 
- It's tacky.

587
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,640
..but it's got a great shine to it, though.

588
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,280
The violets are a little bit clumsy.

589
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,240
This one looks quite neat, doesn't it? Uniform. Very pretty.

590
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,800
I would say the violets were different, but they're all even.

591
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,840
- It does taste very, very good. 
- It tastes lovely.

592
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,400
I do like the French meringue.

593
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,640
That's delicious.

594
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
Now, this is a real giant

595
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,200
and this is the first one that we've got slightly more delicate violets.

596
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,720
There's a lot of layers in this as well.

597
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,680
Tastes great.

598
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,240
The French meringue is beautifully crisp.

599
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,760
Both meringues are delicious.

600
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,080
Moving on...a bit of contemporary art there, Mary.

601
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,480
It's got a good height to it as well and it is fairly even.

602
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,520
Both meringues are very, very good. They taste great.

603
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,880
It looks the part.

604
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,560
Now, this one looks more like something my nan makes.

605
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,280
It's been in the oven a little bit too long and turned it ivory.

606
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,240
And the little violets are a little bit different.

607
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,560
They are almost indistinguishable

608
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,880
between the French and Swiss meringues.

609
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,040
You don't really notice a difference, do you?

610
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,560
It's been dried out a little too much.

611
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,520
This is very neat, isn't it?

612
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,080
It's a very good height

613
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,360
and a very good attempt of the little flowers.

614
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,640
Both meringues are good.

615
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,120
I'm not convinced about the French meringue.

616
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,960
I think it's a little on the chewy side,

617
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,880
but the whole effect is very good.

618
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,400
It's very skilfully done.

619
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,480
Right, I like this one. Quite neat.

620
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,000
Very elegant too.

621
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,600
It's only showing us one style of piping.

622
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,600
The French meringue is firm

623
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,920
and the Swiss meringue is a little bit soft.

624
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,440
Mm. Yeah, they are.

625
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,800
This is a little bit of a mess.

626
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,880
The French meringue is crisp,

627
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,000
but it's a little bit chewy in the middle.

628
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,760
The Swiss meringue is very, very sticky.

629
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,240
It needed longer in the oven.

630
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,440
The thing that let it down is the Swiss meringue.

631
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,280
It's the mixing of it and the piping of it. It doesn't look very good.

632
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,360
The last one.

633
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,760
Nice and straight.

634
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,360
The flowers are all different sizes.

635
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,400
They've had a problem with the Swiss meringue.

636
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,720
See the way it's mixed and split again? It looks rough.

637
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
It is dry.

638
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,840
The French meringue is marshmallowy

639
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,880
in the middle like a pavlova.

640
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,520
Not quite dried out enough

641
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,000
and the Swiss meringue is done beautifully -

642
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,080
apart from maybe a little bit over-mixed.

643
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,760
But whose Windtorte has blown Mary and Paul away?

644
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,960
In ninth place is this one.

645
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,560
A little overbaked and too dried out.

646
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,800
Eighth place is this one.

647
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,200
It needed longer in the oven.

648
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,120
It's very, very sticky inside. Cream was slightly over whipped.

649
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,480
Mat is seventh,

650
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,720
Sandy - sixth,

651
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,960
Tamal - fifth

652
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,840
and Ian is fourth.

653
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,400
And in third place, this one.

654
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,200
Very good height here and we had lovely flowers.

655
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,720
In second place is...

656
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,560
..this one, well done.

657
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,320
The French meringue is good, the Swiss meringue's not bad at all.

658
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,160
And in first place...

659
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,480
APPLAUSE Well done.

660
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,920
This was a good height,

661
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,640
you made a good attempt at the flowers,

662
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,040
there's a good flavour.

663
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,400
We enjoyed it. Well done.

664
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,760
Thank you.

665
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,000
First. Complete shock.

666
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,040
Stroke of luck.

667
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,120
Technicals have been really good so far, actually.

668
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,760
I've had two seconds and a third, so that's...

669
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,560
And a sixth, but we won't talk about that.

670
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,160
I produced what they wanted, just the ugly version.

671
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,760
The pressure gets to you in there and you kind of forget...

672
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,040
"Slow down" and it still has to look pretty.

673
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,640
So, yeah, I'm learning every week.

674
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,160
I've got one more challenge for tomorrow,

675
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,680
but it needs to be absolutely perfect,

676
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,760
I think, tomorrow for me not to exit.

677
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,520
One dessert challenge remaining.

678
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,160
At the end of two challenges,

679
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,680
who do you think's looking good?

680
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,240
I think Ian is having a strong week.

681
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,920
Off the back of being Star Baker twice,

682
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,680
he's doing really well this week too.

683
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,320
He doesn't get fazed, it seems.

684
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,120
I think Tamal had a good day.

685
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,480
His Signature was very good.

686
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,760
Ugne, I think she did very well.

687
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,760
- Who is in trouble? 
- Mat.

688
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,640
Although his custard was different with the coconut,

689
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,000
I didn't like the coconut on top.

690
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,360
And Sandy...

691
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,000
Well, you could pour her custard. It was pouring custard.

692
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,760
- I did. I poured it into my mouth. 
- It certainly hadn't set so...

693
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,160
Alvin was ninth in the technical.

694
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,280
Bit of a shock, because Alvin's normally on it

695
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,080
and he didn't bake very well on his Signature, his brulee.

696
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,880
Nadiya really did go from top to bottom and bottom to top.

697
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,200
Nadiya, in her Signature, the bake was pretty good

698
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,160
and then, in the technical, she came eighth.

699
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,560
Paul and his brulee, scrambled egg inside -

700
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,480
and yet, in the technical, he came first.

701
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,880
It all seems a bit muddly.

702
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,640
- As if anything could happen to anyone, is that right? 
- Yes.

703
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,480
For today's Showstopper challenge,

704
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,720
Paul and Mary would very much like you

705
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,320
to bake a towering tin-ferno of baked cheesecakes.

706
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,040
Now, they are expecting at least three tiers,

707
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,840
decorate them any which way you like,

708
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,320
they can be any shape you want,

709
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,480
but they should be sweet, not savoury, please.

710
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,080
And you've got four-and-a-half hours, so on your marks...

711
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,160
- Get set... 
- Bake.

712
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,040
With cheesecakes, lots of things can go wrong.

713
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,000
I like cheesecakes but baked ones, I've never really dabbled into.

714
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,640
There's a lot more processes to do with a baked cheesecake.

715
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,000
You have a lot more watching in the oven, a lot more time,

716
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,040
whereas a cold set one is in the fridge overnight

717
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,520
and ready the next day whenever you need it.

718
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,560
I don't think I put down on my list

719
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,840
of what temperature to put the oven on.

720
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,560
Most of the bakers are making a biscuit base

721
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,600
by mixing flour, butter and sugar.

722
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,040
There's different types of bases

723
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,800
they can choose on a cheesecake, really.

724
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,640
You've got pastry and you've got biscuit.

725
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,920
I don't mind any of them as long as it's good and even, and consistent.

726
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,800
So, we're really throwing it at them this time.

727
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,560
Three different cheesecakes,

728
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,040
three different sizes,

729
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
three different baking times.

730
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,120
Quite difficult.

731
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,840
Today, I'm making a trio of spicy and herby cheesecakes.

732
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,320
So, some... I don't know, maybe some slightly risque flavours.

733
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,400
Ian's trio of cheesecakes will include

734
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,760
Sichuan peppercorns, rosemary and tarragon.

735
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,640
- Good morning, Ian. 
- Morning, morning.

736
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,680
Interesting. Apple and tarragon?

737
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,160
It's one that surprised me.

738
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,080
I mean bananas and basil go quite well together.

739
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,880
- OK. 
- There are a few things which can go, fruits and herbs,

740
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,520
but it's a bit of alchemy going on for me today in these three bakes.

741
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,800
That's quite adventurous.

742
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,720
Yeah.

743
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,760
Ian isn't alone in his adventure with herbs.

744
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,200
I'm doing honey and rosemary. I can't remember what he...

745
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,320
He's not doing just plain rosemary, it's with something else.

746
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,200
So, hopefully they'll be different enough

747
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,000
that they won't be making direct comparisons.

748
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,040
Tamal's rosemary and honey cheesecake

749
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,280
will be stacked under layers of hazelnut praline and mango -

750
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,440
but it's not a challenge he's particularly

751
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,760
been looking forward to.

752
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,520
For you, what is the most difficult part of this?

753
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,720
The bake on the mango cheesecake has been quite tricky.

754
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,080
The mix has got quite a lot of egg in it,

755
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,840
but getting the set just right has been a little bit tricky,

756
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,280
- so that's the one I'm... 
- So, we'll watch out for that one.

757
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,600
- Shouldn't have told you that, should I? 
- Shouldn't.

758
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,160
- Eagle eyes. 
- Damn. 
- Thank you very much, indeed.

759
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,960
So, with this one, what I'm aiming for...

760
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,000
Why I'm doing everything by hand is...

761
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,920
When I hold it together,

762
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,080
if I prod, it should, sort of, collapse.

763
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,880
If it's too loose, it means I need to add some more butter.

764
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,560
On top of Alvin's crumbly bases

765
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,400
will be blueberry, mixed berry

766
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,040
and lemon meringue cheese.

767
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,960
What was your inspiration for all of this?

768
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,200
They are cheesecakes that my family love.

769
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,480
This one is for my son -

770
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,920
the blueberry one, he loves.

771
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,000
He'll take a slice, he'll have a go at it.

772
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,200
The lemon has got to be for my wife,

773
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
because she loves anything with lemon,

774
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,960
and the middle one is for my daughter, who is fond of berries.

775
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,800
Are you going to be all right for time?

776
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,680
I'm hoping so, that's why I really want to go in now and go in there.

777
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,320
OK, because it's all about getting the toppings on cool and...

778
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,120
Yes, absolutely, and I'm having trouble with times lately, so...

779
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,320
OK. Yes, you have.

780
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,640
Paul, Ugne, Sandy and Nadiya

781
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,040
are all baking pastry bases.

782
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,840
I tried a biscuit base,

783
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,280
where you make the biscuits, crush them and stick them in.

784
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,120
In terms of flavour, I think they took away

785
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,040
from the actual cheesecakes themselves.

786
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,960
Nadiya has taken inspiration from her kids' parties

787
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,720
in the creation of her fizzy pop cheesecakes,

788
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,320
flavouring them with ginger beer,

789
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,600
lemonade and cream soda.

790
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,480
Cream soda cheesecake - how are you achieving that flavour?

791
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,720
I've got some syrups that I've taken litres of pop

792
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,840
and reduced them down for about ten hours, 12 hours.

793
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,920
You boiled down these three fizzy pops to create syrups?

794
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,360
Yep, and so I'm going to use the syrups on top.

795
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,480
- Can I smell one? 
- Yeah, go ahead.

796
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,440
Clever. Very, very clever.

797
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,200
What made you think of this idea?

798
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,240
I just wanted to do something a little bit fun.

799
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,480
And then I'm going to create the illusion of

800
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,600
a can of pop levitating above it

801
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,160
with Italian meringue pop that will kind of fizz down,

802
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,960
and then it will have...

803
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,600
..crystallised ginger and lemon, and white chocolate...

804
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,280
You do know this is only a four-and-a-half hour challenge.

805
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,840
- I know. 
- You've got to go and work.

806
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,400
- Good luck. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you.

807
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,240
I do like making pastry, yeah.

808
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,720
It's very therapeutic.

809
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,760
You can sit here and watch the world go by.

810
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,000
You don't have to look at it,

811
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,560
you just keep rubbing away until you get your breadcrumbs.

812
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,040
Paul's filling the short crust pastry bases

813
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,000
of his berry cheesecake tower

814
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,720
with blackberries, blueberries

815
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,280
and raspberries.

816
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,760
He's also adding a nip of his

817
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,480
home-made blackberry liqueur.

818
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,840
I like the idea of your liqueur going into it.

819
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,760
Did you make that like sloe gin with a bit less sugar?

820
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,600
It's just blackberries condensed down with sugar.

821
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,040
So, you cooked the blackberries?

822
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,040
Cooked the blackberries with the sugar

823
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,320
to get some of the bitterness out of it,

824
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,440
then mix in brandy and vodka...

825
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,280
Party time.

826
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,600
I'm out on the lash now.

827
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,000
When I make cheesecakes, for me,

828
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,720
to keep cheesecake shape is better when they have...

829
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,760
sides as well as a bottom.

830
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,440
In true Ugne style,

831
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,600
she's covering her lime, coconut and hazelnut cheesecakes

832
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,320
with an adventurous

833
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,760
multicoloured cream cheese frosting.

834
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,080
I don't want to go over the top with the decoration.

835
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,280
- I have something in mind... 
- Right.

836
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,520
I want to do ombre-style frosting.

837
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,640
- A what, sorry? 
- Ombre? Is that, sort of, Mexican?

838
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,640
I've never heard of ombre, have you?

839
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,480
I think women have more heard of ombre hair dye,

840
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,400
which goes shades lighter on the hair, so it's kind of...

841
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,160
Yeah, you know that one, Mary.

842
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,600
- Careful. 
- How dare you! That's all real.

843
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,560
Every bit.

844
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,080
- Thank you. 
- Thank you.

845
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
Blind baking the bases first

846
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,360
should help prevent the cheese mix leaking later.

847
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,520
When you're at competition level,

848
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,440
you've got to get it right.

849
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,560
I don't want Mary and Paul saying I haven't tried.

850
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,400
I want them to say, "This base is so beautifully crisp and buttery."

851
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,800
Sandy's making two different shortbread pastry bases

852
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,040
and three individually flavoured cheesecake fillings.

853
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,800
All the cheesecakes are a different...

854
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,120
recipe. There is ricotta in the cassata for authenticity,

855
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,160
there is sour cream in the apple pie one

856
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,400
and there is double cream...

857
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,840
You don't think... You're going for different bases,

858
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,280
- different fillings, different toppings. 
- I have a theme.

859
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,440
Do you? What's the theme -

860
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,880
how to make things really complicated for yourself?

861
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,000
It's a take on New York

862
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,800
and the Italians and Irishmen...

863
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,320
So, this is a meditation on immigration?

864
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,000
I like that.

865
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,640
- I'll eat it. 
- Good.

866
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,800
A basic cheesecake mix is made of cheese, sugar and eggs.

867
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,360
I'm adding one egg at a time

868
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,520
and making sure that everything is incorporated properly.

869
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,360
While Sandy is making life complicated,

870
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,480
Flora is keeping things simple.

871
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,480
Today, I am making elderflower cheesecake,

872
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,120
which I'm a bit concerned about,

873
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,600
because I'm the only one that's only doing one flavour.

874
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,200
All three of Flora's cheesecakes

875
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,720
will have the same base

876
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,160
and will all be flavoured with her home-made elderflower cordial.

877
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,400
- Can I confirm something? 
- Yeah.

878
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,520
You've done all your cheesecakes.

879
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,120
I have done all my cheesecakes.

880
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,080
I sense you're feeling a bit deflated?

881
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,400
Are you now worried you're just doing one flavour?

882
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,840
I am very concerned that everybody's going all out, so...

883
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,160
It's down to a good bake,

884
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,240
a good cheesecake,

885
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,640
good density,

886
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,680
- good finish. 
- Yeah, not a lot really(!)

887
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,600
That's fine, yeah, that's easy(!)

888
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,360
Whilst Flora's cheesecakes are already in the oven,

889
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,720
everyone else's bases are only just coming out.

890
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,280
Couple of minutes more.

891
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,160
I'm trying to think if I can make it any more exciting or...

892
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,480
..jazz it up a bit. I don't know if I can.

893
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,880
It is a bit simple.

894
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,480
I wonder if I could do any white chocolate work or...

895
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,280
do anything to go on the top.

896
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,520
I don't really know. I feel like there should be something else.

897
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,080
My mixes are ready to go into their base.

898
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,080
I've just got to make sure I get the right mix in the wrong... Right base.

899
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,440
"Right mix in the wrong base."

900
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,080
Mat is using flavours of his favourite chocolate bars

901
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,640
to create his cheesecake stack,

902
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,720
including peanut butter, coconut and honeycomb.

903
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,920
So, I've got a peanut butter and chocolate,

904
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,200
a coconut

905
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,560
and the end one is a honeycomb.

906
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,560
This is your honeycomb. It looks very good too.

907
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,960
And you've made that, and what are you going to do with it?

908
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,040
Some of that's going to go through this one.

909
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,480
So, I'll chop it quite finely.

910
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,320
It's quite weird when it bakes, it almost explodes a little bit

911
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,360
as you bake it, but you still get the flavour.

912
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,520
Now, Mary, she's a bit nervous about coconut.

913
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,400
I love coconut. I think coconut's amazing.

914
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,160
There's nothing to be scared of, Mary.

915
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,920
I've grown to like coconut.

916
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,600
I think refreshing is the wrong thing to say for a cheesecake,

917
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,200
but it's quite light, it's not heavy.

918
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,560
Like, the peanut butter one is quite dense, obviously,

919
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,640
cos that's what I've went for but, yeah, the coconut lifts it up.

920
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,400
Now we're going in the oven.

921
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,120
Once these are baked and cooled,

922
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,560
I will slice the tops off.

923
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,760
That will hopefully neaten the edges,

924
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,600
making them a little bit prettier.

925
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,640
I think I'm the only one doing this, but...

926
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,400
I've just always made cheesecakes in a bain-marie.

927
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,640
It's doing it for the same reason really

928
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,360
that I did it with the creme brulee,

929
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,400
is you're supposed to get a gentler cook.

930
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,880
With cheesecakes in the ovens,

931
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,360
the bakers can concentrate

932
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,440
on show stopping decorations.

933
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,520
I am showing off a little bit with the leaves.

934
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,480
Just a finishing touch on the top with the berries. Nice combination.

935
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,480
This is Italian meringue.

936
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,040
I'm trying to create the fizz that comes out of the pop can.

937
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,600
That's going to be the main decoration on my tier cheesecakes.

938
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,680
I'm skewering these hazelnuts

939
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,160
and then they're going to be dipped in caramel

940
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,360
and left to hang, so the caramel drips off in shards.

941
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,440
These are going to be my crystallised

942
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,680
ginger and lemon bubbles.

943
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,320
I'm going to have them cascading down the side

944
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,400
of my Italian meringue foam out of my levitating...

945
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,560
- SHE LAUGHS 
- ..candy.

946
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,640
Oh, my God. What have I done?!

947
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,120
Flora is still worried she hasn't quite done enough.

948
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,840
I was just a bit scared to give myself too much to do.

949
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,760
She's decided to decorate her simple elderflower cheesecakes

950
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,320
with macarons.

951
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,720
I've never done this to time,

952
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,440
so I think I, maybe, overestimated how long it would take.

953
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,920
I'm worried they are going to say,

954
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,080
"What have you done with four-and-a-half hours?"

955
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,800
Bakers, you've got one hour left on the clock

956
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,480
until we want to see 27 tiers.

957
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,840
On the benches,

958
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,680
not rolling down your cheeks, please.

959
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,360
I think the consistency's gotta be just like a slight wobble

960
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,040
when you're bringing it out the oven,

961
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,720
but then it sets down in the fridge. That's the plan anyway.

962
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,520
Yep, definitely needs longer.

963
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,200
I think that looks pretty good.

964
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,800
I think it has a nice little wobble in the middle.

965
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,280
We're back to wobbles.

966
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,920
If it's not that...it's that.

967
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,480
We're all right with that.

968
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,080
So, one souffle.

969
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,160
That's what it was?

970
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,920
The challenge was souffles, yeah?

971
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,240
I'd like to leave them in there with the door open, but I can't.

972
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,800
The ideal situation is turn the oven off, have the door open

973
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,560
and leave them for at least another hour.

974
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,920
We haven't got that luxury.

975
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,480
But you are in danger of, obviously,

976
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,280
cooling them down too quick and getting the cracks on the top...

977
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,400
which I don't want.

978
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,680
If they are warm, I can't stack them.

979
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,560
If they are warm, the ganache won't set.

980
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,200
It's a bit tricky, cos I don't want to put the chocolate on

981
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,720
until they are all stacked,

982
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,080
but I don't want to stack them until they are cold.

983
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,040
So, it's a bit of a sort of catch 22, really.

984
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,320
OK.

985
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,960
It's all right so far. I like the look of them all right.

986
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,800
Oh!

987
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,520
I might just leave it to cool a little bit longer.

988
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,840
This is about to get tech.

989
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,840
It's just breaking.

990
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,080
What if you, like, go without and just splodge out?

991
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,800
Er... Pretty possibly.

992
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,160
SHE GROANS

993
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,760
Five minutes, bakers.

994
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,400
Just five minutes.

995
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,200
I think it's OK.

996
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,400
SHE LAUGHS

997
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,000
Time is up. Step away from your bakes, please.

998
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,640
- This ain't going to do it. 
- Hmm?

999
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,480
- This isn't going to do it. 
- Why not?

1000
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,720
It's just going to... No.

1001
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,960
- OK. 
- That's it.

1002
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,640
INDISTINCT WHISPERING

1003
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,240
It's judgment time.

1004
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,840
- Ian, do you need a hand or are you OK? 
- I should be OK.

1005
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,280
It looks absolutely stunning.

1006
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,080
It would be a centrepiece of the table.

1007
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,840
You've got a very nice line round the outside here.

1008
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,800
Just a gentle browning.

1009
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,320
It's a beautiful flavour, it's lovely.

1010
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,520
When have I ever had tarragon and apple?

1011
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,880
And I like it.

1012
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,160
The flavour of the pecan salted caramel

1013
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,880
with the rosemary... is exceptional.

1014
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,720
That is sheer heaven on a plate.

1015
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,000
Fantastic flavour.

1016
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,400
I'm not getting the peppercorns, though.

1017
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,280
These chocolate leaves are lovely.

1018
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,800
Well done. Is that pastry or...?

1019
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,840
It's pastry base all the way through, yes.

1020
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,480
It's overbaked. The consistency is not creamy, it's quite dry.

1021
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,040
All the moisture's been taken out of it during the baking.

1022
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,760
You could have brought it out five or ten minutes earlier.

1023
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,240
Is this the same or a totally different mixture?

1024
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,760
It's the same cheese mixture.

1025
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,880
It's always very difficult to put things like blackberries

1026
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,600
into a mixture because this,

1027
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,080
having had a long bake,

1028
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,720
it is beginning to bleed into the actual cheesecake.

1029
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,400
Right, let's get into the bottom. Same mixture again.

1030
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,080
It's a shame, it's overbaked and quite dry.

1031
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,760
Now, you've made the same one on each one, haven't you?

1032
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,880
So, I might just go straight for the middle one.

1033
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,520
It looks slightly overbaked.

1034
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,440
It's quite dark on the outside.

1035
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,720
Your base is very thick.

1036
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,840
Yeah.

1037
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,200
The elderflower comes through, it's quite delicate, but it's a bit..

1038
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,240
That had just a little bit too long cooking

1039
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,520
and it hasn't got that creamy texture.

1040
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,000
I don't think you utilised the time properly and,

1041
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
when you did, you burnt it.

1042
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,880
It is a bit of a mess, was it still hot?

1043
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,440
Warm, I think, but yes.

1044
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,000
Which wouldn't help the meringue.

1045
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,120
Your base has turned out a bit like bird seed.

1046
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,720
It just all falls apart - it's very, very crumbly.

1047
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,960
That is beautifully creamy.

1048
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,640
It could have done with just a few more minutes in the oven.

1049
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,400
Right in the middle,

1050
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,440
it's a little bit soft.

1051
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,960
A little bit clumpy, I think.

1052
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,720
- Bad time management, we'd put that down to. 
- Yeah.

1053
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,880
I love to see your caramel work

1054
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,680
and the hazelnuts with the lovely little tails going up.

1055
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,960
Look at that.

1056
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,160
That texture looks great.

1057
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,200
The flavour is lovely.

1058
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,840
The rosemary's coming through, the honey's coming through.

1059
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,240
Love the rosemary, it's so delicate.

1060
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,840
Right, next layer.

1061
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,560
Hazelnut's hit me straight away and I love it.

1062
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,200
You've got the texture right there.

1063
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,600
It's a very nice flavour, a very nice consistency.

1064
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,760
The last one.

1065
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,280
That is fantastic.

1066
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,480
I mean, really good.

1067
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,440
Mango is such a mellow flavour,

1068
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,120
but that, in there, is beautiful.

1069
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,720
Absolutely spot on.

1070
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,000
The texture's great

1071
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,440
and then you've got the beautiful sugar work on the outside.

1072
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,400
I think, overall,

1073
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,640
the piping's a little bit of a mess.

1074
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,160
I know.

1075
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,040
It's beautifully creamy,

1076
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,360
it's a lovely texture.

1077
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,480
Delicious.

1078
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,000
But let's check out the next layer.

1079
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,520
I think the texture's OK,

1080
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,520
but, for me, it's over sweet.

1081
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,080
We'll try the last one,

1082
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,400
we'll leave that where it is.

1083
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,160
It's an absolutely beautiful texture,

1084
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,960
it cuts like a knife, it holds its shape.

1085
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,360
It's beautiful.

1086
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,680
Lovely flavour. You must have rushed to get all of these three together.

1087
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,480
You almost ruined it by putting the bits on the outside.

1088
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,560
Sandy, my love, do you need a hand?

1089
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,520
Yes, please the third tier is just not on top.

1090
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,840
- Thank you. 
- There we go. 
- Well done, Sandy, my love. 
- Thanks.

1091
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,080
- There we go. 
- Well done, my love.

1092
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,480
Safe passage, Sandra.

1093
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,040
You didn't manage to get this one on the top.

1094
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,960
I tried, but there was either

1095
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,560
going to be a splodge of three

1096
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,360
or just slide.

1097
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,640
You've got that silky smooth, beautifully soft cheesecake

1098
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,080
with these quite big clumps of the...

1099
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,520
candied fruit - for want of a better word.

1100
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,160
- It's raw underneath. 
- Oh, dear.

1101
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,600
- In the middle, it's not done and it's runny. 
- Yeah.

1102
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,280
And the last one has a raw base.

1103
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,480
And it's not cooked in the middle.

1104
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,800
MEL AND SUE: Nadiya.

1105
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,680
THEY WHIMPER

1106
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,720
That looks amazing.

1107
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,600
- Very clever. Is that Italian meringue you've used? 
- Yes.

1108
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,840
Well, one thing's for sure.

1109
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,560
If you've done it in a crust like this,

1110
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,640
you know that your cheesecake isn't going to leek out, don't you?

1111
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,760
It actually tastes like cream soda.

1112
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,600
It is quite creamy, it's just a bit too dry,

1113
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,400
because it's been overbaked. The flavour you've got from it...

1114
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,680
I didn't think you could get a flavour like cream soda

1115
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,640
in a cheesecake before, that's a new one on me.

1116
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,880
- What's the bright yellow one on top? 
- That's the lemon ganache.

1117
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,120
- It's great fun. 
- Well done.

1118
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,520
Great fun on the flavour.

1119
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,880
The base on the bottom tier is nice and thin,

1120
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,160
and a lovely ginger flavour is coming through.

1121
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,440
- That's ingenious. 
- Well done.

1122
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,480
Well done.

1123
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,480
I would be proud if I'd made that one.

1124
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,480
Perfect texture throughout

1125
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,720
and just the right amount of colour on the outside.

1126
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,800
That tastes very, very good.

1127
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,840
I can taste the honeycomb...

1128
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,960
and I like it.

1129
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,920
Let's try the next one.

1130
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,000
The coconut going through there is delicious,

1131
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,440
the consistency with the first and second are spot on.

1132
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,200
I just hope we get it near in the third one.

1133
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,000
Well, you've jolly well got to like peanut butter to have this one

1134
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,280
and it's a very good flavour.

1135
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,440
It's much more dense than the other one.

1136
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,800
That is a fantastic trio of cheesecakes.

1137
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,760
Texture, appearance and taste.

1138
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,880
It's been an amazing Showstopper day, hasn't it?

1139
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,840
We've seen real ingenuity,

1140
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,840
both in flavours and also style,

1141
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,960
would you say?

1142
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,200
Some people have saved themselves and some people

1143
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,080
have put themselves into a bit of trouble.

1144
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,560
Let's talk about school swot, Ian,

1145
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,960
who has been Star Baker for the last two weeks.

1146
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,360
His flavour combinations were pretty extraordinary.

1147
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,560
They were extraordinary, but blow me if they didn't work.

1148
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,920
And of course, when you actually looked at his,

1149
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,680
he had three separate cheesecakes - they looked magnificent.

1150
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,440
Who would think that tarragon and apple would go well together.

1151
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,680
- Marvellous. 
- They did.

1152
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,720
MEL: So, Ian possibly in contention for Star Baker again, I'm guessing?

1153
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,280
I think Ian, I think Tamal

1154
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,520
and Nadiya's Showstopper was very unusual.

1155
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,160
So, I mean, I think there are a few people up there,

1156
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,320
but I think certainly in a bit of trouble,

1157
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,560
you have Sandy, Paul, Alvin...

1158
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,560
and I think Mat saved himself.

1159
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,160
Well, news in,

1160
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,000
the cows of the UK are now empty.

1161
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,640
The entire dairy production of the UK

1162
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,600
has just gone into Paul and Mary's stomach.

1163
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,600
But the good news is you have four slices each,

1164
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,600
- so you can take those away. 
- There you go.

1165
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,120
In fact, shall they have them now?

1166
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,080
I think they should tuck in now. Get a spoon.

1167
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,600
Stop being silly. Come on.

1168
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,600
Bakers, who'd like a slice of baked cheesecake?

1169
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,480
I've got 27 of them backstage.

1170
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,880
I've got the lovely job, this time,

1171
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,480
of telling you who Paul and Mary have decided

1172
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,360
is this week's Star Baker.

1173
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,120
Now, I like to think of this person...

1174
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:05,320
tinkering away, experimenting,

1175
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,600
in a, sort of, professor type way -

1176
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,360
possibly in their pantry -

1177
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:13,240
creating all sorts of awesome flavour combinations.

1178
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,760
This person is the Bake Off's very own

1179
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,960
Ian-genuity self.

1180
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,480
Ian, for the third time running, you are Star Baker.

1181
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,600
APPLAUSE

1182
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,080
Well done.

1183
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,000
Well done, Ian.

1184
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,880
So, Mel and I alternate this job

1185
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,640
and this week, sadly, I have to deliver the bad news and...

1186
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,320
..with real sadness,

1187
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,640
the person who is leaving us this week...

1188
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,000
..is Sandy.

1189
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
We're sorry to see you go, Sandy.

1190
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,680
No, that's OK.

1191
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,040
- Come on, let's cover her. 
- Bring it in.

1192
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,240
I do feel proud of what I have achieved

1193
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,560
and I'm going to keep baking, yeah.

1194
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,200
I might even improve.

1195
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,560
SHE LAUGHS

1196
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,000
I might even get better.

1197
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,720
Sandy is a great baker.

1198
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,280
You don't get in this tent by being a poor baker at all.

1199
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,640
I think Sandy really stretched herself this week

1200
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,480
and it just didn't quite work

1201
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,600
and I know she'll be kicking herself.

1202
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,040
INDISTINCT CHAT AND LAUGHTER

1203
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,000
There you have it, the train of Ian ploughs on.

1204
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,560
Three Star Bakers on the bounce.

1205
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,600
It's going to be fascinating to see what happens

1206
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:30,120
with the other guys now - how they consider Ian in the future.

1207
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,640
Is he the threat?

1208
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,840
It's really irritating. Three weeks in a row - what?

1209
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,480
I mean, Ian's a teacher's pet really, so...

1210
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,880
He's totally a teacher's pet.

1211
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,440
He's inventive, he's fantastic on his flavours

1212
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,520
and he certainly has panache.

1213
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,680
I want to dance on the train and go,

1214
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:52,720
"Yes, me! Humble me has suddenly done something rather amazing."

1215
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,400
Next time,

1216
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,840
the bakers wrestle with free-from baking.

1217
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,160
- Look away. 
- This is not a technical. I can look.

1218
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,800
I'm doing whatever you're doing.

1219
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,400
They flex their muscles with sugarless cakes...

1220
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,720
That is one ugly looking cake.

1221
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,600
..grapple with non-gluten bread...

1222
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,600
It's really soft and it's really wet.

1223
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,360
..and fight with dairy-free ice cream rolls.

1224
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,200
There's another desert island.

1225
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,240
Well...

1226
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,680
He hasn't got that.
