1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,280
# What do you see when you peer through the trees in an English country garden?

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,760
# One large tent and a massive silver gent

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,120
# In an English country garden

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,600
# Cakes that are fairy

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,520
# And a judge whose name is Mary

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,520
# Three challenges so scary...#

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,560
Oh.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,680
TOGETHER: Welcome to The Great British Bake Off!

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,040
Last time...pastry.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,120
This is ridiculous!

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,560
- Can I do 48 in five minutes? 
- OK.

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,600
Nadiya had a vol-au-vent meltdown.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,000
But a poor showing in all three challenges...

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,840
- It's raw. 
- Your plums aren't cooked, either. 
- Sorry.

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,720
..meant Alvin had to leave the tent.

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,640
And Mat's first-class canapes won him Star Baker.

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,480
Now, for the first time ever, The Bake Off is going back in time...

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,640
..to the Victorian age.

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,880
Oh, my God!

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,080
Using 19th century skills...

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,080
It's like a hotel in Thailand over there.

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,080
..antiquated utensils...

23
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,280
Wobble is perfect. I'm happy with that.

24
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,120
..and long-lost recipes...

25
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,640
I mean, it can't be that hard, right? It's cake.

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,160
Queen Victoria would be proud.

27
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,640
..the remaining six...

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,800
It's not hot enough.

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,120
..are about to quite literally make history.

30
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,560
Whoops...

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,080
Don't let a fondant tennis court be the end of you.

32
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,520
I know! This is it.

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,120
The Victorian era ushered in a new dawn for home bakers.

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,600
And over the next three challenges, our hopeful half dozen

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,160
will be tested on techniques that defined modern baking.

36
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,520
I haven't really baked that many Victorian recipes,

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,080
so this is all very new to me.

38
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,440
And there's a lot of gelatine

39
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,960
and where gelatine's involved, there's lots of collapse.

40
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,680
I know very few things about the Victorians,

41
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,040
apart from they had really good frocks.

42
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,280
I think this is the least confident I've been

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,680
going into the tent this week

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,120
because of the things we've got to bake.

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,520
I'm very excited. This kind of feels like the week I've been waiting for.

46
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,160
There's some stuff coming up which I've always wanted to bake.

47
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,400
And so, yeah, I'm quite happy.

48
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,040
Good morning, bakers.

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,400
Now, for the next three challenges,

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,320
we're going Victorian.

51
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,920
- Mmm... 
- The Victorian era of course gave us things like baking powder,

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,520
eggless custard and the indomitable Mrs Beeton.

53
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,120
This week, we'd like you to make a raised game pie.

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,840
You can fill it with whatever you like.

55
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,880
It needs to be made with a hot water crust pastry

56
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,680
and you can use jelly or not.

57
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,080
You've got three hours.

58
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,720
On your marks, get set...

59
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,080
Bake!

60
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,760
Week seven. We're going up into the top end now.

61
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,200
The slightest mistake

62
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,240
is not something you want to be doing, really.

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,480
EGG SMASHES

64
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,920
Made some slight mess already.

65
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,840
For the Victorian middle classes,

66
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,520
game pie was a dinner table status symbol,

67
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,200
a way for upwardly mobile families to emulate their social superiors.

68
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,280
Our raised game pie is an excellent challenge.

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,560
It's very Victorian, too.

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,400
They loved their pies.

71
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,760
They were ornate.

72
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,800
The decoration should be intricate.

73
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,120
The key thing here, which we'll be looking for,

74
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,160
is not having a thick base or thick sides or a thick top.

75
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,960
The thinner the better.

76
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,440
Just getting the pastry started.

77
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,800
Game pie is made with hot water crust,

78
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,720
a robust pastry created by boiling water and fat in a pan

79
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,160
then adding flour.

80
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,920
Made properly, it should seal-in the moist filling

81
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,440
and keep its moulded shape.

82
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,880
- Morning, Paul. 
- Morning, Paul. Morning, Mary.

83
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,360
Morning. What have you chosen as your raised pie?

84
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,040
The meats inside are going to be venison, pheasant, pigeon and boar.

85
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,360
Wild boar?

86
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,640
Wild boar.

87
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,440
Paul's Not A Boaring Pie

88
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,880
will be flavoured with cayenne pepper, juniper berries and shallots.

89
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,480
Now the pastry itself, what tin are you using?

90
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,240
The tin's just on the side there.

91
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
This is a modern version of the Victorian tins.

92
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,000
They were beautifully fluted around the outside,

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,560
so you pressed the pastry and then you got this very attractive design.

94
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,280
And it would have all sorts of decoration on the top.

95
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,680
What are you going to be doing?

96
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,600
Just some leaves around the edges and more leaves in the centre.

97
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
Sorry to let you down! Thank you.

98
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,000
Ornate pie moulds were all the rage amongst aspiring Victorians,

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,880
as advances in mass production made them more affordable.

100
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,920
Last week's Star Baker, firefighter Mat,

101
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,520
has unearthed a genuine antique of the era.

102
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,360
Right, Mat, show us your tin.

103
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,960
Oh, that's a classic!

104
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,800
So where's this one come from, then?

105
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,040
That's my mate Dangerous Dave's mum's tin. Sheila.

106
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,160
1850.

107
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,480
Sheila's tin will be used to form Mat's Raised Venison and Pigeon Pie.

108
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,120
He's adding pork belly and bacon to his game

109
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,040
and flavouring it with mixed herbs.

110
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,560
What decoration have you got?

111
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,560
- I'm doing some plaits around the outside... 
- Lovely.

112
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,640
..and some antlers in the middle.

113
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,000
The idea is to try and get them standing up.

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,640
How would you do that?

115
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,960
Just sort of make them on the side and then, hopefully,

116
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,560
I was going to try and bake them after and then stick them in.

117
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,640
- Thank you. 
- Cheers.

118
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,680
While Paul and Mat are tailoring their pies

119
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
to traditional Victorian tastes,

120
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,440
Tamal and Nadiya are taking a more flamboyant approach

121
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,960
to their flavours.

122
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,720
- Morning, Tamal. 
- Morning.

123
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,520
Tell us all about your raised pie.

124
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,640
I'm doing a Middle Eastern flavoured themed game pie.

125
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,040
And then I'm frying the meat in a spice mix.

126
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,560
So it's ras el hanout and then there's some extra...

127
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,880
- I beg your pardon? 
- Ras el hanout. Is that how you say it?

128
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,040
- Do we know what...? 
- Ras el hanout. 
- That one.

129
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,680
I think she's angling for a taste.

130
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,440
Yes...

131
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,920
It isn't chilli. It isn't hot.

132
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,480
- No. There's a little bit of paprika. 
- It's aromatic.

133
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,080
Tamal's spices will flavour his rabbit, pigeon and venison filling.

134
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,160
With almonds, apricots and minced lamb completing his Arabian theme.

135
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,600
Having minced lamb means that it will hold together

136
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,360
and not all fall apart, which is good.

137
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,600
Why do you need something that's quite fatty?

138
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,080
Is that because game's very lean?

139
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,440
Well, it makes a much better pie.

140
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,000
Fat is our friend!

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,480
- Good luck, Tamal. Thank you very much. 
- Cheers.

142
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,720
I assume the Chinese five spice

143
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,920
isn't typical of Victorian cooking,

144
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,040
but I experimented with lots of other flavours

145
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,440
and actually really like this.

146
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,760
It's quite aromatic. It's a little bit different.

147
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840
Nadiya's Aromatic Game Pie

148
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,360
will be jam-packed with pheasant, venison and duck.

149
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,120
Which were your five spices?

150
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,640
Orange, star anise, ginger, fennel and cassia bark.

151
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,720
Cassia bark?

152
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,600
In Victorian times, they would have used mace,

153
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,440
the outside of the nutmeg,

154
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,360
but many of the spices you've mentioned

155
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,480
wouldn't have been available.

156
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's hack up some meat!

157
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,720
Just getting on with my filling,

158
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,800
so I'm cooking the meat just to brown it off a little bit.

159
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,920
It helps to enhance the flavours.

160
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,240
Unlike the landed gentry, who ate it all year round,

161
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,160
for the Victorian middle classes,

162
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,280
game was an expensive seasonal treat

163
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,320
and serving it in a pie showed you were on the way up the social ladder.

164
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
I'm used to working with some of the meats

165
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,960
but game meat's not something you do all the time.

166
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,440
But it can be dry.

167
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,840
One of the first things that I properly cooked was pheasant

168
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,840
and it was a competition at school called Highland Chef.

169
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,240
And I won it.

170
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,400
I got quite a good nickname of Bird Girl

171
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,640
for a really long time after that!

172
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,720
Good morning, Flora. Tell us all about your game pie.

173
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,320
I am doing a sage and game pie

174
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,000
with pheasant, pigeon and rabbit.

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,480
Interesting.

176
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,520
Country girl Flora is adding pork belly to her game,

177
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,040
flavouring it with traditional herbs, shallots and Muscat wine.

178
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,480
And the decoration on the top, what are you doing?

179
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,320
I've got a lattice that I'm going to stick on top

180
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,680
- and then cut some leaves going around the side. 
- Lovely.

181
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,200
Seems to be under control.

182
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,400
Thank you.

183
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,080
Flora isn't the only baker

184
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,120
experienced at with working with game.

185
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,520
The inspiration for this pie was,

186
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,640
shortly after I moved to Cambridgeshire,

187
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,760
I came across a hare on the road

188
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,640
and I just thought, "I can't let this go to waste."

189
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,720
Thus began my passion, really,

190
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,200
for picking up animals that had been, erm...

191
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,960
They'd been bumped on the road. They hadn't been pancaked!

192
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,600
- Hello, Ian. 
- Good morning. 
- Can you tell us about your game pie?

193
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,760
I am doing what I'm calling Road Kill Pie.

194
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,800
Mm-hm...?

195
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,160
Ian's pie is a veritable meat feast

196
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,360
of venison, partridge, guinea fowl, sausage and streaky bacon

197
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,320
baked inside a home-made mould.

198
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,360
Can you tell us about the decoration on the top?

199
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,800
It's my very simplified bird.

200
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,360
I'm going to put a wing around it

201
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,760
and then the eyehole is going to be sort of the steam hole.

202
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,360
So there's going to be a little decoration around there, but it's relatively simple.

203
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,120
Unlike delicate shortcrust,

204
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,000
hot water crust can be kneaded.

205
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,440
This develops the gluten, making it strong enough to shape.

206
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,280
The mould is sort of half the decoration, really.

207
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,640
So you want the pie to really stick to the mould.

208
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,520
Their pie casing should be rolled thin enough to bake crisply.

209
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,880
Too flimsy and the filling could seep out.

210
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,200
The method of rolling it out...

211
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,640
it's leaked every time with me.

212
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,160
Bit of time just manipulating it.

213
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,280
So just putting in the filling now.

214
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm just going to pack it as densely as possible,

215
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,680
because it does shrink away to nothing when it's getting cooked.

216
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,280
For image-conscious social climbing Victorians

217
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,960
the decorations on a pie were as important as its contents.

218
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,800
Middle Eastern flavours made me think of the Arabian Nights.

219
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,440
On the side of the pie, there's going to be some crescent moons

220
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,640
and the roses,

221
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,640
I imagined like if the stories were being told in a garden.

222
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,320
It all makes sense up here.

223
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,280
It looks attractive enough.

224
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,160
When you're sort of running out of time, you've got to prioritise, really.

225
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,760
Right, I'm going in.

226
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,680
I think I filled it too much.

227
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,560
I think it's quite crammed.

228
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,560
To get a crisp crust, the pies should be baked at a high temperature.

229
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,840
Then the heat reduced or the game will be overcooked and dry.

230
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,320
It's in the oven for half an hour to start off with

231
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,280
and then I'm going to turn it down to 160

232
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,960
and leave it in there for another hour.

233
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,200
- What temperature are you doing it? 
- 200.

234
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,480
I've just done so much meat, I don't think it's going to cook.

235
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,600
- For the whole time? 
- I think I'm going to have to.

236
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,840
That's a long time. 200...?

237
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,400
In the pan here, we've got a grisly pot

238
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,920
of pig trotters and pork bones

239
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,040
which, hopefully, I'll make a jelly with.

240
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,480
I'm not sure if it'll work, but I might as well try it.

241
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,840
OK, bakers, we're very game to eat your pie.

242
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,560
And in an hour, yes an hour,

243
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,960
we shall be doing that.

244
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,520
For game to be cooked through,

245
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,360
it needs to reach at least 65 degrees.

246
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,480
It's really low.

247
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
It's at 26.

248
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,480
That's 26?

249
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,240
Well, having it out there's not going to help, is it?

250
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,280
I might put it up to 220.

251
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,760
- Really? 
- To 220?

252
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,920
- You'll burn the pastry. 
- Jesus...!

253
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,360
How's that jelly coming along?

254
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,480
Erm...

255
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,640
It's kind of reduced down a lot.

256
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,400
Oh, God, I've just had a pig's trotter sauna!

257
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,840
Right, don't look at it.

258
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,720
It's not going to improve anything by looking at it.

259
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,600
Right, you horrible lot,

260
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,040
five minutes to get them pies out

261
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,760
or it's to the workhouse for the lot of you!

262
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,200
Oh, 71.

263
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,680
You've got 71?

264
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,400
That's definitely done in the middle.

265
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,800
67.

266
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,960
It's not hot enough.

267
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,480
It's better than it was at home and there's no leaks.

268
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,240
Oh, God...

269
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,680
- Yes! 
- Yes!

270
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,000
The wobble is perfect. I'm happy with that.

271
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,920
One minute for this bake.

272
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,640
Flora, one minute.

273
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,240
Ah...!

274
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,560
65.3!

275
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,960
She's coming. She's going to need to come out.

276
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,320
As Queen Victoria used to say,

277
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,440
"Please put your pies to the end of the benches.

278
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,920
"I can't wait to try them."

279
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,160
Time's up!

280
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,840
I don't know what everyone was worried about, really. That was easy.

281
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,600
Paul and Mary are looking for an ornately decorated pie

282
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,520
made from thin, crisp pastry,

283
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,640
filled with tender flavoursome game.

284
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,440
Overall, the bake looks fantastic.

285
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,360
The colour down on the side with that mould looks amazing.

286
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,960
Very classic looking.

287
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,240
And the antlers...

288
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,560
They look more like dolphins to be honest, or dogs. I'm not sure what they are.

289
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,160
I could've done with a bit more time on the antlers, to be fair.

290
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,520
That looks a really well-packed pie.

291
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,360
You've got the bottom baked and the sides baked beautifully.

292
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,960
I think the top could have done with a little bit longer.

293
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,640
And the meat is tender.

294
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,280
You've got the herbs right.

295
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,720
I think, overall, it's not bad.

296
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,040
I think the flavour is good in the game.

297
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,720
I think it needed an addition of maybe bacon.

298
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,280
Right. There is bacon in it.

299
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,320
Yeah, more.

300
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,600
Yeah.

301
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,000
Just to remind you

302
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,880
that we asked for a highly-decorated pie.

303
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,520
Oh, there's the foot, though, Mary. There's a little foot.

304
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,840
- OK, if we take that off. 
- And the wing and the eye...

305
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,560
So what you've done is a wing?

306
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,440
A wing and a little eye.

307
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,520
The appearance is absolutely beautiful.

308
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,880
The pastry, it's a bit thick underneath.

309
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,080
Yeah, sides, bottom, far too thick.

310
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,600
You can half that.

311
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,880
The filling is absolutely exceptional.

312
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,560
It is beautifully tender.

313
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,280
I just wonder how that jelly is...?

314
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,200
Is that a game changer, Mary?

315
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,480
It's beautifully set. It's lightly flavoured.

316
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,440
- And it's the real thing. 
- Great.

317
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,720
- Well done. 
- Thank you.

318
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,680
That looks...

319
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,600
extremely delicate.

320
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,520
- Beautiful design on the top. 
- Yeah.

321
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,000
Wow...

322
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,800
Strong bake all the way around.

323
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,320
The game's being lost a lot by the spices.

324
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,440
This is a game pie.

325
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,640
We should taste the game and it's strongly spiced.

326
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,120
I think it's set out beautifully, it looks great

327
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,440
- but, for me, just too much spice. 
- OK.

328
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,520
The overall appearance,

329
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,240
particularly of the top, I think is most attractive.

330
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,880
These roses look great.

331
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,040
Look how moist it is in there.

332
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,800
You can see it's almost setting itself.

333
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,480
The mince lamb would have done part of this job for you.

334
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,560
That's very clever.

335
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,360
It has that spiciness, not too much spice, not to knock you back.

336
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,800
It's a gentle blend of spices.

337
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,240
Do you know what?

338
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,720
That's... That's fantastic.

339
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,600
I mean, really well done.

340
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,920
- Thank you. 
- Oh, the handshake... 
- Well done. 
- Thank you.

341
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,520
Thanks a lot.

342
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,480
The decoration...

343
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,920
Remind me what that is?

344
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,920
It's just some leaves in the centre, there's a few leaves on the outside

345
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,720
and a small bird leaf on the top there.

346
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,760
I can see what you are trying to do. It just loses its way a little bit.

347
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,080
- Great filling inside. 
- Yeah!

348
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,160
You've gone a bit thick there on a corner. This corner's better.

349
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,680
Just around here...

350
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,000
..it's a little bit underdone.

351
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,720
Pastry has a nice flavour.

352
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,920
It's quite a tough meat, that.

353
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,600
You may have overbaked it slightly.

354
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,760
Mm-hm.

355
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,800
- I expected a little bit more moisture in there, to be honest. 
- Right.

356
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,480
It's been ruined slightly by overbaking it, overcooking it.

357
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,640
Thank you.

358
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,680
Thank you.

359
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,880
You've caught it all round the edge. It's ballooned quite a lot.

360
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,080
Er, overfilled, probably.

361
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,320
Is... This is?

362
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,640
- Pigeon. 
- The pigeon... 
- Is a little tough. 
- Yes.

363
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,720
The rest of it is beautifully tender.

364
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,160
And the pastry is...

365
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,600
..crisp, which is what we like.

366
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,640
Thank you.

367
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,680
I was expecting to be

368
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,120
hung, drawn and quartered during that judging.

369
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,600
And I wasn't.

370
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,000
Which is a blooming miracle!

371
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,480
Not good.

372
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,400
Not a good game pie.

373
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,200
I know I can do better, so that's a bit disappointing.

374
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,760
Woo-woooo!

375
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,720
Never thought I'd get a handshake from Paul.

376
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,240
Maybe a little bit of confidence has come back.

377
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,280
We know where that's going to go, though, don't we?

378
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,680
When it comes to Victorian domestic cuisine,

379
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,960
one name towers above all else, like a great sponge colossus.

380
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,920
That name is Mrs Beeton.

381
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,880
But despite her image as the quintessential home cook,

382
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,120
a close look at her early baking recipes reveals a scandalous secret.

383
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,600
If you really want to know where Mrs Beeton comes from,

384
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,120
you have to look here.

385
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,160
This is the English Woman's Domestic Magazine,

386
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,280
founded and edited by her husband, Samuel Beeton.

387
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,400
He brought her, his young bride of 21,

388
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,040
into the business to write the cookery column.

389
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,680
She'd had absolutely no experience or interest at all.

390
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,200
And we know that because the first recipe she ever included

391
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,520
was for sponge cake.

392
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,920
But, unfortunately, she forgot to mention that you have to use flour.

393
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,800
That's a base element, isn't it, really?

394
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,080
- You'd have thought, wouldn't you? 
- Otherwise it's just a batter or a lake.

395
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,600
Mrs Beeton might not have been a natural-born baker,

396
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,640
but she was a canny editor,

397
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,280
trawling historical cookbooks

398
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,560
to compile her first full-length publication

399
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,000
Mrs Beeton's Book Of Household Management.

400
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,840
How many recipes did she actually create and originate?

401
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,560
I've only been able to find one.

402
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,840
It's called Useful Soup for Benevolent Purposes.

403
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,080
Oh...

404
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,800
I've been looking for one of those!

405
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,840
I've only ever managed to find either a Useful Soup or a Benevolent Soup.

406
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,480
But never managed to combined the two.

407
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,280
Hitting the shelves in 1861, the same year as Great Expectations,

408
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,160
Mrs Beeton's book outsold Dickens,

409
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,680
as Victorian housewives sought the secret

410
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,280
to baking flamboyant dinner table centrepieces.

411
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,600
And it has remained in print for over 150 years.

412
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,360
The bakers have no idea which 19th century recipe

413
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,760
they're about to revive.

414
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,960
Bakers, it's that time again. It's the Technical Challenge.

415
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,960
And for this one, Mary has raided her antique cookbooks

416
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,160
and has come up with a marvellous recipe from the 1890s.

417
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,320
Before they disappear into the tent of dreams,

418
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,240
Mary, do you have any advice for the bakers?

419
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,480
Timing is really important,

420
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,400
so you really must get going.

421
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,600
Gosh...

422
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,000
Motivational and frightening!

423
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,920
Tarty-bye, tarty-bye!

424
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,120
- Lots of love. 
- Off you go now. 
- Lots of love, but leave.

425
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,840
Mary and Paul would like you to make...Tennis Cake.

426
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,480
Yes. You and us both.

427
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,640
Now, this is a rich fruitcake

428
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,560
decorated with an icing that became royal

429
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,520
after Queen Victoria used it on her own wedding cake.

430
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,080
You've got three hours to make this.

431
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,560
- On your marks. 
- Get set. 
- Bake!

432
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,600
Oh, my God!

433
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,200
Just sounds like a very...

434
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,840
..strange little recipe.

435
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,240
I mean, it can't be that hard, right? It's cake.

436
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,360
Mary, what were you thinking?

437
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,640
A fruitcake as a Technical Challenge?

438
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,240
It's not so much making it, it's the cooling of it, isn't it?

439
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,440
I reminded them in the tent that they had to get going.

440
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,200
In the first half hour, they've got to make the fruitcake.

441
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,040
While that's baking, they can get on with the top.

442
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,280
Any one of those things could break down. Almond paste...could go wrong.

443
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,600
Sugar paste... Making that can go wrong.

444
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,960
Colouring sugar paste can go wrong.

445
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,160
Piping could go wrong.

446
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,560
The net... Well, that's easy to get wrong.

447
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,560
It's all about texture. It's about flavour.

448
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,080
It's about consistency in the fruitcake, as well.

449
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,000
If they get going and get that cake in the oven early

450
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,920
and they spend time on the intricate design,

451
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,440
we should get some wonderful cakes.

452
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,120
It's all about the timing.

453
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,160
The instructions aren't that detailed, no.

454
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,880
It sort of says, "Using the creaming method, make the cake."

455
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,200
What more do you need to know, other than that, you know?

456
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,120
I'm just going to prep all the fruit,

457
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,480
because I assume that needs to go in the cake, as well.

458
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,640
Cor, it's hot!

459
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,200
So size is important.

460
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,160
So you don't want the fruit to be too big,

461
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,520
because it will just sink down to the bottom.

462
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,000
The bakers need to be quick off the blocks.

463
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,600
Such a dense fruitcake

464
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,680
should be baked for at least two of the three hours,

465
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,240
a fact Mary's recipe neglects to mention.

466
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,280
I'm assuming it's quite a slow bake.

467
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,560
So I think it's really important to get it in the oven really fast.

468
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,440
It's in, yeah. Which is kind of a bit of a relief.

469
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,360
Right, next, almond paste.

470
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,760
Almond paste is how the Victorians referred to marzipan.

471
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,320
Get all the ground almonds in and get the icing sugar, the caster sugar, the almond extract

472
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,440
and the egg whites in there.

473
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,800
Mix the ingredients in one by one, until you get a dough.

474
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,320
Should be easy enough...

475
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,360
Bakers, you've had over half an hour.

476
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,400
Urgh...!

477
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,880
Timing is of the essence.

478
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,840
You might want to get your cakes in the oven as soon as you possibly can.

479
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,640
OK, I'm going in.

480
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,320
"Roll out the almond paste.

481
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,880
"Cut it into 23 by 15 centimetres rectangle

482
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,080
"and place it on a silicone sheet."

483
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,400
OK, make the royal icing. Let's make the royal icing.

484
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,640
Royal icing will be used to pipe the net, rackets and decorative border.

485
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,800
I think royal icing is the stuff that kind of dries

486
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,480
when it gets piped.

487
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,320
"Divide the royal icing into three colours. One third pale pink...

488
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,560
"..one third light gold

489
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,000
"and leave the last third white."

490
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,080
To make the surface of the tennis court,

491
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,600
Mary's recipe asks for sugar paste.

492
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,840
Never even thought of making my own sugar paste.

493
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,320
I imagine it's not a home baker thing.

494
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,560
Oh, it's weird...

495
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,160
I have made sugar paste before. I actually made it yesterday.

496
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,040
For another recipe, so...

497
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,920
Shot myself in the foot by saying that, didn't I?

498
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,600
The magic ingredient in this is gelatine.

499
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,880
A lot of gelatine in Victorian food.

500
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,080
I have visions that Victorians used to, like, worship gelatine.

501
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,000
The gelatine must be melted over a gentle heat,

502
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,240
otherwise the mixture will seize.

503
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,560
Whoops...!

504
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,240
I've just been heating that on full whack.

505
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,520
That's good, isn't it?!

506
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,200
Then plenty of icing sugar is added gradually,

507
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,320
until the paste can be rolled out.

508
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,160
Just has to be pliable and dry.

509
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,520
I think it's there.

510
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,240
Like, not sticky. Like, it's not sticking to my hands anymore.

511
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,120
Oh, maybe I should do it again.

512
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,000
That wasn't very wise of me.

513
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,840
This is a joke, innit?

514
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,480
What is that? Sugar paste?

515
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,200
Yeah. Mine's quite different to yours, innit?

516
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,400
It is, yeah.

517
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,000
Everyone else has got it like...

518
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,120
..something that you can actually roll out.

519
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,160
I don't know now. It's just weird.

520
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,040
"Roll out the green sugar paste and place on top of the almond paste." I'm about to do that now.

521
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,200
I've gone for texture. Has anyone else gone for texture? Probably not.

522
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,120
So what's happened with that icing?

523
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,520
I can't make it. Do you know what I mean? I'm just getting the hump now.

524
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,320
Don't get the hump. You're brilliant.

525
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,640
It just won't go right. Oh, this is...

526
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,800
- Honestly! 
- Have you got time to do it again?

527
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
- It's annoying, isn't it? 
- Listen, mate...

528
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,480
Don't let a fondant tennis court be the end of you!

529
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,680
I know, but this is it.

530
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,520
The bakers have just an hour to bake, cool

531
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,600
and decorate their Victorian tennis cakes.

532
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,800
No. Not ready.

533
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,320
Oh, it's nowhere near yet.

534
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,640
Taking it out too soon could leave the cake raw inside,

535
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,320
but every minute they wait eats into their cooling time.

536
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,480
Turned it up by ten degrees.

537
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,000
It's just taking so long.

538
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,240
Says, "Use number three nozzle, three quarters of the white paste.

539
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,360
"Pipe the outline of the tennis court,

540
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,000
"but leave a 1.5 centimetre gap around the edge of the paste."

541
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,040
I think I can remember what a tennis court looks like.

542
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,080
It just looks like something green with a rectangle on it.

543
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,120
I don't know what a tennis court looks like.

544
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,520
You've never played tennis?

545
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,560
I have. I just never paid attention to the lines.

546
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,440
Tennis nets, tennis nets...

547
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,480
Two small tennis rackets.

548
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,120
Trying to get rid of the evidence of this, really.

549
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,760
Pipe round the edges, actually.

550
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,920
So I might be able to get away with the fact that...

551
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,040
that this is pretty shocking.

552
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,120
Bakers, it's 30 all.

553
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,360
30 minutes are all that you have.

554
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,040
I'm going to take it out.

555
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,240
Clean.

556
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,400
Clean.

557
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,520
Clean.

558
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,720
It's sunk a little bit.

559
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,920
But, other than that, it's all right.

560
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,840
Damn, damn, damn, damn!

561
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,560
Not keen on these tins.

562
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,960
I'm really not happy with my icing.

563
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,800
No, they're not set.

564
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,240
Oh, the handle's not ready yet.

565
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,720
- Fridge, fridge! 
- Fridge?

566
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,320
Oh, no, I think I'm going to freeze.

567
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,080
- Freeze? 
- I'll freeze, you fridge.

568
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,040
OK, bakers, that's ten-nis minutes.

569
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,920
Ten-nis minutes to go.

570
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,920
"Place the almond paste and sugar paste tennis court

571
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,720
"on top of the cake, leaving the side bare."

572
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,600
You've only got to get the surface.

573
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,960
It's too hot. It's boiling!

574
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,760
It's not going to do in time.

575
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,320
It's a bit darker than everybody else's.

576
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,680
"Decorate by sitting the tennis court upright on the court and the rackets either side."

577
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,320
What did you do that with?

578
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,800
- Icing? 
- Yeah.

579
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,920
Oh, it's yellow.

580
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,240
Yeah, I probably left it in the oven too long!

581
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,480
Oven?

582
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,400
Yeah.

583
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,800
- Were we supposed to put it in the oven? 
- I don't know!

584
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,880
Bakers, one minute till you're due on court.

585
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,800
They're all broken.

586
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
Just going to have to put these on as they are.

587
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,120
Argh...!

588
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,200
Time, ladies and gentlemen, please!

589
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,240
Oh...

590
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,560
You've done the net.

591
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,560
- I think you're the only person who has. 
- Mat baked his.

592
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,440
- Baked...? 
- His decorations.

593
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,160
Oh, really?

594
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,080
- What, to try and get them to fix? 
- I don't know!

595
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,760
It's time to find out who's served an ace

596
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,040
and who will be awarded double fault from Paul and Mary.

597
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,080
- Right, shall we start from this side, Mary? 
- Indeed.

598
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,920
Now, we asked for a net to be up.

599
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,600
We have got...partial net.

600
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,760
We've got beautiful, flat sugar paste.

601
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,440
There's a little bit of action in the front there.

602
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,760
Oh, it just got stuck into the side of the tin.

603
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,880
Oh, right, yeah.

604
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,560
It's good distribution of the fruit.

605
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,680
It tastes good, the fruitcake. Nice and moist, too.

606
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,720
Let's move on to the next one.

607
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,040
The net is absolutely straight.

608
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,480
Neat piping around the outside.

609
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,440
Good fruit distribution in this one.

610
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,680
And we've got a nice, light crust around the outside.

611
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,960
- It's like hot Christmas cake. 
- Mm.

612
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,040
Moving on to number three.

613
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,440
This looks like a tennis court from Hades!

614
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,800
- The net... 
- Is standing.

615
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,000
It's standing, yeah. It looks like a fence.

616
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,640
I think a ball would probably go through that, if I'm honest.

617
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,160
A little bit of a dip in the middle. And the colour...

618
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,120
There seems to be little extra bits of green around the outside here.

619
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,520
Don't quite know how that got there.

620
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,800
In the very middle here, it is raw.

621
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,920
Needed a little longer in the oven.

622
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,760
That's why it's got a dip there.

623
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,040
Moving on to the next one.

624
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,320
The pipe work is pretty good. A little bit of a dip.

625
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,520
Where's the net?

626
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,120
It's got a strong bake all the way around.

627
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,320
Good flavour, though. Nice cake that, Mary.

628
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,400
Moving on to the next one. We have a net.

629
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,840
But it's just had a tumble.

630
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,640
It's had a bit of a fall, that one.

631
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,560
Beautifully piped round the outside.

632
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,400
Looks as though it's been caught slightly.

633
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,800
You can taste the burntness slightly on this, can't you?

634
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,320
It's slightly overcooked around the outside.

635
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,160
Mm. Let's move on to the last one.

636
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,760
The piping's not bad, but no net.

637
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,800
No net.

638
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,240
I think it's slightly under,

639
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,440
and it has caused that bit of a dip in the middle.

640
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,600
Again, the fruit is beautifully distributed.

641
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,120
Mary and Paul will now seed the cakes from worst to best.

642
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,080
That was good. That was quite good.

643
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
In sixth place is...

644
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,040
this one.

645
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,280
Mat. Net was fantastic.

646
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,280
- Thanks. 
- Problem with the cake. It was underbaked.

647
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,160
And in fifth place...

648
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,360
That's me.

649
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,880
This was slightly underbaked.

650
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,920
Mm-hm.

651
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,920
In fourth, it was this one.

652
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,680
It's a great-looking cake. You overbaked it.

653
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,320
And in third place, who's this?

654
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,240
We've got a well-finished cake.

655
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,120
Was sort of missing a net.

656
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,960
In second place is this one.

657
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,760
It's a nice cake. The other half of the net?

658
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,440
As I put it on, it just collapsed.

659
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,800
So in first place?

660
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,120
Nadiya.

661
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,680
You managed that net.

662
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,000
It was a beautifully-baked cake. Well done.

663
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,960
Yay!

664
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,160
To be in week seven and to get number one in Technical

665
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,760
is a massive achievement for me. Massive.

666
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,080
I think that was my least successful bake in the tent so far, really.

667
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,840
Looked pretty bad and was raw.

668
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,680
So, I don't think you can get much worse than that, really.

669
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,360
Oh, it's just... It's cakes, isn't it?

670
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,680
I mean, almost every time I've done badly, it's been cakes.

671
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,920
Yeah, I'm a bit disappointed with that.

672
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,000
Really pleased that this morning went well.

673
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,400
As long as I don't do something terrible tomorrow. Let's see.

674
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,600
Pigeon, jelly and tennis.

675
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,960
It's been game, set and match. Quite literally.

676
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,520
Who do you think might be in contention for Star Baker?

677
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,320
There's two. There's Tamal and Nadiya.

678
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,480
I think Nadiya did well. She won the Technical.

679
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,200
Her game pie was very good.

680
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,240
The thing that ruined it was spices. She overwhelmed all the flavours.

681
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,000
But when you win the Technical Challenge

682
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,880
like Nadiya did, who knows, you know?

683
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,440
Tamal, I think has done really well. Third in the Technical.

684
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,320
I was amazed with Tamal's pie,

685
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,520
because he just got the spices right.

686
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,160
I think Mat's got to be a bit careful.

687
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,800
He was sixth in the Technical

688
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,040
and dare I say Paul or maybe even Ian.

689
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,960
Coming fifth in the Technical and having a bad day today,

690
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,520
you know, could cause some issues.

691
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,680
One challenge stands between the bakers

692
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,040
and a place in the quarterfinals.

693
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,640
Good morning, bakers.

694
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,800
Or as they would say in Victorian times,

695
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,720
"Wotcha, cock. Have a banana!"

696
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,640
Today, Mary and Paul would love you for your Showstoppers

697
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,720
to create a dessert that sounds a bit like a film star from the 1980s...

698
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,840
Charlotte Russe.

699
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,080
Oooh...

700
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,880
So a charlotte russe is a big, blousy dessert

701
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,640
with bavarois cream and jelly

702
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,680
and it has to be freestanding.

703
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,440
You've got five-and-a-half hours.

704
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,840
- On your marks. 
- Get set. 
- Bake!

705
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,120
A lot of wobble happening this weekend.

706
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,720
A lot of wobbles, emotionally, structurally...

707
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,960
The Showstopper Challenge today is a charlotte russe,

708
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,880
a traditional Victorian dessert made up of lady's fingers,

709
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,360
a bavarois cream and jelly.

710
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,880
Simple enough.

711
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,960
Or maybe not.

712
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,440
The most difficult thing in this challenge

713
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,080
is getting the bavarois and jelly to set

714
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,320
and they've got to add the right amount of gelatine,

715
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,560
that it's not too stiff and it's not too runny.

716
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,520
All the bakers are making traditional sponge fingers

717
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,080
for their external structure.

718
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,360
Sponge fingers have got to be nice, light and airy.

719
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,240
So the way you do that is by whipping up the egg whites

720
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,000
to get loads of little bubbles in them

721
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,280
and, when it goes in the oven,

722
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,320
those expand and it gives you a nice texture.

723
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,880
This mix needs to be very, very light.

724
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,760
Fingers are just dense otherwise.

725
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,000
Most are also using the sponge mix

726
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,400
to create the base layer of their russe.

727
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,800
- Hello, Ian. 
- Morning, morning.

728
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
Right, tell us all about your charlotte russe.

729
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,520
So we are going to start off, obviously, with that at the bottom,

730
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
then we're going to have some rhubarb compote,

731
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,360
then some bavarois,

732
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,080
then another thin layer of compote,

733
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,360
more bavarois and then, finally, the jelly on top.

734
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,320
And then a three-dimensional crown.

735
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,000
- OK. 
- Gracious!

736
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Ian's crown will sit atop a ginger jelly,

737
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,640
flavoured with home-grown lemon verbena.

738
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,520
So you're really going overboard on the...

739
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,080
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
- ..on the sponges?

740
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,160
I was lacking with my decorations yesterday.

741
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,560
I'd like to make up for it today.

742
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,920
- You've got a lot ahead of you. 
- I have.

743
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,920
Ian isn't the only baker

744
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,240
bringing a very Victorian sense of grandeur to their russe.

745
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,200
Hello, Paul. What are you making?

746
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,960
I'm making a strawberry bavarois cream.

747
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,880
Jelly is rhubarb and orange

748
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,000
and, obviously, the Victorians were very elaborate with their fruit.

749
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,840
So I'll be doing some fruit carvings.

750
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,400
Paul's adding almond to his sponge fingers

751
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,880
and rosemary to his jelly,

752
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,960
which will support his fruit sculptures.

753
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,760
Strawberries into roses.

754
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,200
- Apples into swans. 
- Apples into swans?!

755
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,960
Apples into swans are very clever. It's the way you use the knife.

756
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,640
If you glance into Mrs Beeton,

757
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,640
everything was so ornate

758
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,320
because labour was cheap

759
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,120
and all the cooks would be competing against each other.

760
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,560
What, do you do it with a sort of little hammer and chisel?

761
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,560
- A sharp knife. 
- Oh, with a knife. 
- A sharp knife.

762
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,360
A hammer and chisel on an apple?

763
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,520
But tiny, little one. I thought Paul would have a little one in his kit.

764
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,520
- A little small one. 
- No.

765
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,680
I just thought the sponge fingers looked a bit plain,

766
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,120
so I wanted to do something to make them a little more distinctive.

767
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,680
Doing it a bit of a cheat style and building them almost as a wall.

768
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,080
So they're all touching.

769
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,360
And sort of hoping that's going to prevent any...

770
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,760
..sort of leaks.

771
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,840
Mat's making a strawberry charlotte russe

772
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,320
filled with strawberry bavarois, topped with strawberry jelly

773
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,720
and decorated with...strawberries.

774
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,560
If you keep it simple, there's less to go wrong.

775
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,920
The sort of pitfall of keeping things simple

776
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,520
is that you've got nowhere to hide.

777
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,720
But it's sort of served me all right so far.

778
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,720
Unlike Mat, Flora's flavours are far from straightforward.

779
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,520
- Good morning, Flora. 
- Morning.

780
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,720
Will you describe the layers to us?

781
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,840
I've got a pink layer of the raspberry sponge

782
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,480
and then I've got a champagne jelly with pomegranate juice

783
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,120
and some raspberries.

784
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,120
And then I've got a white chocolate bavarois

785
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,720
and then the sponge, jelly and bavarois repeated.

786
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,200
Flora's also making champagne truffles.

787
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,120
Her top jelly layer will be flecked with gold leaf

788
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,920
and her middle layers studded with fresh pomegranate seeds.

789
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,040
What possessed you to use pomegranate?

790
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,360
I actually really like pomegranates.

791
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,520
What's your beef with pomegranates, Paul?

792
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,840
It's the texture.

793
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,080
Everything is being aimed at being soft and silky and smooth.

794
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,400
And then bang! You're hit with a pomegranate.

795
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,320
I'm not going to seed them all for you, I'm sorry.

796
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,600
FLORA LAUGHS

797
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,600
Just going to start lining the tin with the sponge fingers.

798
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,360
This is my lady's fingers chopper,

799
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,360
to ensure that each of my lady's fingers

800
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,000
is exactly nine centimetres long.

801
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,560
If I overlap, there's less chance of a leakage.

802
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,240
I'm happy with that.

803
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,560
While all the other bakers are using sponge to support their fillings,

804
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,640
Tamal has opted for something a little more precarious.

805
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,560
I've got a jelly layer at the base.

806
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,320
There is no sponge fingers on the bottom

807
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,240
and I'm doing raspberry and ginger jelly

808
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
and the top jelly is blackberry and apple.

809
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,840
Inside Tamal's jelly sandwich

810
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,200
is a cardamom, rosewater and orange blossom-flavoured bavarois

811
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,120
with macarons as decoration.

812
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,280
It's easy to overdo it with all those ingredients.

813
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,160
They're quite strong flavours.

814
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,640
I'm going to get started on the bavarois.

815
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,600
Bavarois starts life as a custard.

816
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,080
Dissolve the sugar in the milk, heating it up

817
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,920
and that's going to go into the eggs in a minute to thicken up the eggs.

818
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,720
I'm just infusing the milk with the cardamom

819
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,560
and then I'll filter out, so you don't get the bits of cardamom in.

820
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,720
You just the flavour.

821
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,280
It should end up set, like a mousse.

822
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,880
And that means adding just the right amount of gelatine.

823
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,600
I want it to wobble when you shake the plate,

824
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,280
but to be structurally sound at the same time.

825
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,880
Then delicately whipped cream is incorporated gently

826
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,320
to create a silky texture.

827
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,280
Just trying to get all the lumps out, really.

828
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,520
It's nearly there.

829
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,320
- Good morning, Nadiya. 
- Morning.

830
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,680
You've got a meringue going at the moment. Explain.

831
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,880
When I was at school,

832
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,800
one of the things my teacher taught me was how to make a bavarois cream

833
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,480
and she used Italian meringue in hers. And I'm using her recipe.

834
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,080
The idea of putting an Italian meringue in there is a good one.

835
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,280
It lightens it up, but it'll also help as well with the set.

836
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,480
Nadiya's creating two different flavours of bavarois -

837
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,480
one raspberry, one mango -

838
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,200
topped with mango jelly.

839
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,120
And how are you decorating it?

840
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,840
It's quite a simple decoration.

841
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,280
I'm going to use a little bit of the Italian meringue.

842
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,120
Everything that I've put in the dessert,

843
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,840
I'm going to put on top of the dessert.

844
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,960
It's quite simple, but I think...

845
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,720
I think, as long as... I think it's...

846
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,080
I don't know. We'll see.

847
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,120
- Good luck. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you. 
- See you. 
- Thank you.

848
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,120
Yeah, I think they want an elaborate design, perhaps.

849
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,560
But, no, I'm not worried.

850
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,840
No, I'm not worried at all.

851
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,280
If I can get it out there and it's set, I'm happy.

852
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,640
I'm getting started on the base jelly,

853
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,080
which is the raspberry ginger one.

854
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,920
I'm going for quite a firm set with this jelly.

855
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,640
Just want to try and get it right.

856
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,320
It's mainly the flavour that I'm after for the champagne.

857
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,240
My aim, essentially, is to just get them trollied!

858
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,400
Hitting shelves in the late 1800s,

859
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,760
ready-made gelatine enabled home bakers

860
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,120
to copy decadent desserts being served up at restaurants

861
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,720
without the faff of boiling up hooves.

862
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,600
So one, two, three...

863
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,560
And getting the jelly just right

864
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,400
is key to creating the perfect charlotte russe.

865
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,240
One and a half gelatine sheets are in there.

866
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,040
I'm hoping that's enough.

867
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,160
..six, seven, eight...

868
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,640
One and a half should be enough, surely?

869
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,720
There's three-and-a-half hours to go, but no time to waste.

870
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,600
I'm just getting my first layer in.

871
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,440
Before it sets too hard, the bakers pour their bavarois.

872
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,720
It's all looking just how I wanted it,

873
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,400
which is kind of a like a thick custard, really.

874
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,080
I'd like it to sort of...

875
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,680
- ..settle down a bit more. 
- Like, lay a bit smoother.

876
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,640
Each layer has to set before the next is added,

877
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,160
or the whole russe could collapse.

878
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,800
And, in the meantime...

879
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,480
..it's on to decorations.

880
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,600
So, making some macarons to go on the top of my charlotte.

881
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,920
The title of the cake is Victoria's Crown,

882
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,160
and this is the crown itself.

883
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,000
So, bake that for about 20 minutes or so.

884
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,200
And... Yeah, then start assembling it.

885
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,600
Everyone else is doing loads of stuff.

886
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,880
It's like a hotel in Thailand over there!

887
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,840
Paul...

888
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,040
- Yes? 
- This is a question, obviously, I've asked a million times,

889
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,920
but when did you first get into carving fruit?

890
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,280
Er, in a day.

891
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,920
- In one day? 
- In one day, I learnt how to do it.

892
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,440
You went from eating them to going, "Oh, I must make a swan"?

893
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,800
It's what I like doing. It's the arty side of things.

894
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,680
- It's fantastic. 
- You love it, don't you?

895
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,560
Oh, I love it. It's great. It's great stuff.

896
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,160
- What are you making out of the pineapple? A penguin? 
- Yeah!

897
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,640
OK, bakers, that's one hour.

898
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,880
Time to rush the russe!

899
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,560
You've got 60 minutes.

900
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,920
I'm going to put my second layer of mango bavarois in.

901
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,600
This will be the penultimate layer.

902
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,920
I've just got the jelly to go.

903
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,160
I just want it just so I can spoon it in.

904
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,720
Hopefully, I'll have enough time,

905
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,920
because I've got to then freeze it and then decorate it, as well.

906
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,120
Don't seep on me, please!

907
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,400
That'll do. Straight in the freezer.

908
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,520
OK, bakers, just ten minutes left,

909
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,040
so pull your sponge fingers out!

910
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,480
This jelly will set enough. I won't get the fruit on top, but...

911
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,200
it should be all right.

912
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,960
How do I get it from there to there?

913
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,640
That's it. Just hold it together, hold it together.

914
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,520
OK, then.

915
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,280
What's going on round here?

916
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,840
No, it's split, man.

917
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,440
You need to get it more onto this.

918
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,280
Do you need more hands?

919
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,280
It's just keeping the sides together. It's set inside.

920
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,400
- Shall I put my hands...? 
- No, it's coming off. It's lifting off, man.

921
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,560
Ah... You're twisting it!

922
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,320
That's all right. Let go.

923
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,880
- OK? 
- No, look...!

924
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,320
Oh, it looks so close.

925
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,440
That's it.

926
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,440
What a shame.

927
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,760
Taxi!

928
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,000
This is the start of Victoria's Crown.

929
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,280
OK, bakers, one minute!

930
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,920
Ian, you've got one minute to do the coronation of that sponge!

931
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,960
Flipping heck...!

932
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,480
APPLAUSE

933
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,920
Very good.

934
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,840
Bakers, time is very much up.

935
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,680
My gelatine's not set properly yet.

936
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,120
Paul and Mary are looking for a stately charlotte russe

937
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,680
of perfectly set jelly and silky bavarois,

938
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,400
circled by shapely sponge fingers.

939
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,080
- Flora, are you OK to bring yours up? 
- Yes.

940
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,240
I think the definition in your sponges are good.

941
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,320
They look like lady's fingers. I think they look really nice.

942
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,320
Ooh...

943
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,200
Well, we've got very, very distinctive layers there.

944
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,560
The actual bavarois...

945
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,280
..is rich, creamy.

946
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,520
It's lovely.

947
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,480
I like the jelly. It's quite boozy!

948
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,600
The bavarois itself tastes amazing.

949
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,920
Your pomegranate and raspberry jelly...

950
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,560
Pomegranate will always lose out to raspberry.

951
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,680
It's never going to bring anything to the table, bar grit.

952
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,280
And, to be honest, because you've got the jelly,

953
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,840
which is carrying that lovely champagne flavour to it,

954
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,040
the bavarois is beautiful

955
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,480
and then you go and ruin it by adding those sharp flavours.

956
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,800
I don't think you'll do pomegranate again, will you?

957
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,840
- No. 
- Thank you.

958
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,320
The general appearance is absolutely lovely.

959
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,600
You've slightly overlapped your sponge fingers.

960
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,560
- I think they're a bit flat. 
- Yeah.

961
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,680
They've just opened up a bit too much,

962
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,200
because it doesn't really look like a lady's finger.

963
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,640
MEL: Oh, hello, sailor.

964
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,000
The layers look fantastic.

965
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,880
Clear, definitive colours.

966
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,520
Oh, Nadiya...

967
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,960
I love it.

968
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,800
The raspberry bavarois is so light,

969
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,080
it's like a mousse.

970
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,080
Likewise with the mango.

971
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,840
They're beautiful consistencies,

972
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,120
they're airy, they're creamy.

973
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,720
They're very good indeed.

974
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,400
- Well done. Thank you. 
- Thank you.

975
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,440
Paul, do you want to come up?

976
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,720
The fruit design on the bottom, very Victorian.

977
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,880
Would have been nice to have had one on the top,

978
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,360
but it looks...

979
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,920
..a little bit watery.

980
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,720
We'll have to test that and see.

981
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,360
There goes the river.

982
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,520
We have a sauce on top, not a jelly.

983
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,200
I think you've got too much gelatine in that bavarois.

984
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,880
The flavour's great, though. The sponges are excellent.

985
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,680
The almond really comes through.

986
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,520
The jelly is very sweet.

987
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,800
And it's not set.

988
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,800
Ian, do you want to bring charlotte up to the table?

989
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,880
I think it looks spectacular. Queen Victoria would be proud.

990
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,200
Oh-ho!

991
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,240
- Oh... 
- Wowzers!

992
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,320
We've got wonderful layers there.

993
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,520
Spectacular, mate. I mean, really...

994
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,320
From the sponge finger, crispy on the outside,

995
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,480
beautiful and soft on the inside.

996
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,160
The bavarois holds.

997
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,520
Not too much gelatine, so it falls apart, it's silky smooth.

998
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,720
You have the jelly consistency without being too rubbery.

999
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,640
- And again, the flavour's coming through. 
- Great.

1000
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,000
That is purely magical.

1001
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,320
Brilliant. Thank you.

1002
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,800
- You've had some issues with it. It's split. 
- Yeah, it split.

1003
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,640
And the sponge fingers around the outside are too close together.

1004
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,120
There's no definition between one and another.

1005
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,760
The piping of the cream...

1006
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,240
I just think it's a little bit...

1007
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,920
- rushed. 
- Mm. 
- That's what it looks like. 
- Yeah.

1008
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,640
- If you can hold that sponge finger in, please? 
- Got it, my love.

1009
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,680
Lovely.

1010
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,960
- The jelly on the top really hasn't quite set. 
- No.

1011
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:34,200
It may not have set, but it's true strawberry flavour.

1012
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,760
Bavarois is delicious.

1013
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,280
I love this challenge.

1014
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,760
It's the best one ever!

1015
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,960
It's very light, it's airy, it's creamy.

1016
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,960
You've got all the elements there for a fantastic charlotte russe.

1017
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,840
I just think you've lost it on all counts,

1018
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,320
except for the filling, the bavarois,

1019
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,120
- because that is delicious. 
- Good.

1020
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,240
- Thank you, Mat. 
- No worries. Cheers.

1021
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,760
Tamal, your sponge fingers,

1022
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:12,040
you've done this distinctive design and it does look very, very special.

1023
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,120
Macarons look good.

1024
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,880
Oooh, sir...!

1025
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,040
Now, you've managed without putting any sponge.

1026
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,680
You didn't need to stabilise it. It looks fine to me.

1027
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,200
You've got some lovely flavours there.

1028
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,920
The rosewater and the cardamom together,

1029
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,560
they're two tricky little flavour combinations

1030
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,040
that, actually, you've got it perfectly balanced.

1031
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,040
It's creamy, it's silky, it melts in the mouth.

1032
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,560
That is beautiful.

1033
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:46,080
The fact that you managed to keep the rigidity in the charlotte russe

1034
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,560
by just using the jelly

1035
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,000
is extremely clever and the flavours are gorgeous.

1036
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,200
- Thank you. 
- Thank you.

1037
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,400
I think they liked it.

1038
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,680
Paul and Mary must now decide who deserves Star Baker

1039
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,640
and who will leave.

1040
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,040
Flora had a middling day yesterday, didn't she?

1041
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,680
She was fourth in the Technical.

1042
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,880
Although the flavours were pretty good today,

1043
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,240
I think the addition of the raspberry and pomegranate

1044
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,440
just didn't work.

1045
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,720
Paul, with his pouring jelly, just isn't satisfactory.

1046
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,000
You can't have a jelly like that.

1047
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,960
Mat is certainly in a bit of trouble, isn't he?

1048
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,720
Because he was, of course, last in the Technical Challenge.

1049
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,680
The whole thing had split.

1050
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,400
Well, he went for it being very simple,

1051
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,560
but even that didn't work for him.

1052
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,600
So, for me, I think at the bottom,

1053
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,720
I would say Paul and Mat are in trouble.

1054
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,360
OK. Do you know who you might pick as Star Baker? Any clue?

1055
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,560
I have at the moment.

1056
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,400
- Oh... 
- I think I've got one.

1057
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,880
Well, while you're doing that, Mel and I are going to enjoy

1058
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,080
some of Paul's apple swans

1059
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,400
or maybe a banana mongoose.

1060
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,000
Bakers, what a joy!

1061
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,880
I get the fun job of saying who has got the illustrious title

1062
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,600
of Star Baker this week.

1063
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,080
These challenges have been tough in Victorian week.

1064
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,520
They've involved care, they've needed attention to detail

1065
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,120
and patience.

1066
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,000
And so it's entirely fitting that Star Baker this week

1067
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
is a man who is incredibly used to PATIENTS.

1068
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,040
Congratulations, lovely Tamal.

1069
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,760
You're this week's Star Baker.

1070
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,880
Oh, I don't like this bit at all.

1071
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,520
We can't progress to next week with all of you, sadly.

1072
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,840
So I'm really, really sorry to say

1073
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,400
that the person who won't be coming with us next week is...

1074
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,600
..Mat.

1075
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,160
We're going to miss you.

1076
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,200
Lovely Mat!

1077
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,880
- The tallest baker in the world! 
- Aww!

1078
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,280
- Thank you. Thanks a lot. 
- What a joy to have you.

1079
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,080
'That's it. All done, yeah.'

1080
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,520
Obviously, I'm sad to be going,

1081
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,440
but it's definitely the right decision.

1082
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,080
'Yeah, brilliantly proud.

1083
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,080
'Got a lot further than I thought I ever would.'

1084
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,160
You know, I got to week seven, I got a Star Baker.

1085
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,600
Yeah, I'll get back into baking. I'll have to now.

1086
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,000
People will want loads of cake and stuff made for them.

1087
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,520
I best start charging, I reckon.

1088
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,200
Keep praying. Keep praying. It's all good.

1089
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,320
Didn't know what I was doing, it's gone all right.

1090
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,080
I think we've just entered a realm in Mat's baking world

1091
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,160
that he just wasn't comfortable with

1092
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,520
and the problem is, when you have three challenges

1093
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,560
and two of which you slip up on, you can't do that.

1094
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,960
We're coming up to the quarterfinals now.

1095
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,520
Oh, you'll be sorry.

1096
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,200
'That was a close call. Definitely. I can't afford to do that next week.'

1097
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,680
It's not nice. Someone's got to go, it's a competition,

1098
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,000
but I did feel relieved.

1099
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,760
I'm so happy.

1100
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,520
- I'm so pleased for you. 
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

1101
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,440
I can't wait to ring my parents.

1102
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,800
Hello, Mum. Guess what? I got Star Baker!

1103
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,040
- 'Sorry?' 
- I got Star Baker!

1104
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,360
'Oh, my God!'

1105
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,080
Tamal's been knocking on the door of Star Baker now for weeks.

1106
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,440
Finally, he's got it.

1107
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,600
It will boost his confidence and, when he comes back next week,

1108
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:24,560
I think he'll be working very, very hard to keep up his standards.

1109
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,560
So this was one of my secret aims that I haven't told anyone.

1110
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,840
But the aims were don't go out in week one,

1111
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,040
make something that they think is tasty,

1112
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,720
get Star Baker once.

1113
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,040
And I've done it.

1114
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,040
And, yeah, it's great.

1115
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,200
Next time, it's the quarterfinal.

1116
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,880
No. I can only taste fear in my mouth right now.

1117
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,560
And the bakers face their biggest pastry demons...

1118
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,640
I have to get some puff pastry out, whatever kind it is.

1119
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,520
..tackle some high-end French patisserie...

1120
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,560
They should be sheer perfection.

1121
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,600
I really don't know what I'm doing here.

1122
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,840
Ow!

1123
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,760
..and push show-stopping choux pastry to a whole new height.

1124
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,880
Come on...!

1125
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,960
Practised it and it looked beautiful for about five minutes

1126
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,680
and then just made a gentle topple down.

1127
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,960
Oh, I'm too nervous for construction.
