1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,440
We have been watching a whole new batch of bakers,

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,240
but how did last year's 12 look back at their time on Bake Off?

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,520
It's just one panic after another, isn't it?

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,440
We'll discover what it was like to be the class of 2014.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,760
It is the culmination of a lifetime baking.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,120
It will be the biggest thing I have ever done,

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,480
apart from, you know, giving birth and all those weird things.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,480
It is twice the size.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,320
Last year's bakers will be divulging their secrets...

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,120
I think we all learnt by watching. It needs to wrap around, doesn't it?

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,640
Stop looking over!

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,680
..and revealing their life since.

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,080
What has happened afterwards has opened up a world to me

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,960
that I could have only dreamed of.

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,320
- Too sweet for me. 
- We take a measure of Mary's meticulous gaze...

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,120
- Is this fondant? 
- Yes. 
- Absolutely top marks for flavouring.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,560
..and a dollop of Paul's digit of doom...

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,440
- The side is raw. 
- It's raw?

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,160
..and a heaped spoonful of Mel and Sue.

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,040
It is like a piles cushion, isn't it?

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,640
In no way can we allow that to be shown on television!

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,400
We will share their triumphs...

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,320
- It is what I call a Showstopper. 
- I shall walk out of here on air!

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,400
..learn from their disasters...

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,560
- Oh, no! 
- Starting again.

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,440
..and find out what really happened with the baked Alaska.

27
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,840
- I took it out of the freezer. 
- Where's my ice cream?

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,000
Argh!

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't even like baked Alaskas.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,400
No, no, no...

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,520
This is the class of 2014's recipe for success.

32
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,680
Yeah, looks quite good. I'll have a taste of it in a minute.

33
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,960
Among thousands of hopefuls, just 12 of the country's most talented

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,160
home bakers made it through to compete

35
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,640
in 2014's Great British Bake Off.

36
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,760
30 challenges stood between the bakers and the winner's title,

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,640
but nothing was more nerve-racking than their first day

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,200
in the iconic white tent.

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,920
I can remember driving up in the taxi

40
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,680
and you could just see the points of the tent in the distance.

41
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,440
Oh, my God, I think we all screamed.

42
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,840
It was just like, "Oh, God, the tent! The tent!"

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,160
All of us walked in thinking,

44
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,320
"I'm the only one who has gotten here by accident.

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,280
"They are going to find me out."

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,360
Everything just suddenly dawns on you,

47
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,600
what you have actually decided to put yourself through.

48
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,880
I am not one to duck a challenge but I wanted to turn and run,

49
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,440
I think I really did.

50
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,120
Paul and Mary and Mel and Sue finally arrived.

51
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,760
I was like to the other one, "Oh, my God, it is Mary and Paul!"

52
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,200
Bakers, welcome to the Bake Off tent.

53
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,840
I realised that actually this was very serious

54
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,400
and I had to actually make something in this very unfamiliar environment.

55
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,640
Today you have got your first ever Signature Challenge.

56
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,920
Paul and Mary would love you to make Swiss rolls.

57
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,360
- Very good luck, everybody. 
- On your marks... 
- Get set... 
- Bake!

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,240
By the time that "on your marks, get set, bake" happened,

59
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,520
I was in such a panic that all I was doing

60
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,800
was just trying to think, "Right, flour.

61
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,920
"I don't even know where everything is." It was just pure panic.

62
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
I didn't know what I was doing.

63
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,960
SHE GASPS

64
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,680
You have no idea what you are going to be up against.

65
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,960
You have no idea who anybody else is,

66
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,920
what they are going to be capable of.

67
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,240
Baking. We know how to bake, don't we?

68
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,760
We do. Only thing we know.

69
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,320
It's only a cake. I keep telling myself it's only a cake.

70
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,640
Nobody wanted to go home in the first week and I think we just

71
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,760
wanted to do something right so we don't have to go home.

72
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,440
The bakers had to get their sponges absolutely right.

73
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,840
Fingers crossed.

74
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,400
But this was the first time they had used their ovens.

75
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,760
So tempted just to watch it for the whole time whilst it is baking.

76
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,000
You are so worried about opening your oven

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,400
and letting the camera see what's inside it...

78
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,320
Still going to give it half a minute.

79
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,840
..that I just kept saying, "No, another minute,"

80
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,560
and they kept saying, "Is it ready? Let us know when it is ready."

81
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,600
"Yeah, another minute. You'd better go over there, film someone else,"

82
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,760
thinking I could do it while they weren't looking.

83
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,440
It is just on the edge, yeah. It is literally a few seconds.

84
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,880
Actually, what happened is I left it in way too long

85
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,400
and it was a little bit dry.

86
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,040
Done already.

87
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,840
It had just come out of the oven...

88
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,440
You can smell the aniseed.

89
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh!

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,240
All of a sudden, I went hazy visioned

91
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,000
and felt like there was a whole weight on me.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,040
I had to actually pull myself out of it and think,

93
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,960
"Don't go under here now," you know, "I need to make a Swiss roll."

94
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,120
The bakers had varying approaches to their roll.

95
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,600
I am just going to make a little slash then it rolls tightly.

96
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,760
- But Iain had a very different technique. 
- Why have you done that?

97
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,240
Because if you score it, it prevents it cracking when you roll it.

98
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,720
- I want to see you do this, then. 
- OK.

99
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,640
We're going to be standing here for the next ten minutes, Mary.

100
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,200
But this is a new theory to me.

101
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,280
- SUE: 
- You're doing multiple scoring! 
- Oh, yes.

102
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,440
This is one of the most monitored rolls in the history

103
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,120
of Swiss roll-making.

104
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,120
My Swiss roll technique did get a bit of abuse.

105
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,200
Mary, don't be inscrutable. Be loving, be loving.

106
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,560
- Leave him alone! Thank you very much indeed. 
- Thank you.

107
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,240
With these knives being so sharp, I think I over scored it.

108
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,600
It's a little bit...

109
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,400
Argh!

110
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,800
I never had it cracking at home

111
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,760
so I think it is just one of the things, the tension in the tent.

112
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,760
- You know where you went wrong? 
- Yes.

113
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,840
- Your theory of putting all those cuts across... 
- All the way along.

114
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,200
I don't think it helps one little bit.

115
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,680
Iain wasn't the only one affected by first week nerves.

116
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,280
I've got the shakes.

117
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,120
I have never actually got nervous about anything before, I think,

118
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,720
until I started making that Swiss roll. My hands just started shaking.

119
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,200
I have never experienced that before.

120
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,160
- Stop shaking. 
- Sorry.

121
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,040
- Stop shaking, it's OK. It's looking good. 
- It's falling out!

122
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,440
My Swiss roll, it was awful.

123
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,800
Even I could see that it looked a little bit like it had

124
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,600
cat sick in it.

125
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,200
I tried to make it look better by putting an orange tree

126
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,800
on my Swiss roll in fondant.

127
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,480
It looked like something from the deep had come up

128
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,040
and grasped on to this Swiss roll and was going to pull it

129
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,240
back down into the depths of hell where it belonged.

130
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,800
I think I knew at that point that it was all

131
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,880
just going downhill from there.

132
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,040
The orange is coming through. The cream is a little bit non-descript.

133
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,720
I quite liked the cream.

134
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,120
You stand up for what you think is right!

135
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,800
You are wrong, but I'll tell you what it is,

136
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,240
the orange is so strong that no matter what you put with it,

137
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,480
it was going to get kicked into touch.

138
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,520
THUNDER RUMBLES

139
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,240
Things didn't get any better for Claire during the Showstopper.

140
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,280
Oh, Claire, look what you have done!

141
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,880
Absolutely no idea.

142
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,960
The challenge demanded 36 identical miniature cakes.

143
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,480
At home, I had spent a long time getting that recipe right.

144
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,360
But then on the day, I just don't know what happened.

145
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,040
I know I measured every...

146
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,080
Well, I do know what happened - I was rubbish!

147
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,120
I don't know how she is going to recover that.

148
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,600
I am making some lighter chocolate and cherry cake that I can

149
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,040
cut out into circles that will hopefully cook a tiny bit quicker.

150
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,800
It can happen to all of us at home in our own kitchen

151
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,400
and for it to happen when it is important, I felt sorry for her.

152
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,120
There was just chocolate and hundreds and thousands

153
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,240
and cherries and all sorts all over my desk.

154
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,160
- I mean, it looks a bit clumsy. 
- They are both dry.

155
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,080
You do kind of think, "Is there a little pinprick of hope here?"

156
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,840
They might see some kind of creative or culinary expertise

157
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,400
in their midst of my disaster.

158
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,560
- But they didn't. 
- Claire.

159
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,200
I'm so sorry, Claire. Come and have a massive sandwich.

160
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,080
Like, a big, big Mel-Sue sandwich.

161
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,680
One out of the 12 went,

162
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,040
the other 11 heaved a big sigh of relief that it wasn't them.

163
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,240
- All the best, guys. 
- And to you, all the best. 
- Good luck.

164
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,480
Throughout the series, the Challenge the bakers feared most...

165
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,760
I feel sick.

166
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,040
..involved a gingham cloth and a meagre set of instructions.

167
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,720
Technicals are like nothing else on earth.

168
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,120
They are your worst nightmare. They are just awful.

169
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,360
You are trying to sort of look through the cloth and try

170
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,800
and figure out what piece of equipment was there,

171
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,360
what the ingredients were, while you were waiting.

172
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,640
You really had to keep an eye on the instructions they give you.

173
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,120
The recipe is sparse.

174
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,320
They do give you everything you need if you read them

175
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,720
at least three times.

176
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,360
Well, it says "prepare the cherries".

177
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,440
We don't know what "prepare" means.

178
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,640
Does she mean wash? Does she mean cut?

179
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,280
See, there's the mystery. One egg white, beaten.

180
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,600
It's not in there.

181
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,200
My daughter said, "Treat it as if you are in a school exam

182
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,880
"and read all the question."

183
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,000
The challenges were not just tough,

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,520
they were recipes few of the bakers had ever heard of.

185
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,240
They were getting more and more obscure as the weeks went on.

186
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,800
So, bakers, you will be baking a Schichttorte.

187
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,920
- What? 
- A Schichttorte.

188
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,200
- Well, they might make a good one. Who are you to say that? 
- I know.

189
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,840
Listen, it is a little German tricky patisserie.

190
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,440
As usual, it is something that we have never heard of.

191
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,520
A Schichttorte was a German layered cake and there were a lot of layers.

192
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,680
20 layers?

193
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,720
But that wasn't the only unusual thing about the Schichttorte.

194
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,760
It is a grilled cake. That is going to be the tricky thing.

195
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,080
Who grills a cake? I mean, for God's sake.

196
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,000
I have got the grill on full whack so it should be pretty hot in there.

197
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:01,840
We needed the grill on for something like 45 minutes and for 20 layers.

198
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,920
I have got still ten layers to go.

199
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,320
I have already lost count of layers.

200
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,600
- 20. 
- Yes! 
- We are in, we are done.

201
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,640
- Let's get it in there. 
- Boom!

202
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,840
Might not get 20. Who's counting? As if.

203
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,000
He is going to be counting, all right.

204
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,560
We are going to start with this one. Right...

205
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,240
Oh, he's actually counting them.

206
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,000
- Is he going to count all 20 on all of them? 
- I need to brace myself.

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,960
He's Paul, that's what he gets fun from!

208
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,000
18 layers on that one.

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,160
Very, very good layers.

210
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,840
Life is too short.

211
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,880
Life is too short to count layers in cakes.

212
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,200
That's got 20!

213
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,800
As the challenges became more complicated, there was

214
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,880
one the bakers struggled even to pronounce.

215
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,600
What was it called? Oh, my God.

216
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,080
A Queen Aman.

217
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,560
Queen Amon?

218
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,240
Queen Aman. I still can't say it.

219
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,360
It is called a coo-gin aman. Is it?

220
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,200
Oh, the coogi... Kofi Annans!

221
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,640
- Kouign-amann. 
- Kouign-amann.

222
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,560
- You know which country it's from? 
- Breton. 
- Breton isn't a country.

223
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,480
- Well, it used to be a... Whatever it was. 
- Province? 
- Province, thank you.

224
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,360
They used to have amazing lace

225
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,600
and they would wear Breton Coiffe, which are stiff...

226
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,560
Sorry, there's something happening.

227
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,000
..stiff lace hats and they would do special dancing.

228
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,680
But it was in European cake week that the trickiest technical

229
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,120
ever was crowned.

230
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,960
It is three layers of sponge, it is filled with creme pat and jam.

231
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,440
It has got a dome of whipped cream on the top.

232
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,400
On top of that, it has got some green marzipan

233
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,760
and don't forget a little rose plonked on the top.

234
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,920
Prinsesstarta, oh!

235
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,000
Amazing, amazing technical challenge,

236
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,880
one which I failed at miserably.

237
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,360
I'm quite far behind.

238
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,120
Speed is of the essence, my love.

239
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,800
You are doing well.

240
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,840
Some people are getting quite stressed.

241
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,960
This is not going to happen, is it?

242
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,720
- This is hilarious. 
- I know, it's ridiculous.

243
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,640
I think if I try and cover it all in one go, it will just squidge.

244
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,240
Green marzipan - no. Don't do green marzipan.

245
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Everyone called mine the bin lid because it was so hideous.

246
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,840
- I couldn't think of another way of doing it. 
- I remember Kate's bin lid.

247
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,440
Poor thing, I think it haunts her nightmares.

248
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,760
It wasn't mean to say that because it's not a bin lid,

249
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,200
you know, it's just a hat.

250
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,320
Paul, Mary, a whole shed load of princesses await.

251
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,800
This one is more square, isn't it?

252
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,760
The marzipan has been put over not a very smooth top.

253
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,520
- The lid actually comes away from the base, look. 
- Well spied. 
- OK.

254
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,280
I think I should get a prize for the worst technical

255
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,520
- bake in the history of Bake Off. 
- Interesting. 
- And it is collapsing.

256
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,440
And the creme pat is not set.

257
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,520
- And once you cut the cake, it is not holding up. 
- Yeah.

258
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,960
I can honestly say that I will never ever make one again.

259
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,080
When their baking knowledge let them down,

260
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,360
the bakers found a way through the technicals any way they could.

261
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,920
I absolutely looked at other people's technicals.

262
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,240
- Why wouldn't you? 
- See what everyone else is doing.

263
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,280
The way the benches are arranged is that you are

264
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,320
always staring at the person in front of you, so it is only natural.

265
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,600
I have got a commanding view this time.

266
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,000
Last time I was at the front, last week. Better here.

267
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,880
You can see what is going on.

268
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,320
We heard a mention, "When in doubt, copy Nancy," and it bore true.

269
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,000
Clingfilm and then roll over the top of it.

270
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,360
You do know, by the way, that behind you is Richard

271
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,280
- and everything you do, he looks at you. He is your wingman. 
- Yeah.

272
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,960
Listen, I'm just going to tell Richard

273
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,840
because it is easier than him just watching, OK? Is that all right?

274
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,480
Then he can get on.

275
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,760
Richard, I think, took advantage of me once or twice,

276
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,320
- but he was quite open about it. 
- So, what has she done then?

277
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,240
Right, I'll tell you what Nancy has done.

278
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,680
- We are getting good length, aren't we? 
- How much length do you want?

279
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,120
- Well, it needs to wrap... 
- The same as Nancy's!

280
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,720
- It needs to wrap around, doesn't it? 
- Stop looking over!

281
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,160
This is terrible - did you used to do this in your exams?

282
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,200
Of course I did.

283
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,640
The thing is, his will be better than mine, at the end of it.

284
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,560
- Listen, it's not a competition. 
- SHE LAUGHS

285
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,840
Ooh, hang on...

286
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,960
..but there were times

287
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,120
when relying on the other bakers was more confusing than helpful.

288
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,720
If someone had to take something out of a proving drawer,

289
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,120
or pop it out the oven,

290
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,960
that period of just sitting and watching

291
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
to see who's going to crack first...

292
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,920
See, that's an hour. TIMER BEEPS

293
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,520
Someone's going to break the seal - someone's going to do it.

294
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,360
You've got to keep an eye out.

295
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,040
Jordan's taken his out.

296
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,800
Every time someone would break,

297
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,280
and then there'd be an avalanche of people...

298
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,800
..and one sneaky, clever person just waiting for an extra five minutes,

299
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,520
and they were the ones who usually won!

300
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,720
Are you just going to wait? Just hang on?

301
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,960
Till the last second.

302
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,760
Despite keeping a close eye on each other's techniques,

303
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,040
it soon became clear that all the bakers

304
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,960
had their own, very distinct style...

305
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Yeah, I'm just flattening out the haggis

306
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,600
to go in the bottom of the pie.

307
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,520
I think, very definitely, each of us

308
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,720
brought our own backgrounds with us,

309
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,160
and used them as boons in the tent.

310
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,000
Normski, can you address the haggis?

311
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,760
Er, "Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face,

312
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,840
"Great chieftain o' the puddin'-race!

313
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,160
"Weel are ye worthy o' a grace

314
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,560
"As lang's my arm."

315
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,640
I ken you're awfy smelly, but you'll soon be doon ma belly.

316
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,760
That's what made it so much of a fun competition -

317
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,560
if everyone came with the same baggage,

318
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,640
we'd all make the same cakes, wouldn't we?

319
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,200
..and Chetna's particular strength...

320
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,200
- Your spices, the volume of spices you put in there... 
- Yeah.

321
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,520
..was frankly staggering.

322
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,840
..earned her a nickname.

323
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,000
Flavour Queen! Yes, yeah!

324
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,920
I'm doing white bread with onion and fresh curry leaves,

325
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,720
and a lot of spices.

326
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,680
Surprise, surprise!

327
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,840
Wonderful flavours, and they all blend together.

328
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,200
It was really lovely to hear it.

329
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,240
The first week, I think I made the cardamom in the Swiss roll...

330
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,720
I'm just using what I've grown up eating.

331
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,800
Home cooking, if you can say.

332
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,800
I just wasn't sure how it will be accepted.

333
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,080
The flavours are good.

334
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,320
The cardamom doesn't come through till you've just finished,

335
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,280
and it's just the right amount.

336
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,480
I felt a bit more confident the next week,

337
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,920
when I went in with the savoury biscuits, I remember.

338
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,280
It's really aromatic. They're great, aren't they?

339
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,920
The flavour of that carom seed as well - gorgeous.

340
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,760
SHE SIGHS

341
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,080
..and if Chetna was the Queen of Flavours,

342
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,440
Norman was the King of Simplicity...

343
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,880
I mean, I was brought up on cod's head broth

344
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,680
and brose and oatmeal, and that sort of stuff.

345
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,920
I thought pesto was very exotic!

346
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,640
I would be the first to admit the stuff was quite plain and simple.

347
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,360
If you opt to bake something simple, I think it HAS to be good.

348
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,800
These might be at the bottom of the list as far as taste is concerned,

349
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,240
but I like them.

350
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,680
..and he was right on the money

351
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,840
with his plain but elegant farthing biscuits...

352
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,880
It looks a lovely texture when you open it.

353
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,920
- I like them. I like that biscuit a lot. 
- Thank you.

354
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,960
Very professional.

355
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,520
- I think the recipe, the way you've approached it... 
- Uh-huh.

356
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,800
- You could sell those tomorrow. 
- Thank you very much.

357
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,880
- I really believe you could sell them tomorrow. 
- OK - at a farthing each!

358
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,280
LAUGHTER

359
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,320
SHE MOUTHS

360
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,280
He was always the person that I would go to

361
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,680
if I was ever feeling a little bit like it was all too much,

362
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,960
because he would be there with a plain shortbread

363
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,840
going, "It's going to be fine, Martha."

364
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,920
Then I'd be like,

365
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,480
"Anything I make is fine - it's all going to be great!"

366
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,680
..but it became impossible to keep it simple

367
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,400
AND meet Mary and Paul's high standards.

368
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,800
You kept it simple.

369
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,880
I think it's just a little bit simple.

370
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,840
You're playing it so safe that, actually, you're beginning to fail.

371
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,880
Poor guy - started off really basic,

372
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,760
and then one week they were all, "Go exotic, go exotic,"

373
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,280
and then one week he goes exotic,

374
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,520
he goes all out there with some lavender...

375
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,640
- This tastes of lavender! 
- It does.

376
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,240
It really tastes...REALLY tastes of lavender.

377
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,360
Poor Norman!

378
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,480
He had three pies in a Pieffel Tower,

379
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,360
and he had a label on it, and everything,

380
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,080
and his own pottery displaying it.

381
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,600
He was telling me all about it, and I just thought, "That's a winner!

382
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,920
"It sounds right."

383
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,200
But I just think he just put that tiny bit too much in!

384
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,160
- I'll, try the meringue first. 
- OK.

385
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,800
What's in that egg white?

386
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,360
- Lavender. 
- Lavender?!

387
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,520
HE COUGHS

388
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,440
It's probably a little bit too powerful.

389
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,600
We all tasted a little bit of the lavender meringue

390
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,520
just to make sure that Paul and Mary weren't overexaggerating,

391
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,400
and we did all have to get a glass of water quite quickly!

392
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,720
- NORMAN: 
- In retrospect, that was a big mistake,

393
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,240
and things might have turned out quite differently

394
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,480
if I hadn't done that.

395
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,880
Unlike Norman, Diana was never tempted to go exotic.

396
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,160
I was a traditional baker.

397
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,080
I think just to change - purely for the programme -

398
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,400
would have been a mistake.

399
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,520
The flavour of it is absolutely gorgeous.

400
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,800
The combination of the flavours is perfect,

401
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,720
and, actually, I think that is beautiful.

402
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,600
A good pudding, but not a saucy pudding.

403
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,640
- I think it's fine. 
- Oh, that's fantastic!

404
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,960
I tell you what, I shall walk out of here on air!

405
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,040
The only problem with sticking to being traditional -

406
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,560
you've nowhere to hide.

407
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,680
You can't cover it in anything, you can't... It's what it is.

408
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,280
- The appearance is not very appealing. 
- No.

409
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,880
If you were to take one of these

410
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,400
and get rid of all the extra bit off the side...

411
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,120
- SHE LAUGHS 
- ..like that... 
- Yes.

412
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,080
- See how much prettier that looks? 
- Yeah.

413
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,240
You respect him as a judge,

414
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,560
and he didn't scare me at all.

415
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,960
You should've met some of the WI judges I met 50 years ago.

416
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,040
I still quake at the thought of them.

417
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,960
Diana, you are pushing the boat out with the old swan, aren't you?

418
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,480
Yeah. I am.

419
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,800
Is it going to wilt?

420
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,520
- No. 
- Good.

421
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,360
It must not be a dying swan, Diana.

422
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,040
- No! 
- Don't let it be a dying swan.

423
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,640
I was not happy with what I produced for the show,

424
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,640
and I was, I think, always expecting criticism.

425
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,360
They said I walked with my head down because I was defeatist.

426
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,480
I actually think it looks pretty good, actually.

427
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,600
- Thank you. 
- Impressive.

428
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,640
- You should be very proud of yourself. 
- Thank you.

429
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,840
- You always come to us with your head down... 
- Sorry.

430
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,360
You need to start holding your head

431
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,840
- a little bit further up. 
- Like a swan would. 
- Yes!

432
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,240
You know what? It's this carpet.

433
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,560
I've had a new knee, and I've got those -

434
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,520
I call them "pumps", but they were trainers, weren't they?

435
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,520
And I wanted to look where I was going.

436
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,240
I didn't want to trip up with my Showstopper -

437
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,760
that would have been a Showstopper, wouldn't it, really?

438
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,680
The bakers not only brought their different baking styles

439
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,000
to the tent...

440
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,040
IT BEEPS I'm slightly scared by that - stun...

441
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,520
- 35. 
- 35?!

442
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,040
..they also called upon a whole array of gadgets.

443
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,720
- Shall I do you? 
- I don't know what I am...

444
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,760
- What do I do, just press... 
- On my neck somewhere.

445
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,640
- ..press the button? 
- Yeah.

446
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,520
- And let it go. 
- IT BEEPS

447
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,960
- 35.1. 
- I'm a bit hot. 
- Very good.

448
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,520
- You're sending my temperature up just a wee bit. 
- Hey, oh...

449
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,880
- That 0.1, that's what it is. 
- By 0.1 degree!

450
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,920
Thanks, Norman.

451
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,440
I noticed quite a lot of gadgets around the kitchen -

452
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,000
I thought, "Wow, where did they get one of those from?

453
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,280
"Those people are custom-making equipment."

454
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,760
What the hell is that?!

455
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,480
- I commissioned this, this week. 
- Who'd you commission it from?

456
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,000
Husband again.

457
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,600
I said, "I need something to make them look professional."

458
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,560
Essentially this is a biscuit iron maiden.

459
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,960
That's a skateboard!

460
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,920
What do you normally do, a sponge on a Segway?

461
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,520
Do you always serve things on a...?

462
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
I've done it on a Segway, yes. Now and again.

463
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,040
- You've got 36 of these pipettes... 
- Yes.

464
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,160
Slightly medical.

465
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,560
I have here a guillotine.

466
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,200
- Erm, hang on... 
- What's the guillotine for?

467
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,520
So, me cake lays there,

468
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,840
and then every one's cut in exactly the same place.

469
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,960
- My husband made it. 
- It's very nice, I like that.

470
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,320
I have executed them very well, but I just hope today I can do it.

471
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,240
You're certainly going to execute some cakes with this, aren't you?

472
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,280
Yeah.

473
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,400
- NORMAN: 
- It's a loose-bottom cake tin.

474
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,640
I made this thing with a couple of dowel rods.

475
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,320
- You just pop it on, and they all come out at the same time. 
- Oh!

476
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,160
I'm sorry, I love that. Stormin' Norman.

477
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,400
- Thanks. 
- Good man. I love your gadgetry.

478
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,640
I made a few bits and pieces.

479
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,200
I couldn't keep the construction out of my baking.

480
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,800
I can't help but notice, Richard,

481
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,040
that you've brought a little bit of your day job

482
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,360
to bear on today's bake.

483
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,000
Oh, yeah. It's the eclair stair.

484
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,200
I build stuff for a living.

485
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,320
It was fun to build stuff

486
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,520
and then stick a cake on top of it, it was lovely.

487
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,600
How do people think of these things?

488
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,640
I just don't know.

489
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,120
..but there was only one way to truly succeed in the tent.

490
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,880
Probably made this one about 20 or 30 times.

491
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,240
You've practised it 20 times?!

492
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,440
I haven't practised it - I've made it to eat!

493
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,200
That's fine.

494
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,600
I used to practise... Every waking minute, I was practising.

495
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,400
- CHETNA: 
- Nancy just would practise again and again.

496
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,120
She had this thing of making it once before she came,

497
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,960
and then obviously in the week, as well - I just couldn't do it,

498
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,040
I just couldn't do it.

499
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,400
- MARTHA: 
- It's hard, not knowing what it should be like.

500
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,960
I feel like how I feel in Technicals,

501
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,280
even though this is a bake that I could have practised!

502
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,560
Which isn't very good, cos I could've practised it.

503
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,280
You can do all the planning in the world,

504
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,160
but when you're out there covered in flour,

505
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,760
and there's sugar all over the floor,

506
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,120
sometimes you have to wing it.

507
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,720
MARY: Is it staying how it is, or are you having a syrup or -

508
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,480
- how are you finishing it? 
- I'm... going to wing it again this week.

509
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,720
- You're going to wing it? 
- I'll either do a syrup,

510
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,880
or I'll icing sugar it.

511
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,480
Dangerous thing, week six. Winging it.

512
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,080
The balance between playing it safe and being ambitious

513
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,280
is really difficult.

514
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,200
You only get one chance at the tent

515
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,440
and, unless you jump in with both feet,

516
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,960
then you're kind of missing your chance, aren't you?

517
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,440
Nancy decided to take a hi-tech risk

518
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,560
when it came to proving her fruit bread...

519
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,040
Microwave...

520
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,360
for five minutes on 10% power.

521
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,120
Amazing. I'm coming with.

522
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,560
How do you feel, my love?

523
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,200
Um...bit scared.

524
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,360
Quite a bit scared, because this could be my death knell.

525
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,640
- It's done. 
- OK, right...

526
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,480
GASPS: It's twice the size!

527
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,920
..but would it impress Paul?

528
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,400
What you've got is something that's underproved.

529
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,000
- Or... 
- Really? 
- ..the proteins have indeed been damaged... 
- Heck.

530
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,760
..and then it rips and falls apart.

531
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,160
With a microwave, just using 500g of flour,

532
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,560
you can feed an entire village.

533
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,120
They did like you to make everything yourself -

534
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,280
and not any shop-bought stuff.

535
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,680
Enwezor found that out to his cost.

536
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,520
- ENWEZOR: 
- I think I've got, like, 80 biscuits cut out... 
- 80?!

537
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,560
..and 80 fondant cut-outs, as well,

538
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,040
- to kind of intersperse stuff with, as well. 
- Yeah.

539
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,920
- So... 
- Are you making your own fondant?

540
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,240
Er, no. No, I'm not, no.

541
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,520
"Haven't made it?! What?!

542
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,840
"The fondant is shop-bought?!"

543
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,440
There's not much I can say.

544
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,200
Proper pregnant pause.

545
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,240
- MARY: Is this fondant in between? 
- Fondant, yes. 
- Yes.

546
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,920
"In my tent?!"

547
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,440
SHE TUTS

548
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,280
He did have a lot of fondant.

549
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,920
I would bet quite a lot of money

550
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,720
that Mary does not make her own fondant.

551
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,480
It's such a waste of time - I can't believe she'd ever do it.

552
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,400
I think it's always going through your mind -

553
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,520
"Am I using something here I shouldn't be using?"

554
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,480
Or, "Is this is a shop-bought item I'm using?"

555
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,280
But I was quite confident that I hadn't

556
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,960
because I'd made my own jam for the cakes in the first -

557
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
in fact, I'd gone the extra length

558
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,640
to get the seeds out of the raspberries

559
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,560
before I made the jam, so it was very good.

560
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,760
I did ask them if they thought the jam was all right -

561
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
they thought the jam was very nice, so...

562
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,680
But no amount of self-belief could prepare the bakers

563
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,400
for the reality of life in the tent.

564
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,040
It is really manic behind the scenes,

565
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,280
and the tension in the tent is unbelievable.

566
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,400
I feel under a massive amount of pressure.

567
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,080
Bake Off pushes you past your limits.

568
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,160
Everything is amplified in there...

569
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,200
Argh!

570
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,280
..and you have to concentrate for long, long periods of time,

571
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,720
and you're desperate to get everything right.

572
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,520
It's not a very hot deep-fat fryer,

573
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,520
and it's concerning, to say the least...

574
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,360
..and if I put more in, I lower the temperature.

575
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,160
I'm just going to have to...

576
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,720
I don't know what to do.

577
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,480
Argh! I don't know whether mine are going to be cooked.

578
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,520
- I feel like I've missed something. 
- Yeah, I know!

579
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,640
HE LAUGHS

580
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,880
Perhaps in the confines of our own kitchen,

581
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,680
in our own surroundings, we can do everything great.

582
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,520
This tent does crazy things.

583
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,600
Where are the cherries?

584
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,840
I really don't know where those cherries have gone.

585
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,640
There's no cherries on the top - they have to be in there somewhere.

586
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,880
- There's a couple. 
- There are very, very few cherries.

587
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,640
I don't know where they've gone.

588
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Stuff just seems to disappear.

589
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,920
I keep placing my things...

590
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,360
Scissors, scissors, scissors.

591
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,560
Not sure if it's your brain is working so quickly

592
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,520
that you can't actually keep track of where you've put everything...

593
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,440
- What have you done? 
- Some of them are fig, and some of them are apricot,

594
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,800
and it's meant to alternate...

595
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,120
But I think I've forgotten where I've put them. Oh, no!

596
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,440
- I have no idea. 
- Um...smell them. Smell them.

597
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,760
Smell. Figure, apricot.

598
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,360
- Ooh, I've got flour in my nose, now. 
- That's... That's just...

599
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,720
I'm just getting dough.

600
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,280
They were supposed to alternate,

601
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,160
and they were just all the same, in a row!

602
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,240
I don't think I've alternated them.

603
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,760
I think I might have had a mix-up with alternation.

604
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,760
- Oh, you've got two the same. 
- Oh!

605
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,920
Oh, that's embarrassing.

606
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,080
There is definitely apricot in there somewhere!

607
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,240
Rip all the legs off!

608
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,600
- Oh, there's one. 
- There's one. 
- Got one.

609
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,240
Time just gets swallowed up.

610
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,240
It vanishes in the link of an eye.

611
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,200
One moment you've got 20 minutes left,

612
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,040
and the next moment you're done.

613
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,480
Are you staying on time?

614
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,080
Am I on time? I don't know.

615
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,200
I don't know whether I'm Arthur or Martha this afternoon.

616
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,640
Bakers of the 3-D Biscuit Challenge,

617
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,000
in terms of time dimension, you've got 30 left.

618
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,800
30 units of time - each unit being a minute...

619
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,280
in dimensional terms.

620
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,720
All you can see is the timer ticking down. Gosh.

621
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,880
You're halfway through - it's half-time.

622
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,240
Bring out the dancing girls and the orange segments!

623
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,800
I've got the shakes.

624
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,720
What do you mean, there've been budget cuts?

625
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,520
You start, and then somebody says, "Five minutes left!"

626
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,160
And you think, "What?!"

627
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm up to the wire.

628
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,840
Come on, come on!

629
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,560
OK, bakers, halfway through.

630
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,800
Halfway through.

631
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,560
Certainly haven't got time to measure. That'll do.

632
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,960
Bakers, one minute left on the clock.

633
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,080
Hah!

634
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,560
- BOTH: 
- Ten, nine, eight, seven,

635
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,440
six, five, four,

636
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,920
three, two, one...

637
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,960
Whatever pressure the bakers were under,

638
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,440
there was always some light relief in the shape of Mel and Sue.

639
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,720
Welcome to the 2014 Euro Bake Off.

640
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,480
Amsterdam, can we have your points, please?

641
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,240
- Amster... 
- Hello, Melanie, and this is the Amsterdam jury.

642
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,440
I want to say thank you for having such a groovy show,

643
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,040
and everybody in the Netherlands really enjoying themselves tonight.

644
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,760
So, the votes from the jury -

645
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,560
we have British bakers with the 12 points.

646
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,080
Love Mel and Sue.

647
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,160
- MIMICKING KENNETH WILLIAMS: Ohh! 
- Ohh!

648
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,560
- BOTH: 
- So saucy!

649
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,560
I think they make the experience in the tent that much more special.

650
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,040
# Savoury biscuits

651
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,640
# I'm gonna sing it

652
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,920
# Savoury biscuits. # Sorry.

653
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,560
I needn't have baked - I just enjoyed their company!

654
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,640
It's not gone unnoticed

655
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,320
that you've been doing a little bit of semaphore in your, um...

656
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,000
- in your free time. 
- Yeah, well, I was teaching them last night.

657
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,720
So, how would you semaphore "bake", for example?

658
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,040
- It's B... 
- B.

659
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,640
- ..A... 
- A.

660
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,400
- ..K... 
- K.

661
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,000
- ..and E. 
- You just made that one up!

662
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,800
They just magically appear from nowhere

663
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,760
when you kind of need them.

664
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,000
What are you making?

665
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,040
SHE LAUGHS

666
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,680
In no way is that legal.

667
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,720
In no way can we allow

668
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,320
that to be shown on television.

669
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,240
These remind me of 1988.

670
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,360
They make you feel ill if you look at them too long.

671
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,800
I know - I think it's the old glow stick...

672
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,760
They are the voice of reason in the Bake Off tent.

673
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,120
Without them, we would all be a quivering wreck.

674
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,000
- How's it going? 
- Rubbish.

675
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,880
Martha, don't say that word!

676
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,840
They make it all a little bit less stressful, it has to be said...

677
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,400
- Any enjoyment in this, Luis? 
- No, not really. 
- No? OK.

678
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,080
..and every now and then they come round and say, "Come on.

679
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,360
"Come on - sort it out."

680
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,920
Is it Alien Autopsy Week?

681
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,320
It does feel a bit like that.

682
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,400
Just checking.

683
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,320
They really had a knack of, in your darkest moment in that tent,

684
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,200
of picking you up and reminding you that it's just a cake.

685
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,760
The nut's quite chunky - I don't know

686
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,440
- if that's a good thing or a bad thing. 
- We love chunky nuts here.

687
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,640
You KNOW we love chunky nuts on Bake Off.

688
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,680
HE LAUGHS

689
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,280
That is one hell of a snake.

690
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,800
Mel and Sue do like to eat off your bench.

691
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,360
One, two, three...

692
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,680
They're like little mice that can eat a whole cake.

693
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,480
I'm going to go and get my other thingy.

694
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,800
- Yeah, and I'm going to... 
- Eat!

695
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,200
- ..tidy up some of these. 
- Do eat, please do!

696
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,560
I'd always try and leave some mixture in the bowl,

697
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,680
cos if you don't, they're always putting their fingers in.

698
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,800
Anything that you're going to use,

699
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,520
make sure you keep it within arm's reach,

700
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,600
because anything that was anywhere else,

701
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,200
as far as they were concerned, was theirs.

702
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,000
- That mousse is mine. 
- Get off it! 
- That mousse is mine. 
- Get off it!

703
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,880
I can't believe you've given that to her!

704
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,400
That's mine, that mousse.

705
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,320
Give that back!

706
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,000
I want to get my spatula in there.

707
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,040
Get off!

708
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,160
- My mousse. 
- I did a little netball thing, there...

709
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,880
- My mousse. 
- Oi, that's mine! 
- My mousse.

710
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,720
- Will I see it again? It's... 
- SHE LAUGHS

711
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,160
It's in the lap of the gods, huh?

712
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,080
You did start to think, "Well, I've got the chocolate ganache,

713
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,680
"so I can just cover them in that if it never comes back!"

714
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,240
Got some.

715
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,760
I've got good news and bad news.

716
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,160
Good news, it's great.

717
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,440
Bad news, I've eaten it all.

718
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,400
No-one was safe when Mel developed a taste for pasties...

719
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,360
- Do you mind, Richard? 
- Fill your boots.

720
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,000
- Fill my pockets. 
- Fill your pockets.

721
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,440
- Can I take another one, Luis? 
- Absolutely.

722
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,800
- Thanks, Luis. 
- (For later.) 
- Thank you.

723
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,840
Mel had never-ending pockets that week.

724
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,440
- Kate, would you mind? 
- I wouldn't mind at all!

725
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,560
Who even fits seven pasties in their pockets?

726
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,920
There's no room in the pockets,

727
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,040
- so I'll just... 
- Put it in your mouth. 
- Eat it, yeah.

728
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,720
..and this year, more than ever, there was an awful lot worth eating.

729
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,680
MARY: What perfection. A sheer joy to look at.

730
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,320
It is very, very good. Well thought out. Well done.

731
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,640
Luis' dragon was a work of art.

732
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,480
A lot of Luis' bakes are works of art,

733
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,680
but that one in particular was incredible.

734
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,920
With the biscuits together,

735
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,480
and theming them with the characters, it's unbelievable.

736
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,400
- I'm running out of superlatives. 
- Thank you!

737
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,520
- Well done. 
- Well done. 
- I'm flattered, thank you.

738
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,000
I spent so many hours drawing those templates,

739
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,360
and trying to get them to work, and get them all interlocking -

740
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,680
I couldn't believe it when it was all finished and there in the tent,

741
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,320
and it was almost like relief that it had all come together -

742
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,160
it was a tricky bake, that one.

743
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,880
- It's a great looking pie, that. 
- It's lovely. Absolutely delicious.

744
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,160
Yeah, very good. I like the texture, I like the flavour, too.

745
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,960
Now, that's what I call a sauced pudding.

746
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,160
I think the standard WAS really high.

747
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,920
I would say that - I was in this year!

748
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,280
It did appear that we had some experts in that tent.

749
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,880
I like that a lot.

750
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,520
Mm, as a package, it's a very professional doughnut, actually.

751
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,320
- I think you've cracked it. 
- I'll take that, I'm going to pocket that.

752
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,800
..and impeccable backing brought the ultimate accolade.

753
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,960
Our Star Baker is Nancy.

754
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,480
APPLAUSE

755
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,880
I thought I was an all right baker - you know, that's why I entered.

756
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:22,320
But then, to have national judges giving me Star Baker first week,

757
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,600
I thought, it doesn't get any better than this.

758
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,400
- Luis, you're our Star Baker. 
- APPLAUSE

759
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,920
Thank you very much.

760
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,160
Thank you.

761
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,360
If there was only ever one week I wanted Star Baker,

762
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,440
it was bread week,

763
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,720
cos it's the thing that I really enjoy making the most.

764
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,160
Luis brought a Star Baker badge, and it was fantastic,

765
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,240
because he passed it on to the next Star Baker,

766
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,920
who passed it on the next Star Baker.

767
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,960
APPLAUSE

768
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,960
Well done, Kate!

769
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,560
I loved being Star Baker that week.

770
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,920
It was brilliant.

771
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,640
'But it was Richard who took Star Baker to a new level...'

772
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,600
Richard, you're Star Baker. Well done.

773
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,680
APPLAUSE

774
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,760
'..claiming the title not just twice...'

775
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,120
Richard, for the second time.

776
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,400
- Ooh, well done! 
- APPLAUSE

777
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,640
Well done, Richard.

778
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,760
'..or three times...'

779
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,160
Keep the badge on, Richard.

780
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,360
'..or even four times,

781
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,040
'but a record-breaking five times.'

782
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,520
- Richard, congratulations. Well done. 
- LAUGHTER

783
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,600
When I came into it, I thought, you know,

784
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,240
just being second from last every episode would be fine

785
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,720
to get me through to the final,

786
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,560
but, yeah, I'm not going to say I didn't enjoy getting Star Baker,

787
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,440
cos it was awesome. It was great.

788
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,880
All the bakers wanted to impress the judges

789
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,160
but, for some, Mary was more than just a judge.

790
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,280
Growing up watching Mary teach me kind of everything I know,

791
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,560
and learning from her recipe books and stuff,

792
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,320
to suddenly be making something that she's really going to eat...

793
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,160
It's like the tables have turned,

794
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,880
and I was really nervous about what she'd think about it.

795
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,120
When we first got married, we bought Mary Berry's cookbook,

796
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,040
and that's how I sort of got my fondness for cooking and baking,

797
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,480
and it was a great thrill to meet the lady herself -

798
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,440
and an even bigger thrill for her to praise something that I'd baked.

799
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,760
There was one sure-fire way to please Mary.

800
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,880
MEL: What are you going to fill these with?

801
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,880
I was going to fill them with Baileys.

802
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,520
Ohh...!

803
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,280
So, you'd have the little drink, and the you'd have the doughnut.

804
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,720
- Yeah. 
- Ooh!

805
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,200
Oh-ho-ho!

806
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,640
- MEL: Happy days, eh? 
- Here we go.

807
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,120
- LAUGHTER 
- Here we go.

808
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,720
I mean, why are we bothering with the doughnuts?

809
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,080
LAUGHTER

810
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,600
Here you go. There you go, love.

811
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,760
- There you go. 
- Cheers! 
- Cheers.

812
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,960
- Wahey! 
- Good health.

813
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,720
I always refer to Mary Berry, since I was on the show,

814
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,320
as a sort of cross between the Queen and your nan.

815
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,400
- I'm quite happy with the cinnamon... 
- Mm-hm.

816
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,000
- ..because, between you and me, I'm not that fond of dates. 
- OK.

817
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,480
You've been consistent - they're ALL a little bit overcooked, but...

818
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,120
LAUGHTER

819
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,440
..we will get a lovely, crisp pastry from it.

820
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,280
Mary would always find something really nice about what you'd done.

821
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,280
And these little twirls - I do like the inventive idea.

822
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,480
Even if it's just like, "I like your plate,"

823
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,840
it's better than nothing.

824
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,080
I love the flavour of that.

825
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,400
The cherries, the chocolate, goes well together.

826
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,640
He's something up his sleeve to say to you.

827
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,800
Your choice of flavours for the inside

828
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,560
- I think are wrong. 
- Oh.

829
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,440
Paul just comes across as sort of a slightly grumpy bloke -

830
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,440
ever so slightly like your dad when you're small.

831
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,800
It IS burnt. That annoys me.

832
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,640
STIFLED LAUGH

833
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,400
Um...

834
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,560
It's welding my mouth shut.

835
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,760
I'm from an era where you don't answer back,

836
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,160
so you just take it on the chin, you know?

837
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,640
Do better next time.

838
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,120
And there was one particular baking discipline

839
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,080
which saw Paul at his most exacting.

840
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,800
MARY: I know Paul was thinking there might be a gap

841
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,280
between the ham and the bread.

842
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,240
There is no gap...

843
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,120
because the inside is raw.

844
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,640
- It's raw? 
- What?!

845
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,720
He can just look at the bread and say how long it's proved for,

846
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,280
there's too much water, or, you know, too much heat.

847
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,320
That's an indication that the yeast hasn't reached its full potential

848
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,560
before you put it in the oven.

849
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,600
The reason it flattens out is down to the mixing.

850
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
You haven't built up the gluten strong enough.

851
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,960
Raw inside. That is going to have a few issues.

852
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,000
Paul IS like a bread psychic. Yeah, definitely.

853
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,400
- RICHARD: 
- If he came up and saw what you were doing,

854
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,160
anything he said, you knew there was going to be a lesson in there.

855
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,120
So, you're going to bring your dough out and pop it into all that flour.

856
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,120
Do you not think that's a little bit excessive?

857
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,320
- Nice technique. 
- Yeah? 
- Unusual.

858
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,600
Good or bad unusual?

859
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,920
I've never seen rolls made like that before.

860
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,800
Using cocoa or chocolate in the pastry to turn it brown,

861
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,560
how do you know when it's actually baked?

862
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,920
Because obviously baklava's all about the flake,

863
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,160
- and the crispiness. 
- Yes. Yes. 
- How do you know?

864
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,680
- By eye. 
- Sometimes your eyes can kid you.

865
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,440
You could see the doubt creeping into the minds

866
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,320
of some of the other bakers, as he walked over.

867
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,920
I noticed, sometimes, he'd walk away with a wry smile on his face.

868
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,840
He just has a habit of getting right under your skin,

869
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,480
and then exposes all your weaknesses.

870
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,200
- When you put them into the oven, are you expecting a shine? 
- Yes.

871
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,200
- Are you going to use water? 
- I've got an egg wash to put on the top of it.

872
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,720
- Makes it a bit shinier. 
- That's very daring.

873
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,320
- Is it? 
- Yeah.

874
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,600
- Very. 
- Oh...

875
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,240
Daring, to put an egg wash on?

876
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,320
Yeah... I won't tell you why, I'll talk about it later,

877
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,720
but - good luck.

878
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,480
He didn't say whether it was good or bad -

879
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,400
I didn't know what the right answer was, so you just doubt everything

880
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,320
you're going to do from that point onwards.

881
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,240
I'm panicking about everything.

882
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,000
I know - and then, I'm putting an egg wash on mine,

883
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,120
and they were like...

884
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,040
He was like, "I'm not going to tell you why, but that's a bad idea."

885
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,480
- Did he? 
- And I was like...

886
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,120
What do you do, then?

887
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,520
I'm going to do it anyway.

888
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,600
Because you put the glaze on the top,

889
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,760
which has falsely accused the roll of being ready...

890
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,880
- Yes. 
- You've brought it out too early. 
- OK.

891
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,040
Now I know that you should never do that if it's a rye roll,

892
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,720
because it will "falsely accuse the roll of being ready"!

893
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,040
SHE GIGGLES

894
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,400
That is burned into my memory now - I will never do it again.

895
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,200
In the heated atmosphere of the tent,

896
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,880
it seemed that catastrophe was never far away.

897
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,040
- JORDAN: 
- If it CAN go wrong in the tent, it WILL go wrong in the tent.

898
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,720
- CHETNA: 
- I can smell something burning. 
- Yeah!

899
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,920
HE SNIFFS

900
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,320
When something goes wrong, you just don't want anyone to know.

901
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,160
- GASPS: 
- It's mine!

902
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,480
OK, do that again, then. Thank you!

903
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,360
Unfortunately, that is not the case,

904
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,480
because there are cameras everywhere.

905
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,560
- RICHARD: 
- The tarte au citrons are a disaster.

906
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,440
Welded.

907
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,960
Whoo!

908
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,440
Starting again.

909
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh, no!

910
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,280
That's not good.

911
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,440
My pears in pastry, I think...

912
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,400
I think I got a full house of things wrong.

913
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,200
I think I undercooked the pear, overcooked the pastry,

914
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,360
and burnt the syrup.

915
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,680
Ooh!

916
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,720
There it goes.

917
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,960
I will always remember when I took my massive chorizo pie

918
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,760
out of its massive mould,

919
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,120
and I thought it just had a little leak in the oven,

920
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,600
cos I could see fat dripping out, and I took of the mould,

921
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,200
and it just gushed out.

922
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,440
Oh, my goodness!

923
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,280
- Martha, what's going...? Oh! 
- It's having a plumbing problem!

924
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,640
We've got a little bit of weepage there.

925
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,760
It was a river of pork fat, and it was gross.

926
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,840
Crikey, it was a massive, delicious pie full of pork.

927
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,480
I'd have still eaten it!

928
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,760
In fact, I did.

929
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,360
HE CHUCKLES

930
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,120
There was one bake more disastrous than any...

931
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,280
Probably the biggest thing that's ever happened on the Bake Off.

932
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,880
..the baked Alaska.

933
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,720
Baked Alaska Week is known among all of us bakers as "the Bincident".

934
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,760
It's a sponge base and ice cream, so what can possibly go wrong?!

935
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,080
It was REALLY hot that day.

936
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,840
It's so hot!

937
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,320
The whole weekend was so bizarre, because of the meltiness -

938
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,160
it was 40-odd degrees in the tent, it was totally crazy -

939
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,240
everything we did was melting.

940
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,480
Is it frozen, Norm, yeah?

941
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,680
Yeah, it's frozen, but it's melting very quickly.

942
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,960
Everyone was running round like headless chickens,

943
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,520
trying to put ice cream into any cold space they could find.

944
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,560
- CHETNA: 
- I need to go in the freezer - freezer, freezer, please, freezer.

945
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,000
I was having my own meltdown, with my ice cream.

946
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,240
It'll be all right, it'll be all right.

947
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,200
Now it's all melting. The whole thing's melting.

948
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,720
DIANA: No-one's ice cream was setting.

949
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,840
- Ugh... 
- What's up? 
- Not frozen.

950
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,040
You're joking.

951
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,520
The freezer I was using was quite packed with everyone's ice cream,

952
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,920
and the door was being opened and closed a lot,

953
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,040
so I decided to use a space on the other side of the tent,

954
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,560
in another freezer.

955
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,040
Can I put this in the freezer?

956
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,080
I took it out of the freezer.

957
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,440
Whose is this?

958
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,600
Iain's, I think.

959
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,680
That's Iain's.

960
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,320
I assumed he had his own freezer.

961
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,280
I went back over just to check how the ice cream was setting,

962
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,720
and my ice cream was sitting at the end of someone's bench.

963
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,360
Where's my ice cream?

964
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,240
It's here - sorry, Iain, we...

965
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,360
Argh!

966
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,560
How's it looking?

967
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,000
Look.

968
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,880
- It's soup. 
- The only real reason why it's staying there

969
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,960
is because I put the tin round to hold the caramel in.

970
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,360
Eurgh...

971
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,400
OK, all right, so, let's think about how we're going to present that.

972
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,880
Um... That's not... OK.

973
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,040
- I've got a serving suggestion. 
- All right.

974
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,920
- SHE SIGHS 
- Oh...

975
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,880
No, no, no, you can't...!

976
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,280
Iain, Iain, Iain, you have to...

977
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,080
Look at it - you can't present it.

978
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,880
It kind of happened, and then he left the tent,

979
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,040
and it kind of rippled around, and everyone was really upset.

980
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,480
He threw it in the bin.

981
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,680
- Iain had to throw his in the bin. 
- He didn't!

982
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,360
I think he kind of regretted it straight away,

983
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,520
but it was done, and it was too late.

984
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,280
Ngh!

985
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,960
Just when something like that goes catastrophically wrong at that time,

986
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,840
it's hard to see a way out of it.

987
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,000
Iain, are you OK?

988
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,920
Yeah, I'm fine.

989
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,960
Of course, I didn't do it maliciously.

990
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,480
I wouldn't dream of sabotaging someone else's bakes.

991
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,360
Um, I had some issues with the ice cream...

992
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,040
- Yeah. 
- ..and I let the frustration of that get the better of me.

993
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,080
OK.

994
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,920
- Did you have a problem with your sponge? 
- No.

995
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,880
- Did you have a problem with your meringue? 
- No.

996
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,880
- Did you have a problem with your ice cream? 
- Yes.

997
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,120
So, where's your sponge? In there?

998
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,880
- Mm-hm. 
- We could've tested that.

999
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,480
- Yeah, I know, I didn't cope with the situation very well. 
- OK.

1000
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,680
- I think you know that it got the better of you. 
- Mm.

1001
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,640
- It was just a moment of your life that you want to forget. 
- Yeah.

1002
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,240
- Is that right? 
- It is. I regret it.

1003
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,560
Because, you know, we all make mistakes,

1004
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,360
and we would have liked to see that sponge.

1005
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,680
Diana was more upset than me. I didn't hold any grudge against her.

1006
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,800
DIANA: You think, "Oh... Oh, dear me."

1007
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,040
Did it make that much difference to his ice cream?

1008
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,680
'In total, Iain's baked Alaska was out of the freezer

1009
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,240
'for under a minute.'

1010
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,880
Me not presenting something, I think,

1011
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,320
was the reason I went home that day.

1012
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,360
- MARTHA: 
- He was angry for about five minutes, and then he was gutted.

1013
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,280
He was like, "What have I done?!"

1014
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,880
I was really sad for Iain,

1015
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,720
because I do think that if he hadn't done that,

1016
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,320
he'd have probably got through the week,

1017
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,760
because the judges would still have tried it.

1018
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,760
I still get people shouting across the street at me,

1019
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,880
"Bincident" and "Bingate" and "Baked Alaska", as well.

1020
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,560
I don't even like baked Alaskas!

1021
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,880
Three bakers survived the triumphs and disasters

1022
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,880
to get through to the 2014 Bake Off final.

1023
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,840
Luis managed to fuse creativity...

1024
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,520
This is multitasking!

1025
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,840
..with a meticulous sense of order.

1026
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,080
He's very organised. Like a maths teacher - like this!

1027
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,800
And I'm thinking, "That's where I'm going wrong."

1028
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,000
This is like your in-tray of sponge, isn't it?

1029
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,240
- It is. 
- In-tray, out-tray.

1030
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,600
You like all this - the organisation bit - don't you?

1031
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,920
- I do, yeah. 
- You do! 
- I do.

1032
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,120
- I know you do! 
- I know!

1033
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:12,080
I really wanted to get to the Dobos tarts,

1034
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,800
and I did that as a -

1035
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,760
it's a place you can visit near where I live called The Cage -

1036
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,960
and it's my wife's favourite place to go,

1037
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,760
so I really wanted to make that.

1038
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,240
What can I say?

1039
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,440
It is a monumental effort.

1040
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:31,440
- It is spectacular - it's what I call a Showstopper. 
- Thank you very much.

1041
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,360
'Luis got it perfect with his bread rolls.'

1042
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,960
- I like that. 
- Mm.

1043
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,880
Pure alchemy.

1044
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,520
I was thinking too many flavours but, actually...

1045
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,920
- Well done, Luis. 
- Wow, thank you very much!

1046
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,000
He called them alchemy, which is just, like, fantastic,

1047
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,960
and he shook my hand, and...

1048
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,760
God, I think I giggled - it's really embarrassing, looking back!

1049
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,400
You know, but it was such a nice thing for him to do,

1050
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,200
because, you know, things like that are what matters,

1051
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,280
if you're really into baking.

1052
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,400
Richard's selection of Star Baker awards

1053
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,560
was only matched by his collection of pencils...

1054
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,040
He was a resource.

1055
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,200
Richard, can I use...?

1056
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,560
Thank you.

1057
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,000
SHE CHUCKLES

1058
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,480
..and Richard shone best

1059
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,560
when the challenges called for precision and delicacy.

1060
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,880
It takes a lot of guts to be able to show all the layers.

1061
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,440
That is extremely good.

1062
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,240
Your consistency is perfect.

1063
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,280
What a professional selection you done for us.

1064
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,120
The ever-consistent Nancy developed a special relationship

1065
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,280
with a certain Mr Hollywood.

1066
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,200
Paul, yeah - not "male judge".

1067
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,400
What did the male judge say?

1068
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,920
You know when I said, "I'm '70s"...

1069
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,680
- Did you just say "the male judge"? 
- Yes.

1070
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,160
- And he said... 
- You're not even calling him Paul, now!

1071
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,120
You know when the male judge said...

1072
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,040
'I'd forgotten it, I'd forgotten it.'

1073
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,600
That's how I was referring to him outwith the tent,

1074
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,840
and I'd forgotten that I was IN the tent...

1075
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,400
Nancy, if you'd like to come and present to Mary and the male judge.

1076
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,360
..and Sue just picked it up and ran with it.

1077
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,400
I think he referred to me as "the female contestant" in the end.

1078
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,880
What kind of faces are you going to pipe?

1079
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,360
Well, I thought about grey, spiky hair and piercing blue eyes...

1080
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,360
- Right. 
- ..and then a sort of a smile... 
- A smile? 
- ..but...

1081
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,360
- Sort of like a male judge? 
- A sort of a male judge.

1082
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,120
But like a fictional male judge, because the real male judge...

1083
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,440
- Doesn't smile. 
- Never smiles.

1084
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,600
They're getting at you. THEY LAUGH

1085
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,120
There are some dark ones up there.

1086
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,640
Did you find that you were getting it regular in colour?

1087
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,320
They all look all right to me.

1088
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,040
Would you say if they didn't?

1089
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,080
Of course!

1090
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,840
You know, he can bake bread, but he can't bake everything.

1091
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,640
I've never seen a wedding cake he's made, have you?

1092
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,440
LAUGHTER

1093
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,880
With nine weeks survived, and 27 bakes to their name,

1094
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,840
Nancy, Richard and Luis had one last chance to bake their way to glory.

1095
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,640
The final weekend was a bit of a blur, really.

1096
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,440
It was so emotional, as well, you know?

1097
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,320
All our friends and family were here,

1098
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,800
and it just really did make it quite difficult.

1099
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,400
- NANCY: 
- On the final morning,

1100
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,360
I needed to leave home at 11 o'clock to get the train,

1101
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,840
so, because it was a five-hour challenge, I thought,

1102
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,440
"I'm going to give it one more go,"

1103
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,360
so I got up at half past four and worked from five till ten,

1104
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,720
and then got ready, came down here, and did it again on the Sunday.

1105
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,520
I'm trying not to think about the fact that it's a final,

1106
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,160
and you could win it, at the moment.

1107
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,600
By the time I got to the final,

1108
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,480
I had won Star Baker a record-breaking five times!

1109
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,120
I did feel a weight of expectation.

1110
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,120
Is anyone else in a silent panic, or is it just me?!

1111
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,760
Constant, constant - I wonder how long I'll be able to keep it up.

1112
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,920
That is one hell of a cake.

1113
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,800
They're like tyres, aren't they?!

1114
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,720
- Yeah! 
- But not rubbery.

1115
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,240
'Their Showstopper demanded an elaborate patisserie centrepiece

1116
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,200
'called a piece montee.'

1117
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,160
The final Showstopper was really, a really difficult bake,

1118
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,000
and I think, for me personally,

1119
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,360
I was probably a bit too ambitious on it.

1120
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:05,200
If I can get this in how I want it to, I'll be happy, definitely -

1121
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,440
but, flipping 'eck.

1122
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,840
You're just in a zone.

1123
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,520
I was just absolutely in an zone,

1124
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,200
I had no idea what was going around me.

1125
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,640
Me hands won't keep still, cos they're too nervous.

1126
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,080
Oops!

1127
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,960
'Every available minute was utilised.'

1128
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,680
Not having it.

1129
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,640
OK, my love, the cake colliery is nearly complete.

1130
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,920
God!

1131
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,160
Oh, no...

1132
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,880
Nancy and Richard both did windmills,

1133
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,880
and I felt a little bit left out, because I was thinking,

1134
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,400
"Was the brief to do a windmill, here?!"

1135
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1136
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,080
I knew the only way I was going to win

1137
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,560
was if both Luis and Nancy set their cakes on fire,

1138
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,760
and, you know, you wouldn't wish that on anyone, would you?!

1139
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,920
I think, when you got to the final three,

1140
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,520
they were all so talented

1141
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,120
that any of them could've seized it on the day.

1142
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,720
It wasn't clear who was top, who was going to be bottom -

1143
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,960
you just didn't know.

1144
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,280
Paul and Mary have made their decision,

1145
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,000
and I'm delighted to announce

1146
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,480
that the winner of the Great British Bake Off 2014 is...

1147
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,360
..Nancy.

1148
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,040
CROWD CHEERS

1149
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,600
Nance, come here! Well done!

1150
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,560
Nancy's track record was just solid.

1151
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,360
She barely ever slipped up, so she just -

1152
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,080
she had this grounding about her.

1153
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,920
Can you believe it?!

1154
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,120
She was always steady, never flustered...

1155
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,880
She put in so much effort into the whole process.

1156
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,720
- RICHARD: 
- She was always either excellent, or achieved benchmark,

1157
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,600
and that told in the end - she was brilliant.

1158
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,400
- DIANA: 
- I was very pleased

1159
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,520
for the more mature lady to have won Bake Off!

1160
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,760
And I'm going to get some flak about that, aren't I?!

1161
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,720
So, since leaving the tent,

1162
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,800
how has life changed for these three finalists?

1163
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,520
Getting onto Bake Off was one thing but then what's happened afterwards

1164
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,200
has opened up a world to me that I could've only dreamed of.

1165
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,800
- LUIS: 
- When I entered the Bake Off,

1166
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,040
I just entered to have a bit of fun, you know?

1167
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,360
I never did it with a view to a career change,

1168
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,080
which is ultimately what it's led to.

1169
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,320
- RICHARD: 
- Following this, I've kind of achieved, like, the perfect balance.

1170
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,320
I'll do maybe two or three days a week of baking,

1171
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,440
and then come back to work for two or three days,

1172
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,240
just to try and work it off, to be honest!

1173
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,240
Richard now combines his job as a builder in the family firm

1174
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,400
with baking.

1175
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,560
Today, he's showing off his skills at a food festival in Oxfordshire.

1176
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,000
This certainly brings back memories, doesn't it?

1177
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,600
Making bread in a tin.

1178
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,480
Bake Off has certainly enriched my life.

1179
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,880
I think it hasn't just given me opportunities,

1180
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,640
it's given me a lot more confidence

1181
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,960
to kind of jump on things and have fun with it.

1182
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,240
Mr Richard Burr!

1183
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,680
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1184
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,680
Today we're making challah - challah's a Jewish bread.

1185
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,400
I've been making this for years.

1186
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,720
I know they normally say stick your hands in it

1187
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,880
and get your hands dirty but, as a builder,

1188
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,480
I've kind of tried to keep my hands clean most of the time,

1189
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,720
so I like to start my kneading off with a spatula.

1190
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,640
Following the show, I was pretty lucky -

1191
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,600
I got offered to do a book, which was great.

1192
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,200
I got to spend the whole of the winter,

1193
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,000
rather than being outside fixing roofs,

1194
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,040
staying in a kitchen, cooking all my favourite food!

1195
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,440
Being on Bake Off has inspired Luis to inspire others,

1196
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,480
by becoming a professional teacher.

1197
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,120
When I was on Bake Off, I kind of got known for my design skills,

1198
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,160
I suppose, and I'm really picky on how I want things to look,

1199
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,200
and how I do things,

1200
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,000
and that's kind of one of the things that I now teach people.

1201
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,200
The way it works is, I'll do something, and then you guys do it.

1202
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,880
You can ask me anything you like, it's fine -

1203
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:10,920
within reason!

1204
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,880
We're going to be doing pastry today -

1205
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,400
I do some other courses, as well.

1206
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,520
That's it - unroll it over the tin.

1207
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,920
- Oh, gosh, my tin's too big. 
- That's all right.

1208
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,960
It's really good fun and, you know what?

1209
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,400
It's just really satisfying, being able to show people how I do things.

1210
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,800
It looks like it's leaked around the edge, so...

1211
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,400
and if one of yours is better, I'll just swap, anyway,

1212
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,800
- so it doesn't matter! 
- LAUGHTER

1213
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,040
Since winning the competition, Nancy has been busier than ever.

1214
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,560
In fact, her victory has brought her out of retirement.

1215
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,760
I have to be honest, I didn't really enjoy retirement.

1216
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,280
I'd worked all my life and then, when it came, I didn't like it,

1217
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,240
so I've been given an enormous gift -

1218
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,800
doing something that I absolutely, passionately love.

1219
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,560
Today, Nancy's headed to East Yorkshire

1220
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,200
to judge a cake competition...

1221
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,760
The standard here is really good,

1222
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,960
so I think the judging's going to have to be pretty harsh

1223
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:08,320
to sort them out, because they all look absolutely amazing.

1224
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,120
..and not content tasting other people's recipes,

1225
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:15,120
Bake Off has encouraged Nancy to get busy writing her own.

1226
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,480
I decided when I won Bake Off

1227
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:22,080
that I would start to write a recipe a day.

1228
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,440
At some point, I will write a book.

1229
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,760
What I would like to see it being, in years to come,

1230
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,760
is a tatty old thing on the shelf with no spine left on it,

1231
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,640
but that somebody says, "Oh, this book? Yeah, my mother gave me this."

1232
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,880
That would be my ultimate dream.

1233
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,840
Those lucky few who make it into the tent

1234
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,600
may come for the chance to raise the glass stand,

1235
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,120
but the taste of success isn't just about the winning.

1236
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:58,280
I think the reason we all loved Bake Off so much

1237
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,240
was that we all became really close friends.

1238
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,280
Just one on each is fine. Thanks so much, you guys.

1239
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,000
There are so few people who have walked through those doors.

1240
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,280
You know, something so unique, so magical,

1241
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,320
that you can never experience again.

1242
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,480
- My God, woman! 
- I know.

1243
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,120
You've got the face of a wood nymph and the body of Ryan Gosling.

1244
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,320
Look at that!

1245
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,640
It was just the most intense, most stressful...

1246
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,560
Gah!

1247
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,600
..most crazy, most brilliant thing I've ever done.

1248
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,160
Are you a pie or a tart?

1249
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,080
- Oh, a tart. 
- Yeah, I'm a tart, as well.

1250
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,720
IAIN: It's bigger than your head!

1251
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,880
- JORDAN: 
- It is!

1252
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,880
Oh, yeah, of course I'm in an exclusive club,

1253
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,960
being one of the bakers.

1254
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,640
I like to hang on to that. I wear it like a badge of honour.

1255
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,000
It's something I can be really pretentious about at dinner parties.

1256
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,400
BANGING

1257
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,640
Sorry.

1258
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,840
- Not putting you off, am I? 
- No, not at all.

1259
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,840
You're trying to learn from me, aren't you?

1260
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,280
I don't think there's many days go by that I don't think about it,

1261
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,080
in some way, shape or form.

1262
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,200
Done. Oh, I love it, Nance!

1263
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,520
HE CHUCKLES

1264
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,280
I still have the schedule stuck on my fridge at home -

1265
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,520
it's never moved.

1266
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,760
- It looks like he's making darts. 
- I'm taking out the judges today.

1267
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,880
- CHETNA: 
- Bake Off has definitely changed my life.

1268
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,440
The oven doesn't stop, really.

1269
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,000
Am I showing a bit?

1270
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,880
I would say that since the Bake Off, I've got a bit more adventurous,

1271
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,800
and I'm baking more sort of stuff.

1272
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,960
A nice finish.

1273
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,720
I kind of came to the Bake Off and left with 11 great friends.

1274
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,080
Come on, Diana.

1275
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,560
High-five me.

1276
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,480
Can I do it again, please?!
