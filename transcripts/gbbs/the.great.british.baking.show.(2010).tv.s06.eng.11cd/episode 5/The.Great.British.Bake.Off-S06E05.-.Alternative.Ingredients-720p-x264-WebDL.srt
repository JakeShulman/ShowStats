1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Week five of our baking marathon and Ian is way out front.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,080
He set a cracking pace and is now pulling away from the pack

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,480
with an amazing three out of four Star Baker titles to his credit.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,760
I can't wait to wrap him in a foil cape and give him a good rub down.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,280
- Welcome... BOTH: 
- To the Great British Bake Off.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,840
Last week, Ian triumphed with desserts.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,160
That is sheer heaven on a plate.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,920
It was Sandy who failed to meet the mark...

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,200
It's raw underneath.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,680
..becoming the fourth baker to leave the tent.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,840
- Come on, let's cover her. 
- Bring it in. 
- Bring it in.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,040
I'm OK.

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,800
So far, the bakers have also been tested on cakes...

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,840
Whoa!

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,880
..biscuits...

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,160
Happy with that.

17
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,200
..and breads.

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,720
Ta-dah!

19
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,720
But now how will they cope without some basic ingredients?

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,160
What?

21
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,960
It's definitely going to be a good one.

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,320
Cake without sugar...

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,200
I'm worried that it might be too simple.

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,880
..bread without gluten...

25
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,000
This...is...rank.

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,080
..and an ice cream roll without diary.

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,680
Might that stop it setting?

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,280
I hope it won't.

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,280
A good sponge, but where's the ice cream?

30
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,400
Ice cream, anyone?

31
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,360
That was intense.

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,600
Imagine a world of cake without sugar,

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,280
bread without gluten,

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,360
Mel without Sue.

35
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,760
Huh?

36
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,520
That's 27 years of my life!

37
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,680
It's free-from week.

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,720
(Finally got rid of her.)

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,480
SHEEP BLEAT

40
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,440
It's been amazing to be at the front like this for the last three weeks.

41
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,520
All the other bakers want to break my fingers,

42
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,480
but, you know, that's something they've got to live with, I guess.

43
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,720
I feel a bit embarrassed for the rest of us. I'm like,

44
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,840
"Someone's got to give him a bit of competition,"

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,640
"otherwise it makes us look a bit pants."

46
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,040
Would I love to knock him off the top?

47
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,280
Absolutely! Who wouldn't?

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,360
Everybody wants to knock him off the top spot.

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,480
Watch out, Ian!

50
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,000
Morning, bakers.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,480
Now, for your Signature Bake,

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,360
Paul and Mary would like you to bake a cake.

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,240
But you can't use sugar, OK?

54
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,920
You can use honey, fruit - but nothing that comes from a bag.

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,680
It can be any shape, size or flavour that you desire.

56
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,760
Two-and-a-half hours on the bake.

57
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,840
On your marks.

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,080
Get set. Bake!

59
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,320
I think we're looking for something

60
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,920
that's as close to a regular cake as possible.

61
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,560
I want it to be as light and tasty, and fluffy, as possible.

62
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,320
It's just a bit harder.

63
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,320
It's something different I'm trying.

64
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,040
I loved it when I tried it and I'm going for it.

65
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,600
So, I have made sugar-free cakes before in the past,

66
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,720
so I feel OK with the sugar-free, yeah.

67
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,920
Dare I say it?

68
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,240
When you're baking a cake,

69
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,800
one of the most important ingredients is sugar

70
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,240
and we're asking them to forget about sugar,

71
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,920
and use anything else to sweeten it -

72
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,160
and most of them will be using a form of syrup.

73
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,680
Some of our bakers will add fruits to get that sweetness.

74
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,240
When you think of adding a fruit,

75
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,200
you may think apple, you may think pear...

76
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,000
The problem with that - they don't carry too much flavour.

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,120
You need something a bit more robust LIKE an orange, LIKE a lemon.

78
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,680
Something that will override the sponge and give it a flavour.

79
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,200
Morning, Paul.

80
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Hello, Ian. Morning, Star Baker.

81
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,920
I know. It's, kind of, strange days, eh?

82
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,560
Right, tell us all about your cake.

83
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,520
I'm doing... Well, it's pear, ginger and honey cake.

84
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,240
So, the total sweetener is honey?

85
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,600
It's just honey, yeah. That's all it is.

86
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,360
To his honey and pear batter,

87
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,760
Ian is also adding root ginger for heat

88
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,480
and chopped walnuts to give it some bite.

89
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,720
Have you had any problems with the texture?

90
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,320
Some of the first ones did turn out

91
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,280
a little bit moist and a bit heavy.

92
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,400
Sometimes honey cakes are quite dense but a lovely flavour,

93
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,320
and there's lots going in there, I might say.

94
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,600
Oh, yes, a hearty amount.

95
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,200
- Thank you, Ian. 
- See you later. 
- Thank you.

96
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,440
- Good morning, Mat. 
- Morning. 
- Hello.

97
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,720
So, Mat, what's the cake you've chosen?

98
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,000
And what have you got as your sweetener?

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,560
OK, so I've gone for a carrot cake,

100
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,320
so I'm using - instead of the sugar - dates and honey.

101
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,640
- Good choice. 
- Right.

102
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,400
In addition to honey and dates,

103
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,560
Mat's carrot cake will be packed with raisins

104
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,240
and flavoured with cinnamon, ginger and orange zest.

105
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,960
There's a lot of filling in there?

106
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,480
- Yeah. 
- God, that's a monster.

107
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,200
What could happen, if the mixture's too slack,

108
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,880
the fruit could go to the bottom

109
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,760
because it will be pretty wet.

110
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,120
- Good luck, Mat. 
- Thank you very much. Cheers.

111
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,360
Mat's not the only one

112
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,640
who has adapted their trusty carrot cake recipe

113
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,440
to make it sugar-free.

114
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,880
Sometimes it's gone wrong, sometimes it's gone right

115
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,840
and I think I've got the balance just right.

116
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,520
Obviously, that'll be dependent on the judges.

117
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,960
Paul's sugar substitute is agave nectar -

118
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,840
a natural syrup that comes from a cactus-like plant.

119
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,520
For extra sweetness, he's adding sultanas

120
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,800
and for texture, chopped pecan nuts.

121
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,600
To come out with the look, the texture and the flavour

122
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,360
is a bit of a skill, a bit of an art,

123
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
and it's definitely chemistry as well -

124
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,640
something I was never good at in school.

125
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,120
I'm a firm believer in the all-in-one method

126
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,160
but, this one, there's just too many variables

127
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,480
that are different from your standard...

128
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,840
butter, sugar, flour and eggs.

129
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,600
Well, originally, I'd done a normal, sort of, cake recipe

130
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,800
and it didn't work because it was too liquid.

131
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,200
So, I decided, instead, I'd do a genoise sponge...

132
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,000
and incorporate the eggs and the molasses

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,920
till they're quite airy and then add the flour,

134
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,000
and so we're relying completely on the air in this to make it go up.

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,040
The mixture seems all right. The same as it looks at home so,

136
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,720
happy so far, yeah.

137
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,840
So, I am making a polenta cake

138
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,000
with grapefruit zest and grapefruit juice.

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
So, I'm making a syrup with the grapefruit juice,

140
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,840
injecting that into the cake with some syringes.

141
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,120
Tamal will add honey to his grapefruit syrup

142
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,680
which will be applied to his polenta cake, once baked.

143
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,080
He's also using honey as his sugar substitute.

144
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,880
I can't wait to see what this tastes like

145
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,880
and then obviously the texture that polenta brings as well.

146
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,920
A good polenta cake is worth having.

147
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,600
Let's hope your is one of the good ones.

148
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,720
- I hope it's a good one. Thank you. 
- Thanks.

149
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,120
I'm making a pineapple upside down cake.

150
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,880
A simple classic.

151
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,520
Alvin knows his pineapple upside down cake inside out.

152
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,600
He's replaced the refined sugar with agave nectar.

153
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,480
It's my go-to...

154
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,600
and this is something I'm comfortable baking.

155
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,720
It's a quick bake, 45 minutes in the oven.

156
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,840
I hope it's good enough.

157
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,680
Just trying to get it reasonably equal

158
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,960
so they bake at the same, sort of, speed.

159
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,240
Good morning.

160
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Hello, tell us all about your cake.

161
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,120
Today, I went for, not only sugar-free,

162
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,640
I went for gluten-free as well.

163
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,720
- Hello! 
- I'm using...

164
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,960
quinoa flour, almond flour and hazelnut flour.

165
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,640
Ugne's using her alternative flours

166
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,640
to make chocolate and vanilla cakes,

167
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,920
which she too has sweetened with agave nectar.

168
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,760
She'll assemble them in chequered layers

169
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,600
before decorating with hazelnut butter icing.

170
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,760
I'm going to frost it with a little purplish colour

171
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,320
and I might do some truffles as well.

172
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,000
You might put some truffles on there?

173
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,840
I would, because I don't think it screams,

174
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,760
"Hello, I'm a cake," enough.

175
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,840
They want to go in for...30 minutes.

176
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,480
I am putting them in the oven for half an hour.

177
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,160
While the sponge bakes,

178
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,680
Flora and Nadiya are making sugar-free fillings for their cakes.

179
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,560
- Good morning, Nadiya. 
- Morning.

180
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,160
Right. what are you up to?

181
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,440
So, I am making a very healthy no-cook blueberry jam.

182
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,480
- How do you do it? 
- Well, I use basil seeds.

183
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,640
When they touch liquid, they bloom

184
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,920
and that will create the jam-like texture

185
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,320
without all the sugar in it.

186
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,480
I'm fascinated by this.

187
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,000
- I can't wait to try that. 
- Yeah.

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,520
Nadiya's blueberry jam will be used to sandwich together

189
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,720
her blueberry and caraway seed cakes.

190
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,720
For her sweetener, she's used mulberry molasses.

191
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,480
I tried this cake out on my father-in-law

192
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,960
and he said it was perfect so, hoping they like it.

193
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,280
These are Bramley apples

194
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,440
and I'm just making a compote to put inside the cake.

195
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,320
A filling that's a bit jam-like but sugar-free.

196
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,240
Flora's apple compote will be spread

197
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,080
between her pistachio and cardamom flavoured cakes.

198
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,240
She'll decorate with mascarpone icing

199
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,960
and more sugar-free cakes.

200
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,400
I'm making my honey madeleines

201
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,960
which will go around the base of the cake.

202
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,360
Something else to do, but I don't know how long we've got.

203
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,320
I'm probably going to regret adding something else to my long list.

204
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,400
Bit longer.

205
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,520
- Definitely not. 
- I've got the fear.

206
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,400
Cake fear.

207
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,840
I can't, almost, tell whether it's burning or if it's just...

208
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,320
Hopefully, it's not burning, it's just the molasses.

209
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,760
I'm not taking my eye off the ball. Not on this.

210
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
Spot on.

211
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,080
They're good, they'll do.

212
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,720
It looks how it normally looks,

213
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,120
which is quite a relief.

214
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,800
I'm pleased.

215
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,200
I'm happy with that, very happy with it.

216
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,360
So, it's 50% grapefruit juice,

217
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,520
50% blood orange juice

218
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,320
and then some honey as well.

219
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,080
So, it's not 50% of the others.

220
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,240
Ah, maths.

221
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,920
So, that is the majority of the bake done, really.

222
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,760
Now I've got to start working on the sort of decoration side of it.

223
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,040
Alvin's glazing with agave syrup,

224
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,640
everyone else is making a soft cheese icing.

225
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,400
This is my mascarpone and cream cheese icing.

226
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,600
Obviously, I'm going to add a liquid sweetener to it

227
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
rather than icing sugar.

228
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,200
So, by squeezing a lot of the water out of the cream cheese,

229
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,760
I get a denser consistency that I can spread around the cake.

230
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,520
Little bit more honey in there.

231
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,480
I'm just making mascarpone cream with maple syrup.

232
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,240
I'm going to sweeten with agave.

233
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,560
So, I've swapped icing sugar for honey.

234
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,080
That's maple syrup I've put in there.

235
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,920
As you can see, I've still got a nice, good, thick consistency there.

236
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm finished. I'm done.

237
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,720
Is that good?

238
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,320
- Yeah. 
- Too simple, probably.

239
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,160
Oh, dear.

240
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,120
30 minutes, bakers. Just 30 minutes remaining.

241
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,320
I'm waiting for my cakes to cool down.

242
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,600
What's everyone else doing?

243
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,720
I'm doing whatever you're doing, Ian.

244
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,880
The cake's a bit...

245
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,280
It's not as soft as I wanted it to be.

246
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,400
Everyone's working.

247
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,680
I'm worried that it might be too simple.

248
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,040
I'm going to mix and match the colours of the sponge,

249
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,240
and when you cut into cake, it should have like,

250
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,760
check effect in the middle of the cake.

251
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,840
If you play it safe it will be boring.

252
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,880
We can do boring every day,

253
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,320
but it's not everyday bake,

254
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,680
it's Bake Off.

255
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,320
Paul, you're prowling.

256
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,520
I am prowling, yes.

257
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,040
You're slightly... You're on the old...

258
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,680
Are you thinking in term of,

259
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,040
"Right...who's my competition?"

260
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,200
Well, the competition is Ian, I think.

261
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,720
But it could go wrong for him at any time.

262
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,440
Slightly hoping.

263
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,040
Let's do it.

264
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,960
Five minutes, done.

265
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,400
I'm not sugar-coating it.

266
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,000
Tried to fix it, but we'll see.

267
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,520
Oh, no. What's happened?

268
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,560
The top went because my top layer broke.

269
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,880
Oh, well.

270
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,640
That is one ugly looking cake.

271
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,480
Bakers, time is now up...

272
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,360
..so move all your bakes to the end of the bench.

273
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,520
It does look very pretty.

274
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,240
The bake is good.

275
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,920
The sharpness that you get from the grapefruit is beautiful.

276
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,080
It's such a delicate cake, actually.

277
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,560
Really well done.

278
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,880
Polenta is quite difficult

279
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,040
- but I enjoyed that cake. 
- OK.

280
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,760
- Congratulations. 
- Well done. 
- Thank you. 
- Well done, Tamal. 
- Thank you.

281
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,200
It looks beautifully finished.

282
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,920
Very, very simple.

283
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,440
Maybe a little bit too simple.

284
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,080
Cuts well.

285
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,520
And this has got pears in?

286
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,840
This has got pears in, yes.

287
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,000
The actual cake itself

288
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,040
- is not sweet enough. 
- Right.

289
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,360
But push it with the icing, it improves it greatly.

290
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,560
Pear's not going to bring anything to a party in an unsweetened cake.

291
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,000
- Yeah. 
- I think it was the wrong choice.

292
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,000
It just looks like it hasn't been baked.

293
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,600
Looks a bit like Christmas pudding.

294
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,720
- MEL: Yeah. 
- It does.

295
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,040
OK.

296
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,960
- I actually really like it. 
- Right.

297
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,400
- I think it is baked. 
- Yep.

298
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,280
I just think you're got so much stuff in there

299
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,720
that the lack of sugar is almost incidental.

300
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,840
I think you've made a really nice cake.

301
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,480
- Thank you. 
- Nice one. 
- Cheers.

302
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,320
I mean, it's got a great flavour.

303
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,720
It's probably slightly overdone.

304
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,160
I think you've got superb icing.

305
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,000
You've been able to do that nice ribbing round the side

306
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,080
- and that, with cream cheese, is quite difficult. 
- Yes.

307
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,320
You've made yourself extra challenges

308
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,720
that we didn't ask for.

309
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,480
- I mean, you haven't got a classic flour in there and... 
- Yeah.

310
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,440
..I think that's why the texture doesn't hold together.

311
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,520
MEL: Oh, wow.

312
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,720
The chocolate part is very, very close textured

313
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,040
and tastes a little bit bitter.

314
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,600
The hazelnut cream is stunning,

315
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,280
however the look of it...

316
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,880
needs a bit more work.

317
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,200
- What about these flowers, edible? 
- Nope.

318
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,000
Spit it out.

319
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,120
I think the blueberry jam,

320
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,720
that you made, using those basil seeds, is beautiful.

321
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,360
I love the appearance

322
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,120
but, sadly, the genoise is just dry top and bottom.

323
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,880
I think it's just slightly overbaked but the flavours are spot-on...

324
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,680
and quite daring flavours, too.

325
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,560
- Well done. 
- Well done. 
- Thank you.

326
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,240
I think the whole thing looks really good.

327
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,960
I just think there's too much moisture in the cake,

328
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,760
which makes it feel like it's underbaked.

329
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,480
You've got such a pretty design

330
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,160
but the cake is just stodgy.

331
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,360
I just think the apple was a bad choice.

332
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,440
That is superb.

333
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,920
The sweetness is perfect for me.

334
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,880
- The syrup's soaking through. 
- Yeah.

335
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,360
I think you've done really well

336
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,960
- considering there's no sugar in there. 
- Yeah.

337
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,040
As soon as you get the pineapple with the sponge,

338
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,560
it's a perfect balance.

339
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,160
- And you've made a cracking cake. 
- Wow, thank you so much.

340
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,880
- Thank you, Alvin. 
- Well done, Alvin. 
- Thank you very much, sir.

341
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,720
Wow.

342
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,760
Such a good feeling, such a good feeling.

343
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,000
And I wish it could be like that all the time. I wish.

344
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,840
I tried to do something different.

345
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,200
It didn't work for them.

346
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,480
Paul didn't like the pears at all.

347
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,120
I didn't think they were that offensive but, clearly, he did.

348
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,520
After a sugar-free morning,

349
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,280
the bakers must now find the energy for their next challenge.

350
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,880
The technical.

351
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,240
Bakers, if you thought making sugar-free cakes was easy,

352
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,840
you are going to love this afternoon's technical challenge.

353
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,960
It's one of Paul's recipes and,

354
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,560
like Paul himself,

355
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,160
it defines simple.

356
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,720
Paul and Mary, I'm afraid you, you can't watch this one

357
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,200
so if you could just vacate.

358
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,120
Be good now, you two.

359
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,040
So, Paul and Mary would love you please

360
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,440
to make 12 identical

361
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,040
gluten-free pittas.

362
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,400
Oh, that just got me.

363
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,960
Simple process, simple ingredients

364
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,360
but - oh, my days - tricky to make.

365
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,120
You've got two hours.

366
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,520
- On your marks... 
- Get set...

367
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,040
BOTH: Bake!

368
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,640
I have never made gluten-free bread in my life,

369
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,040
not talking about pittas.

370
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,560
I know what a pitta looks like,

371
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,600
so at least I've got something to work towards in my head.

372
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,240
What?

373
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,040
It's definitely going to be a good one.

374
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,240
What the hell?

375
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,240
Why did you choose pitta bread as the gluten-free challenge?

376
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,400
What we're testing them on is their base knowledge

377
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,840
of gluten-free flours.

378
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,000
The right consistency is almost like a sticky dough,

379
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,560
rather than a wet dough.

380
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,480
OK, come on. Let's have a go.

381
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,680
That's a beautiful shape too and

382
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,720
it's just got that tinge of brown.

383
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,920
That's right.

384
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,520
Now, if you just tear it, it's not glutinous,

385
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,160
where you get a stretch.

386
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,440
It breaks fairly easily, you know?

387
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,000
Then you get that pocket.

388
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,240
I think they're really rather good.

389
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,960
It's almost as good as traditional pitta with wheat flour.

390
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,760
Well, it seems to me that,

391
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,680
not only do they have a new technique to get used to,

392
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,200
I think many of them will never have made anything

393
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,640
gluten-free unless they've been particularly asked to.

394
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,880
I agree, and now they've been asked to.

395
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,320
I have never made pitta bread before so,

396
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,360
I don't know if whatever that...

397
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,280
is to do with a pitta bread

398
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,400
or to with the fact that it's gluten-free.

399
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,240
Everyone's been given a packet of brown powder.

400
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,800
I don't even know what it is.

401
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,120
"Fisilum."

402
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,880
"Fislium."

403
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,800
It's no good if you can't even read it, is it?

404
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,000
When mixed with water,

405
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,200
psyllium powder can act as the gluten substitute for bread.

406
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,680
It's like a fibre

407
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,280
and it's really gelatinous

408
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,120
when it's mixed with water.

409
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,480
This...is...rank.

410
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,120
Doesn't smell particularly nice either.

411
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,680
"Using all the ingredients, make a dough."

412
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,800
"Put the flour in, yeast one side of the bowl."

413
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,320
Obviously keep it separate from the salt because it reacts with it.

414
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,720
I've never made any gluten-free bread before.

415
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,440
So, this is really new for me.

416
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,320
It's really soft and it's really wet.

417
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,000
I think it's meant to be very sticky.

418
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,040
Difficult to...

419
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,040
..work with.

420
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,800
I mean, can you knead a liquid?

421
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,200
I think I need a bit more flour, maybe. This is...

422
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,680
This is bad news, innit?

423
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,200
Very loose dough.

424
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,880
I've got big lumps of that powered stuff.

425
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,920
You're not going to stretch any gluten strands

426
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,200
cos there's no gluten in it.

427
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,400
So, I'm just mixing it, basically.

428
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,280
I'm not going to work it any more longer,

429
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,680
I did around ten, 15 minutes so far, so...

430
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,880
..I think that should be about enough.

431
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,720
It's coming together a little bit.

432
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,240
Do you eat pitta, if not make them?

433
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,360
- Once. 
- You've eaten one once? 
- Yeah.

434
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,520
What was your memory of it?

435
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,560
Can you remember what it looked like?

436
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,920
Like a triangle?

437
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,240
It's more important to get it proved than kneaded.

438
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
I decided to start proving it

439
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,440
because it wasn't changing, even remotely.

440
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,760
I'm sure that'll be a wrong decision.

441
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,000
Ideally, anything needs to be proved for a good hour

442
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,720
or till it's, at least, doubled in size.

443
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,560
- Obviously, the longer the better. 
- I'll give it 40 to 45 minutes

444
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,520
and then I'll go into shaping mode,

445
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,680
I think.

446
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,920
- What shape are you doing? 
- Eh?

447
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,400
Circle, triangle?

448
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,560
Oh, don't even know.

449
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,840
The more I work this,

450
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,400
it doesn't seem to be changing.

451
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,240
So, I'm, kind of, thinking I might just pop it in to prove.

452
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,160
Definitely won't be coming number one.

453
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,200
Fine, whatever.

454
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,800
OK, bakers, you've got an hour

455
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,120
till we want to hear

456
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,480
the "pitta-patter" of tiny breads

457
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,800
coming up to the table.

458
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,520
I've got nine minutes left on the prove now.

459
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,600
It's just, I've got nine minutes to decide how to bake them now.

460
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,840
That's not a long time.

461
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,880
At least half an hour to prove, I think,

462
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,200
but, ideally, I'd want longer than that.

463
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,440
Damn.

464
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,840
Worried about this one.

465
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,720
I think I'm one of the first to take it out.

466
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,560
The plan was one hour...

467
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,600
but...

468
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,200
..I'm going to start.

469
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,520
It doubled the size so, I think that's what I need.

470
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
Oh, that's so sticky.

471
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,360
OK, that's really weird.

472
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,560
So, I'm trying to do it equally into 12.

473
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,840
So, a little bit of maths and maths isn't my strong point.

474
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,680
I'm going to do it into three, first of all,

475
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,920
and then divide each three into quarters.

476
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,400
Very nervous, actually.

477
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,840
I don't like not being in the know this much

478
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,080
and I think I've got a lot riding on this.

479
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,280
So, they're oval like rugby ball type shape,

480
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,320
but you can get little ones as well.

481
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,760
I'm confused with a naan bread and a pitta.

482
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,440
Are they the same?

483
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,200
But I'm assuming, judging by the amount of dough we've got,

484
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,600
they need to be big ones.

485
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
I'm going to go for oblong, circle...

486
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,680
Going to go for oblong.

487
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
I mean, it's risen a bit,

488
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,840
so I'm pleased about that.

489
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,120
Happy is quite a big word to be using

490
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,200
for something that looks like this.

491
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,280
Trying to make them look fairly similar but...

492
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,800
They're, sort of, OK.

493
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,760
This is not turning out good.

494
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,120
Bakers, I have PITTA for you, but there's only 30 minutes left.

495
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,480
What?

496
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,680
Cook, pittas, cook.

497
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,800
Just put my first lot in.

498
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,880
Don't think they need proving again.

499
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,800
I'm sure they don't need proving again.

500
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,920
I'm giving it 15 minutes.

501
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,960
Hopefully, it will be enough.

502
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,400
Are you running out of time?

503
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,800
Yeah, a little bit. I think...

504
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,280
You've got 23 minutes and you're telling me you want to do

505
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,680
a final prove and then bake them and they take 20 minutes -

506
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,920
which means you've got three minutes to prove them.

507
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,720
Well, when you put it like that, it sounds stupid.

508
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,760
These are hollow - so, yeah, that's good.

509
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,200
They were in for 12 minutes.

510
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,720
I've had to take them out to get the next six in but...

511
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,760
I don't think they're going to be nice inside.

512
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,960
I've just got that gut feeling.

513
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,200
- It's just funny how little colour they're getting. 
- Yeah.

514
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,320
I'd like a nice bit of brown to it,

515
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,520
but it's just...

516
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,560
Grey and dense.

517
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,200
They're meant to puff up.

518
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,680
There's one or two that are, there's ones that aren't.

519
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,240
They're puffing up all right.

520
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,400
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to do that,

521
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,600
but I'd rather have both sides evenly baked.

522
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,120
Bakers, don't be in a PITTA despair,

523
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,040
because it's over in five minutes.

524
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,320
- What? 
- Five minutes to go.

525
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,240
I always think I'm going to come last,

526
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,840
but I'm not looking around right now.

527
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,440
Let's just see...

528
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,800
how it goes.

529
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,960
Let's just say, this has not been my favourite technical.

530
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,560
OK, bakers, time is up.

531
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,800
Finishing dusting down your pitta

532
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,360
and pop them on the gingham altar behind the photo of yourself.

533
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,800
Mary and Paul, if you'd like to join us.

534
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,760
Right, what we're looking for is 12 baked pittas,

535
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,440
nice and thin with an envelope inside.

536
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,160
Now, they are identical.

537
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,560
Nice and thin.

538
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,640
Can we get a pocket? We can.

539
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,760
See, this one's got a bit of colour on it

540
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,320
and has naturally formed a pocket -

541
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,880
but the ones without colour remain doughy.

542
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,640
Now, they are baked but they're just not thin enough...

543
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,920
so you're not getting too much of an envelope.

544
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,480
You can't open it up.

545
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,840
Now, moving on.

546
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,000
- It's doughy. 
- Yeah.

547
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,200
It tastes all right.

548
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,120
I would take that as a flatbread than a pitta.

549
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,360
Now, these have got a bit more colour on them.

550
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,720
Uniform, decent shape.

551
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,360
Maybe too thick to get an envelope but... Cos it hasn't formed.

552
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,160
I've got a bit of an envelope there.

553
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,600
Yeah, but that's not a natural one.

554
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,840
No, I've worked my little fingers along it.

555
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,720
LAUGHTER

556
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,520
- Right. 
- What about these?

557
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,000
These are round, aren't they?

558
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,840
Yeah, quite a lot of flour on there.

559
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,200
It's gone very light.

560
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,320
This is someone who knows how to do bread

561
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,760
but, unfortunately, they don't know how to do pitta bread.

562
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,960
Now moving on.

563
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,080
This looks more like it, actually. Nice colour.

564
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,920
There it is.

565
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,320
Gosh, there's room for all sorts of things in there.

566
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,800
That came as a proper pocket.

567
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,400
Half of them are pretty good, very good.

568
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,240
The other half, just a little bit thinner

569
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,920
and a little bit longer in the oven.

570
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,880
Oh, look, we're getting a good... Look at that.

571
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,640
- You got a pocket in there. 
- They're good.

572
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,880
They could have just stayed in a little bit longer.

573
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,120
But they're not bad at all.

574
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,800
- Quite uniform as well. 
- And the flavour was good. 
- Yes.

575
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,280
Very bread-like. Out of all of them, that's the thickest one.

576
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,120
That's lovely at that end but,

577
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,560
here, it's very doughy at the bottom half.

578
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,680
But whose gluten-free pitta is technically perfect?

579
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,480
So, in eighth place, who's that?

580
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,120
They were not quite done and it was the thickest of all of them.

581
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,280
And in seventh place is this one.

582
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,000
Very thick. Couldn't get any envelopes in there at all,

583
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,360
it was more like a bread, too much flour.

584
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,920
Ugne is sixth,

585
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,560
Ian - fifth, and Mat is fourth.

586
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,800
And in third place is this one.

587
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,480
Nice and thin, which was good.

588
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,960
You had a pocket in places.

589
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,400
And in second place...

590
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,240
Now, these were getting good.

591
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,640
They had a nice colour

592
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,800
and we could get a pocket in there.

593
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,920
And in first place...

594
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,240
That's me.

595
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,320
APPLAUSE

596
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,080
How many times have you struggled

597
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,240
with technical challenges over the weeks?

598
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,200
And then you come straight up and get first.

599
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,520
Well done.

600
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,400
Ha-ha, I got first in the technical.

601
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,320
Three good weeks and now, I'm thinking,

602
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,120
"Right, OK. This is a bit nerve-racking.

603
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,720
"I've got to do some work tomorrow."

604
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,360
It could have gone better...

605
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,000
..but it could have been worse.

606
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,200
Yeah.

607
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,200
Just terrible, really, wasn't it?

608
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,400
So, Paul and Mary, Ian started this weekend riding high

609
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,080
with his three Star Bakers.

610
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,320
Didn't go so well for him yesterday, did it?

611
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,600
I don't think it did.

612
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,520
In his Signature Challenge, the bake was OK,

613
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,640
but he was always going to struggle with the pear.

614
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,760
And in the technical, he came fifth.

615
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,920
Ugne.

616
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,480
MARY: She was just putting everything into her chocolate cake.

617
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,800
- And then it, gradually, was falling apart, wasn't it? 
- Hmm.

618
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,040
MEL: Who do you think's in trouble?

619
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,840
I think Ugne and, dare I say, Ian.

620
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,400
- Ooh, that would be a shocker! 
- MEL WHISTLES

621
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,480
Morning, bakers.

622
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,680
Hope you're wearing your sequined undergarments

623
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,560
because it is Showstopper day.

624
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,360
Now, Paul and Mary would love you to make an evergreen

625
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,720
of the chest freezer.

626
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,680
It's the ice cream roll.

627
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,720
Now, what we're looking for is silky smooth ice cream,

628
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,640
covered in luxurious sticky jam

629
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,920
and then some light, golden sponge wrapped around that...

630
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,720
BUT - and there's always a but -

631
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,800
it's got to be dairy-free ice cream,

632
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,400
so I'm afraid you will not be able to milk any goats,

633
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,760
sheep, pigs or cats for this challenge.

634
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,760
You've got four-and-a-half hours on the Showstopper clock, bakers.

635
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,320
- On your marks... 
- Get set... 
- Bake!

636
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,560
I've made this four times as a practice but...

637
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,680
Cos I always make the ordinary ice cream

638
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,400
using heavy cream, you know.

639
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,120
But not this...surprisingly.

640
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,560
Of many times I made it, it never failed -

641
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,320
but you know me, I made many times, at home, stuff which failed me here.

642
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,120
I feel like I got something to prove today

643
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,640
after what happened with the technical yesterday.

644
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,000
No pressure...but it has to go well.

645
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,320
We're really throwing it at them.

646
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,000
I mean, first of all, they've got to do their dairy-free ice cream -

647
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,480
which is very tricky.

648
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,560
They've got to make a perfect sponge,

649
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,200
wonderful jam and the whole thing

650
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,240
has got to look outstanding.

651
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,800
We expect to see magic in the tent.

652
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,400
We're not going to hold back on them and judge them thinking,

653
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,520
"Oh, well they used an alternative ice cream therefore that'll do."

654
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,280
"That'll do" baking in that tent, in a Showstopper,

655
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,800
is not good enough.

656
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,280
With a dairy ban in force,

657
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,880
the tent is taking on a rather tropical aroma.

658
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm making ice cream using coconut milk.

659
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,440
I'm using coconut milk.

660
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,600
The coconut milk is, kind of, fairly strong coconut flavour.

661
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,720
This is coconut syrup,

662
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,920
so it's coconut milk with sugar.

663
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,560
Boil it down till it's quite thick.

664
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,200
In here, we've got the coconut custard mix.

665
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,200
If you don't heat it up, then it'd be quite thin.

666
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,200
I'm just looking at it cos I don't want it to be curdled.

667
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,680
So, you want to thicken it up a little bit - but not too much,

668
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,520
otherwise you end up with scrambled eggs.

669
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,840
So... It's not, it's fine.

670
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,160
It's just the foam at the top that's making me panic a little bit.

671
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,240
- Good morning, Alvin. 
- Good morning, Sir. Morning, Mary.

672
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,280
Morning, Alvin.

673
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,040
Ice cream roll. Tell us about yours.

674
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,400
I've chosen a classic Filipino flavour.

675
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,240
This is a staple ice cream back home in the Philippines

676
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,680
which is Buko Pandan.

677
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,720
So, basically, the "Buko" translates to "the young coconut meat,"

678
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,640
and we use it like our vanilla in here.

679
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,760
- We use it in south east Asia like that. 
- It's like sun cream.

680
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,360
Please, rub some on him, please.

681
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,600
- That's what he's been using all this time. 
- Exactly.

682
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,960
Alvin's Buko Pandan coconut-flavoured ice cream

683
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,480
will be surrounded by mango and passion fruit jam

684
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,000
and a fatless sponge.

685
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,440
His children love it -

686
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,000
especially the vibrant ice cream.

687
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
- Mary, have I got a green tongue? 
- Yes, you have.

688
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,200
Does that go?

689
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,640
MARY: No, you're there forever.

690
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,040
It's quite strong.

691
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,920
Look away.

692
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,800
- Eyes front. 
- All right.

693
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,560
Tell us all about your ice cream roll.

694
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,720
It's mango, lime and coconut ice cream

695
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,520
and a sponge decorated with

696
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,920
a pattern of a desert island.

697
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,040
Paul's almond-based sponge will be spread with pineapple jam

698
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,680
before adding his ice cream.

699
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,800
The centrepiece will be a fondant bikini-clad sunbather.

700
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,160
I've got, like, a beach towel on the top.

701
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,320
I've then got palm trees coming up round the side,

702
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,840
it will then sit on sand, which is sugar,

703
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,960
and then, obviously, blue piping to replicate the water.

704
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,600
Wow, is there room for three more on your desert island?

705
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,120
I'd quite like to go there.

706
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,880
It's a tropical ice cream roll,

707
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,520
which I thought was very original -

708
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,960
but I've looked around and it's maybe not as original.

709
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,520
So, it's a passion fruit ice cream,

710
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,680
a pineapple jam

711
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,760
and then the sponge is just a simple fatless sponge.

712
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,160
Tamal will bake a lattice pattern into his sponge,

713
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,960
which he'll flavour with lemon.

714
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,320
He'll top his ice cream roll with Italian meringue

715
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,960
and a crafty creation.

716
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,040
And I've made this baby bunting thing

717
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,120
that I made on train on the way down

718
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,160
which I've, sort of, being umming and ahhing

719
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,680
about whether or not I should use it

720
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,200
and now I'm like, "No, I need, I need every little thing."

721
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,520
OK, so today, I'm making a coconut ice cream

722
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,000
with raspberry jam and

723
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,280
just a fatless sponge.

724
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,640
Mat will roll his sponge like a Swiss roll

725
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,960
and he's going for a minimalist look.

726
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,960
So, your only decoration is the stripes.

727
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,040
I'm not saying, you know, that's bad.

728
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,120
- So, you're using stripes... 
- Yeah. 
- ..then plain raspberry jam...

729
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,080
- It is. 
- ..and then ice cream? 
- Yeah.

730
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,080
You're...trying to frighten him.

731
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,000
- You're being tough. 
- I'm not. There's nothing wrong with using plain stuff

732
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,360
but when you go back to the basics,

733
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,480
- the basics have got to be good. 
- Right.

734
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,440
Oh, I can smell her peanut butter from here.

735
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,600
- That smells so nice. 
- Can you smell it?

736
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Yeah, it's really good.

737
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,720
- Good morning, Ugne. 
- Good morning.

738
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,960
Right, can you tell us all about your ice cream roll?

739
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,120
My ice cream will be peanut butter ice cream.

740
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,320
- I'm going to make it with a grape jelly. 
- Grape?

741
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,000
Grape jelly and peanut butter's the best combination.

742
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,760
Ugne is shunning convention

743
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,640
and will spread her grape jelly jam

744
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,800
in the centre of her peanut butter ice cream

745
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,240
rather than on her sponge, which will be flavoured with chocolate.

746
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,040
I mean, it sounds interesting.

747
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,120
Not convinced, totally, about the flavour combinations.

748
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,640
- You never do. 
- No.

749
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,000
I need this to work today.

750
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,560
- Good luck. 
- Thank you.

751
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,120
It's quite a thick custard.

752
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,560
The ice cream will only freeze in time

753
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,440
if they've struck the fine balance

754
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,840
between coconut, fats and flavourings.

755
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,760
I'm making a chocolate ice cream.

756
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,320
Very nearly went for a tropical theme, which I'm glad I didn't.

757
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,880
This is coconut ice cream.

758
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,320
I made it at home and it set,

759
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,960
so I really hope it sets today.

760
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,160
So, I've got the ice cream, itself, chilling in there now

761
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,000
and here we've got my two, sort of, "boats" I'm calling them.

762
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,480
Each half is going to be filled with ice cream

763
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,680
and then once that's all chilled and assembled,

764
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,960
pop the two halves together and roll it up.

765
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,360
Ian hopes his moulds will shape his mango and stem ginger ice cream

766
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,000
into a perfect round to form the centre of his "dessert" island.

767
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,760
Complete with caramel palm trees

768
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,720
and chocolate marzipan coconuts.

769
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,480
There is another desert island.

770
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,840
- There is. 
- How do you feel about that?

771
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,080
Well...

772
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,600
- ..he hasn't got that. 
- Yep.

773
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,400
The ice cream is still quite...

774
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,320
..liquidy.

775
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,440
Didn't quite get the flavour that I want.

776
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,360
I better add another half teaspoon.

777
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,520
It looks like it's, sort of...

778
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,040
setting.

779
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,240
It's looking a bit...bubbly.

780
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,520
I am making a pear and chocolate,

781
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,760
and macadamia nut, ice cream buche,

782
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,480
so there isn't a roll as such...

783
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,360
..which is my concern.

784
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,800
Flora's buche will be assembled in a mould.

785
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,600
She'll create layers of vanilla ice cream, pear jam,

786
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,640
caramelised pears and macadamia nuts inside a thin chocolate sponge.

787
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,080
If it goes to plan, it will be lovely

788
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,760
but it hasn't ever gone to plan before so...

789
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,000
I'm not optimistic.

790
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,400
Ian and Nadiya have set themselves an extra challenge -

791
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,720
to create an additional frozen element

792
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,280
to go inside the ice cream.

793
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,440
This is my strawberry and lime mousse.

794
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,920
I don't know if anybody's doing a mousse...

795
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,640
but it worked for me at home

796
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,240
and I'm just hoping it works for me here.

797
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,520
Nadiya's ice cream mousse will run through her chocolate ice cream.

798
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,320
She'll wrap it in a sponge with a henna-inspired design.

799
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,880
Yeah. Happy with that.

800
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,680
I'm just going to leave it in the freezer,

801
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,400
just because I can't leave it out or it'll get too runny.

802
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,880
Just a little bit of mango sauce in there

803
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,520
which we freeze like that

804
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,800
and hopefully, at the end, we just...

805
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,120
and that will be the core of the ice cream roll.

806
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,560
So, in the freezer it goes.

807
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,680
Mary and Paul are expecting a show-stopping sponge.

808
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,320
Six of the bakers are inlaying designs.

809
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,840
I will freeze it and then I'll pour Swiss roll batter over it.

810
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,080
When it bakes, this pattern should be left on the sponge

811
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,040
Is this helping?

812
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,640
That always helps.

813
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,440
I love it when there's a Sue hanging above my head.

814
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,960
Hey.

815
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,880
As the designs set,

816
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,200
they move onto making a fatless sponge -

817
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,760
which they must be able to manipulate without it cracking.

818
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,320
I made it a few times.

819
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,480
Well, maybe like three times, the sponge itself,

820
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,760
and it's been OK.

821
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,560
Well, it's quite sort of light and fluffy, which is what you want,

822
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,720
but it's still quite reasonably robust to roll.

823
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,480
I'm very aware that everyone else is doing a lot more

824
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,200
design and decorative stuff so...

825
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,960
Yeah, I dunno. Fingers crossed.

826
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,920
This is one of the desserts

827
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,520
that the flaws are so obvious if you get something wrong.

828
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,280
If it's too thick in places, it tends to crack a little bit -

829
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,800
which is what I don't want.

830
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,240
The challenge, when cooking a sponge to roll,

831
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,560
is judging the moment when it's cooked through

832
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,520
but still has the flexibility.

833
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,200
Are you enjoying this, Ian? Is this going OK?

834
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,400
I think it's going OK.

835
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,680
I, kind of, feel like I need to do a good job today.

836
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,280
Are you feeling the pressure?

837
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,560
Yeah, I was quite relaxed the last couple of weeks...

838
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,200
- Yeah. 
- ..at this point. This week I've got to fight a bit harder.

839
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,800
So, what are you doing to sort of...?

840
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,760
I was hoping to do a few extra twiddly bits

841
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,000
- but I don't think I'll get time to do those. 
- Come on,

842
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,600
- you can do the twiddly bits, Ian. 
- Twiddly bits, hmm. 
- Come on.

843
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,400
So, it's had 10 minutes now.

844
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,440
It's quite nice and brown on top.

845
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,320
I think I'll give it another couple of minutes.

846
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,080
I'd like it a bit browner, you know.

847
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,960
Just give it another minute, I reckon.

848
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,360
Ah, baby.

849
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,960
That's going to do me.

850
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,920
Yeah, it's done.

851
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,960
Peeling away.

852
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,680
That looks quite nice.

853
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,360
Ahh, it smells nice.

854
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,560
So, that just needs to cool,

855
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,280
for me to not...

856
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,960
do something to it.

857
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,600
It's quite crispy.

858
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,240
Might a left it in a bit long.

859
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,880
Roll up, roll up.

860
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,320
Bakers, you've got one hour to complete your diary-free creations.

861
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,320
One hour.

862
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,440
OK.

863
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,800
So, the paddle's stuck, which means...

864
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,880
it's churned.

865
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,680
Now, just to get it out.

866
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,960
Yum.

867
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,840
I pleased with this.

868
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,240
See, it's far too runny.

869
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,400
It looks OK.

870
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,040
I think the consistency's all right. It's almost spreadable -

871
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,200
which is what I want when I make the roll, you know.

872
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,320
I've got my tubes.

873
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,440
So, basically, by dividing the ice cream up into two halves,

874
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,600
hopefully, it should chill down quite a lot quicker.

875
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,000
I just need to roll it into a log now.

876
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,920
Let it set completely in the freezer.

877
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,480
Slightly worried, yes. Who wouldn't be?

878
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,280
Who wants an ice cream roll with slop out of the side?

879
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,400
Bakers, you've got half an hour left to roll and freeze.

880
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,960
Ooh.

881
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,080
- TAMAL: 
- Don't mind us.

882
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,880
MAT AND TAMAL CHEER

883
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,880
- NADIYA: 
- Oh, he's clever.

884
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,200
I have to work really quickly.

885
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,320
because everything stars to melt really fast, so...

886
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,480
got to keep going.

887
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,560
I'm just trying to get a really, really fine sponge on the outside...

888
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,080
because I've just found that it helps ice cream freeze

889
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,680
and because there's so much going in terms of filling...

890
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,320
..I think a finer sponge is just a bit nicer.

891
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,120
The jam should neatly bind the sponge to the ice cream.

892
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,080
So relieved to see this is nice and frozen,

893
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,360
just how I wanted it to.

894
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,920
Seems to be nice and solid.

895
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,840
This has jam inside the ice cream. See?

896
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,720
- It's INSIDE the ice cream?! 
- Yeah.

897
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,680
Might that stop it setting?

898
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,280
I hope it won't.

899
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,680
Cos most people have ice cream within jam,

900
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,920
but you've gone the other way.

901
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,480
Mary and Paul are expecting a perfect round of ice cream

902
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,560
contained and sealed by the sponge.

903
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,360
Ice cream is too big, I think.

904
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,400
It is too big.

905
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,120
Do you want a hand, Alvin?

906
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,200
- Yes, please. 
- What do you want me to do?

907
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,000
Just want to cut this half away.

908
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,960
- It's not going to go in, is it? 
- It's not going to go.

909
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,400
Oh, that's full.

910
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,840
It's a bit like me trying to get my trousers on every morning.

911
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,760
OK. That's it.

912
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,160
Yes.

913
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,560
(Oh, no.)

914
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,400
(Damn.)

915
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,000
Sponge cracked.

916
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,960
I'm going to put this back in the freezer.

917
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,000
The ice cream has just one more chance to freeze up

918
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,280
before judging.

919
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,320
Yep, that's really cold.

920
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,080
Then just close it...

921
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,800
and hope for the best.

922
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,000
You're looking very concerned.

923
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,600
It's the ice cream.

924
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,720
Ice cream, anyone?

925
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,240
That was intense.

926
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,040
No show-stopping ice cream roll would be complete

927
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,240
without show-stopping decoration.

928
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,480
I've never watched a man,

929
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,440
particularly someone of your stature,

930
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,840
turn a calf...

931
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,760
quite as marvellously as the way you turn that.

932
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,560
Killer hands.

933
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,400
That's good to know.

934
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,000
My hands are shaking more than I would like,

935
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,320
- so it's not exactly a straight line. 
- Looks slightly scary, doesn't it?

936
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,320
Making palm fronds with it.

937
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,000
I love these hanging nuts.

938
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,640
I had to put three on there for obvious reasons, yes.

939
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,760
You need a gusset, Paul, that's going to be a...

940
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,080
Bit of a loincloth going on.

941
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,440
Yes, we can't have her going out on the beach like that,

942
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,240
she'll get arrested. HE LAUGHS

943
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,760
An island.

944
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,280
This is just a large block of Parmesan.

945
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,160
Parmesan? That would be interesting wouldn't it?

946
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,920
I can't remember what it's called.

947
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,720
Marzipan! Marzipan. Yes.

948
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,960
It's the gusset. HE LAUGHS

949
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,720
No that's bad, that's bad.

950
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,520
That's better.

951
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,120
- Is that better? 
- Yeah, that's much better. Legs together.

952
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,800
- I think you should leave her alone. 
- No, no. That's all...

953
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,720
All good, all encased, all safe.

954
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,560
Now, let's turn her over and see what's happening in the back.

955
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,160
- there's nothing at the back there's just... 
- No, she's nude.

956
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,680
- Let's leave her be. 
- Naked.

957
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,040
OK, bakers, five minute left.

958
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,200
Ahh! Cold, cold, cold.

959
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,920
Come on.

960
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,560
It's falling apart.

961
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,720
In the freezer...quickly.

962
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,680
That is pretty poor looking.

963
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,400
I think I let my glaze thicken too much before I poured it on.

964
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,600
There she goes.

965
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,440
There's a few air pockets in there...

966
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,000
There's a few air pockets down there as well.

967
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,960
OK, bakers, time's up.

968
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,120
Time to take your rolls out of the freezer

969
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,280
and put them on the end of your benches.

970
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,440
It looks fun. It looks ready for a party.

971
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,760
Facing me, I've got a bit of a crack.

972
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,480
It can crack if it's overcooked.

973
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,000
That is stunning.

974
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,200
I mean, really good.

975
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,280
The passion fruit comes through really well,

976
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,760
pineapple holds its own and the sponge is delicious.

977
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,200
That Italian meringue is fantastic, as well, on the top.

978
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,880
If I'd done that, I'd be really proud.

979
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,280
I'd be amazed.

980
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,760
I think it's beautiful.

981
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,000
Quite flat. Have you done layers?

982
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,760
Because I was expecting it to be a bit more domed.

983
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,720
I'm just trying to find the sponge.

984
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,800
Have you got the sponge?

985
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,440
I think that's part of the problem.

986
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,280
The sponge is so thin...

987
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,320
that it's struggling to keep the control

988
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,120
of the ice cream that's inside.

989
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,480
Did you intend to do a Swiss roll?

990
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,760
Yeah, I always want...

991
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,440
Yeah, I didn't realise it was a different type.

992
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,800
The ice cream's all gone.

993
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,600
It was getting pushed out as I rolled it up.

994
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,960
It, sort of... Like a tube of toothpaste, so I tried...

995
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,360
Which is why the idea was to just roll it once,

996
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,720
to keep the ice cream...

997
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,520
- It makes sense now. 
- ..inside.

998
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,440
- Nice sponge. 
- Nice Swiss roll.

999
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,600
A good sponge, but where's the ice cream?

1000
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,680
I know.

1001
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,720
I think it looks really most exciting

1002
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,520
- and you've done that all freehand. It was your design. 
- Yeah.

1003
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,400
Your chocolate ice cream is very good

1004
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,160
because it masks the coconut.

1005
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,880
That strawberry mousse is beautiful

1006
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,440
and I think the whole package together...

1007
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,000
I think you should be very proud of yourself.

1008
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,440
Wow, look at the colour on that.

1009
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,600
The flavour's great in the ice cream.

1010
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,840
I think the depth of the sponge is good.

1011
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,680
The mango lost its way slightly,

1012
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,240
the coconut inside is just overwhelming everything

1013
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,720
but the Italian meringue on the top is delicious.

1014
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,000
Thank you, sir.

1015
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,440
It does look a little bit sad.

1016
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,520
I know you were trying to show us lots of skills.

1017
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,360
As soon as you put the grape jelly

1018
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,440
in with the ice cream, it's going to make it run,

1019
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,400
and I just wonder whether peanut butter goes with these, we shall see.

1020
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,000
The actual sponge itself

1021
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,440
is very, very close textured.

1022
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,440
That peanut ice cream is fantastic. It is beautiful.

1023
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,560
Thank you.

1024
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,880
That is lovely.

1025
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,000
Quite refreshing...

1026
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,520
against the chocolate as well.

1027
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,800
The grape actually gives a little bit of...soothing to the peanut.

1028
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,520
Although...

1029
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,600
it looks like you've dropped it from 10 foot.

1030
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,360
SHE LAUGHS

1031
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,680
LAUGHTER

1032
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,960
I think your lady needs to get a little bit of sunshine to her.

1033
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,680
The design of your palm trees

1034
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,680
and so forth, I think, is lovely.

1035
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,320
See if we can get a slice.

1036
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,600
Shall we take the lady off?

1037
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,920
Oh, please, no. Paul, no, no!

1038
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,560
I won't.

1039
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,560
I can't believe you did that.

1040
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,960
I think it's excellent.

1041
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,920
I think the blend of the mango with the pineapple, with the sponge.

1042
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,280
Great proportions altogether,

1043
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,920
and finely decorated.

1044
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,840
Got that mango absolutely in the middle.

1045
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,320
THEY LAUGH

1046
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,560
The ginger with the mango and the ice cream,

1047
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,240
altogether with the jam and the sponge are...

1048
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,760
..ingenious, yeah.

1049
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,720
The texture of each component is right

1050
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,840
and the flavour is knock-out. Well done.

1051
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,720
- Brilliant, thank you. 
- Well done.

1052
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,800
So, Paul and Mary, one of the most technicolour challenges

1053
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,320
we've ever had on Bake Off. How did they do?

1054
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,520
I think Nadiya's done well.

1055
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,760
I thought the design on the top of her sponge was fantastic.

1056
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,680
Altogether, as a package,

1057
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,560
very well thought through.

1058
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,280
Ian went into today with quite a lot to pull back.

1059
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,720
Has he managed to do that?

1060
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,040
MARY: He was really right down at the bottom

1061
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,880
and today he's lifted himself up

1062
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,960
to do something absolutely beautiful.

1063
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,800
Ugne has had a bit of a bad day.

1064
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,120
The ice cream flavour was pretty good but,

1065
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,960
I think, once she thought of putting the grape jam through it...

1066
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,600
that was always going to be a problem.

1067
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,400
I think Flora's in a little bit of trouble,

1068
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,800
the look is great but it's got to taste good.

1069
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,600
The whole thing has got to work together.

1070
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,560
Are you two clear as to who's done really well and who might be going?

1071
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,400
MARY: I've certainly made up my mind,

1072
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,000
- I would think we're on the same wavelength. 
- I think so.

1073
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,360
In which case...

1074
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,560
shall we share a torso?

1075
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,680
- Yeah. 
- What do you want? I might have a leg.

1076
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,600
- I'd like a bikini bottom. 
- Really?

1077
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,200
Bakers, today I get the wonderful job

1078
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,040
of announcing Star Baker.

1079
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,600
Now, today's Star Baker is terrible.

1080
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,160
Terrible at technical challenges

1081
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:48,200
but something rather magical happened.

1082
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,960
And instead of being rather terrible, became rather brilliant

1083
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,080
to go along with the rest of her brilliant baking.

1084
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:57,760
- Nadiya, congratulations. 
- APPLAUSE

1085
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,120
Now, this job gets harder every week

1086
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,480
as we get to know you and love you and...

1087
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,760
..as you know we can take everybody with us into next week's Bake Off,

1088
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,040
so the person that were saying goodbye to today is...

1089
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,920
Ugne.

1090
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,760
- We're so sorry. 
- No, it's fine.

1091
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,960
We're very, very sorry to say goodbye.

1092
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,720
It was a shame to say goodbye to Ugne

1093
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,840
because she has potential.

1094
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,400
But I think she got carried away of trying to do too much.

1095
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,360
She is a fantastic baker at the end of the day

1096
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,760
and I do hope she carries on.

1097
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,240
She's got some great ideas for flavours

1098
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,320
but sometimes she goes a little bit wild.

1099
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,560
I will keep working.

1100
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,960
I will keep baking, definitely.

1101
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,200
Keep experimenting.

1102
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,400
Massively dodging the bullet

1103
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,960
and that's not a comfortable position to be in.

1104
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,480
I'm just feeling hugely relieved more than anything.

1105
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,320
Because, yeah, I was...

1106
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,280
I had fair reason to feel quite nervous.

1107
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,200
This weekend has really taught me

1108
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,880
that you've got to fight hard round here. You really have.

1109
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,840
- Well done. 
- Thank you.

1110
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,880
See, I told you.

1111
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,920
My kids are going to be really proud.

1112
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,080
And my husband's going to be so proud.

1113
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,480
They're going to be so proud, I know they are.

1114
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,440
It's weird, I'm never proud of myself

1115
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,240
but I'm actually really proud of myself.

1116
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,080
Next week, pastry.

1117
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,160
So difficult to roll. I don't know why.

1118
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,440
A shortcrust signature

1119
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,240
with a dreaded pitfall...

1120
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,120
Ooh, bit of a soggy bottom there.

1121
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,000
- A pungent technical... 
- SHE RETCHES

1122
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,640
..that beats going to the gym...

1123
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,480
It's a good little workout, actually.

1124
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,640
- ..and the puff pastry Showstopper... 
- HE EXHALES

1125
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,520
..with more huff than puff.

1126
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,200
It's hard to pick. They're all so hideously deformed

1127
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,120
Your plums aren't cooked either.
