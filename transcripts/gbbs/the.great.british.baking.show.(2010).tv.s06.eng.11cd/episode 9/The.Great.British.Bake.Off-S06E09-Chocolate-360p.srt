1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Four bakers remain, two boys, two girls,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,880
all ready to tackle the semifinal.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,080
- I'm semi-hysterical. 
- I'm semi-excited. 
- Let's get the semis on.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,480
- Welcome... BOTH: 
- ..to the Great British Bake Off.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,840
- Last week, the bakers tackled patisserie. 
- Why won't it pipe?

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,240
Nadiya was awarded Star Baker for the second time.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,320
Well done.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,560
And despite Flora's underwhelming overembellishments...

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,680
- I think you attempt too many things. 
- Sorry.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,840
..it was Paul whose problematic patisserie

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,160
saw him leave the tent in the quarterfinals.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,000
- Unlucky, buddy. 
- Cheers, Paul.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,840
Now the four remaining bakers

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,680
face a semifinal dedicated to the trickiest of ingredients.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,000
- Chocolate. 
- Nothing good coming out of that oven this afternoon.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,240
- And they're in for a shocking... 
- What?!

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,120
- ...Bake Off first. 
- Will you remind me to breathe? 
- Never bake again.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,280
But who will prove they're worthy of a place in the final?

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,920
Oh, God, they're really burnt.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,000
That was stressful. I'd sooner have another baby.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,360
I really would.

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,960
AS FORREST GUMP: Life is like a box of chocolate.

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,280
NORMAL VOICE: You never know what you're going to get.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,800
Chocolate?

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,240
It's chocolate week.

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,080
It's week nine, and out of the 12 bakers who started,

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,080
only four have made it this far.

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,360
With one Star Baker title to his name,

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,080
Tamal has impressed with his creativity and stunning flavours...

30
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,240
- That's fantastic. 
- Thank you. 
- Oh, the handshake! 
- Thank you.

31
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,400
..but has struggled with his timings.

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,960
- Tamal... 
- What? 
- Less than a minute now. Come along. 
- Grr!

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,880
It would be amazing if I managed to complete a bake on time

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,400
without the stress.

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,640
It's not really my style, is it?

36
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,480
Flora's bakes are always beautiful,

37
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,480
but she has a tendency to stray from the brief

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,760
and place style over substance.

39
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,560
Just forget about the amaretti. It doesn't add anything to it.

40
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,880
I've been criticised a lot

41
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,080
for things that take away from the brief.

42
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,680
I'm trying not to distract too much this week, but improve.

43
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,920
Nadiya overcame her troubles with Technicals...

44
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,520
Last place... Whose is this?

45
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,240
..and has grown in confidence,

46
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,560
impressing with her artistic flair and bold use of flavours.

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,960
The flavour is quite something.

48
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,000
If I go back nine weeks, I didn't think that I would be here now.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,040
I just have to remember and think back

50
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,000
how I got through those nerves and being at the bottom,

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,160
and I just have to remember that and say,

52
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,120
"Look, you're here. Look how far you've come."

53
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,480
Ian's precision, ingenuity

54
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,720
and unusual and exquisite home-grown flavourings...

55
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,320
Interesting that you're using rosemary.

56
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,040
..have earned him three Star Baker titles.

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,840
Well done.

58
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,440
So, my daughter said,

59
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,320
"I don't think you're good enough to win it or anything."

60
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,560
But it's like, well, you know, we're down to the last four.

61
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,680
You know, playing the numbers game,

62
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,280
things are looking pretty reasonable.

63
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,200
But, unfortunately, there's some pretty talented people in there.

64
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,760
So, you know, don't want to get ahead of myself.

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,480
Good morning, bakers.

66
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,400
Or should I say... semifinalists? Well done.

67
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,480
Now, today, very exciting. It's the thing I love most in the world.

68
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,360
- Guinea pigs? 
- No. Chocolate.

69
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,200
We'd very much like you to make a chocolate tart this week.

70
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,040
Now, the pastry can be any kind of pastry you want,

71
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,840
as long as it's chocolate-flavoured.

72
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,120
The filling can be anything you want, as long as it's chocolate-flavoured.

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,160
And you can use any decoration you want,

74
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,440
although my betting is that you'll use chocolate.

75
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,120
You've got two-and-a-half hours to go cocoa-loco.

76
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,880
- On your marks. 
- Get set. 
- Bake!

77
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,400
Let's not say semifinals. Just easier not to say it.

78
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,360
Just another day, it's just another chocolate tart.

79
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,560
It's only slightly horribly tense. I think everyone's quite nervous.

80
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,440
This is the semifinal now. There is no room for error.

81
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,960
If they make an error in making the chocolate tart at this point,

82
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,200
it can prove fatal going into the final.

83
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,640
You have to be on it.

84
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,880
Chocolate tart. Sound very simple.

85
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,560
But it's got to be immaculate, it's got to be a superb flavour.

86
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,280
It's got to taste brilliant. It's not as easy as it sounds.

87
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,760
I'm just making a sweet shortcrust,

88
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,120
but basically swapping some of the flour for cocoa.

89
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,280
I think the addition of cocoa to pastry is a bit of a nightmare.

90
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,000
You'd think adding a dry ingredient into a fairly dry mixture

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,320
would be fine.

92
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,680
But, unfortunately, it's not as plain sailing as it appears.

93
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,720
I think when you add the cocoa powder,

94
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,280
it does become a little bit more brittle.

95
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,080
So, I think that's the worry.

96
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,840
The trick to making perfect chocolate pastry

97
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,760
is adding just enough liquid to counteract the dryness of the cocoa

98
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,160
and bind all of the ingredients together.

99
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,360
The little white flecks in this are ground oats.

100
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,400
- Morning, Tamal. 
- Hiya. Morning.

101
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,480
Right, tell us all about your chocolate tart.

102
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,040
The basis for my chocolate tart was an American recipe.

103
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,640
You've got the chocolate filling

104
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,120
which is quite a dense chocolaty filling, quite rich.

105
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,440
And then on top of that is a layer of raspberry coulis,

106
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,160
just a thin layer.

107
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,400
After struggling with time last week,

108
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,520
Tamal has opted for a minimalist chocolate tart.

109
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,600
He'll decorate it modestly with a layer of crushed pecan praline,

110
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,520
and he's making just the one filling.

111
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,280
It's always very difficult with chocolate to know when it's done,

112
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,960
because it's dark already.

113
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,360
- Yeah. 
- You've been practising? 
- I have been practising.

114
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,680
I'm going to do exactly the same as I've done at home and hope for the best.

115
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,440
- Good luck. 
- Thank you.

116
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,600
I hope it's not too simple.

117
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,800
I think if it's tasty, that's what they'll be looking for the most.

118
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,600
- Good morning. 
- Morning.

119
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,200
Right, can you tell us all about your chocolate tart?

120
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,800
So, I'm going to have... It's a dark chocolate pastry,

121
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,720
and then I have the passion fruit layer, it'll be like a custard,

122
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,760
and then I'll have a milk chocolate mousse

123
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,440
and then a dark chocolate ganache.

124
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,600
What are we expecting when we look at it?

125
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,120
There'll be quite a lot of decoration on top.

126
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,080
There'll be some jellies and some chocolate work.

127
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,000
True to form, Flora is going all out on the decoration.

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,200
She'll top her triple-layered tart with macarons.

129
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,480
Semifinals!

130
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,040
And I've probably given myself too much to do already, but, oh...

131
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Just want to get this pastry as thin as possible

132
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,280
without it completely breaking apart.

133
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,160
This is for the macaroons.

134
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,480
I'm just going to get them piped, and once they're out and drying,

135
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,520
I'm going to roll out my pastry.

136
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,160
- Good morning. 
- Good morning, good morning. 
- Morning, Ian.

137
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,280
What have you got up your sleeve for us today?

138
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,440
So, I'm doing a bay-infused salted caramel sauce on chocolate pastry.

139
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,080
Bay-infused caramel? What do you think that brings to the table?

140
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,080
It just sort of brings a slight sort of, I don't know,

141
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,800
sweetness and floral element to it.

142
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,120
Once again, Ian's relying on his home-grown herbs

143
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,160
to set his tart above the rest.

144
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,920
- I think you're going to have to get a move on. 
- Of course. Definitely.

145
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,560
Thank you.

146
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,600
The pastry's feeling quite good, actually. It's about as it should be.

147
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,960
I've had issues with the pastry just not being very pretty.

148
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,760
So, I make sure that it's one whole piece

149
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,200
when I'm laying the pastry into the tray.

150
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,640
There may need to be a bit of patchwork, but that's fine.

151
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,960
Shortcrust was made for patchwork.

152
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,680
- Good morning, Nadiya. 
- Morning. 
- Nadiya, tell us all about your tart.

153
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,560
So, I'm doing a chocolate tart with chocolate pastry

154
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,440
and then it's going to have a layer of salted caramel and peanut,

155
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,560
and then a layer of chocolate mousse and peanut.

156
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,840
Nadiya will make her own peanut butter

157
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,480
to flavour her chocolate mousse

158
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,320
and she's covering it with a chocolate ganache.

159
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,960
I'm going to decorate it with some truffles covered in peanut powder.

160
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,800
Peanut powder - that's interesting.

161
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,920
I'm going to use something called tapioca maltodextrin,

162
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,000
which is a starch, which, essentially, it can take on fats.

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,760
What I do is, at home, anything that I buy that's a fat,

164
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,200
I always put a bit of that in

165
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,320
just to make it into a powder and see how it tastes.

166
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,520
- You're a bit of a scientist. 
- You're in the wrong job.

167
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,320
- Could you make that into a powder? 
- We don't want Mary into a powder.

168
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,600
Thank you very much.

169
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,560
- Everyone needs a sprinkle of Mary. 
- Have you finished? 
- Yes.

170
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,920
- She's furious now. 
- You just get on with that.

171
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,480
God! Can you imagine? That's what she suggested!

172
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,080
No, let's not turn Mary into a powder.

173
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,280
With her pastry in the oven, Flora moves on to her first layer.

174
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,280
I have the passion fruit layer, which will be a bit like a custard.

175
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,240
If it's overbaked, it'll go like scrambled eggs.

176
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,520
Ian, Nadiya and Tamal are using caramel

177
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,200
to bring sweetness to their tarts.

178
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,040
I'm just making the caramel now for the pecan praline.

179
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,520
That worked fine twice at home

180
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,840
and then I had one batch that just crystallised.

181
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,880
Just like eating caster sugar, basically.

182
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,640
Because what I'm doing is so simple, everything has to be done properly.

183
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,520
Tamal will use his praline to make a pecan brittle

184
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,440
which will add texture to the top of his tart.

185
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Nadiya's salted caramel will cover her pastry base.

186
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,960
I'm using rock salt for my salted caramel so that it's not all salt,

187
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,680
you get bursts of saltiness when you bite into it.

188
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,440
I really like salted caramel, but I've done it before

189
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,720
where it's really salty and it's kind of been...

190
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,000
It just becomes savoury.

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,560
She's also adding ground peanuts for extra crunch.

192
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,600
So far, so good.

193
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Like Nadiya, Ian's flavouring his caramel with salt,

194
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,840
but he's using fine salt rather than rock salt.

195
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,640
It's just trying to get the balance right with the salt.

196
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,240
Because it can easily be overwhelmingly sweet, this tart.

197
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,160
Oh, that's a lovely colour.

198
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,760
See, pray and the praline will happen. Perfect.

199
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,960
I can't really tell when it's baked when you're blind baking.

200
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,720
I'm just going from the fact that it's kind of had ten minutes

201
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,120
and that's what I've always done at home.

202
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,160
Looks about right. It's not burnt.

203
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,480
The bakers are halfway through.

204
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,640
That's the passion fruit custard.

205
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,840
Got the caramel sauce here.

206
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,760
This is my salted caramel and peanut layer.

207
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,640
I'm going to stick it in the freezer for about ten minutes.

208
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,360
It does look slightly dense.

209
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,680
Now you see why it needs the raspberry

210
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,520
to lighten it up a little bit.

211
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,360
With their first layers complete,

212
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,440
Nadiya and Flora get to work on their decoration.

213
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,840
I'm just starting on the chocolate filling.

214
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,880
I'm just aware that everyone else looks much busier than me.

215
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,280
Maybe I should have done a tiered chocolate tart.

216
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,320
I think it's because I've got Flora behind me

217
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,080
and she's making about six billion different elements to hers.

218
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,280
So, it's like, oh...

219
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,560
I should probably be just concentrating on a tart

220
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,920
and that's it, not venturing into other minefields.

221
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,600
But I always do.

222
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,600
Sorry.

223
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Maybe slightly over-set it.

224
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,280
But, hopefully, the freezer will prevent any further cooking.

225
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,080
I'm praying.

226
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,960
I'm so aware of how good it has to be that it's just painful now.

227
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,720
That's that done.

228
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,680
- Ohh. 
- No snooping.

229
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,360
Bakers, half an hour. That was tart.

230
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,600
I think the raspberry balances it out nicely,

231
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,720
so hopefully they'll like it as well.

232
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,600
No, no, I never look forward to facing Paul. Never.

233
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,640
He scares me witless.

234
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,320
I'm looking for a beautifully smooth mirrored surface

235
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,880
that you can kind of see your own reflection in.

236
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,560
Ohh.

237
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,520
It's just not coming together.

238
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,400
It's on now and there's very little I can do about it.

239
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,880
OK, bakers, 15 minutes till your ganache hits my gnashers.

240
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,280
15 minutes.

241
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,600
I'm going to coat my truffles in a peanut butter powder.

242
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,880
Will turn Paul into powder if he doesn't put me through to the final.

243
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,400
I could be finished before the time is up.

244
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,480
It's rather delicate work, this bit.

245
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,960
Ian's is really classy. I wish I'd done a mirror glaze.

246
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,240
Hard. Could be my last Signature.

247
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,800
Why am I shaking?

248
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,880
OK, bakers, tart time is up.

249
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,920
- You've gone for a simple finish. 
- Mm-hm.

250
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,400
And providing that everything else is right, it'll be good.

251
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,960
The pastry on the outside is lovely.

252
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,000
You've got it right into all the corners.

253
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,360
But I think we need to have a look inside to see how this holds.

254
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,400
Lovely thin pastry, I can see.

255
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,400
And a good layer of your chocolate mixture.

256
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,280
I love the contrast of textures, because we've got crisp pastry,

257
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,880
we've got a crunchy top and we've got a smooth middle.

258
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,160
I'm trying to debate whether I like it or not. Um...

259
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,120
No, I do like it. If you hadn't put that coulis on the top,

260
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,320
it'd be too much, I couldn't eat it.

261
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,760
- But the fact that that's on the top makes it a great tart. 
- Well done.

262
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,400
- Thank you. 
- Thank you, Tamal.

263
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,320
Quite attractive. You've got a lovely mirror on there.

264
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,680
You've got a nice thin crust. It looks good. I love that shine.

265
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh, it cuts well.

266
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,520
It's rich, it's creamy.

267
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,960
Once this is all assembled, you really can't taste the bay leaf.

268
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,640
- I don't like the caramel underneath. 
- OK. Mm-hm.

269
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,760
I think if you'd left it pure caramel,

270
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,840
- you would have been better off. 
- Right.

271
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,400
You're king of flavours and I think you missed a trick there.

272
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,640
- OK. 
- Thank you.

273
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,800
Well, the appearance is very attractive.

274
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,640
I love your twirls on the top.

275
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm a little bit concerned about the thickness of the pastry.

276
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,160
But let's have a look at it and see what it's like.

277
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,360
It's holding together really well.

278
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,040
I like it.

279
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,480
I like it and I'm not a peanut fan.

280
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,400
Ohh!

281
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,360
Well done, Nadiya. That is fantastic.

282
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,200
The peanut butter coming through is not overwhelming,

283
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,880
it's not stodgy, which it could be.

284
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,720
I love the crunch at the bottom as well from the salted caramel.

285
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,400
- Spot-on. Well done. 
- Thank you.

286
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,000
Handshake! I got a handshake! That's cool.

287
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,400
I think the overall decoration does look very attractive.

288
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,400
I just hope it tastes as good as it looks.

289
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,200
You haven't got much of a shine on your ganache.

290
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,560
Maybe you got it a little bit warm.

291
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,760
- Cuts well, though. 
- It does cut well. Great layers.

292
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,440
Really distinctive colours which you see. Very well done.

293
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,040
It has split, your passion fruit base, hasn't it?

294
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
- I thought it had, yeah. 
- Quite badly.

295
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,520
But it's light

296
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,120
and the kick of tartness that comes from the passion fruit is fantastic.

297
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,960
You've gone to the trouble of making macarons as well.

298
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,520
If you're going to do a macaron, do it properly.

299
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,760
MEL GASPS

300
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,560
- Not good. 
- No? 
- It's overbaked. Dry as a bone.

301
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,440
But the overall appearance and the flavours are good

302
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,960
and your pastry is crisp.

303
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,240
- Thank you, Flora. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you.

304
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,560
I mean, it wasn't a complete disaster,

305
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,600
but for a semifinal Signature, it was pretty catastrophic.

306
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,760
I mean, Nadiya got a handshake.

307
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,480
They liked it!

308
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,440
Paul and Mary liked it, so...

309
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,040
And I got a lingering handshake. Happy days!

310
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,640
Mary liked it. Paul did his...

311
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,520
"Oooh, I'm not sure. Do I like it?

312
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,320
"Yeah, it's all right."

313
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,400
I do feel a bit deflated. Paul didn't like that caramel.

314
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,560
I mean, it's the semifinals. Everything has to be tickety-boo.

315
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,200
But that wasn't. So, yeah, that's a bit of a worry.

316
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,600
Bakers, welcome to the Technical Challenge.

317
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,400
Now, as it's semifinal week,

318
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,680
Paul and Mary have something rather special up their sleeves.

319
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,080
It's a Mary recipe.

320
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,440
Now, Paul and Mary, as you know,

321
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,000
we ask you to leave the tent during the Technical Challenge,

322
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,400
so off you pop.

323
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,840
Bye-bye.

324
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,440
Now, bakers, because this Technical Challenge is so quick,

325
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,160
we're going to stagger your start times.

326
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,120
So, I'm going to be asking three of you to leave the tent.

327
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,760
As you all get called in one by one,

328
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,440
we'll let you know what that challenge is.

329
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,240
So, Tamal, Ian and Nadiya, could you please leave the tent?

330
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,360
- What?! 
- Off you pop. 
- Thanking you.

331
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,720
Don't go!

332
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,200
It's all gone a little bit Lord Of The Flies, hasn't it?

333
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,040
- See you shortly. 
- Oh, my God.

334
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,040
OK, Flora, Mary and Paul, please,

335
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,960
would like you to make a chocolate souffle.

336
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,560
You've got 1 hour and 15 minutes on the clock.

337
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,040
- On your marks. 
- Get set. 
- BOTH: 
- Bake!

338
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,480
This is the least funny thing I've ever done in my entire life.

339
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,720
Oh, goodness.

340
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,600
It says absolutely nothing in front of me. There is nothing helpful.

341
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,000
Number one, make a chocolate creme patissiere. OK.

342
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Number two, make a meringue. Number three, make a souffle.

343
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,560
I have never made a souffle in my life before.

344
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,280
That looks amazing.

345
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,920
So, why have you picked a chocolate souffle as a Technical Challenge?

346
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,280
Because I reckoned it was one of the most difficult things to make

347
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,720
and they were at the stage that we've really got to challenge them hard.

348
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,920
We're looking for a well risen, level souffle.

349
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,280
Now, it should be a little bit softer in the middle.

350
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,040
It's like a mousse in the middle. It's perfect.

351
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,840
- They've got to make a creme pat, a chocolate creme pat... 
- Exactly.

352
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,280
..and then on the other hand, whisk up some egg whites,

353
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,240
and they've got to be both exactly the right consistency to come

354
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,960
- together to allow for this souffle to rise. 
- Exactly.

355
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,360
They can go wrong by not mixing it right from the first place.

356
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,800
If they fold it in too much, it won't rise.

357
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,800
If they fold it in too little, you'll have big flecks

358
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,560
of beaten egg white, like little pieces of uncooked meringue in it.

359
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,920
Not good.

360
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,280
That's delicious. It melts in the mouth.

361
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,480
All the little bubbles in there, all the chocolate,

362
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,960
just bursts in your mouth.

363
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,560
Let's just hope we get some beautiful souffles,

364
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,880
- just like this one. 
- We shall see.

365
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,520
It says, "Bake for 40 to 50 minutes," so I need it to go in the oven...

366
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,760
Well, with 40 to 50 minutes left,

367
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,560
cos you need to serve it pretty much immediately, don't you?

368
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,480
It has to come out then. Oh, my God!

369
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,040
Will you remind me to breathe?

370
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,760
- I tell you, I've never been so happy to see you. 
- Lovely to be here!

371
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,800
Ian - Paul and Mary would very much like you to make

372
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,520
a chocolate souffle. You've got one hour and 15 minutes.

373
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,240
- On your mark. 
- Get set. 
- And bake.

374
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,640
HE INHALES SHARPLY

375
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,200
Right.

376
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,160
I kind of thought this one might rumble my lack of knowledge, but...

377
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,440
This is just to get the meringue started,

378
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,040
so six large egg whites and 40g of caster sugar, which I'll put in.

379
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,080
MEL: In order for the meringue and creme patissiere to combine

380
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,400
at the exact point,

381
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,040
the bakers will have to make both elements simultaneously.

382
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,120
My mind's gone blank.

383
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,840
I'm just trying to remember how to even make a creme pat.

384
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,520
HE SIGHS

385
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,600
Which I'm...

386
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,640
I just can't remember anything.

387
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,680
I'm... I'm going to...

388
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,800
I think I know what I'm...

389
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,800
This is for the creme pat. Creme pat is a posh way of saying "custard".

390
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,040
I've never made a chocolate creme pat.

391
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,400
- Ian, how goes it? 
- I can't even remember how to make a creme pat.

392
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,840
- You've made one on Bake Off before. 
- Yeah, exactly. I know.

393
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,680
- I've just got to get a grip and remember how to do it. 
- OK.

394
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,800
Do I put the cocoa in there now? I just don't know.

395
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,480
OK, Nadiya - Paul and Mary would love you, please,

396
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,120
to make a chocolate souffle.

397
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,920
You've got one hour and 15 minutes on the clock.

398
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,480
- On your marks. 
- Get set. 
- BOTH: Bake.

399
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,240
I've never made one. I have never made one.

400
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,480
Why have I never made a souffle? Oh, wait.

401
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,600
Because they're a pain to make.

402
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,040
I'm just trying to cool the creme pat down.

403
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,360
I just think if I add it to the egg whites

404
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,840
when it's still really hot, it's just going to do something dodgy.

405
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,120
I've no idea if it's correct. I'm just going to...

406
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,760
Instinct is telling me, "Don't add this when it's really, really hot."

407
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,480
Trying to make the creme pat.

408
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,560
If it's too hot, it'll cook the egg whites.

409
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,200
But if it's not hot enough...

410
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,360
I'll take it to as long as it cooks the flour out

411
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,680
and then I'm thinking I'm going to make my meringues.

412
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,920
But that's really hot, so why would I put hot with meringues?

413
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,640
It'd just melt everything.

414
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,720
So I think I'm going to whisk this until it's light...I think.

415
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,080
- Tamal - Paul and Mary would love you to make a chocolate souffle. 
- OK.

416
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,640
You've got an hour and 15 minutes.

417
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,000
- On your marks. 
- Get set. 
- BOTH: Bake.

418
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,480
Never made a souffle before.

419
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,960
Definitely never made a chocolate one, so...

420
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,080
awesome!

421
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,240
You know what? I'm always the last one,

422
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,040
so it's kind of fitting that I'm the last one to come into the tent.

423
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,520
I'll be the last one to finish as well, so...

424
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,960
- SUE: 
- The trick to a good souffle

425
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,960
is getting the consistency of the creme patissiere correct.

426
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,280
Too thin and it will sink, too thick and it won't rise.

427
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,920
FLORA: I really don't know how thick it has to be.

428
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,000
It's not massively thick for a creme pat.

429
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,240
Maybe if the creme pat's too thick, it won't rise up.

430
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,040
A creamy consistency here.

431
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,680
I'm going to strain it through a sieve.

432
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,800
You know what? It's not going to sieve, it's so thick.

433
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,200
So there's baking parchment and string for a collar

434
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,840
and I think what that does is it stops the outside cooking

435
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,360
too quick, so it cooks it more evenly throughout.

436
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,040
I think that's what happens.

437
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,760
- Do you need these paperclips? 
- I don't know why they're in there.

438
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,880
- Did they give you those? 
- They gave those. 
- Paperclips? 
- They're in there.

439
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,360
I don't quite know why.

440
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,160
What, for filing your souffle?

441
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,440
Yeah, for filing it away in the folder that says,

442
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,680
"Never bake again."

443
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,120
Sorry. That was just... Jekyll and Hyde moment.

444
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
Sorry. I'm OK. It's all fine.

445
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,280
Stiff enough not to fall out of the jug thing.

446
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,720
That looks about right.

447
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,880
MEL: The souffle will only rise

448
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,480
if the egg whites are stiff enough to trap the air, and they must be gently

449
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,320
folded in - just enough to fully combine with the creme patissiere.

450
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,960
Persevere. It's fine. It'll be OK.

451
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,400
So, the meringue's going to be a lot looser than the creme pat,

452
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,120
which is where the skill of the folding comes in, how you do it.

453
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,880
If that makes a souffle, I think I'll eat my hat.

454
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,960
Oh, my God. It really is going to rise a lot, isn't it?

455
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,720
Look, that's... Oh!

456
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,520
I don't know. It just...

457
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,560
It just looks way too sloppy. I don't think it's going to rise.

458
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,680
It's got white specks in it, which it shouldn't really,

459
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,360
but I'm running out of time so I'm going to just get it in.

460
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,240
I'm not even going to look in the oven.

461
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,360
There's nothing good coming out of that of this afternoon.

462
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,400
That was stressful.

463
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,880
Oh, my God! I would sooner...

464
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,040
I would sooner have another baby. I really would.

465
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,280
- SUE: 
- In 45 minutes, the bakers must open the door

466
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,360
and present the souffle for the second semifinal judging.

467
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,840
MEL: As always on the Technical Challenge,

468
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,600
Mary and Paul will blind-taste the bakes.

469
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,000
OK, baker one, your souffle time is over. I'm coming to get it.

470
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,720
MARY WHISPERS

471
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,480
This looks interesting. It's not very flat, though,

472
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,040
and this comes down to the texture of the creme pat with the meringue.

473
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,280
- It's holding up well. 
- It is holding up well.

474
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,040
It's got a good colour on it. Now, that's lovely. It's well baked.

475
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,800
- It does look good, doesn't it? 
- It does.

476
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,200
- Nice flavour. 
- Very good flavour.

477
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,960
I don't think it's been mixed enough but it is baked beautifully.

478
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,680
- Good result. 
- Yeah. 
- Good rise. 
- Mm.

479
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,600
- Thank you very much indeed. 
- MEL: Good luck. Enjoy.

480
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:08,160
This hasn't got much rise on it, because that should be up here.

481
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,920
Not as much height as the first one.

482
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,800
But they have incorporated every bit of the meringue.

483
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,720
- Good consistency. 
- It's a good consistency.

484
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,120
It's a lovely flavour and texture.

485
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,440
- It's just over-folded, which means you lose volume. 
- Yeah.

486
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,240
- Lots of meringue in this. You see the white meringue? 
- Mm.

487
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,400
All the way through it. Look at all that meringue in there.

488
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,680
- There's loads of it. See? 
- Not quite mixed in.

489
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,240
It's quite bad, that.

490
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,120
- It tastes absolutely fine. 
- Mm.

491
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,280
OK.

492
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,360
- It looked horrible. 
- You think so? 
- Yeah.

493
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,040
- We've got a good rise there. 
- The height is not bad.

494
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,520
- It's badly split, though. 
- And there are some flecks. 
- Let's have a look.

495
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,360
- It's holding up well. 
- It is, yeah.

496
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,000
There are a few flecks on the top but it isn't... It's all right inside.

497
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,320
It's a good flavour. The texture's very sponge-like, isn't it?

498
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,680
- It's very light. 
- It's beautifully light.

499
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,720
OK.

500
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,560
MEL: Whose souffle rose highest in Mary and Paul's expectations?

501
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,720
OK. In fourth place...

502
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,600
is this one. Whose is this? Nadiya.

503
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,560
What we can see is the lumps of meringue.

504
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,240
I think this comes down to

505
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,360
the actual way you've introduced the meringue into the mixture.

506
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,560
A little bit first, to slacken down the creme pat,

507
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,960
and then you fold the rest of it in.

508
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,640
So, in third place...

509
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,480
This was less risen than the rest.

510
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,440
The flavour was there but what had happened is,

511
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,200
you had over-mixed it and therefore we didn't get the rise.

512
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,840
In second place is this one.

513
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,360
A lot of flecks, though, still,

514
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,760
but you managed to get the height in your meringue

515
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,720
and you can tell that because it's still sitting on the top. Well done.

516
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,280
So all that remains is first here.

517
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,360
Flora, we had a good rise and when we delved inside,

518
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,600
it was a lovely texture and a lovely flavour.

519
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,240
You've done well. Well done.

520
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,960
Number one! And in the semifinals.

521
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,320
I will take that very nicely, thank you very much.

522
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,400
I felt well out of my comfort zone in that

523
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,440
but I got something that was edible.

524
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,400
I wasn't last, so I'm pleasantly surprised.

525
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,440
I just thought, "Oh, if I can just not come last, that would be nice."

526
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,080
So, yeah, to come second...

527
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,280
Pat myself on the back today.

528
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,760
SHE SIGHS

529
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,440
Just didn't want to come last. Er...

530
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,280
It's just standing out for the wrong reasons.

531
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,160
I know I'm going to go home.

532
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,560
I'm going to do the best Showstopper I can, but...

533
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,120
I don't think I'm going to...

534
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,520
I think it's going to be...

535
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,840
Would you say, Paul, that it's quite difficult to call who

536
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,520
- the three finalists are going to be this year? 
- I think yes.

537
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,040
I think over the two challenges, Ian is in the weakest position.

538
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,520
He didn't do particularly well in the Signature

539
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,000
and he was third in the Technical.

540
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,640
When you look at the other three, they've all moved around.

541
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,920
I mean, Nadiya was last in the Technical but, for me,

542
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,320
she was right up there in the Signature.

543
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,520
I think Tamal and Flora are sort of in the middle.

544
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,760
I think a lot of it depends on the Showstopper.

545
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,320
Mary, this is inconceivable - that Ian, who won Star Baker

546
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,200
three times in a row could be in the trouble in the semifinals.

547
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,800
Well, Ian's got to do well but, indeed, so has everybody else.

548
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,800
Morning, bakers. Welcome to your semifinal Showstopper day.

549
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,480
Now, I don't know about you - I have not eaten enough chocolate...

550
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,880
- Oh, no. 
- ..this weekend, OK?

551
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,280
Today, Paul and Mary would like you all to create

552
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,000
a stunning and delicious chocolate centrepiece.

553
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Now, this centrepiece has got to be three-dimensional.

554
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,320
You have to make your own moulds and your own stencils.

555
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,360
It needs to have a biscuit element and use any chocolate you like,

556
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,640
as long as you feature white chocolate.

557
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,680
This is your last bake before three of you hit the finals.

558
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,000
We wish you the very, very, very best of luck.

559
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,960
You've got four hours on your challenge.

560
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,440
- On your marks. 
- Get set. BOTH: Bake.

561
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,240
I'll be honest - not done it to time at home.

562
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,760
That's why I'm nervous.

563
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,440
I'm just here, I'm just going to do another bake.

564
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,320
And I'm just going to concentrate on that.

565
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,560
I think this needs to go brilliantly, otherwise I am in...

566
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,400
a lot of trouble.

567
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,960
My hands are already shaking. I'm feeling really nervous.

568
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,040
Really nervous.

569
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,520
This is their last chance to get into the final next week.

570
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,320
What we're looking for is detail, precision,

571
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,040
exquisite artistry, using chocolate.

572
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,080
There's no doubt about it that chocolate is tricky to work with.

573
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,120
But there's no excuse - we still want a very spectacular

574
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,480
centrepiece at the end of it, so they're going to have to work at it.

575
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,480
- Good morning. 
- Morning.

576
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,720
Tamal, tell me what you've chosen as your chocolate centrepiece.

577
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,640
So, I'm making a bell tower.

578
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,160
So there are three tiers to it

579
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,160
and I'm making two different types of biscuit.

580
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,720
The sides are made of a vanilla shortbread,

581
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,000
coated in chocolate with piped chocolate on it as well,

582
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,560
and then the other four sides are made out of

583
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,400
just pure tempered chocolate panels

584
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,240
with some piping on those as well.

585
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,680
Tamal will top his tower with chocolate pillars and a bell.

586
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,720
They'll sit on a star anise biscuit

587
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,920
and he'll use white chocolate to adorn the walls.

588
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,360
I know what I think's going to be the trouble with it.

589
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,480
Which is going to be the tricky bit that we'll have to watch out for?

590
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,560
It's all been tricky getting it done in the time,

591
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,640
cos there's quite a lot.

592
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,960
I want to get the biscuits done as quickly as possible,

593
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,880
then get on to doing all the chocolate work.

594
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,280
- Good luck, mate. 
- Thank you.

595
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,960
Like Tamal, Flora has decided that biscuit will play a key role

596
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,840
in her centrepiece.

597
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,400
- Morning, Flora. 
- Morning.

598
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,520
- Morning, Flora. 
- Can you tell us all about your chocolate creation?

599
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,560
I am making the cocoa carousel.

600
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,920
So I've got a hexagonal pecan shortbread,

601
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,920
- chocolate and pecan shortbread, that I'm doing... 
- That sounds good.

602
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,720
..for the centre of the carousel, and then the roof is going to be

603
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,480
a chocolate-and-puffed-rice mixture that I'm going to put

604
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,280
into a cone and that will shape the roof, just cos it's much lighter.

605
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,240
So the base will be a chocolate cake as well.

606
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,320
I think it's a bit of a challenge - you're making a cake and a biscuit.

607
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,600
To complete her centrepiece, Flora will make

608
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,400
white chocolate ganache horses to sit inside the carousel.

609
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,400
You've got a horse mould, so they're all going to go round the outside?

610
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,080
- They'll be stuck into sticks. 
- You bought that? 
- I made it.

611
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,600
- You made that? 
- I made it. I know. 
- How did you make that, Flora?

612
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,840
- A lot of time spent... 
- Is that a dog? 
- Oh, come on! 
- It's not a dog.

613
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,560
- Oh, come on. I mean, look at it. 
- It's not.

614
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,960
- Look at the legs - that's not dog's legs. 
- Look at the head!

615
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,280
It's a "dorse".

616
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,280
She's a clever girl - she's going to make it look like a horse. Come on.

617
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,960
- Good luck, Flora. 
- Thank you.

618
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,560
Oh, I'm nervous!

619
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,520
Nadiya's gone for a different interpretation of the brief -

620
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,400
focusing on a sculptural element,

621
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,880
with the biscuits playing a supporting role.

622
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,320
- This looks fascinating. 
- Yeah, what's going on?

623
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,680
Tell us all about your chocolate creation.

624
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,280
So, I am making a chocolate peacock with marshmallow, like,

625
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,120
puffed rice crispy biscuit base.

626
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,040
The peacock will be sitting on a log

627
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,040
and so I'm going to temper some chocolate and make,

628
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,560
sort of, edible chocolate bits,

629
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,080
and I'm going to make individual tail feathers that will go

630
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,480
all the way up here,

631
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,560
and I'm going to put little cinder eggs inside the nest.

632
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,760
- A bit like honeycomb? 
- Yeah, a little bit. 
- Ah, nice.

633
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,280
Nadiya's peacock will be covered

634
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,720
in a form of edible blue modelling chocolate,

635
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,960
made from melted candy and glucose.

636
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,720
Her cinder biscuits will be covered in white chocolate

637
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,240
and sit in a tempered chocolate nest.

638
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,680
- I'm going to be fascinated to see how it turns out. 
- Yeah.

639
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,120
- Are you going to be able to do this in the time? 
- I do hope so.

640
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,560
- Good morning, Ian. 
- Good morning. 
- Good morning.

641
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,520
Ian, tell me what you've chosen as your chocolate centrepiece.

642
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,240
It's one of the more complicated ones, this one.

643
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,120
We're making a chocolate well today.

644
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,640
It's going to be cast in here out of chocolate.

645
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,360
Then this is going to make a handle

646
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,680
on the end of which is going to be a little bucket,

647
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,120
which is going to go down into the well.

648
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,000
What's the water going to be made of?

649
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,040
A mixture of white chocolate, a bit of milk,

650
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,400
bit of cream and a bit of lemon flavour as well.

651
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,640
- It will be melted chocolate at the bottom? 
- A cold chocolate drink.

652
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,440
Ian's well will be surrounded by a circle of shortbread biscuits.

653
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,280
- Have you made this before, Ian? 
- I have, yes. 
- Did it go well?

654
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,000
The first attempt took me four days,

655
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,400
but that included making all the moulds.

656
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,440
- Will it work when you turn the handle? 
- It should do.

657
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,800
Good luck, mate.

658
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,040
God, they're really burnt.

659
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,240
I worried about it being underdone and being too weak,

660
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,480
but I've overcompensated a bit.

661
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,680
It is a pecan and chocolate shortbread.

662
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,360
It's going to be the sort of support for the roof,

663
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,840
so it's pretty fragile,

664
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,720
which is why I'm an idiot, I bet it's going to break.

665
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,840
While Tamal and Flora concentrate on their biscuits,

666
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,040
Nadiya prepares her candy and glucose modelling chocolate.

667
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,400
She'll use a melted version of the same mixture

668
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,640
in blue and green to pipe her tail feathers.

669
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,240
It gets brittle as it cools down,

670
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,760
so it's just trying to work with it quite quickly.

671
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,120
With so many elements to each centrepiece,

672
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,800
speed is of the essence for all the bakers.

673
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,280
I'm making two different biscuits. This is one of them.

674
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,400
It's my shortbread. Obviously I want something that tastes nice.

675
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,680
This is the base of the carousel, it's just quite a tall cake.

676
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,760
I've done two full assemblies and they've been OK.

677
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,640
You know, it could always change, that's the worrying thing.

678
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,640
With the bakers all interpreting the brief in different ways,

679
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,120
the one unifying factor is chocolate.

680
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,200
To create a shiny and glossy finish,

681
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,920
the bakers will have to temper their chocolate.

682
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,280
This is how I temper my chocolate.

683
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,720
I melt it over a bain-marie,

684
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,400
get it to a temperature where everything is melted,

685
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,280
then you put in ready-made tempered blocks of chocolate in

686
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,440
and keep stirring it until you get it down to the temperature

687
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,800
that you can work with it.

688
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,960
The right temperature is between 30 and 32 degrees,

689
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,680
depending on whether it's dark or milk chocolate.

690
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,840
The slightest error in temperature control and the chocolate will

691
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,320
not be shiny and could end up with a grainy texture.

692
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,320
Yes, it's still rising too quickly. I'll let them sit for a wee minute.

693
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,680
It's such a narrow margin for things to go well.

694
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,960
It feels a little bit daunting at times.

695
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,480
I've brought my own thermometer from home,

696
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,120
so I've got two of them, just to double check.

697
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,280
I won't really know for sure until it's set

698
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,920
whether it was tempered properly.

699
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,080
Ian, there's chocolate in the microwave, chocolate on the hob,

700
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,600
chocolate in the proving drawer, I am surrounded.

701
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,200
There's chocolate everywhere. So now it's the big pour.

702
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,000
- That looks beautifully shiny. 
- Yes, it looks good at the moment.

703
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Yeah, I'm a little bit worried. I need about 60.

704
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,400
Each tail feather is made of

705
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,080
two different colours of modelling chocolate and topped with a dragee.

706
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,280
They'll be set on a layer of tempered dark chocolate.

707
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,200
Does the semifinal feel different to all the other...?

708
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,760
Well, nobody is really talking to each other,

709
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,840
there's lots of occasional glances,

710
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,480
like, "Oh, no, they're doing that!" and things.

711
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,000
Which is unsettling me somewhat.

712
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,320
I keep changing nozzles

713
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,280
because the chocolate's setting and blocking it off.

714
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,120
This doesn't look like a rushed job at all(!)

715
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:10,920
I'm just making the white chocolate truffle mixture for the horses.

716
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,680
I'm just adding a bit of brandy.

717
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,560
I always think booze and white chocolate are good.

718
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,840
I'm running short on time, to be honest.

719
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,320
These are my little eggs.

720
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,800
I've totally forgotten how to do a shortbread.

721
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,800
They've chilled and I'm just coating them now.

722
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,400
They're not bad.

723
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,480
That's the beginnings of the peacock's tail.

724
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,680
I had to pick something where you have to do 500 feathers(!)

725
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,840
Bakers, the next hour of your life is going to be chocca.

726
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,720
- I can do this. 
- One hour.

727
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,320
I'm just trying to rush and it's just not working.

728
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,240
I've just got to take my time. God, chill out!

729
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,680
This is pretty much it in terms of detail

730
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,360
and now I'm going to start the assembly.

731
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,200
I'm a bit cautious of the fact that everything just looks all right.

732
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,080
I think maybe, for a semifinal,

733
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,640
things should be looking pretty good, should they not?

734
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,400
OK, I need to relax because my hands are shaking and I need to just stop.

735
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,920
I want a nice glassy finish which, to my pleasant surprise,

736
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,360
it appears to be.

737
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,520
This is just tempered chocolate, ice-cold sugar syrup.

738
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:49,320
This looks more like a bit of a nest, a bit twiggy, a bit messy.

739
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,480
I am pretty worried about the time,

740
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,120
I'm about an hour behind where I want to be.

741
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:59,640
Yeah, not great. I just need to push and push and push until the end.

742
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,360
The bakers have 30 minutes to complete their centrepieces.

743
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,320
I do need to get a shift on, definitely.

744
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,760
Oh, come on, that's not funny.

745
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,520
Not even remotely entertaining.

746
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,480
I think that's precarious enough.

747
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,600
Oh, please, don't, not now.

748
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,680
I think this is probably

749
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,680
the messiest piping I've ever done in my life.

750
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,720
Oh, this is the end of me right here.

751
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,640
Perhaps I was a little bit too ambitious on this one.

752
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,920
Anybody got any free hands?

753
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,040
Right, if you can just hold those two there, please.

754
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,920
OK, bakers, the chocolate factory is closed. Down tools, please.

755
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,960
- Tamal, if you'd like to bring yours up now. 
- Thank you.

756
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,600
This is very impressive... as I walked into the tent.

757
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,960
When you're close up, it doesn't look as good as

758
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,960
when you're standing back here, but the whole thing is very effective.

759
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,560
I think the idea was sound enough.

760
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:10,080
If you're going to pipe, make sure the lines are straight.

761
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,080
- The darkness coming around the edge of the biscuit. 
- They were overdone.

762
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,720
But I just think the attention to detail,

763
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,320
some of this work down here, the joining together,

764
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,320
the whole thing, I'm not convinced that it's neat enough.

765
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,000
The tempering of the chocolate is very good.

766
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,640
It's got a lovely shine on it.

767
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,200
A good bake on the shortbread.

768
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,080
It's got a good crumble on it, it melts in the mouth.

769
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,560
The star anise is tasting well, it's beautifully crisp,

770
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,640
it's holding up and it's well baked.

771
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,360
The flavours you've got coming through are excellent,

772
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,240
but at the end of the day, it could have been neater.

773
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,240
Ian, can you manage your well?

774
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,160
Very contemporary. I like what you've done with the well,

775
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,320
to build the well, it's quite solid.

776
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,480
I think you get full marks for originality.

777
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,160
I don't think I'll ever see a well like this again.

778
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,040
We asked for something spectacular,

779
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,360
we've certainly got something spectacular.

780
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,640
I think I'm going to go down for some white chocolate.

781
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,880
Oh!

782
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,480
- It's going in. 
- Oh, that is amazing!

783
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,240
The bucket goes...

784
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,800
Oh, come on, everyone can sort the crankshaft.

785
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,680
I think we'll try one of these biscuits in the white chocolate.

786
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,320
I think the biscuits are lovely, crumbly. Lots of flavour.

787
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,720
That is beautiful shortbread.

788
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,960
Shortbread should taste buttery.

789
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,920
It does. It's a first-rate one.

790
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,520
I could go on dipping it in there, but I'm not going to.

791
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,760
The lemon oil,

792
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,640
who's thought of putting lemon oil in chocolate before?

793
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,400
But I wanted to see more piping,

794
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,160
a little bit of fretwork around the outside.

795
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:29,720
We needed to see more skills of your chocolate work.

796
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,320
- Yeah, hm. 
- You know, don't you?

797
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,280
As ever, timing was an issue for me.

798
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,040
Where all your time is spent up was tempering the chocolate

799
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,800
and pouring it into the mould and waiting for these things to set.

800
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,920
- Yeah. 
- Your flavours are good, and that's what we're after as well.

801
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,800
- Good, thank you. 
- Your flavours are good.

802
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,280
My question is, is there enough work in there?

803
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,160
Flora, do you need a hand with your carousel?

804
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,040
No, it's all right, thank you.

805
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,000
I like it. I do like it. I just think it's a bit...

806
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,360
wonky.

807
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,880
All your chocolate has a sort of bloom on it.

808
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,640
We haven't got a nice, glossy shine. It's a very flat finish.

809
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,240
Shall we try lifting that?

810
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,960
- Does that come off? 
- Yeah. It'll cut through.

811
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,480
Very good.

812
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,800
Very good! Let's have a look at this.

813
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,240
- (They're great, aren't they?) 
- How much cocoa did you put in there?

814
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,800
Four teaspoons of cocoa and 200g of dark chocolate.

815
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,000
I mean, I can taste the cocoa,

816
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,560
but I can also taste a bit of rising agent as well.

817
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:02,200
Ahem-hem, we can taste the raising agent a little bit too much.

818
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,000
- Underneath this roof, you have puff rice. 
- Yeah.

819
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,120
The fairground is closed for the day.

820
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,440
- Oh, no! 
- Wow. 
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

821
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,040
Sorry. SNIGGERING

822
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,720
- It's a bit crumbly! 
- Yeah! 
- It's all right, we've caught it and eaten it.

823
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,240
Normally when you do something like this, it binds together.

824
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,000
- That ain't binding together, that's just... 
- No.

825
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,640
It was more for the shape.

826
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,160
Right.

827
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:33,040
- Erm, it's crumbly, it's quite bitter... 
- It is.

828
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,080
..but on the other hand, it's very impressive when we look at it.

829
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,320
It looks very exciting, it looks fun,

830
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,120
but it doesn't taste as good as it looks.

831
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,640
Sorry.

832
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,600
- Nadiya, do you want a hand with your peacock? 
- I should be OK.

833
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,080
The overall effect is really very beautiful.

834
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,320
It has a lovely, flowing, feathered tail.

835
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:17,160
It shows a lot of skill and I think you've done it very well.

836
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:22,160
I think it's, erm, it's a great piece of art.

837
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,160
It looks in proportion and neat.

838
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,720
There's not one piece you haven't thought of and made it look good.

839
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,160
The nest is very clever. The detail on this thing is very good as well.

840
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,640
I want to see if it tastes as good as it looks.

841
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,400
It's still got it's crunch. It's good.

842
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,680
It's effective and it tastes good, too.

843
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,760
And what about the biscuit element?

844
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,200
It's fun. It tastes good, it's sweet, it's firm, it's holding together.

845
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,120
I think the whole thing is very effective.

846
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,240
It looks good and it tastes good. Thank you, Nadiya.

847
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,720
Thank you.

848
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,640
So, the semifinalists have completed their three challenges.

849
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,560
There's an awful lot riding on this for them. What do you think?

850
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,560
When you look at Tamal, for instance,

851
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,440
one of his biscuits was slightly burnt.

852
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,440
The others were fine, the shortbread was fine.

853
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,520
Tempering the chocolate was exceptional.

854
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,400
- It was just a little bit messy. 
- Yeah.

855
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,280
But I think he's in a very safe area.

856
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,400
I think Tamal's done really well. I think Nadiya's done really well.

857
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,840
Although she was last in the Technical, she dominated

858
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,000
in the Signature, I felt, and she dominated again on the Showstopper.

859
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,720
I thought the design was good, very clever, very artistic,

860
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,680
and the textures and flavours, in each one of the criteria,

861
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,880
the biscuits and white chocolate was very good.

862
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:51,040
Ian had a lot to do today to, kind of, claw back some of what he needed.

863
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,080
He did something very, very spectacular. It worked.

864
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,760
Ian was very neat...

865
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,720
but was there enough work in it? Four hours' work?

866
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,640
I think there was a lot of templates involved, a lot of moulds involved.

867
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,400
He took a lot of the chocolate up to temperature, poured it in,

868
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,760
left it to set.

869
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,480
He could have shown us a little bit more skill and a bit more

870
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,440
variation with the white chocolate,

871
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,520
but what he did, he did very, very well.

872
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:22,400
Now, you see, Flora, she worked very hard on all the parts of it, but

873
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,360
when you break it down and you taste it, it is a huge disappointment.

874
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,320
The only thing that tasted all right was the horse.

875
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,280
I think we're looking at Ian and Flora

876
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,360
- for leaving the Bake Off at this stage. 
- Hm.

877
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,880
It's tricky.

878
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,920
Bakers, I've got the good job.

879
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:56,680
I'm going to announce who this semifinal Star Baker is.

880
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,480
It's a majestic Star Baker who has

881
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:03,640
dominated in two of the challenges particularly,

882
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,800
using a common theme of the pea -

883
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,320
peanut, and then we had a peacock.

884
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:14,320
Nadiya, you're the semifinal Star Baker. Well done. Well done.

885
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,160
APPLAUSE

886
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,160
SHE SIGHS

887
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,720
I have the more onerous task this week.

888
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,960
It's always very, very difficult to do this on semifinal week.

889
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,160
As Mel said, you've all worked incredibly hard

890
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:33,840
and this was an extremely close call.

891
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,640
It's with real sadness and regret I have to announce that the person

892
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,440
not joining us for the final...

893
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,040
..is Flora.

894
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,880
I'm so sorry, darling.

895
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,200
Come and do hugs. Deep hugs.

896
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,120
I am gutted, of course I am, but in the same respect,

897
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,880
I feel so, so honoured.

898
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,560
I feel very privileged to have got this far,

899
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:02,520
so... What a fantastic nine weeks.

900
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,040
Amazing.

901
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:09,600
'Flora's time has come because she always wants the extra twirl'

902
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:14,760
on the top, but she really needed to concentrate on her flavours.

903
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,880
To get through to the semifinal, it's a big thing,

904
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,880
and I think she's done as much as she can.

905
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,400
Nadiya deserves to be in the final and she deserves to be Star Baker.

906
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,400
She's really picked two bakes that are quite tricky to do,

907
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,240
and got it spot-on at the right time.

908
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,640
I made it to the finals.

909
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,680
CHEERING ON PHONE

910
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,080
PHONE: They just heard you!

911
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,840
- That's the kids! 
- Oh, my God. Well done, Nadiya.

912
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,840
Sorry. It should have been me.

913
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,520
- Don't weep, you big soft...!

914
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,360
CHATTER

915
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,480
I feel like I've got through on the skin of my teeth today.

916
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,000
I really thought that was it, I'm, erm... You know, I'm going home.

917
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,360
I can't really believe it. I'm an actual finalist.

918
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,760
I kind of want to start working now!

919
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,920
