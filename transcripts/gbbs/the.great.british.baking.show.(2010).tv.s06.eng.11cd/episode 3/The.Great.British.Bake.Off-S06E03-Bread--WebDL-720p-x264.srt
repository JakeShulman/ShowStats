1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,840
- Melly, I'm absolutely shattered 
- I'm absolutely pooped, Susie.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,080
Do you think we could go and get some tea in the tent?

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,000
Absolutely, I'm hoping for oodles of scones and pastries.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,240
Absolutely.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,280
And I'm hoping for lashings of harsh judgment from Paul and Mary.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,040
Will there be a life-size statue of the Taj Mahal

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,600
made out of cheese straws?

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,280
BOTH: Absolutely.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,960
Welcome to the Great British Bake Off.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,200
Last time...

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
I wish I'd made it a lot more simple now.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,880
- Fireman Mat... 
- HE BLOWS

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,960
..and care worker Sandy's biscuits...

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,280
I do all the loving.

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,000
..were no match for stay-at-home Dad Ian's...

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,760
That is a fantastic biscotti.

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,440
..as he became this year's second Star Baker.

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,800
That was a good result.

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,720
And despite prison governor Paul...

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,760
It's starting to look a bit like a snail.

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,160
..and project accountant Dorret struggling...

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,720
I'm not getting much flavour there.

23
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,040
- ..problems with biscotti... 
- (Oh, don't.)

24
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,760
..and disaster with arlettes...

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,760
- They're not cooked at all. 
- ..meant that the first Star Baker,

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,920
Marie, had to leave the tent.

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,280
I'm a silly-silly.

28
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,640
Now, it's bread week.

29
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,080
It's got dough everywhere. Dough-verload.

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,160
Who'll meet Paul's high standards

31
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,720
with their quick bread?

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,840
Put me out of my misery.

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,720
Can anyone technically master a French classic?

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,960
I know what one looks like.

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,880
Question is, can I make one?

36
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,720
And who makes a Showstopper so monumental...

37
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,840
- No pressure. 
- None at all.

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,160
..it's worthy of a Bake Off first?

39
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,560
And we'll start with something we've actually never done before.

40
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,960
It makes me feel uneasy.

41
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,320
All right, it's television.

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Oh, I don't know what that is.

43
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Massaging a guinea pig?

44
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,200
Very bad '80s manoeuvres?

45
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,800
Bingo wings?

46
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,200
My waistline?

47
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,400
Look, I don't have time for this. It's bread week.

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,480
Morning, bakers.

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,080
Very exciting this morning,

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,760
we've got a new category of bread

51
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,760
never before seen on Bake Off.

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,240
Quick breads.

53
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,880
Quick breads, of course, are just very speedy breads

54
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,920
made without yeast.

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,040
Paul and Mary would like you to make two of these,

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,200
any flavour you like but they have to be free form,

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,160
ie not in a tin.

58
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,320
So, you've got one and a half hours,

59
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,920
very good luck. On your marks...

60
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,800
- Get set... 
- BOTH: Bake!

61
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,240
I am shaky as anything.

62
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,120
It turned out well at home.

63
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,800
Just has to turn out really well now.

64
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,640
A quick bread is a bread risen without yeast

65
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,040
so the only thing they're going to be able to use to rise

66
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,640
is bicarb or baking powder.

67
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,960
You throw your bicarb in, which is your alkaline,

68
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,000
and then you throw your buttermilk in, which is essentially acid.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,240
The reaction between the two creates a gas and grows your bread.

70
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,120
If they use too much bicarb or baking powder,

71
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,520
it's very bitter,

72
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,960
and the moment you eat into it, you know it.

73
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,480
- Hello, Flora. 
- Morning.

74
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,040
Right, what are you up to?

75
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,200
I am making fig and hazelnut soda bread today.

76
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,840
Flora's using a blend of plain, wholemeal

77
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,560
and rye flours in her quick breads.

78
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,600
I quite like rye flour with figs.

79
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Rye flour often gives a very close texture.

80
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,160
So, how much liquid to flour?

81
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,520
I use 600 mls of buttermilk.

82
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,320
- How much flour in total? 
- 670 grams.

83
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,040
So, it's almost 100% liquid then?

84
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,560
Yeah, pretty much.

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,320
Interesting, this should be good.

86
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,520
It doesn't look promising, does it?

87
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,440
- Good morning. 
- Good morning.

88
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,280
Mat, tell us about your loaves.

89
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,960
OK, so I'm doing a smoked salt

90
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,520
and Mexican Cheddar soda bread.

91
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,440
Oh, "Andale, Andale."

92
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,680
As the Mexican carpet-fitter once said.

93
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,000
Mat's also adding jalapeno peppers to increase the heat.

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,120
And what shape are you doing these two?

95
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,000
Just round with a traditional...

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,160
- Cut or slash? 
- Slice.

97
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,880
- OK. Good luck, mate. 
- Thank you.

98
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,920
- What difference does it...? 
- I'm not going to tell him.

99
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,960
Mat's not the only baker hoping to add

100
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,560
a touch of Mexican heat to their quick bread.

101
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,840
So, I'm making a Mexican-style bread with cumin, coriander...

102
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,560
Quite similar to the kind of flavours

103
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,080
that I would use at home when I'm making a curry.

104
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,800
Nadiya's Mexican quick bread

105
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,240
will also be served

106
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,400
with a warm tomato salsa.

107
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,040
Now, old Mat is also doing a, sort of, Mexican thing...

108
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,160
He copied me. Look into my eyes.

109
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,080
- He knew... 
- There's a bit of a Mexican face-off.

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,880
Have you got a lot of the same ingredients?

111
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,800
Pretty much the same ingredients.

112
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,400
- Yeah, but he's totally copying me. 
- Yeah.

113
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,840
- Good morning, Dorret. 
- Morning.

114
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,400
Tell us all about your quick bread.

115
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,240
OK, I've chosen Waldorf-inspired flavours.

116
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,800
Dorret's bready version of the classic Waldorf salad

117
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,840
will include walnuts, sultanas and blue cheese.

118
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,320
Just making sure that the cheese is evenly dispersed.

119
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,960
- And that gives you the texture that you're looking for. 
- Yeah.

120
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,400
I love Stilton in a loaf.

121
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,640
Yes, me too. That slightly melty, delicious tang.

122
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,840
A lot of butter on it.

123
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,040
And then a trip to the coronary heart.

124
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,280
- Thank you. 
- Thank you.

125
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,880
Tamal is also using cheese -

126
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,920
but he's less concerned about its dispersal.

127
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,640
I want there to be big chunks of cheese.

128
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,280
It's really nice, like goat's cheese,

129
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,760
so when I been practising at home, I've just been like...

130
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,880
the whole time, yeah.

131
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,240
Buying a little bit extra...for "research."

132
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,320
Tamal is using figs, ground oats and walnuts

133
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,840
to complement his goat's cheese.

134
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,640
The final bread is quite a nice, sort of, rustic, hearty loaf.

135
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,440
The sort of thing you'd want with soup.

136
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,400
Good morning, Alvin. Can you tell us about your quick breads, please?

137
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,440
It's going to be packed full of flavours

138
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,160
from prosciutto, Manchego cheese, basil and some balsamic onion.

139
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Alvin's using Spanish cheese, Italian prosciutto

140
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,040
and basil to create loaves with a European flavour.

141
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,840
Quite a strong flavour, Manchego.

142
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,000
So, I make sure I mix it and distribute it into the flour...

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,800
- Right... 
- Equal pieces, hopefully.

144
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,520
What shape are they when in the oven?

145
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,200
They're going to be circular.

146
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,240
Good luck.

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,960
Achieving the correct crumbly texture in a soda bread

148
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,840
depends on getting the ratio of bicarb to buttermilk spot on.

149
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,800
If there's not enough liquid, the loaf will be too dense.

150
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,960
Too much and it won't hold its shape.

151
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,720
How much flour are you using in this?

152
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,080
- 800 grams of flour. 
- 800 grams. How much liquid?

153
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,760
300 to 350 of buttermilk.

154
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,040
Not a lot of liquid.

155
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,400
- So, it's quite a tight structure inside? 
- Yeah.

156
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,640
It is.

157
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,480
Paul's close-textured quick bread is a break with tradition

158
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,960
as it's sweetened with orange and cranberry.

159
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,720
Why did you choose sweet?

160
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,680
I just like the texture, like the taste, like the flavours.

161
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,480
So, how long are you baking this for?

162
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,160
This is for 50 to 55 minutes.

163
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,160
OK, that's quite a long time.

164
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,200
Good luck, mate.

165
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,720
Thank you.

166
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,320
One baker is going even sweeter.

167
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,440
I am making chocolate quick bread

168
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,320
with salted caramel sauce.

169
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,160
I'm loving chocolate all the way,

170
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,800
so it's a little bit untraditional, I would say.

171
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,280
Ugne will top her quick bread with caramelised pecans

172
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,360
and she's doing everything she can to ensure it will rise.

173
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,480
I'm using both baking powder and bicarbonate of soda.

174
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,360
It tends to work when I use both.

175
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,000
It looks a lot more neater when I have done it at home.

176
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,560
It's such a mess.

177
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,720
Quick bread shouldn't be kneaded.

178
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,280
The more the dough is worked, the closer the texture becomes...

179
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,600
I just don't want it to fall apart, really.

180
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,280
..and overworked dough makes for a tough, chewy loaf.

181
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,320
I'm using Tipo 00, a very fine flour,

182
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,600
to try and make it a nice light soda bread.

183
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,840
Does that work?

184
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
It does, yeah.

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,520
Once again, Ian's brought a little bit of Cambridgeshire to the tent

186
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,560
and added it to the dough for his pesto soda bread.

187
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,320
Did you pick your wild garlic?

188
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,960
I did, yes. Yeah, went out to the woods a couple of days ago.

189
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,920
Very relieved to see it was still there.

190
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,120
There's only a certain time of year that you can find it and use it.

191
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,360
Do you find that it goes quite a dark colour when you bake it?

192
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,600
It's got a lot of green in there, but it's...

193
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,680
- So, it's quite Martian in its... 
- Yes, exactly.

194
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,960
- Its look. 
- Yeah.

195
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,680
The bakers are at the halfway point

196
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,440
and their next move could make or break their soda bread.

197
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,440
What I'm doing now is just crossing the soda bread.

198
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,960
Cutting straight through.

199
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,200
The idea is to try and help get the heat into the middle...

200
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,240
..otherwise it can quite easily end up being quite doughy inside.

201
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,000
I've been told already by Paul that I'm cutting it in the wrong way.

202
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,800
It does need to go a fair way down, much more than a normal bread.

203
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,720
A lot of people slice the edges, with a sort of...

204
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,640
How bad's that cutting?

205
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,360
Bad.

206
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,840
It's going to look great.

207
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,800
Don't you find, the further you get in, the more competitive you get?

208
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,320
- Maybe so. 
- You just have to.

209
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,160
It's the nature of the beast, isn't it?

210
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah, except I did run the 800 metres once at school

211
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,680
but waited for the last lap and waited for a friend.

212
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,520
- Oh, San... Oh, Sandy 
- So, that's how competitive I'm not.

213
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,280
- No, Sandy, no. 
- I've got to change that thinking, haven't I?

214
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,360
Wait for nobody in this tent.

215
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,520
It's about you.

216
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,720
Sandy's aiming to get the better of everyone

217
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,520
with a bacon-and-onion soda bread

218
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,240
that's straight from the family recipe book.

219
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,120
It's part of my Irish ancestry.

220
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,200
I go to Ireland a lot and I make it on a range in Ireland.

221
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,760
In we go.

222
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm hoping that they rise the way they're supposed to.

223
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,160
With a quick bread, there's no proving.

224
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,960
The dough will only rise when it's in the oven.

225
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,320
They have a mind of their own

226
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,680
and they just, kind of,

227
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,160
puff up wherever they feel like puffing up.

228
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,200
There's an element of faith here.

229
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,480
He said to me, "How long for?"

230
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,320
I says, "55 minutes," I said "180." "That long?"

231
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,720
THEY LAUGH

232
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,480
They're looking like monsters.

233
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,120
They've grown.

234
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,680
Ten minutes early.

235
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,640
Happy.

236
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,240
Properly done? Done?

237
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,280
- SHE GASPS 
- So...

238
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,040
I love the way you divvy it up into four,

239
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,280
- so you can just break it. 
- That locks the devil out.

240
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,760
- Oh, does it? 
- Yeah.

241
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,560
- So, there's no devil in that bread? 
- There's no devil in there.

242
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,720
Good. Good to know.

243
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,920
Yeah, I think that's going to be all right.

244
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,560
Just a couple of minutes more

245
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,360
and then it's going to come out.

246
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,520
Bakers, panic, you've got one minute left.

247
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,280
Yeah, holding my nerve at the moment, it's all right.

248
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,680
I hope they're done in the middle.

249
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,960
I just hope that they're cooked.

250
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,600
Is that hollow?

251
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,720
So...da quick bread-making challenge is over.

252
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,120
Bring your breads to the end of the...

253
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,400
You've done it. Drama. Exciting.

254
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,560
They look so tempting,

255
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,440
I can hardly keep my hands off them.

256
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,240
- I'm sure you put slashes across it. 
- I have, but they disappeared.

257
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,120
But of course, with all those exciting toppings, they've all...

258
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,920
- Disappeared. 
- ..gone together.

259
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,200
Manchego's... It's such a pungent cheese.

260
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,320
But the fact that you got all those layers in there

261
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,200
with the balsamic onion as well -

262
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,640
it's a thing of beauty, my friend.

263
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,080
I told you it looked terribly tempting

264
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,920
and I couldn't wait to get into it, well, now I'm into it, I want more.

265
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:03,200
How nice and bright, and green. The wild garlic has stayed.

266
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,440
MEL: Wow.

267
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,880
It's a nice light texture.

268
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,200
- Mm-hmm. 
- The garlic comes through.

269
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,480
MEL: It's delish.

270
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,520
The intensity of the flavours is about right.

271
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,680
The bake is beautifully done too.

272
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,000
- Nice little work of magic there. 
- Cool.

273
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,000
They look, sort of, homely.

274
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,360
The overall texture of it is quite tight

275
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,800
and that's because of the cheese.

276
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,160
Could have done with, probably,

277
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,000
LUMPS of Stilton in there.

278
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,400
- I am getting the flavour... 
- Yep.

279
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,040
..but I think it could be more intense.

280
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,960
Looks more like a conventionally-yeasted bread

281
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,480
than it does a soda bread.

282
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,600
It's split there because it's trying to find a place to grow.

283
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,520
I like the nice, original shape.

284
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,320
A little bit of heat in there.

285
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,440
The coriander comes through.

286
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,440
I think you've done well with the flavour and the shape and the bake.

287
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,600
Which, to be honest, I was really concerned about -

288
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,520
but, actually, you've got away with it.

289
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,800
- You did do a cut through the... 
- I did.

290
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,680
- We've lost that a bit. 
- Yeah.

291
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,120
Let's have a look inside.

292
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,200
Lovely crust.

293
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,920
One of my concerns is,

294
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,360
it's just more, you see,

295
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,720
bread-like than soda bread-like.

296
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,960
It doesn't crumble at all, it holds together.

297
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,480
I think you've just worked that dough a little bit too much.

298
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,000
- Yeah, sure. 
- Is it overworked?

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,920
- It's overworked. 
- Overworked.

300
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,400
I like to be able to see the filling pouring out.

301
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,560
I like that.

302
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,200
The figs come through strongly.

303
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,320
Put me out of my misery.

304
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,720
It's baked OK.

305
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,440
The blend between the goat's cheese and the nuts as well, particularly,

306
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,040
- is gorgeous. 
- Thank you, thank you.

307
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,960
- It looks as though it was quite a wet dough... 
- Yes.

308
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,080
..and, of course, it will change the texture

309
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,840
because you've added extra fat from the bacon.

310
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
I like the flavour very much.

311
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,040
But it just crumbles when you touch it. I like it.

312
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,040
- Thank you. 
- SUE: It's delish.

313
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,960
The hazelnuts work exceptionally well in -

314
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,640
but the one that really works is the blend of flours together.

315
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,360
I think you've got that bang on.

316
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,440
Excellent.

317
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,280
I can smell a lot of baking powder.

318
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,280
Here we go.

319
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,560
- It's baked beautifully and it tastes fantastic. 
- Oh, yes.

320
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,480
One of the things is, it's not overly sweet either.

321
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,720
It's about right.

322
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,360
I was expecting it to be bitter

323
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,080
having both those raising agents.

324
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,720
- You've obviously done it lightly - it works and it's right. 
- Yes.

325
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,680
I can smell the orange, it's coming up and hitting me,

326
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,440
which I like in a bread.

327
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,320
- Well, that's excellent. 
- Thank you.

328
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,360
The orange comes through, the texture's good,

329
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,880
the bake's pretty much perfect,

330
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,560
for a sweet soda bread...

331
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,120
- Yeah, I'll have another piece of that. 
- Thank you very much.

332
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,480
- Oh, the handshake. 
- Nice one, Paul. Thank you. 
- Well done.

333
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,760
Bread week is Paul's week - the king of the baking.

334
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,280
For him to give you a handshake at the end for your...

335
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,360
quick bread... I know it sounds a bit soppy but that was good.

336
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,880
That was a really good feeling.

337
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,800
I'm feeling dangerously happy.

338
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,760
What Paul said about my soda bread

339
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,320
is going to stay for the rest of my natural life.

340
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,400
Well, I think I'm struggling to please the judges.

341
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Overworked, apparently.

342
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,960
So...

343
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,240
yeah, not a clean sweep.

344
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
For bread week's technical challenge,

345
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,160
Paul has asked for a classic

346
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,080
never seen before on the Bake Off.

347
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,400
Bakers, for today's technical, we're all going to France.

348
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,200
Not literally, we don't have the budget.

349
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,080
Paul and Mary - they're off to a Morris dancing class.

350
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,560
Paul, before you do, any words of wisdom for the bakers?

351
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,840
Good luck.

352
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,000
That really wasn't a word of wisdom.

353
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,160
That was just saying, "I hope it all goes well."

354
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,400
Au revoir, a bientot.

355
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
FRENCH ACCENT: See you later, my darlings.

356
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,040
Today's challenge - four identical crusty baguettes.

357
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,240
If you don't know what a baguette is, it's over, you should leave now.

358
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,960
You've got two-and-a-half hours.

359
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,240
- On your marks... 
- Get set... 
- BOTH: Bake!

360
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,360
I have made baguettes before...

361
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,400
I know what one looks like, I know what one tastes like.

362
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,520
The question is, can I make one?

363
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,600
I've tried them, they're not easy to make.

364
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,360
How hard can it be?

365
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,000
A baguette is all about having that crisp on the outside.

366
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,960
- This one here has got a nice... 
- HOLLOW TAPPING

367
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,320
- A good crust. 
- You get that by using steam in the oven.

368
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,120
See, the structure's very irregular, it's not like a tin bread,

369
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,560
it's not tight little air holes.

370
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,240
It's open, it's chewy, it's crispy.

371
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,800
Mmm.

372
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,280
- Have you suggested that they create steam in the oven? 
- No.

373
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,280
I expect them to know how to get a great crust on bread.

374
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,520
One of the other things I'll be looking for is

375
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,800
whether it's proved enough.

376
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,840
Take it too early and pop it in the oven, it'll split down the side.

377
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,040
I really think you have been...

378
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,480
THEY LAUGH

379
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,600
..particularly nasty on this one.

380
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,840
Mary, we're looking for the best amateur bakers in the country.

381
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,880
And I think this is a really tough challenge.

382
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,920
The recipe is, kind of, basic.

383
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,440
"Add three quarters of the water to the flour, salt and yeast."

384
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,720
That's it.

385
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,400
The bakers may not realise that a baguette dough

386
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,280
needs a high water content

387
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,520
in order to produce the open texture the judges require.

388
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,200
It's very sticky dough.

389
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,920
It's very hard to work with.

390
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,000
It's getting there, you can see it.

391
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,520
Potentially haven't put enough water in.

392
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,360
See, other peoples look more wet than mine.

393
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,400
It says 370 ml.

394
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,040
I think I put about 300 in, but is it the wrong thing to do to add it now?

395
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,080
Probably.

396
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,120
It doesn't say how long to knead it for

397
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,560
or how long to prove it for,

398
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,680
that's the fun bit.

399
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,080
- "Oil a plastic container." 
- "Oil a plastic container."

400
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,880
This is definitely a plastic container.

401
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,320
That bit, I'm going to get right.

402
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,080
"Cover and prove." It doesn't give you

403
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,720
- any timings or anything, does it? 
- No.

404
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,320
The first prove is critical,

405
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,280
as it's when the baguette's airy texture is created.

406
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,200
This is what I do at home.

407
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,680
I just noticed that, "Oil a plastic container."

408
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,760
I didn't realise what it's for.

409
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,760
I don't want to take it out because it's already in there.

410
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,840
So, I don't know how that would be any different from that.

411
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,440
I'm taking it out. Silly mistake, never mind.

412
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,960
- Hmmm. 
- I'm not sure where to prove it.

413
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,680
In the oven, on the proving setting -

414
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,560
or if I should leave it at room temperature.

415
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,120
I'm putting my faith in the oven proving setting.

416
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,040
Proving drawer, not in the oven, cos the oven's too hot.

417
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,440
In the oven.

418
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,920
I'm sticking to what I do at home,

419
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,440
I never put my bread into proving drawers or ovens.

420
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,880
It just says prove it, doesn't say how long.

421
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,760
It'll probably be about an hour.

422
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,200
Not confident in this at all.

423
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,360
Not rising.

424
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,160
I haven't put enough liquid in.

425
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,840
One hour and 15 minutes remaining.

426
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,920
I'm not going to leave it for an hour.

427
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,240
Got a little bit of rise.

428
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,320
- Massive. 
- I'm happy with that.

429
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,360
"Divide and shape the dough into four equal baguettes." So...

430
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,360
800 divided by four.

431
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,200
The shaping's really important. If you don't do it properly,

432
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,240
you just get bread that just slops out as it rises.

433
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,080
- I want to keep the air bubbles. 
- OK.

434
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,120
I want a good crumb which has got good...

435
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,400
Yeah, crisp.

436
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,880
Or am I thinking about ciabatta? I don't know.

437
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,960
Don't think about ciabatta, Alvin. This is baguettes, not ciabatta.

438
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,400
What's with the pinching?

439
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,720
I am pinching my bottom seam...

440
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,440
- Right. 
- ..so, when you've got it on top, you should have no seams.

441
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,160
I wonder if I could roll it.

442
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,920
This is a lot trickier than I thought it would be.

443
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,960
Place it into the coachy or whatever it's called.

444
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,480
"Couche" - which is a bed, innit? So it's just a linen bed.

445
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,800
SHE CHUCKLES

446
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,280
I think.

447
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,080
The 100% linen couche is a traditional French cloth

448
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,920
that helps the baguette's shape stay intact during the second prove.

449
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,480
- FRENCH ACCENT: 
- You go to sleep, my babies, for a few minutes.

450
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,800
Well done, Sandy.

451
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,880
Come on.

452
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,320
40 minutes remaining.

453
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,640
You know, it's worked so hard to rise,

454
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,080
I don't want to upset it.

455
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,200
Oh, don't fall off.

456
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,920
My heart is just going boom, boom, boom, boom.

457
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,960
"Flash each baguette."

458
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,400
Do you have to score it...

459
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,920
for it to look like a baguette?

460
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,800
That's the tricky bit.

461
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,400
Have to be careful with this one.

462
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,560
Slash the bread and the whole thing will just collapse.

463
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,040
I'm just basing it on, kind of,

464
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,920
a traditional baguette in the diagonal slashes.

465
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,080
Trying to think, in my head, of a baguette.

466
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,600
A baguette doesn't have that,

467
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,760
a baguette has that.

468
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,480
Right or wrong, soon find out.

469
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,000
There's no mention of steam in Paul's instructions

470
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and only some of the bakers have spotted this.

471
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
The water's just to give it a nice bit of steam in there,

472
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,160
which gives it a nice, good crust to it.

473
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,560
Professional bread ovens have steam injectors.

474
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,160
So, this is, like, how you can replicate it at home, apparently.

475
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,800
It's really good for your complexion.

476
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,560
Not all of the bakers have realised the secret

477
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,680
to Paul's perfectly crisp baguette.

478
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,480
Mais oui.

479
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,800
Right, I think I'll start with 15 minutes

480
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,440
and take it from there, really.

481
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,040
"Bake until golden brown." That's all it says.

482
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,760
Bear in mind what my wife says.

483
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,360
"Always leave it in for an extra 10 minutes."

484
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,080
I think baguettes are slightly under golden than over golden.

485
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,320
Can't do anything now, it's all in there, so have to wait.

486
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,800
I wished I baked a baguette before at home.

487
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,840
They have to be four mini baguettes, don't they?

488
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,160
- I don't know, actually. 
- What does it say?

489
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,680
So, I imagined it then.

490
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,840
You did. I was really happy when you said that.

491
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,360
I'm sure it said mini ones.

492
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,680
Ten minutes, bakers.

493
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,760
I'm using every minute there is.

494
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,120
I'm not rushing.

495
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,160
No, that's all right, bit longer.

496
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,960
Second guessing myself now.

497
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,960
I want to brown them a little bit more than they are.

498
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,240
Might have to stick it in another minute or so.

499
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,400
TIMER BEEPS

500
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,720
Time's up.

501
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Let's look at these babies.

502
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,560
Golden.

503
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,120
I'm going to have a gander.

504
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah, let's go with those.

505
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,840
OK, bakers, just two minute before we release the man gorilla

506
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,160
that is Paul Hollywood.

507
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,760
Two minutes to go, that's OK.

508
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,480
Well, they look a little bit like baguettes.

509
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,640
That line, sort of, shows that it's under-proven.

510
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,240
I've got it on four of them,

511
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,440
so at least that's consistently under-proved.

512
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,120
They look all right, them.

513
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,240
Cutting it a little bit fine here.

514
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,920
Looks like I'm the last person to be taking something out the oven.

515
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,760
OK, bakers, baguette time is up.

516
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,440
HE WHISTLES

517
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,520
Please bring them up to the gingham altar in front of your photo.

518
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,960
What will Paul and Mary make of the Bake Off's first ever baguettes?

519
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,160
What we're looking for are four equal-sized baguettes -

520
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,280
crispy, cut on the top, good colour,

521
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,520
as opposed to ciabattas.

522
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,400
These look pretty good.

523
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,640
I can hear a nice crunch there.

524
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,520
It's crispy, good structure inside.

525
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,320
- Yeah, they're nice, they are. 
- You can't fault that.

526
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,040
Right. See underneath, the line,

527
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,320
normally means it's slightly under-proved,

528
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,960
but they're not bad.

529
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,800
- The flavour's good. 
- Just needed more crisping on the outside.

530
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,960
These look a bit more like ciabattas than they do baguettes.

531
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,080
The cuts are there.

532
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,440
Open structure. You can see.

533
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,880
Overall, they're not bad.

534
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,960
Soft. A million cuts down the middle,

535
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,280
variety of shapes, under-proved...

536
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,360
Flavour's there.

537
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,480
Moving on. Well, at least they're all the same size, Mary.

538
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,000
Split there, it's under-proved, see, both sides.

539
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,840
Soft...

540
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,600
and the colour's pretty bad too.

541
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,440
I think they look really good, the problem is, it's underbaked.

542
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,560
It needed another five, ten minutes in the oven.

543
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,000
You see how soft they are?

544
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,040
It's fine to eat.

545
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,280
Soft again, not long enough in the oven.

546
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,400
Fairly even shape. This side's fine.

547
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,680
Oh, dear.

548
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,840
Four soft...pieces of bread.

549
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,520
Which, actually, haven't been steamed in the oven.

550
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,040
Cuts are terrible.

551
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,880
I'm just feeling very sorry for whoever it is.

552
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,880
Right, this one has had steam.

553
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,920
The cuts are all wrong, the slashes should be on a diagonal.

554
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,200
They're too short.

555
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,680
- And they're not crisp, are they? 
- No.

556
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,960
Tastes OK.

557
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,480
We're back in Italy now making half-baked ciabattas.

558
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,760
Shape's all wrong, it's too fat. It needs to be long for a baguette.

559
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,880
It's got a nice colour underneath, come on.

560
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,160
It's barely baked.

561
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,560
Will anyone come out well from such a brutal judging?

562
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,040
So, in tenth place, whose is this?

563
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,720
It looks half-baked

564
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,960
and it's rather wide and short.

565
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,880
In ninth place is this one.

566
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,560
Nadiya, if you'd put steam in the oven,

567
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,040
it would have helped a little bit.

568
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,400
Mat is eighth, Sandy seventh, Dorret sixth,

569
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,560
Ugne is fifth and Alvin is fourth.

570
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,000
Number three is this one.

571
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,280
Good steam in the oven,

572
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,000
nice and equal baguette -

573
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,560
but you just brought them out far too early.

574
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,920
Who is two, here?

575
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,600
They've got good slashes,

576
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,240
they were a pretty good bake.

577
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
So, number one is this one.

578
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,600
- APPLAUSE 
- Well done, Ian. 
- Well done, Ian.

579
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,760
Don't get too cocky though.

580
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,560
Little bit longer would have been better, if I'm honest -

581
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,080
but they're a nice, equal, crispy, good texture.

582
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,120
Well done.

583
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,400
Might just have a little fizzy pop in the bar this evening.

584
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,200
Not too many though, just the one-off.

585
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,360
Maybe two.

586
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,600
I got second...again.

587
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,680
Paul Hollywood - he was punching bread

588
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,480
and shattering dreams in there.

589
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,000
It was nasty.

590
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,200
I think...I'm potentially in trouble.

591
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,600
That went badly, obviously.

592
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,280
I've done well in the signature,

593
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,960
I've done awful on the technical.

594
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,000
I seem to bring it back in the Showstopper.

595
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,160
It's a bit of a common theme with me at the moment.

596
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,680
Kristy Turlington, Linda Evangelista and Lily Cole...

597
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,760
That's great. When I said sculpt...roll models.

598
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,520
I didn't mean...

599
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,480
roll "models".

600
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,600
Roll models.

601
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,120
A lot of work went into those.

602
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,640
Here's how the Ukrainians do it.

603
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,080
The Ukrainians really love their bread.

604
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,120
So much so, that their flag represents a field of wheat

605
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,360
under a clear blue sky.

606
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,760
And a bread sculpture is the centrepiece

607
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,840
of any traditional wedding.

608
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,200
Ukrainian chef Olya Hercules

609
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,440
is trail-blazing a new wave of eastern European baking in Britain.

610
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,600
- Morning, all. 
- Morning.

611
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,720
Olya, good to see you. What's going on?

612
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,520
We're making a korovai, which is a traditional Ukrainian wedding bread.

613
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,120
So, instead of a cake, we normally make a massive,

614
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,800
lavishly-decorated bread.

615
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,080
And who's getting married?

616
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,320
Xenia's getting married.

617
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,720
Xenia, are you sure?

618
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,080
Yes, I'm very sure, yes.

619
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,440
Sure you want to do it? Go through with it?

620
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,840
- Do you always do this in a group? 
- Yes.

621
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,640
Traditionally, it's done by seven women

622
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,040
coming from seven different places.

623
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,160
It's all about transferring positive energy and vibes

624
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,600
into the bread for the bride and groom.

625
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,640
- Oh, really? Great, symbolically... 
- Yep.

626
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,840
..joining the main bread. Lovely.

627
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,480
So, is this the equivalent, then, of a Ukrainian hen do?

628
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,680
Kind of, yeah, just without the booze.

629
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,160
THEY CHUCKLE

630
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,600
We... Traditionally, women sing songs.

631
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,160
Could you start us off with something?

632
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,640
Not looking that keen over here.

633
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,840
LAUGHTER

634
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,480
SHE SINGS IN UKRAINIAN

635
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,080
And that, ladies, is the Eurovision entry for 2016.

636
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,720
What were you singing about?

637
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,480
About a girl dumping a guy.

638
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,160
Oh, not the best song.

639
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,000
A sweetened-enriched bread flavoured with vanilla,

640
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,360
korovai is decorated with dough figurines.

641
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,080
Pine cones represent fertility,

642
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,680
poppies for serenity

643
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,880
and birds are created in the likeness

644
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,520
of the guests at the wedding.

645
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,800
- Now, Slava, you're Xenia's aunt. 
- I am.

646
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,360
Have you been done already?

647
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,520
I actually haven't been done yet, Mel,

648
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,360
- so you've got an opportunity here to do... 
- I was hoping you say that.

649
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,640
- ..a Slava dove. 
- You've got lovely hair, Slava. 
- Thank you.

650
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,880
The pressure is on to get the bake correct,

651
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,440
as folklore says,

652
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,720
"If the loaf cracks, the marriage will end in divorce."

653
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,760
Oh, it looks brilliant.

654
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,120
Do you want to do these ones?

655
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,800
Ukrainians aren't alone celebrating weddings with wheat.

656
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,920
On the island of Crete, breads shaped in floral wreathes

657
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,120
are presented as gifts to the wedding guests...

658
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,800
You're determined to get that Slava one in, aren't you?

659
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,520
..and in Poland, a loaf is sprinkled with salt,

660
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,080
said to represent tears,

661
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,400
hopefully, of joy.

662
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,320
Seven ladies. We rock.

663
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,320
The omens are good for Xenia's marriage.

664
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,680
I just feel sorry for whoever ends up eating the Slava dove.

665
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,120
Only one challenge left

666
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,920
before Paul and Mary decide who's excelled this week

667
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,680
and who will be going home.

668
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,920
Who's in line for Star Baker do you think, Mary?

669
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,040
It could be Alvin, he's done particularly well.

670
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,960
With the Manchego and the prosciutto, that was beautiful.

671
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,440
Flora did really well.

672
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,680
I think Ian's up there.

673
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,920
Absolutely.

674
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,760
So many different flavours.

675
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,040
Nadiya is having a nightmare in technical challenges -

676
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,240
right down the bottom in all three so far.

677
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,640
She's always better at things that she's practised at home.

678
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,480
For me, Dorret's in trouble.

679
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,560
I didn't particularly like her Signature Bake -

680
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,760
with the Stilton, I don't think it was good enough.

681
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,200
I think Mat has to be down there too

682
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,880
and anyone that comes in the bottom of a technical challenge,

683
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,720
such as Paul, automatically puts you in a very difficult position.

684
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,600
Morning, bakers. It's Showstopper day.

685
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,680
Paul and Mary are searching for the new Michelangel-dough.

686
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,360
We want you to make 3D bread sculptures.

687
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,080
So, you need to make up to three types of dough.

688
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,960
One of them needs to be filled and

689
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,760
you have five hours for your creations.

690
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,560
- So, on your marks... 
- Get set... 
- Bake!

691
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,000
I think I've definitely got to do well in this.

692
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,960
Yeah, I'm right down the bottom.

693
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,440
This is one of the trickiest challenges we've ever had.

694
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,960
They've really got to know their dough to create a sculpture.

695
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,200
As the dough grows, it can lose its definition.

696
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,000
We know our bakers can make one dough,

697
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,880
but can they manage three

698
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,720
AND a filling as well?

699
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,480
If they don't come prepared,

700
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,280
they're going to come unstuck.

701
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,960
- Morning. 
- Good morning.

702
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,160
MEL: Morning, Tamal.

703
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,720
MARY: Tell us about your sculpture.

704
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,280
I'm making a bread bicycle - or a bread-cycle.

705
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,680
So, the wheels are Chelsea buns

706
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,840
and the filling is marzipan and cranberries.

707
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,560
The frame of Tamal's two-wheeler

708
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,840
will be made from a woven fennel and lemon dough.

709
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,160
His third dough will make chai-spiced loaves

710
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,520
to go in the bike's basket.

711
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,840
So, the overall bike's going to be standing upright.

712
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,440
The weight on those Chelsea buns,

713
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,200
which are, essentially, a soft bread...

714
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,320
I'm trying to visualise how the whole things stands together.

715
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,360
So am I.

716
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,040
For my Showstopper, I'm making a cornucopia or a corn-of-plenty.

717
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,200
It's the first thing that came into my mind

718
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,640
when I heard a bread sculpture

719
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,440
because I've got relatives in the States -

720
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,400
and they have Thanksgiving, and they always have it there.

721
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,520
Alvin's planning an ambitious bake.

722
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,560
Inside his bread cornucopia will be five balsamic onion rolls,

723
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,080
three enriched dough plaits,

724
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,920
followed by pumpkins, a wheat sheath and pain de Provence.

725
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,720
So, this one is pain de Provence.

726
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,720
It's a fascination from growing in the Philippines.

727
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,920
It's a bread that you only get in patisseries

728
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,320
and French bakeries back home.

729
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,160
And, yeah, probably, it's that fixation from it.

730
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,040
Alvin's not the only highly ambitious baker.

731
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,080
Do better.

732
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,760
I know I can do it, I've just got to do it.

733
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,040
I'm making a lion sculpture

734
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,720
and it's called King Of The Jungle.

735
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,120
Paul's predator will have a white bread head,

736
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,720
a wholemeal tail and a body filled with figs and walnuts.

737
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,960
You've got to bring out those features of a lion -

738
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,440
which is the ears, it's the eyes,

739
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,520
it's the nose, it's the teeth, it's the claws.

740
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,240
If you say you're going to do a lion, it's got to look like a lion

741
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,400
and not like a dog or something like that.

742
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,080
Mat's sculpture also has to be accurate...

743
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,600
- Morning. 
- Morning.

744
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,400
..as it's one of Britain's most recognisable landmarks.

745
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,240
I'm making the Brighton Pavilion in bread.

746
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,520
Good gracious, me.

747
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,280
I know, they're all curry-inspired breads.

748
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,000
Mat's bready Brighton Pavilion

749
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,120
will have buildings stuffed with sag aloo,

750
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,560
curry-spiced domes

751
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,280
and lime pickle breadstick columns.

752
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,920
Sag aloo, which is going to be rolled in the dough

753
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,240
like a Chelsea bun.

754
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,720
Is there a danger that the building itself will "sag aloo."

755
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,040
I hope not, it hasn't so far.

756
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,120
How are you bonding them together?

757
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,880
- Gravity. 
- You... OK.

758
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,080
I'm pretty sure that's how they worked the actual pavilion, just...

759
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,480
Yeah, probably.

760
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,720
I'm making a snake charmer's basket with a snake and some flutes.

761
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,440
It was inspired by my travels to my grandad's village

762
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,120
in Bangladesh.

763
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,280
Like Mat, Nadiya's creating a spicy Showstopper.

764
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,160
Hers will include a woven basket

765
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,040
flavoured with za'atar, garlic and parsley flutes,

766
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,800
plus a snake packed with fried onions and chilli.

767
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,760
I've tried the snake loads of times

768
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,600
and he just does explode in the oven. He's enormous.

769
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,200
So, I think after doing him six times,

770
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,360
the trick is to just keep him small to begin with.

771
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,480
The challenges are once again

772
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,880
flavour, texture, design -

773
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,080
which is bottom of my list, actually.

774
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,760
Sandy's making a blue cheese and walnut basket

775
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,840
filled with wholemeal flours on pesto breadstick stalks.

776
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,760
My inspiration are the poppies from the Tower of London

777
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,640
to commemorate the war.

778
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,800
I thinks it's the simplicity of a poppy

779
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,080
that is so inspiring really.

780
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,800
Kind of waiting for stuff to rise

781
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,760
makes me feel uneasy.

782
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,200
So, I'm making three different herb breads

783
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,280
and then I'm doing courgette bread as well - so a green theme.

784
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,680
Flora's fashioning a three-tiered skirt

785
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,640
from white, wholemeal and courgette baguettes filled with pesto.

786
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,680
A corset, made from dough, completes the outfit.

787
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,640
In practises, I've broken the corset, I just dropped it.

788
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,400
It's very, very fragile.

789
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,160
This looks all very interesting.

790
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,520
Tell me what you're going to sculpt then.

791
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,080
It's basically a black olive and Parmesan plant.

792
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,720
The earth is going to be baked in a flowerpot,

793
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,160
so it's going to be my classic every-day seedy loaf

794
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,120
that I make at home for the family.

795
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,480
Ian's black olive and Parmesan plant

796
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,080
will feature brioche flowers

797
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,800
filled with a rose and raspberry marzipan.

798
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,760
And your flowerpot? They are quite tricky things to bake in.

799
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,080
- I've cooked in it several times but I'm still lining it as well. 
- OK.

800
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,000
Ian, you are Bake Off's first flowerpot man...

801
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,320
and for that, I commend you.

802
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,880
It's got dough everywhere. Dough-verload.

803
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,440
Don't want leave it too long because it will start going out of shape

804
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,240
and then your features are gone, so it's a bit of a time issue there.

805
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,560
I find you sculpting a lion's mouth.

806
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,240
- As you do. 
- As you do.

807
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,480
If Aslan ever needs facial reconstructive surgery,

808
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,440
you're the man.

809
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,960
I haven't actually practised this baked.

810
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,640
This is completely theoretical.

811
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,600
Dorret's taking inspiration from artist Tracey Emin's unmade bed.

812
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,200
Her sculpture will feature a raisin and fennel headboard,

813
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,160
a mattress stuffed with marzipan and glace cherries,

814
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,480
and an enriched dough duvet.

815
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm making a stuffed dough with nuts

816
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,560
and fruit to look like that puffy mattress sort of effect.

817
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,600
Have you ever made this before?

818
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,720
I've made lots of beds.

819
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,240
None out of bread.

820
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,000
Have you made beds out of dough?

821
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,520
No. The doughs, I've made.

822
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,160
As you would say, you're winging it a bit today.

823
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,440
Yeah.

824
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,160
- Good luck. 
- Thank you.

825
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,320
Like Dorret, Ugne's making a sweet, enriched dough

826
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,600
which produces a softer bread that's harder to sculpt.

827
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,680
I'm making a Easter basket,

828
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,280
I'm going to fill it with truffle-infused brioche bunnies.

829
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,560
Cover them with a maple syrup frosting...

830
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,720
Truffle with maple frosting as well?

831
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,360
Yeah, and...

832
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,320
- crispy bacon bits on top. 
- PAUL SIGHS

833
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,320
It taste amazing.

834
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,000
Ugne's unique Easter bake will also include a coffee and cardamom

835
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,160
woven basket, plus brioche red roses filled with prunes.

836
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,480
It's one of those things that's wait and see.

837
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,760
- Thank you. 
- Thank you.

838
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,200
I love truffle oil in anything really.

839
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,840
I'm going to stick to my guns.

840
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,800
Stuffed breads can be tricky.

841
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,880
The more filling the bakers add,

842
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,160
the longer the loaves need in the oven.

843
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,280
These are my Chelsea buns.

844
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,160
This is definitely out of everyone's comfort zone.

845
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,640
If it's not encased properly in the centre,

846
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,760
I find that it just spills out everywhere -

847
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,160
so I'm trying to keep it, sort of, uniform.

848
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,080
So, I've done the filling, this is marzipan.

849
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,960
It's nutty, it's fruity, it's zesty.

850
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,520
It's a nice stuffed mattress,

851
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,520
just the kind you'd like to lie on.

852
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,680
In each of the pestles for the flowers,

853
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,360
I'm going to have freeze-dried raspberry marzipan.

854
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,800
It looks more like a snake and less like roadkill now.

855
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,000
Problem with dough is, it's got a life of its own.

856
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,680
It'll start to move around.

857
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,640
I have to support some areas with foil while it's baking.

858
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,080
Oh, let's do it.

859
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,880
The first bake is crucial.

860
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,560
Only when their bread is in the oven,

861
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,960
will the bakers know if it's held its shape

862
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,040
or if the fillings have spilled out.

863
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,720
And now the duvet.

864
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,360
This is where theory meets reality.

865
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,880
OK, bread-ren. It's halfway. Halfway gone.

866
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,200
It's a lovely calm countryside out here. In here, it's just...

867
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,040
My bunnies losing their eyes.

868
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,640
They will be blind bunnies.

869
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,720
To guard against any mishap with the next stage of his Showstopper,

870
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,000
yet again, Ian's brought something from home.

871
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,160
So, I've been out with my angle grinder again.

872
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,320
Carving out this sheet of steel into a mould.

873
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,880
Believe it or not, it's going to turn into a black olive

874
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,800
and Parmesan, sort of, plant.

875
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,160
But for her poppies, Sandy hasn't gone quite so hi-tech.

876
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,640
I'm going to just scrunch up some tinfoil a bit more.

877
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,520
Artisan.

878
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,200
I'm glad you got the brief that

879
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,760
- we wanted enough bread to feed the whole of the South West. 
- Yes.

880
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,640
One out...

881
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,240
..one in.

882
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,560
I think happy with the colour and bake.

883
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,040
The head's relatively small, so that's good.

884
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,560
I'm really pleased with that.

885
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,720
I think I'm up against it.

886
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,160
I just need a bigger oven.

887
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,600
Yeah, it needs to come off the mould.

888
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,560
That is always a nightmare

889
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,640
and I've broken them several times before doing this.

890
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,720
So, the first time, the first time I practise it,

891
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,400
when I pull the mould out, the whole thing just caved in.

892
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,360
Ta-da.

893
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,520
Yay.

894
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,440
Oh, blimey. Oh, don't look behind.

895
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,720
I'm working on that "less is more" kind of attitude.

896
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,560
I've never seen so much bread,

897
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,640
you can open your own bread shop right here, right now.

898
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,880
Split a bit. I didn't want that to happen.

899
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,280
Didn't need that.

900
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,480
Good catch. He took a dive for his roll.

901
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,240
This is a mattress.

902
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,440
It's fine. Just going to put it back in to make sure

903
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,600
it's baked all the way through.

904
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,320
I really don't like these bunnies.

905
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,400
Which bunnies?

906
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,960
Which ones? Thank you, it means you don't see them.

907
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,040
I like... They are...

908
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,680
I'm not doing very well, am I?

909
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,800
Bakers, time to scream like Bread-vard Munch, 15 minutes.

910
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,720
15? Argh.

911
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,600
I love this - high fashion and baking.

912
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,080
I'm going to start doing a bit of assembly stuff.

913
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,680
I just want to get it on there now.

914
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,440
Time to...spike my flowers.

915
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,800
It just feels simple compared to some others.

916
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,520
You know what, if it tastes good, you'll be fine.

917
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,920
Yeah, that's what I'm hoping.

918
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,640
Bakers, one minute left on your sculpting.

919
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,320
I'm not functioning any more.

920
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,200
Oh!

921
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,800
It just looks like a lot of man-handled bread.

922
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,840
OK, Bakers, that's it. Time's up.

923
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,840
Step away from your bakes, please.

924
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,240
I think that looks spectacular.

925
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,800
What impresses me about your three different breads is,

926
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,840
there's almost a different technique in each.

927
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,760
I would be very proud if I'd made that.

928
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,600
Let's have a look at the Chelsea bun.

929
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,400
Lovely and chewy.

930
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,520
As a bake, it doesn't get much better than a Chelsea bun.

931
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,840
Well done, Tamal.

932
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,560
MEL: Ride off into the sunset.

933
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,200
- The whole thing, to me, is just a little but clumsy. 
- OK.

934
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,280
- Right, the poppies - cardboard. 
- Bitter.

935
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,040
You could take each petal off like that

936
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,360
and put it in a dip,

937
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,320
- and that... 
- Yep. 
- ..would be absolutely fine.

938
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,000
The star of the show, really. is your pesto grissinis -

939
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,320
they taste fantastic.

940
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,320
Alvin, would you like to bring your bakery up, please?

941
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,960
Do you need a hand, Alvin?

942
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,120
Yes, please.

943
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,040
- INDISTINCT CHAT 
- All right.

944
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,400
And guard it with your life.

945
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,600
- I'm very frightened right now. 
- Thank you.

946
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,480
Vehicle reversing.

947
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,160
MARY: You've achieved an awful lot in your five hours.

948
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,800
This is the pain de Provence.

949
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:09,080
The texture that you've got on that...is beautiful.

950
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,000
The craft on that is really perfect.

951
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,200
There's no questioning your bread-making skills.

952
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,400
Each individual piece is baked to perfection.

953
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,000
Just be aware of the brief in future.

954
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,760
If we ask you to make A sculpture,

955
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,160
try not to do too many.

956
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,600
The moment you lift it up, you smell the truffle oil.

957
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,560
Yeah. Got it.

958
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,200
I'm not sure about truffle oil with brioche.

959
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,840
PAUL SIGHS

960
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,120
It's too musty to go with something so sweet and so delicate.

961
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,320
Right. All the bakes are pretty good.

962
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,320
But just leave out the truffle oil.

963
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,160
That's a sculpture. That's one piece, it's uniform, it's simple.

964
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,160
It's truly magnificent.

965
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,040
I think what we need to do is, try one of the flowers.

966
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,160
It's lovely.

967
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,360
Flowerpots can be quite tricky things to bake in.

968
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,800
Lovely flavour.

969
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,080
I think you've got away with it. It is baked. But...just.

970
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,840
- I think your family are very lucky to have this every week. 
- OK.

971
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,400
- I think you've really thought it through. 
- Cool.

972
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,640
I love the way that you have made things so delicate, so perfect.

973
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,400
I think the pesto tastes amazing.

974
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,320
To get that much flavour in such a small amount of bread,

975
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,720
you've got it absolutely spot on.

976
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,720
- It's really good. 
- Thank you.

977
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,080
The colour of that snake is just unbelievable.

978
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,560
I think it's fantastic.

979
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,440
It certainly tastes smoky.

980
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,280
It's fiery. It's got a bit of heat in there.

981
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,800
The wholemeal basket with the za'atar,

982
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,600
it probably could have done with a little bit longer in the oven.

983
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,920
- It's a little bit too soft. 
- OK.

984
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,400
I think the whole thing together is good.

985
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,600
I think the problem is with the basket.

986
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,760
MEL ROARS

987
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,160
THAT is one of the best things I've seen in bread, ever.

988
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,480
- HE EXHALES 
- That is absolutely fantastic.

989
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,960
It's knowledge of dough, it's how you manipulate it,

990
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,640
it's got yeast in it, it's edible.

991
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,160
Just to do that with a salt dough is hard enough.

992
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,680
To do it with a risen dough...

993
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,360
I wouldn't have attempted anything like that. That is exceptional.

994
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,040
The detail that you've done,

995
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,800
the almonds in the claws...

996
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,840
Chunk off this.

997
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,720
That is packed with flavour.

998
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,160
Very, very good indeed.

999
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,760
- I'm pleased. 
- Thank you.

1000
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,800
It is really effective because you just simplified everything

1001
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,480
and I love that.

1002
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,000
So, we've got one.

1003
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,360
It's under-proved and it's underbaked.

1004
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,080
It's a lovely flavour.

1005
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,120
So you got a sag aloo inside the bread?

1006
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,880
- Inside all four of those, yeah. 
- It's a clever idea.

1007
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,280
The flavours are nice.

1008
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,320
- It just came down to like ten minutes in an oven. 
- Yeah.

1009
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,800
To choose something that's untidy to start with

1010
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,640
doesn't give us a good impression when we actually first look at it.

1011
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,880
Is that five hours work?

1012
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,520
- No, it isn't. 
- OK.

1013
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,600
I like the idea of this sitting on the top.

1014
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,760
When you managed to get that shape out of it.

1015
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,960
The bedhead - it's not defined enough.

1016
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,520
Raisin and fennel works well.

1017
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,720
It's a very good tasting bedhead.

1018
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,760
OK.

1019
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,400
Let's take the side off this.

1020
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,840
It's just about baked.

1021
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,040
As you move into the middle...

1022
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,800
..it's raw.

1023
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,960
Because you got layers of marzipan and apricots,

1024
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,400
and all sorts of things going on,

1025
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,200
the heat can't penetrate into the middle.

1026
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,320
It needed more careful planning, I think,

1027
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,440
- on the whole thing. 
- Sure.

1028
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,160
I think it's fair to say that was a memorable Showstopper.

1029
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,960
Paul's lion face was SO detailed.

1030
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,320
Absolutely amazing.

1031
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,840
Paul was in trouble before this,

1032
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,640
which just seems a light-year away.

1033
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,440
He failed in the technical challenge

1034
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,600
but then he's bounced back in a massive way.

1035
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,320
I think when you look at Nadiya, who was ninth in the technical,

1036
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,520
today, the thing that saved her was the flavour of that snake.

1037
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,840
- And the look of it. 
- MEL: Yeah.

1038
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,200
I think the people who did best today,

1039
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,360
did a sculpture...

1040
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,840
Something simple, something complete.

1041
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,760
I did actually like Ian's idea of the plant pot.

1042
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,840
The flavours that he got through there so...

1043
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,920
You know, Ian's had another strong week.

1044
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,640
Could you mention Alvin? I mean, fourth in the technical.

1045
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,240
Top, as far as I was concerned, in the signature.

1046
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,120
Now, Mat and Dorret were both in trouble

1047
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,080
as we went into the Showstopper, are they still there for you, Paul?

1048
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,600
Well, they both needed to really pick their game up

1049
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,920
and I don't think either of them did, really.

1050
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,560
I think Dorret's just seemed a bit chucked together.

1051
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,760
I know, when you add so much filling,

1052
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,640
- you're never going to get it baked. 
- Yeah.

1053
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,360
When you went in the middle, it was raw.

1054
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,680
When you look at Mat, the flavours were good

1055
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,360
and the design, I thought, was fantastic -

1056
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,600
but Mat's bake it was OK.

1057
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,000
- I think it was ten minutes away. 
- Hmm.

1058
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,240
Do you think you might know who is going today?

1059
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,840
I've sort of made up my mind but I would like to talk to Paul about it.

1060
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,200
- Shall we allow that? 
- Let's allow it. 
- I think we might. 
- Yeah.

1061
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,600
Bakers, I have the fun job this week.

1062
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,640
I'm going to start with something we've actually never done before,

1063
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,200
which is give out a special commendation...

1064
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,480
..and this goes to Paul.

1065
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,160
Because Paul has never, ever, in his life seen a bread sculpture...

1066
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,400
a magnificent as that one - so round of applause and congratulations.

1067
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,480
APPLAUSE

1068
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,240
And now to Star Baker.

1069
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,520
This week's Star Baker...

1070
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,160
created a flower so delicious,

1071
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,880
I want to eat the entire herbaceous border.

1072
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,040
Once again, it's Ian.

1073
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:56,240
APPLAUSE

1074
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,360
I've got the sadder job this week.

1075
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,840
We can't take everyone with us...

1076
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,360
so I'm afraid that we will be saying goodbye this week...

1077
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,000
..to Dorret.

1078
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,080
We're very sad to see you go, Dorret.

1079
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,280
It's been great. Thank you.

1080
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,680
It would have been nice to stay a little bit longer.

1081
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,600
I've got some recipes that I have actually practised.

1082
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,560
But, yeah, it's been awesome.

1083
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,880
Have you enjoyed it?

1084
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,760
Oh, yeah, it's been fantastic.

1085
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:34,280
To not test and try the Showstopper at home is a mistake -

1086
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,320
and Dorret has found that out.

1087
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,280
But I did have a word with Mat and said,

1088
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,120
"You've got to raise your game, mate."

1089
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,160
Well done.

1090
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,320
Thank you very much.

1091
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,560
This is getting weird now.

1092
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,000
Star Baker again.

1093
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,600
I feel like chucking myself in that river and...

1094
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,560
You're learning, you're producing things,

1095
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,520
you're meeting new friends, meeting new people - the whole process.

1096
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,120
But to get, then, on top, a commendation from Paul

1097
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,600
of how good it was, yeah...

1098
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,880
Fantastic.

1099
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,920
My wife told me before I came up for bread week that

1100
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,280
I had to bake everything for at least 10 minutes longer

1101
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:10,000
than I normally would and, yeah, she's right, so...

1102
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,520
I'll be in trouble when this goes out.

1103
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,720
Next time...

1104
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,000
This always gets messy.

1105
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,520
..it's desserts...

1106
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,560
Burning flesh.

1107
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,880
..with a Signature that sends the bakers into a wobble...

1108
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,800
The right wobble would be...that.

1109
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,320
They've just not set at all, damn.

1110
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,160
..a technical challenge of crumbling construction...

1111
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,280
It's the most feminine version of plastering you could imagine.

1112
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,200
..and a monumental Showstopper...

1113
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,720
Tell me, please that you don't use that on your patients.

1114
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,280
..that might just push them...

1115
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,720
The challenge is souffles, yeah?

1116
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,000
..over the edge.

1117
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,040
What have I done?

1118
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,800
I feel like I'm sat here like David Attenborough.

1119
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,640
"And if we just sit very quietly, here,

1120
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,080
"we'll soon see the brulees coming out."
