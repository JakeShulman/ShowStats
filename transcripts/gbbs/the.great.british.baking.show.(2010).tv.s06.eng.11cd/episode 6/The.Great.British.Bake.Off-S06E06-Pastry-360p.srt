1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,640
- Oh! Fill your lungs, mate - that is the smell of British summertime. 
- Mm.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,440
Cut grass, blossom on the trees...

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,560
THEY SNIFF

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,040
Oh - I'm getting adrenaline, and caramelised butter and sugar and...

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,200
- I... I think that's your armpits I'm getting. 
- I do apologise. 
- Oh, dear.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,360
Welcome... BOTH: ..to The Great British Bake Off.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,040
'Last time, the bakers had to bake without gluten, dairy and sugar.'

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,360
Icing gusset... THEY LAUGH

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,200
I mean, can you knead a liquid?

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,400
One ugly-looking cake.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,160
'Ugne had a double disaster, and went home.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,240
- 'Nadiya won Star Baker...' 
- It looks really most exciting.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,360
'..and broke Ian's run at the top.

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,600
'This week, the seven remaining bakers tackle pastry...'

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,360
It's so difficult to roll, I don't know why.

16
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,880
- It's burning. 
- Oh, it's burning.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,960
The frangipane is baked to perfection.

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,640
'..suffer the most pungent Technical Challenge so far...'

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,920
It's like sweaty old socks.

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,840
'..and batch-bake a retro Showstopper.'

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,240
This is SO fiddly!

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,720
- I cannot do 48 in five minutes. 
- OK. Do as many as you can.

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,640
This is ridiculous!

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,920
Just realised it's pastry week.

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,720
'I did it! I got Star Baker.'

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,160
But last week's over. It's a new week this week.

27
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,000
Last week - oh, dear, dear, dear.

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,400
I would quite like to get Star Baker. I'm going to say the words.

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,720
Oh, God, I've jinxed it. Why did I say it?

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,040
Good morning, bakers.

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,280
For this morning's Signature Challenge,

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,520
- Paul and Mary would very much like you to make a frangipane tart. 
- Oh.

33
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,200
Now, frangipane cream, for your information,

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,680
was named after the 16th-century Italian noblewoman

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,120
Muzio Frangipani...

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,160
- Nice. 
- ..and pastry cases after the 16th-century Italian nobleman

37
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,520
Giovanni Shortcrust.

38
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,760
Now - your tart must be open-top,

39
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,560
it must be made of shortcrust pastry,

40
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,640
and most important of all, you've got two hours on this, bakers.

41
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,640
- On your marks... 
- Get set... 
- BOTH: 
- ..bake.

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,640
I wouldn't say I'm king of pastry, no!

43
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,520
So nervous this week.

44
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,680
I just feel like I need to...

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,200
get better.

46
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,600
'I'm not feeling massively confident, really.'

47
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,920
Underprepared, I think.

48
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,040
To make a good short pastry you need to just bring it together,

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,640
but not overwork it -

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,880
then it's too rubbery cos you build up the gluten.

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,080
You want it to break and almost melt in the mouth,

52
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,880
but strong enough to hold the frangipane. It's a tricky one.

53
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,600
They all SHOULD be able to make a good sweet shortcrust pastry,

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,400
but it's a real test for them NOT to get a soggy bottom.

55
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,120
The bakers all start by making their shortcrust.

56
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,200
I want all the butter evenly mixed in so you don't get big lumps,

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,400
but it should look a bit like breadcrumbs at the end.

58
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,200
Like when you're making an apple crumble.

59
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,560
- Are you using the machine to make your pastry? 
- Yeah. So much quicker.

60
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,520
I don't know about that.

61
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,480
Everyone's doing it! Oh, Gawd.

62
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,800
A small amount of water should be added, to bring the dough together.

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,520
Yeah, you want to be careful with your water.

64
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,160
Obviously you don't want a sticky dough at the end of the day.

65
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,200
To get the pastry's characteristic shortness,

66
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,360
the butter and flour must be carefully rubbed in, not overworked.

67
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,520
And once it comes together as a dough,

68
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,240
it should be rested in the fridge to prevent the fat melting.

69
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,360
Chilling this dough right now is the most important thing,

70
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,520
because the last thing you want is a sticky dough

71
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,480
that just goes everywhere.

72
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,320
Hello, Alvin. Good morning.

73
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,280
Tell us all about your frangipane tart.

74
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,000
It's a simple plum frangipane tart.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,680
I'm making a rich sweet shortcrust pastry,

76
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,400
and I'm going to put some jam on it, just a thin layer of jam,

77
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,960
and then I'm going to put the frangipane on top.

78
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,840
Alvin's home-made plum jam will line his pastry case,

79
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,040
and he'll top it with fresh plums.

80
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,200
So you haven't poached your plums,

81
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,440
- you've just cut your plums and then fanned them on the top. 
- Yes.

82
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,880
How do you fan your plums, Alvin?

83
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,160
Oh, it's just arranging them on top.

84
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,560
Nice.

85
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,760
- Morning, Paul. 
- Morning, Paul. Morning, Mary. 
- What are you up to?

86
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,520
I'm making my version of a Christmas frangipane.

87
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,120
The pears are poached in orange, cinnamon, cloves, mixed spice.

88
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,000
- Do you make this over Christmas, then? 
- I do, actually, yes.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,120
Paul's pears will rest within his traditional frangipane,

90
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,000
glazed with apricot jam and speckled with sliced almonds.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,720
So how's it going to look when you finish the whole thing?

92
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,080
You'll have the pears going round in a circular motion,

93
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,760
and then I'll decorate with some icing Christmas trees in between.

94
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,320
Icing Christmas trees?

95
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,200
- Well, good luck. 
- MEL: Yeah. Can't wait to taste it.

96
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,840
'Like Paul, Tamal is filling his frangipane tart

97
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,120
'with festive flavours.'

98
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,680
- Morning, Tamal. 
- Morning.

99
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,400
MARY: Tamal, tell us all about your frangipane tart.

100
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,880
So, I'm doing mulled wine, poached pear frangipane tart.

101
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,280
So this is the wine mixture on there, so it's got red wine,

102
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,040
pomegranate juice and raspberry puree in there.

103
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,240
Tamal will use his reduced poaching syrup

104
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,800
to glaze his frangipane,

105
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,160
and he'll dot the surface with blackberries.

106
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
I'm sort of thinking how I'm going to do it,

107
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,720
cos when I've done it at home it's a really tasty syrup

108
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,040
but to put on enough that you actually get the flavour,

109
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,160
you ruin the effect of the tart cos you can't see the pears any more.

110
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,800
And do you find this fresh fruit bleeds into the frangipane?

111
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,080
Erm...

112
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,640
not too much cos I only put a few of the blackberries in,

113
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,720
they're just of scattered around.

114
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,520
- Good luck, Tamal. 
- Thank you.

115
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,520
- MEL: Yeah, good luck. That smells really nice. 
- Thank you.

116
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,000
So I'm making my frangipane mix now.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,400
Frangipane's quite a liquid cake batter.

118
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,320
MEL: Frangipane is an almond-flavoured pastry cream.

119
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,400
What I've creamed together there is the butter and the sugar,

120
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,040
and then it's a case of the eggs and the ground almonds there,

121
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,800
and that's frangipane.

122
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,680
Quite pleased. One of my guinea fowl started laying eggs.

123
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,840
I haven't baked with guinea fowl eggs for many, many years.

124
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,800
So I hope they're OK. Nothing like now to find out.

125
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,080
Hello, Ian. What are you up to this morning?

126
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,400
I'm making a pear and raspberry frangipane.

127
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,320
- OK. 
- So fairly...you know, fairly conventional, I think.

128
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,520
When I go on holiday to France, that's what I love to get.

129
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,760
Ian's adding Calvados to his Francophile frangipane,

130
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,880
and he'll glaze it with a reduced pear, star anise and lemon syrup.

131
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,960
I suppose my little twist of the day is I'm using my guinea fowl eggs.

132
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,760
MEL: Oh, these are guinea fowl!

133
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,080
MARY: I was looking at these, they look like pheasant eggs.

134
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,240
How many guinea fowl have you got, Ian?

135
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,400
Three adults now...

136
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,160
and one little chick that's about two weeks old.

137
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,720
What's her name?

138
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,480
We haven't named them yet. The kids have named the chick...

139
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,920
(Mary!)

140
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,160
HE LAUGHS Could be Mary?

141
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm just toasting the almonds, just to give them a bit of flavour.

142
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,640
Otherwise they don't taste of anything in there.

143
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,640
And mine is quite a subtle...

144
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,240
There's no strong flavours in mine.

145
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,360
- Good morning, Nadiya. 
- Morning.

146
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,040
Nadiya, tell us all about your frangipane tart.

147
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,080
So I'm making a bay-leaf Rong tea and pear tart.

148
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,440
MEL: What's wrong with the tea?

149
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,800
- Everything's RIGHT with the tea. 
- "Wrong tea"?

150
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,960
- Rong means colour. 
- Ah...

151
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,320
Nadiya will thicken her Bengali bay-leaf-infused Rong tea

152
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,160
with arrowroot, and use it as a glaze.

153
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,720
I can't wait to see what this tastes like.

154
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,520
- It's very subtle. 
- Right.

155
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,720
- Thank you. 
- Thank you.

156
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,840
Definitely a gamble doing stuff with flavours.

157
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,280
Unlike Nadiya's flavours, Mat's tart is far from subtle.

158
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,000
- Hello, Mat. 
- Good morning! 
- Right - pineapple,

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,360
- this is interesting. Tell us all about your frangipane tart. 
- OK.

160
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,320
- So today I'm making a pina colada frangipane tart. 
- Of course you are.

161
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,720
To create the cocktail's tropical tang,

162
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,440
Mat's mixing his frangipane with

163
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,600
pineapple, coconut and one other essential ingredient.

164
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,080
So this is the rum. Are you using just a little bit of this?

165
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah, not all of that. It depends how badly it goes.

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,800
Might resort to it at the end, but, yeah, not all of that.

167
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,960
Will it put us in a bit of a...mood?

168
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,360
Well, the sun's out, you have your rum and pineapple - that's the idea.

169
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,960
Fingers crossed!

170
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,080
Start rolling it out...

171
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,480
It's got to have a nice sort of pliable consistency to it -

172
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,360
not too brittle but not too loose.

173
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,960
It's a forgiving pastry, in that it doesn't tear.

174
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,960
I'm having a problem with rolling it, actually. It's sticking on the bench.

175
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,640
So I thought I'd put something underneath it.

176
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,480
I'm going to try this...

177
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,760
Flora, Alvin, Mat and Tamal are all blind-baking their pastry.

178
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,360
If you blind-bake it first, it means that

179
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,400
the pastry's less likely to get soggy with the filling.

180
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,640
I read once that you should blind-bake things,

181
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,800
that's why I'm doing it.

182
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,600
I don't think it's like a baker's instinct kicking in, I think it's

183
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,360
just a fear of wanting to change something that you vaguely know.

184
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,560
Paul, Nadiya and Ian have chosen NOT to blind-bake.

185
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,720
For a frangipane tart, I don't think you do blind-bake.

186
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,040
But, erm...we shall find out.

187
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,120
If I blind-bake, any pastry that's above the frangipane,

188
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,240
it looks burnt, it doesn't look very nice.

189
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,400
And I've done it without it, and it doesn't need it.

190
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,280
Mine's really dark in colour...

191
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,080
- Hello, Flora. 
- Morning.

192
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,360
- Flora, that was quick! 
- Speedy.

193
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,120
MARY: So you've baked this blind...

194
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,360
Yeah. I'm just doing egg white on top, just to seal it completely.

195
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,160
Flora's tart will be topped with an apricot jam glaze

196
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,600
and rosemary icing.

197
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,280
Amaretti biscuits will adorn the outside.

198
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,040
You've had a bit of a shrink back there, haven't you?

199
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,680
When did you trim that?

200
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,760
- Er, I trimmed it before it went in. 
- Why?

201
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,480
I'm always a bit scared of waste.

202
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,840
Doesn't it waste a lot of pastry when you have it hanging over?

203
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,560
Yeah, but we want it to be as neat and as squared-off as possible.

204
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,320
It's only shrunk inwards, it hasn't shrunk down.

205
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,280
MEL: You're not going to serve it in the tin,

206
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,640
- so you won't know there's been a shrink back. 
- No. 
- What's the problem?

207
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,640
- Thank you very much. 
- FLORA LAUGHS

208
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,320
So I'm just egg-washing the base...

209
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,680
It makes a sort of glaze, which then when you pop it back in the oven

210
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,280
it's basically another line of defence

211
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,360
against having a soggy bottom.

212
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,320
MEL: While Mat and Tamal are giving their pastry the second part

213
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,920
of its bake before filling, Alvin's only just getting his in the oven.

214
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,480
I've wasted about seven minutes there rolling the pastry.

215
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,200
There was no leeway for me.

216
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,560
So...I'm worried.

217
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,600
I'm worried. But, erm... I'm just going to carry on.

218
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,200
One hour to go. The bakers need to get their tarts filled

219
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,720
and allow enough time for the final bake.

220
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,640
I've put almonds on the bottom just to help with some of the moisture

221
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,480
on the bottom of the pastry, because it's not blind-baked.

222
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,000
Look how much it's shrunk!

223
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,360
It's about half the size it went in.

224
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,800
Oh, no. The pineapple takes up most of that.

225
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,520
Design is a bit of a generous word to be using for this.

226
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,960
This is...modern splodging! HE LAUGHS

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,560
It has to be pretty, because I'd like it to be pretty.

228
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,640
Yeah, I probably am a bit concerned with the aesthetic.

229
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,560
And I probably should concentrate on baking, but... Oh, well.

230
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,640
Right. Going in.

231
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,040
Bakers, half an hour

232
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,560
before I huff and I ruff-puff your pastry concoctions down.

233
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,680
I'm thinking...

234
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,600
if I have less than half an hour, I'm going to put less frangipane.

235
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,440
That will mean I will actually serve them something that's cooked.

236
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,680
It's not going to be full - but it's cooked. So hopefully it'll work.

237
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,880
(Come on.)

238
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,880
These are my amaretti biscuits

239
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,480
that I'm maybe going to put on the outside of the tart,

240
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,360
I'm not convinced if I should or shouldn't yet.

241
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,920
Come on. Come on.

242
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,680
(What's the temperature...?)

243
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,640
(Ridiculous...)

244
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,360
OK, bakers, you've got ten mins on your frange.

245
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,640
Ten, frange, obvs.

246
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,440
Oh, no...

247
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,720
Oh, it's like, two minutes...

248
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,760
- I'm going to take it out. 
- Are you? 
- Yeah.

249
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,880
- Bottling it, are you? 
- Going for underdone rather than overdone

250
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,320
this time. Mix it about a bit.

251
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,080
Dark on a couple of edges, but it's all right.

252
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,040
- Well, hello there. 
- No!

253
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,400
Oh, it's burning. Slightly burnt on the side...

254
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,520
FLORA GASPS

255
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,520
Oh, my God. I did not see that happening.

256
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,560
Maybe a little trim...

257
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,840
Yes, Paul!

258
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,880
HE WHISTLES

259
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,960
I really don't know if I should put my amaretti on or not.

260
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,280
I think they're going to think my pastry's a bit dark.

261
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
I might put it on to cover it up.

262
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,320
Bakers, you've got one minute

263
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,040
before you know if you've gone down the frangi-pan.

264
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,360
I'm going to take it out.

265
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,760
OK, bakers, that's time up.

266
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,720
Move your tarts, please, to the end of your benches.

267
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,840
'Paul and Mary will be expecting tempting tarts

268
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,440
'of crisp golden shortcrust, filled with mouthwatering frangipane

269
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,240
'and full-flavoured fruit.'

270
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,040
For me, it's lacking a glaze.

271
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,840
The reason why you put a glaze on is to cover up essentially

272
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,680
the dried pears, because they look so bad sitting on the top.

273
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,720
I tried to put it on, but it kind of disappeared in.

274
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,000
That's not a crispy base.

275
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,320
- When you don't blind-bake, it tends to be a lot more delicate. 
- Yes.

276
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,920
Crumbly. You want that rigidity from the base to crack through

277
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,840
- before you hit the frangipane. 
- The filling is just right, the balance.

278
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,880
You're getting a nice jam at the bottom, and the pears are done.

279
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,480
Overall, I think it looks unfinished.

280
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,200
The appearance is really, really lovely.

281
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,600
It's very professional, you sliced those pears perfectly evenly.

282
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,600
- Oh, bit of a soggy bottom there. 
- No!

283
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,640
It is quite an aromatic flavour.

284
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,960
But the baking of the frangipane is perfect.

285
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,640
It's perfumed, it's subtle and I like it.

286
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,280
But the pastry definitely is not done underneath.

287
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,920
It does look good, it's quite effective.

288
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,920
The pastry is a little bit doughy.

289
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,240
It's a nice flavour, I would say it's pineapple frangipane.

290
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,160
- SUE: 
- You're not getting the rum? 
- No.

291
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,720
It's quite bland.

292
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,960
They look a bit of a mess.

293
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,240
Just forget about the amaretti, doesn't add anything to it.

294
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,000
Absolutely delicious.

295
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,160
Because it's fresh apricots, it's quite sharp, which I like.

296
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,800
Don't think the rosemary adds to it at all.

297
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,160
I think it's overbaked.

298
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,880
- I think you blind-baked it slightly too long. 
- OK.

299
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,920
It is overbaked, but it isn't bitter and it isn't burnt.

300
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,760
It IS burnt and it IS bitter.

301
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,520
Thank you very much indeed.

302
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,880
I tell you who's bitter...

303
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,600
That looks stunning.

304
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,040
Oh, it's done, but it could have done with a little bit longer,

305
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,600
just to put a bit of colour on there.

306
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,720
The inside is a lovely texture.

307
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,520
It looks the part. I like it as a tart.

308
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,960
OK, thank you.

309
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,280
You have made a beautiful pattern of your plums on the top.

310
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,480
The pastry looks a little overbaked.

311
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,920
- You probably overbaked on the blind-bake. 
- Right.

312
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,840
Or overbaked on the end one, but the chances are, if you'd overbaked

313
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,520
on the end one, your frangipane would be baked, but it isn't.

314
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,680
Sorry.

315
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,200
(It's wrong...)

316
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,640
Hmm.

317
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Your base is far too thick.

318
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,280
I'm so sorry.

319
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,720
Your plums aren't cooked, either.

320
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,240
Timing is your nemesis, Alvin.

321
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,400
Timing issues, timing issues.

322
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,920
It is a bit chaotic on the top.

323
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,480
It should be all fanning out beautifully, symmetrical,

324
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,680
but it's not.

325
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,560
Nicely baked. It's solid, it's perfect.

326
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,200
That tastes beautiful.

327
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,680
The pastry is thin, it's crisp.

328
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,080
Frangipane is baked, as well, to perfection.

329
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,680
I think the whole thing is a classic frangipane. Spot on.

330
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,560
Messy top, tidy bottom!

331
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,800
Thank you.

332
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,080
Yeah, I'm really, really pleased with that.

333
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,040
They liked the flavours, said it was a bit of a mess on top,

334
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,680
which it was, but it's me,

335
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,480
so it is always going to be a bit of a mess.

336
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,200
Amaretti disaster.

337
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,720
Again, just trying to do something different and it didn't pay off.

338
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,720
I've been raised to always move forward, move on.

339
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,560
My dad is a retired general in the Army, and...

340
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,600
..failure is not an option. You need to carry on.

341
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,320
You'll never see me throwing the towel in and calling it a day

342
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,760
and walking away from it.

343
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,520
- SUE: 
- Pastry triumphs and tribulations

344
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,880
are not the sole preserve of the Bake Off tent.

345
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,440
Let me introduce you to the good people of Denby Dale,

346
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,080
who've taken pastry, pies in particular,

347
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,160
to a whole new dimension.

348
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,160
Since the 18th century, this northern town has been celebrating

349
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,240
as only a Yorkshireman knows how - with behemoth baking.

350
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,640
In 1846, the oppressive Corn Laws, which kept the price of grain high

351
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,400
and left the poor struggling to pay for bread, were finally axed.

352
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,680
So how did they celebrate the repeal of the Corn Laws?

353
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,640
By making a ginormous pie, of course.

354
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,240
I'd have had a disco, I'm telling you. A pie?! Who has a pie?

355
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,640
Sadly, the celebration with the eight-foot-wide pie was cut short

356
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,840
when Joseph Pease, the master of ceremonies, fell into it

357
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,000
and nearly drowned.

358
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,400
Following the tragedy, it took Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee

359
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,360
to inspired Denby Dalers to once again take up their spoons.

360
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,400
Now, Chris, I have to say, you've brought me here

361
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,000
under false promises. I was expecting an enormous pie

362
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,760
and all I've got is a rather lovely barren field.

363
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,880
Well, there is pie here. Sadly for you, it's buried without a marker.

364
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,240
- Why did they bury it? 
- They buried it because it was off.

365
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,360
So presumably, this is an absolute disaster.

366
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,640
They're never going to make any more pies again.

367
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,080
Absolutely not, no. They had a very good run.

368
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,560
There were two or three more, at least until we got to 1928.

369
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,240
- What happened in 1928? 
- It got stuck in the oven.

370
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,160
Chris, surely now people are saying, "Stop making pies!"

371
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,800
No, in 1964, we were baking again.

372
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,080
Large enough to feed 30,000 people,

373
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,560
this was Denby Dale's biggest pie yet.

374
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,120
The pressure was on to get this bake right.

375
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,200
- REPORTER: 
- How does it feel to be key man

376
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,240
for the biggest pie in the world?

377
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Well, I think it's a big responsibility

378
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,480
and it's such delicate stuff to deal with, to keep fresh.

379
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,400
It can soon go sour, can gravy.

380
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,360
At last, they met with success and spurred on.

381
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,000
In 1988, Denby Dalers decided to celebrate 200 years

382
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,320
of giant pie-making by attempting to bake a world-record-breaking pie.

383
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,440
The 1988 effort did indeed break the world record

384
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,240
for the biggest meat and potato pie, and the villagers finally received

385
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,880
the recognition they so richly deserved.

386
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,720
'Baking a record-breaking pie is no mean feat.

387
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,240
'But at least the bakers of Denby Dale knew what they were making.'

388
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,920
Bakers, welcome to your Technical Challenge.

389
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,840
Now, this is a recipe close to Paul's heart...

390
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,200
just nestling underneath the chest hair.

391
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,040
Now, Paul and Mary, of course, with all due respect,

392
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,320
- you're not needed for this bit, so... 
- Goodbye.

393
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,720
...off you pop.

394
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,200
Paul and Mary would very much like you to make...flaounes.

395
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,000
It's a cheese-filled pastry made in Cyprus

396
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,040
to celebrate the end of Lent.

397
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,000
You've got two hours on the flaounes clock.

398
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,960
- On your marks... 
- Get set, flaouna!

399
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,800
- TAMAL: 
- What is this?

400
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,440
Not in a million years have I heard of this recipe at all.

401
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,880
Never heard of them, never heard of them!

402
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,000
- It sounds like an airline. 
- It sounds like... 
- "Fly flaounes!"

403
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,680
- It's the way you say it, it sounds like an insult. Flaounes. 
- Flaounes!

404
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,160
I've made these a few times...

405
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,800
No, not really! Never heard of that.

406
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,000
I don't think they would've heard of these before.

407
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,520
They wouldn't have heard of them. I haven't heard of them.

408
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,240
They look absolutely delicious,

409
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,520
but why did you choose them as a challenge?

410
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,400
What I'm trying to do is test them on different levels.

411
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,840
One is the cheese filling inside and two is the dough on the outside.

412
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,840
It's got two flavourings in there as well.

413
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,760
One is mastic and one is mahlepi.

414
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,200
- Have you explained to them what to do with those? 
- No.

415
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,600
I think that's totally unfair. It is the toughest challenge yet.

416
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,120
Great, isn't it?

417
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,480
The filling has got the cheeses in it, the semolina,

418
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,880
it's got yeast in it.

419
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,080
The instructions for the ingredients are...

420
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,400
"Make the filling with all of the ingredients,

421
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,120
"apart from the baking powder, and then rest."

422
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,400
'Before tackling the pastry element,

423
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,840
'the bakers must first prepare the filling.'

424
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,680
There's a lot of cheese going in this.

425
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,240
It'll do nothing for my figure!

426
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,360
It's got sultanas in it,

427
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,280
a bit of cheesy sweetness going on there.

428
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,520
I mean, sultanas with cheese, you know, it's pretty odd.

429
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,360
FLORA: It just feels wrong, the whole thing feels wrong.

430
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,320
So I'm just going to mix it together with my hands.

431
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,160
"Cover it and rest it," it says.

432
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,000
Rest it down there in the proving drawer.

433
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,880
Pastry next. Right, that's what we're here for.

434
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,320
So it doesn't give any instructions about how to make the pastry.

435
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,520
This is not like any pastry I've heard of.

436
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,480
'The pastry has two very unusual ingredients.'

437
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,400
- Urgh! 
- Mahlepi...

438
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,320
Mahlepi, if that's how you pronounce it.

439
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,520
Mahlepi is ground pits of the sour cherry.

440
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,360
- NADIYA: 
- Mastic, I've never heard of that,

441
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,000
I don't even know what that is used for.

442
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,720
I've used that in a bathroom a few times, like, putting things together.

443
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,560
I've never used it in baking.

444
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,840
I have no idea what this is. No idea.

445
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,960
'A popular spice in Greek and Cypriot cuisine,'

446
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,960
'mastic is a crystallised tree resin with an unmistakable...'

447
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,240
Ugh!

448
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,680
'..pine aroma.'

449
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,280
It's nasty!

450
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,680
Oh! Oh...

451
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,080
That's like some industrial-strength cleaner.

452
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,800
It's like eating sand!

453
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,880
'And there's something else which makes this pastry special.'

454
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,960
I've never made a pastry with yeast in it...

455
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,600
which makes it feel so much more like bread than it does pastry.

456
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,480
I assume they want it to be a bit biscuit-like in texture.

457
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,400
Don't know, maybe it's like filo. Is it like filo? I don't know.

458
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
They haven't told you whether to knead or not.

459
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,400
Says, "Make the pastry, then rest."

460
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,200
Pastries, you don't normally knead,

461
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,240
but it's something that you've got to make sure everything is combined.

462
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,640
'If the pastry is overworked,

463
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,400
'it will become tough and brittle and could break.'

464
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,200
Can't make up my mind.

465
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,520
My instincts say to knead it a little bit.

466
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,640
It's a good little workout, actually.

467
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,840
Just realised it's pastry week and not bread week.

468
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,320
'The bakers have just one hour remaining.'

469
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,760
"Add the baking powder to the filling, divide into 12."

470
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,000
Baking powder...

471
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,560
"Divide pastry into 12 and roll into squares."

472
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,640
How big these babies are meant to be, I'm not too sure.

473
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,400
They're not exactly square.

474
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,120
I've been looking around constantly.

475
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,880
Help me cheat!

476
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,800
After last week's thick pittas I did,

477
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,920
I'm going to try and roll them a bit thinner.

478
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,000
Not getting any clues from this lot.

479
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,600
Oh...stupid Technical.

480
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,640
So we've got to coat one side of the pastry with the sesame seeds.

481
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,960
Question is which side.

482
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,080
Sesame is on the inside, just because I thought there's no way

483
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,040
it's going to stick to the outside.

484
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,640
I'm going to put it on the other side. Yeah.

485
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,240
"Then you put the filling in the centre of each square

486
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,880
"and fold over the edges..."

487
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,600
"Leaving the centres exposed."

488
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,320
But then you get a really thick layer of pastry.

489
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,240
That doesn't seem very pleasant.

490
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,000
Really?

491
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,280
You've just got to guess.

492
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,200
No, it can't be.

493
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,000
That looks quite nice.

494
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,360
Sorry to all of Cyprus if I'm ruining a lovely national dish.

495
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,240
Decisions, decisions - all of them wrong.

496
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,320
'Paul's recipe doesn't state how long to bake for.'

497
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,960
I guess these should bake for sort of...I don't know...

498
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,720
half an hour or something like that?

499
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,000
Come on!

500
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,480
I hope it's right. I hope I interpreted it right.

501
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,600
It's all in the hands of the oven now.

502
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,000
Well, they're in.

503
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,800
That's pretty relaxing, all in all.

504
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,680
Has everyone got theirs in the oven?

505
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,800
Yeah.

506
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,320
I hate you. I hate all of you.

507
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,120
I mean, I love my fellow bakers.

508
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,080
Bakers, that's ten minutes and this little bird will have FLAOUNES.

509
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,840
"During cooking, reduce the temperature...

510
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,440
"to make them golden brown."

511
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,440
I might have turned the temperature up and not down.

512
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,920
They don't need to know that.

513
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,600
Mine is so like pizza!

514
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,720
Cypriot pizza.

515
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,400
Top one is going to be raw.

516
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,200
I underestimated how long it was going to take to shape them.

517
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,840
They do look like they're going to be very neat ones, though.

518
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,120
- Yeah, they look really neat. 
- That's what they want, neat and raw.

519
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,160
Bakers, you have flao-una minutes.

520
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,400
- One? 
- That's it. 
- That's that, then.

521
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,840
Please bake.

522
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,720
OK, bakers, time's up for the cheesy Cypriot parcels.

523
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,200
Please bring them up

524
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,280
and leave them on the gingham table.

525
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,080
Paul and Mary are looking for 12 identical flaounes

526
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,640
with a thin crust and a high dome shape.

527
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,360
Right, shall we start over here, Mary?

528
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,480
Now, straight away, what we're looking for

529
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,400
is sesame seed on the outside.

530
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,720
You have the square, you have the cheese filling,

531
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,480
but there's no sesame seeds and it's too flat.

532
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,040
Actually, the interior doesn't look too bad.

533
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,840
It smells like a flaouna.

534
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,560
- Tastes like a flaouna, too. 
- Mm.

535
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,040
Problem is, they don't look like flaounes.

536
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,520
Right, move onto the next one. This looks more like a flaouna.

537
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,840
It's got a good colour.

538
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,400
It's just too flat.

539
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,640
Tastes very nice.

540
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,480
Mm. It does taste good.

541
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,600
Right, let's move onto these pizzas.

542
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,680
Oh, dear. It's not encased at all.

543
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,600
It's a deconstructed flaouna.

544
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,080
- Lots of sesame seeds, though. 
- Yes. Underneath.

545
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,800
It tastes fine.

546
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,160
It's just that the pastry hasn't come over the top

547
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
and got that fold in.

548
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,760
Now, these are a bit more like it, if I'm honest.

549
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,720
There's sesame seed on the outside. It's folded correctly, too.

550
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,960
And a lovely shine from the glaze.

551
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,800
They're not bad. Not bad at all.

552
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,600
Right, moving on.

553
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,160
There is sesame seed on the outside, sesame seed on the bottom.

554
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,680
- And it's very thick there. 
- It needs to be rolled out much thinner.

555
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,600
- Tastes all right. 
- Tastes like a flaouna.

556
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,680
Right, these are almost like crowns.

557
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,520
And they're a little bit haphazard shape.

558
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,040
Because it's a yeasted dough, I think they've pulled it.

559
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,600
It's a little bit undercooked, this one, I think.

560
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,920
And the glaze is a bit patchy.

561
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,760
It does need a little bit longer in the oven. Right, moving on.

562
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,440
- Interesting. 
- Cornish flaounes. 
- It is a Cornish flaouna.

563
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,480
You've got the height there. You've got the bubble coming out the top,

564
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,520
- which is good, but the shape's all wrong. 
- They've got it all even.

565
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,640
And that lovely colour underneath.

566
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,960
'Mary and Paul will now rate the flaounes from seven to one.'

567
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,400
In seventh place is...this one. Whose is this?

568
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,200
The sesame seeds weren't there.

569
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,560
Did you put the baking powder in all together as well?

570
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,360
- I did but I flattened out the cheese. 
- You need it to be high.

571
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,680
And in sixth place, these were just open and flat.

572
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,200
'In fifth place is Paul, and in fourth, Nadiya.'

573
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,800
And in third place is...this one.

574
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,640
Whose is this? Pretty good.

575
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,160
- You got the nice height, you just got the fold all wrong. 
- Yeah.

576
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,000
In second place...

577
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,240
You've got the fold right here and a little bit flat.

578
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,720
A beautiful colour and plenty of sesame seeds.

579
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,280
And in first place is this one. Whose is this?

580
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,800
The overall look of that could just about pass as a flaouna.

581
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,680
- Well done, Matt. 
- OK, Cheers. 
- MEL: Well done, Matt.

582
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,120
APPLAUSE

583
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,160
That's a turn up for the books, wasn't it?

584
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,040
Bad morning, better afternoon,

585
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,640
so...yeah, one balances out the other a little bit.

586
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,280
I said the words, didn't I? I said I wanted it.

587
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,800
Sounded cocky and the universe beat me back down.

588
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,320
Get in your place!

589
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,760
It's a disappointing day. It's a really disappointing day.

590
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,080
What impression do you get overall as to who's doing well this weekend?

591
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,520
What's really difficult, and more so this year than any other year,

592
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,080
they go from the top down to the bottom and vice versa on every

593
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,080
challenge, so to actually judge it is getting harder and harder.

594
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,960
I mean, Matt, his frangipane tart was very bland,

595
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,760
and then come the Technical, there he is right at the top.

596
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,200
Someone like Flora, the ideas are there.

597
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,600
But she's got to do what we ask her to do and forget all the extras.

598
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,080
Who do you think's in trouble?

599
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,720
It's Alvin, because he was down there in the Signature

600
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,560
because it just wasn't baked, and in the Technical, he was sixth.

601
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,920
Alvin has really got to pull up his socks.

602
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,920
So, Alvin is in trouble.

603
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,240
- What needs to happen for him to be saved? 
- A miracle.

604
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,920
If Alvin has a great day today,

605
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,480
I mean an unbelievable day today, you never know.

606
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,080
- Anything could happen. 
- Anything could happen in the tent.

607
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,160
- I'm excited, are you? 
- I'm on tenters.

608
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,240
I won't sleep for the rest of the day, which is unlike me.

609
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,600
Good morning, Magnificent Seven. Now, Showstopper day.

610
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,520
Paul and Mary, please, would love you to tackle

611
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,240
that classic of the 1970s,

612
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,320
the star of thousands of drinks parties.

613
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,840
They would like you, please, to make vol-au-vents.

614
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,720
They'd like you to make your own puff pastry from scratch

615
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,880
and two different types of vol-au-vents.

616
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,880
24 of each, which makes, by my mathematics, 48.

617
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,080
Now, I'm off to get into my Bri-nylon boob tube

618
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,520
- and my terry towelling hot pants. 
- Hello, sailor.

619
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,840
In the meantime, you've got three hours and 45 minutes

620
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,640
while I get the white wine warming nicely.

621
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,360
- On your marks. 
- Get set. 
- Bake!

622
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,880
I don't think we ever had any dinner parties when I was young.

623
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,480
I don't know if my mum would have ever made vol-au-vents.

624
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,240
It wasn't the sort of thing done in my house!

625
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,680
I'm old enough, unlike some of the rest in the tent,

626
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,880
to remember vol-au-vents!

627
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,080
Of the '70s, the late '70s, '80s.

628
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,640
And normally, in them days, it was egg mayonnaise.

629
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,600
At the moment, I'm just going to mix the dough.

630
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,680
I'm doing the dough for the pastry itself.

631
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,480
Brand-new day, brand-new challenge, so going to give it a good go.

632
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,240
We've given them plenty of time to do it,

633
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,400
but the trickiest part is making the puff pastry.

634
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,640
We want a good rise, we want it nice and straight, with all equal colour.

635
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,040
I love vol-au-vents,

636
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,640
providing they're beautifully cooked, lovely light pastry,

637
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,440
beautiful layers and well-filled.

638
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,040
Lots of filling.

639
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,320
'Puff pastry's light and flaky texture is made by creating

640
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,040
'layers of butter and pastry in a series of folds.'

641
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,320
So, this is my pastry mix.

642
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,480
At the moment, just flour and water.

643
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,480
I'm going to get that sort of fully combined and get it to chill down

644
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,960
in the fridge before I add the butter as another layer,

645
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,080
and then start the process of folding my puff pastry.

646
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,560
'Once the pastry's chilling,

647
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,600
'the bakers can concentrate on the butter layer.'

648
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,880
I need to break the butter down - there's two blocks.

649
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,720
Got to fold them together, break them down, get them to the shape

650
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,960
that I need, ready to go into parts of pastry.

651
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,080
The main thing with puff pastry is that the butter stays really cold,

652
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,080
so the pastry and the butter are both the same temperature,

653
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,240
so that when they meet they don't melt.

654
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,680
If the butter all melts, there's no rise in the dough at all

655
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:55,800
and you just get a kind of fairly nice circle of stodge.

656
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,320
'When the butter has reached the desired shape and depth,

657
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,960
'it's then encased in the pastry.'

658
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,600
It's important you seal everything

659
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,720
so there is no butter sort of exposed.

660
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,920
'Then it's rolled and folded.'

661
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,440
The secret to this was to keep everything really neat and form edges

662
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,840
to be straight so everything's sort of folded together nicely.

663
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,920
'The pastry then needs to be chilled.

664
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,480
'This process should be repeated several times.

665
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,240
'More folds means more layers and better puff.'

666
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,840
You want the dough to roll easily so you don't need to use too

667
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,760
much pressure, because the more pressure you use, the more

668
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,080
you're pushing the butter into the dough,

669
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,040
which, again, messes up the layering.

670
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,440
I need to get the lamination of the pastry right.

671
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,400
If I'm going to perform well today, it's got to be that.

672
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,120
The rest is just a bonus but the lamination needs to be perfect.

673
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,320
- Hello, Ian. 
- Good morning, good morning.

674
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,240
I am very impressed with the way you've kept your ends straight.

675
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,640
- Very neat, very Ian. 
- Yeah. Mm-hmm!

676
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,160
- You should get a wonderful rise from it. 
- I really hope so.

677
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,480
These have been my nemesis.

678
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,040
They've been the thing I've been dreading the most.

679
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,120
What kind of vol-au-vents are you making?

680
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,280
So, I'm making a mushroom vol-au-vent,

681
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,080
three mushroom vol-au-vents,

682
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,480
with just regular horse chestnuts and porcini,

683
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,160
- and then some truffle oil on top. 
- Ooh!

684
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,960
- How delicious. 
- With some lemon and thyme in there as well. 
- Yes.

685
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,520
- And the other one? 
- And the other one, this is my risk for the week.

686
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,680
This is my scallop one, with some squid ink in there.

687
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,720
'Ian will add bacon and vermouth

688
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,760
'to his black scallop and squid ink vol-au-vents.'

689
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,320
- Is there anything that's worrying you? 
- I spoke to my wife

690
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,760
the night before last. I left her some of this filling.

691
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,880
She said, "Ian, I don't like it."

692
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,560
- You can't tell me that now! 
- I mean, it is daring. 
- Yeah, I mean,

693
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,760
jet-black food is a little bit risque.

694
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,960
I don't want to sort of manipulate it too much.

695
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,520
You know, you don't want the butter to get too warm.

696
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,080
I'm going to wrap these up and I'll put them in the freezer.

697
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,920
Just for ten, 15 minutes.

698
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,000
Just get that in the freezer.

699
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,080
My vol-au-vents are...just remind myself.

700
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,280
I'm doing a garlic and chilli prawn

701
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,960
marinated on risotto with a pea puree underneath,

702
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,720
and then I'm doing a sweet one,

703
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,680
which is my take on the '70s, '80s trifle.

704
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,960
'Paul's trifle-inspired vol-au-vents will be layered with creme pat,

705
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,720
'raspberry coulis and cream, with a fresh raspberry sitting on top.'

706
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,520
This is unreal, isn't it?

707
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,800
That's horrendous.

708
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,200
It's jolly cold, so it's a perfect day for making pastry.

709
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,560
Just adds some drama to the occasion, doesn't it?

710
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,680
Biblical pastry.

711
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,640
'Creating perfect puff is a tricky enough challenge for the bakers.

712
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,040
'But, true to form, Flora is pushing herself

713
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,680
'by adding another element to her pastry.'

714
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,320
I am just doing my second dough, which will be the chocolate one.

715
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,520
- A chocolate one? 
- Ooh! 
- How are you incorporating the chocolate?

716
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,560
- I've never seen her so excited! 
- Well, it is quite different.

717
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,960
It is quite different.

718
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,360
'Flora's chocolate puff pastry will be filled with chocolate ganache

719

720
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,000
'Her savoury canapes will be filled with asparagus and Parma ham.'

721
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,600
How does the chocolate react with the puff pastry

722
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,040
- when you're baking it? 
- The cocoa powder can affect

723
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,640
the actual puff but I've managed to get it to work twice,

724
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,440
so I hope that it happens for me today.

725
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,720
'Not only do Paul and Mary want to see light-layered pastry,

726

727
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,840
'and transform the vol-au-vents into the perfect canape.'

728
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,400
I'm sort of doing a his'n'hers vol-au-vent.

729
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,200
So, one for my wife.

730
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,360
I asked what she'd like in the vol-au-vent

731
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,520
and she wanted smoked trout and horseradish,

732
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,560
and then I worked out what I was going to have,

733
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,680
and I was going to have...almost like a full English breakfast vol-au-vent.

734
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,840
'Matt's full English vol-au-vents will contain sausage and bacon

735
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,000
'and be topped with a quail's egg.'

736
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,440
It's a fancy sort of dinner party vol-au-vent,

737
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,440
and then one just from a caff. That's the look I'm going for.

738
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,480
'While Matt opts for traditional British flavours,

741
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,880
with a poached quail's egg on top,

742

743
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,480
- Cod and clementine? 
- Yeah.

744

747
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,480
What made you choose these?

748
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,520
These are my mum and my grandma's recipes.

749
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,680
When my mum was little,

750
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,000
my mum would eat the clementines and my grandma would keep the peel,

751
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,400
wondering what she could possibly do with it,

752
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,120
and that is what she came up with.

753
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,480
And that is an unbelievably - for me, anyway,

754
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,960
and I hope you guys like it - but it is such an amazing combination.

755
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,840
'Like Nadiya, Alvin's also using his childhood memories

Chicken a la King is obviously an American dish,

758
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,720
and being in the Philippines,

759
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,320
we sort of get this recipe from them, so I grew up with it.

760
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,760
It brings back memories - Mum making it in a big case and stuff,

761
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,200
so it's quite good.

- isn't it? 
- Yes, I'm not going to put everything in,

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,880
but I made some for me later.

767
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,640
I'm going to be standing very close to you

768
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,600
because I know there's going to be an awful lot left over.

769
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,160
- Thank you, Alvin. 
- Thank you.

770
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,360
'The fillings are a key part of this challenge,

771
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,200
'so Tamal's chosen a recipe that has been close to his heart for years.'

772
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,560
This is basically inspired by a sandwich that I had

773
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,160
a few years ago. It was top two sandwiches of my life.

774
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,920
It was a pork sandwich and they fried the meat with the fennel

775
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,960
and the rosemary, and I think about that sandwich quite a lot.

776
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,680
'Tamal's pulled pork vol-au-vents

777
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,920
'will be matched in flavour by his second filling,

778
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,480
'which will be spicy chicken and coriander.'

779
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,520
It's definitely got chilli in it!

780
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,960
OK, bakers, you're halfway through your three and 3/4 hour challenge,

781
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,280
which means you've got one hour, 52 and a half minutes remaining.

782
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,200
It's looking good. I can see the butter lamination inside, so...

783
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,400
What you don't want to see is butter being in there,

784
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,640
because it means it hasn't amalgamated with the dough.

785
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,080
That's not a good thing for puff.

786
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,360
Look at my butter. Why is it so lumpy?

787
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,320
- My butter looks a bit mottled, like it's chunks. 
- Yeah, so's mine.

788
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,600
Because I've tried to get it to cool quickly,

789
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,360
the butter's just frozen so fast,

790
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,400
when I've gone to roll it, it's just broken up into pieces.

791
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,280
- There's quite a lot of, um... 
- Lumps?

792
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,720
- It's a bit like a cellulite-y thigh. 
- It is.

793
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,680
Nadiya's has gone the same.

794
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,880
Um...I don't know, it's all right.

795
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,720
Are you feeling the presh with the puff?

796
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,200
Well, this isn't ideal but, yeah, I think I'll be all right.

797
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,040
That's what they're getting now, anyway.

798
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,960
I haven't got time to start again.

799
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,480
I'm making a second batch. I just need it to work.

800
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,480
There's time, there's always time.

801
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,760
'Once the bakers have got their hard-earned layers,

802
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,240
'they need to keep them.'

803
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,240
So, this cutting is very important.

804
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,320
The crucial bit to it, I think, really.

805
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,960
If I sort of cut like that,

806
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,880
the greasy butter will lock the sides

807
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,640
and then it will not rise above me.

808
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,520
It's those little things, I think, that if you focus on it,

809
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,200
you'll be rewarded in the end.

810
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,480
14, 15.

811
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm under pressure because we're running out of time

812
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,880
and they're not even in the oven yet, let alone filled.

813
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,600
OK, bakers, you've got an hour to go

814
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,200
before the vol-au-vents buffet will be served.

815
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,960
One hour before the vol-au-vents buffet will be served.

816
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,320
Thanking you.

817
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:55,360
I am rushing, so I need to just stop and just calm down.

818
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,680
And just do this because I will just mess it up otherwise.

819
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,840
Ah, this is so fiddly.

820
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,240
I'm all right at the moment, yeah.

821
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,920
I'm just sort of trucking on, you know what I mean? It's, um...

822
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,880
I'd prefer they came out of this - the cutter - a little bit easier.

823
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,760
I'm putting a sheet of silicon on top of all the vol-au-vents.

824
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,080
This just helps them to rise evenly.

825
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,680
These are going in.

826
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,280
I'll just put the wire rack on top.

827
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,480
The idea is to stop them rising too far.

828
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,920
If they rise that far, I'll be jolly happy.

829
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,720
Anyway, that's 20 in, so that's good. I'm on my way.

830
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,480
'Mary and Paul will want to see a perfect batch of vol-au-vents

831
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,040
'from each baker. Well-risen, uniform and vertical.'

832
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,560
They're not going straight, which I knew they would

833
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,680
because I've had to rush it. Which is not good.

834
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,920
Melting.

835
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,720
I didn't chill them before I put them in

836
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,600
because I'm running out of time.

837
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,480
Well, there's some vol-au-vents.

838
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,880
Oh, my God.

839
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,920
- They look all right? 
- They're perfect.

840
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,800
This is disaster. This is not good.

841
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,840
Look at Matt's. Like straight soldiers.

842
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,200
Mine look like they've been drinking.

843
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,400
I've now got to take out 48 middles, though.

844
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,800
One.

845
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,240
Two.

846
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,960
I'll keep you up-to-date, yeah?

847
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,720
My pastry's just melting away in the oven. It's not rising very much.

848
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,760
Oh, it's not looking very good.

849
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,640
OK, bakers, 15 minutes left

850
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,320
before Puff Daddy comes to judge.

851
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:21,560
I've still got to rebake the breakfast ones. Oh, that's not good.

852
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,480
- I've still got lots to do. 
- They're not straight but I'd rather have

853
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,720
something on there, filled, than nothing at all.

854
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,520
I've got so many piping bags on the go.

855
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,800
I need to make sure I'm putting the right one in.

856
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,200
- Nadiya, my love? 
- Yes? 
- Just a thought. 
- Yeah?

857
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:43,840
Worth trying to put some filling, even if it's just on there,

858
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,440
- just so you've got something to show. 
- I cannot do 48 in five minutes.

859
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,640
OK, well, do as many as you can in five minutes.

860
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,840
Right, going in with a finger. This is ridiculous!

861
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,760
It's a bit black, isn't it?

862
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,000
Terrible. That's how they're looking.

863
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,800
It's hard to pick, they're all so hideously deformed.

864
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,720
Come on, come on, come on.

865
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,360
Better hide the ugly one, eh?

866
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,560
I'm going to give them everything I said I would, just deconstructed.

867
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,320
OK, bakers, the Showstopper has been stoppered.

868
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,320
Vol-au-vents at the end of the bench.

869
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,240
They look amazing.

870
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,680
The puff, the height that you've got from it, the lamination,

871
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,360
the shape, the bake.

872
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,080
It all looks fantastic and great size as well.

873
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,640
- Flavours are gorgeous. 
- Good.

874
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,640
Well thought out, actually, and well baked.

875
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,520
And I promise you, the egg yolk is beautifully runny,

876
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,040
it's dripping down my hand.

877
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,520
Delicious.

878
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,200
The horseradish with the smoked trout, the blend is beautiful.

879
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,240
They're delicate, they're really good, strong flavours.

880
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,480
You've done two excellent vol-au-vents.

881
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,200
- Well done. 
- Thank you very much. 
- Thank you.

882
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,760
- They look a little bit under-baked. 
- It looks anaemic. 
- Mm-hm.

883
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,680
- You've got the layers there, but they're a bit tilted. 
- Yes.

884
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,800
You can see right down the bottom, it's raw.

885
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,320
Right, let's check the sweet one.

886
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,520
- The flavours are coming through. 
- It's a lovely creme pat.

887
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,480
- They just look hideous. 
- Yes, I agree there, yeah.

888
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,800
Your savoury ones look a picture.

889
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,760
Those are very delicious.

890
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,560
I don't think you've got the rise of your pastry.

891
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:35,440
- They're little bit heavy. 
- But it's neat and the filling is beautiful.

892
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,760
- Right. 
- The chocolate ones, they've risen in the beautiful flakes.

893
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,960
Quite dense again for a puff pastry, the chocolate,

894
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,120
but the flavour is stunning. It's even better than the savoury.

895
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,000
I think they're brilliant. You were exceptionally brave to do it.

896
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,840
- Thank you. 
- And we haven't got any extra things stuck on the side.

897
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,880
Well done.

898
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,240
They are a bit of a mess, aren't they?

899
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,960
They do look a little bit pale, bit topsy-turvy, but well filled.

900
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,200
Let's have a look at this one.

901
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,360
Quite a good bake underneath, look. It's a lovely flavour.

902
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,520
As a canape, I think it really works.

903
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,600
That coriander chicken is delicious.

904
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,920
Next one is pulled pork.

905
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,240
The filling is delicious.

906
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,720
- I thought it was going to be dry, it wasn't dry. 
- Two fantastic flavours.

907
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,520
They taste good, they don't look too good.

908
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,360
They are a bit irregular. I didn't expect that.

909
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,840
Most of them have risen fairly straight.

910
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,600
They're a little squat in size.

911
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,000
The mushroom ones look a little bit over-baked.

912
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,440
Truffle oil with the mushrooms, though, is delicious.

913
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,400
The filling is very good.

914
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,840
But the scallop and the ink look interesting.

915
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,000
I ran out of time, so didn't get a chance to garnish them,

916
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,640
- so they look a little, um... 
- Look plain. 
- Look a bit black. Mmm.

917
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:14,240
- I think the black ink with that is... It's not good. 
- No, OK.

918
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,280
They're all very neat, but that's not Ian, really.

919
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,520
We haven't got your style.

920
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,120
- Oh, dear. 
- Yeah.

921
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,640
I'm sorry, they weren't obviously supposed to be presented like that.

922
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,680
Is this the pastry you made initially or is it the second lot?

923
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,560
- It was my second lot. 
- This is why you ran out of time. 
- Yeah.

924
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,080
And once you run out of time, to try

925
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,640
and laminate a dough when the butter is trying to melt

926
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,280
and you try to rush it and bring it out and then the butter just leaves

927
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,200
the pastry, which is why you end up with these massive gaps.

928
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,560
It's very sad that it has all toppled over and so forth.

929
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,680
You've got wonderful layers there.

930
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,480
- The pastry was properly made, but you needed to chill it. 
- But...

931
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,520
..the fillings look fascinating.

932
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,720
It's so annoying.

933
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,960
The cod and the clementine together, that is stunning.

934
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,840
- The korma... 
- I'm not, as you know, a very spicy person

935
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,680
- and it really is absolutely scrumptious. 
- It tastes amazing.

936
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,320
And I was a bit worried, thinking, "Would you have that cold

937
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,560
- "in a canape?" But, actually, yeah, you would. 
- It's lovely.

938
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,040
And we can see that you can make the puff pastry,

939
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,760
because the layers are there.

940
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,560
- It just... It didn't get chilled in time. 
- Thank you very much.

941
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,400
Overall, they don't look too bad.

942
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,080
They look lovely and colourful, those. And these are well garnished.

943
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,160
But they look quite raw here in the middle.

944
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,200
Did you notice that on a few of them when they were coming out?

945
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,400
Er, to be honest, no, I did not.

946
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,000
- Goes back to dough when I push it. 
- Yeah. Oh, sorry.

947
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,400
That is a shame.

948
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,040
I like that feeling. I've tried that filling before.

949
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,640
- The flavour's good. 
- The filling is delicious.

950
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,600
I think your pastry is better baked on this one.

951
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,960
- I'm not getting much flavour throughout that. 
- Sorry.

952
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,880
But I'd say the flavour on that is delicious.

953
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,920
Thank you. Thank you. Sorry about that.

954
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,120
BIRDSONG

955
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,760
I actually think one of the stars of today was Max.

956
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,560
I mean, look at them, they're perfect

957
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,120
and the flavours were stunning

958
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,320
and he even got his yolk runny too.

959
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,200
What a relief that Flora just made what she was asked to make.

960
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,280
Who's had chocolate puff pastry before?

961
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,480
But she had confidence in it and it worked.

962
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,120
Mary and I have got a few ideas for Star Baker,

963
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,240
but, I think, when it comes to the person who has to go,

964
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,760
I think it is between two.

965
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,760
And I think we have to sit down and try to figure out

966
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,880
over the three challenges, who has baked the better.

967
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,200
Did Alvin do enough to save himself?

968
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,040
Well done, bakers. Who knew that puff could be so tough?

969
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,600
So, I've got a very nice job this week -

970
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:37,320
Star Baker goes to somebody whose vol-au-vents today

971
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:41,160
are as tall and proud as the baker himself.

972
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,360
Matt, you are this week's Star Baker. Well done.

973
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,160
Thank you.

974
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,000
I've drawn the short cheese straw.

975
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,760
With great regret, the person who is leaving us this week...

976
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,640
..is Alvin.

977
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,960
Alvin, you cherub.

978
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,400
Being in the tent, it taught me how to be resilient.

979
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,040
I feel like I'm leaving the tent a better man, a different man.

980
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,760
- Well done, mate. 
- Thank you, sir.

981
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,000
'It was unfortunate that Alvin had to go,'

982
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,720
but the Showstopper to save him really had to be fantastic

983
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,640
and it just wasn't good enough.

984
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,120
Nadiya, who's also in the drop zone,

985
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,080
but the flavours were honestly some of the best stuff I've ever had.

986
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,200
I can't believe I made it through.

987
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,920
I thought I was going home.

988
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,560
I am so grateful that I'm here. I'm so grateful.

989
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,680
Yes!

990
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,680
'Matt has improved beyond belief.'

991
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,360
His Showstopper was really stunning.

992
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,680
It's great, innit?

993
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,120
The biggest surprise is Mary Berry double-punched me

994
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,480
in the stomach when she congratulated me!

995
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,600
That's a surprise.

996
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,960
Little bit winded.

997
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,920
Next time - the tent turns Victorian...

998
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,360
Oh, my God.

999
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,400
..as the remaining six bake recipes from the past...

1000
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,600
I've filled it too much.

1001
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,520
..go overboard with decoration...

1002
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,360
Queen Victoria would be proud.

1003
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,480
Agh!

1004
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,840
..and get to grips with old-fashioned techniques...

1005
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,920
I mean, it can't be that hard, right? It's a cake.

1006
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,200
'..which turn even the tent's toughest to jelly.'

1007
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,160
Don't let a fondant tennis court be the end of you.

1008
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,440
HE EXHALES
