1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Tents, bunting, Glastonbury, Glyndebourne.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,440
- I love a classic British event. 
- I wish we were going to one, mate.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,640
Might have the very thing for you, chum.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,680
Welcome to the final of The Great British Bake Off.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,880
- MEL GASPS 
- You organised all that?!

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,440
- Put the guy-ropes up myself. 
- Oh, great.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,720
In the beginning...

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,000
That is one of the best things I've seen in bread, ever.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,040
- Wow. 
- ..there were 12.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,480
Now...

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,080
Oh, no.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,760
..there are three.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,160
How long have we got?

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,320
Three bakers.

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,880
Three final challenges.

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,280
Stop looking so nervous, you're making me nervous.

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,800
- Do I look nervous? 
- Yeah. 
- If I'm making you... 
- I know.

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,760
- ..if YOU think I look nervous, wow, I must look really nervous. 
- I know.

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,360
From the very beginning of this year's Bake Off, Tamal has shone.

20
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,240
I've tried many times to put collars around cakes.

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,240
First time in the tent, and you've achieved it.

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,760
He's delivered daring flavours...

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,440
The rosemary's coming through, the honey's coming through...

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,320
- ..and ingenuity. 
- That looks spectacular.

25
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,320
..despite taking almost every bake up to the wire.

26
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,040
Perhaps I was a little bit too ambitious on this one.

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,680
'I've been getting stressed.

28
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,680
' "Oh, God, I'm in the final, it's so stressful." '

29
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,080
And then I'm like, "Ooh! I'm in the final!"

30
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,320
I keep wanting to tell people, like, strangers, "I'm in the final!

31
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,440
"Yeah, me!" "Who are you?"

32
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,320
Nadiya's Bake Off didn't begin quite as well.

33
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,720
Last place is...this one.

34
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,800
Whose is this?

35
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,600
Eventually shaking off her technical curse...

36
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,480
- And in first place... 
- That's me. 
- APPLAUSE

37
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,800
- ..her spectacular bakes... 
- That's ingenious.

38
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,920
..inspired by her family...

39
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,640
The overall effect is really very beautiful.

40
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,840
..propelled her to claim Star Baker three times.

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,040
'I know week by week how much I've had to claw my way through.

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,160
'Now I'm battling myself a little bit, thinking,'

43
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,800
"But I really want to do well, but I really want to win.

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,040
"But I don't want to come second or third, I want to win,"

45
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,680
and it's just really weird.

46
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,760
I'm come in feeling very strange this morning.

47
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,960
Ian has also been named Star Baker three times...

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,480
Truly magnificent.

49
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,320
..The competition standout engineer of incredible structures...

50
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,400
I think you get full marks for originality.

51
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,520
I don't think I'll ever see a well like this again.

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,120
..And inventor of pioneering flavours.

53
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,360
When have I ever had tarragon and apple? And I like it.

54
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,880
I wrote in my journal,

55
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,360
"This could be a pivotal moment in my life, this weekend."

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,920
- It's like, "Whoa, that's too big. 
- Don't think about that."

57
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,280
'It's just another weekend in the tent, three things to cook,

58
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,600
what's there to worry about?

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,960
- Quite a lot, actually. 
- But never mind.

60
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,600
HE EXHALES DEEPLY

61
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,560
Bakers, huge congratulations.

62
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,000
After 27 challenges, you're here in the final.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,400
So, this is your last ever Sig Chal.

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,840
Mary and Paul would love you to make, please,

65
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,640
16 filled iced buns.

66
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,680
Ah, thank you.

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,640
- Happy days. 
- Thank you, Mary. 
- Two different types, please.

68
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,720
Any favours, that's all good.

69
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,560
You've got three hours on the clock.

70
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,840
- On your marks... 
- ..Get set, bake!

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,080
I've got the capacity to turn this

72
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,280
into a very stressful-looking challenge.

73
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,880
You can almost sense that it's the final.

74
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,280
Just really quiet.

75
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,080
Feel like I should be whispering.

76
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,520
Just cooking another thing.

77
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,480
- PAUL: 
- This is The Great British Bake Off Final.

78
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,000
We're looking for every single thing that they bake,

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,320
or prepare, has to be the best they can produce.

80
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,240
Sometimes you have a bit of an inkling,

81
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,720
but on this occasion, I have no idea who's going to win.

82
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,960
- PAUL: 
- An iced bun is a thing of beauty.

83
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,480
There is nowhere to hide, from the icing, to the bun, to the filling.

84
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,880
They have got to use enriched dough, which is tricky.

85
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,920
A good iced bun should be cram-jam full of flavour.

86
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,360
A lovely, soft, beautifully textured bun and the icing,

87
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,080
when you just get your teeth into it, should be soft, not crisp.

88
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,840
It's all down to keeping calm and following, in your head,

89
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,280
the stages that they need to achieve to produce perfection.

90
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,800
- Morning, Tamal. 
- Morning. 
- Tell us all about your iced buns.

91
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,680
So, the two different iced buns that I'm making, the filling for one,

92
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,080
I'm making a citrus marmalade and a caramel creme pat

93
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,800
and then the other one is an apple and whipped cream,

94
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,320
so I'm making apple sauce with a little bit of cinnamon

95
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,600
and some ground cloves in it.

96
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,960
Tamal's apple iced buns are inspired by the apple turnovers

97
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,240
his mum always brought him when he was little.

98
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,560
His second batch will be flavoured with citrus marmalade and caramel creme pat.

99
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,880
What about the icing?

100
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,840
I'm doing a simple royal icing for the tops of both of those.

101
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,280
- A royal icing? 
- Yes. 
- Any flavours going to be in that icing?

102
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,680
No, I thought all my flavours are going into the fillings,

103
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,880
because I thought the icing is quite a simple element.

104
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,880
Just make sure that the shape and the icing is all...perfect...

105
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,040
- EXAGGERATED ACCENT: 
- Perfect Paul, everything's got to be perfect!

106
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,480
- I'll do my best. 
- Thank you, Tamal. 
- Thank you.

107
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,880
Like a standard bread dough, an enriched dough should be kneaded.

108
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,880
It doesn't need kneading for too long, just five minutes.

109
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,040
So, I think quite a wet dough means you get a very light,

110
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,960
fluffy bun, which is what we want.

111
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,240
Just looking for the stretch of the gluten.

112
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm going to put in a bit more flour into this,

113
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,120
because it's still quite a wet dough.

114
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,040
But it's getting there. I think it's going to be...

115
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,280
CLANG

116
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,200
- HE LAUGHS 
- Sorry!

117
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,040
Thanks, little chum.

118
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,400
Into the proving drawer, I'm just going to chuck

119
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,120
a thermometer in there, check the temperature's good.

120
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,200
I think I'm going to prove it for about an hour.

121
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,120
This is kind of the stuff that I ran out of time for,

122
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,640
and keep an eye on, at home,

123
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,760
just sort of trying to do other things at the same time.

124
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,640
I'm doing two proofs, so I'll prove it now for about an hour.

125
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,880
And then I'll prove it again once it's shaped, for...

126
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,160
another half an hour probably?

127
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,200
Feel all right. It's a nice, soft dough.

128
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,600
Tamal and Nadiya are proving one dough which they intend

129
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,680
to split for their different buns.

130
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,120
Nice and wet.

131
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,480
But Ian has made his final Signature Bake twice as hard.

132
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,680
Yeah, I'm going to do two batches of dough.

133
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,800
I'm using some elderflower cordial for this.

134
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,160
Wasn't sure what flavour to do for these iced buns,

135
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,160
and then cycling along last week,

136
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,920
there was this glorious smell of fresh elderflowers,

137
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,680
and I thought, "Yes."

138
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,440
Ian's elderflower buns will be filled with fresh lemon curd

139
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,600
and his second dough will be for spiced buns

140
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
flavoured with cardamom and cinnamon,

141
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,520
and filled with apple and cranberry jam.

142
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,480
- Why did you do two separate doughs? 
- Um...

143
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,200
I wanted the flavours in there right from the beginning

144
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,960
to sort of permeate the dough.

145
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,840
Elderflower, it's going to be fascinating

146
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,560
to see what comes through in the dough.

147
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,400
In place of sugar in the elderflower dough,

148
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,040
I'm just using elderflower cordial,

149
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,640
cos there's an amazing amount of sugar goes into cordial.

150
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,160
You're actually pushing the boat out. This is the final.

151
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,600
You're going to be very, very busy

152
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,440
to do two doughs, two different flavours.

153
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,720
- Yes, mm-hmm. 
- Are you going to finish it on time?

154
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,360
- I hope so. 
- You have to. There is no, "Oh, I might do."

155
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,280
You HAVE to finish in that three hours.

156
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,960
(Nadiya...are you flavouring your doughs?)

157
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,000
- (Yes.) 
- (I'm not.)

158
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,360
How's your dough rising? Are you happy with it?

159
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,680
I've done it in the oven. Stick it in the oven on the proving setting.

160
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,720
Have you now?

161
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,680
- Yeah, it wasn't rising that fast. 
- Yeah, mine's not rising that fast.

162
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,360
- What's Ian doing? 
- Ian's sticking with the proving drawer...

163
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,400
Just starting to make the lemon curd.

164
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,240
..And he's made a start on his fillings.

165
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,160
Zest and...juice of three lemons going into there.

166
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,760
Start to just coat the back of the spoon nicely.

167
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,640
They're both doing something with creme pat, which I'm not.

168
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,400
I'm weighing my egg yolks. Getting this set for the creme pat

169
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,640
relies on you having the right amount of egg and cornflour.

170
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,880
Got to go for precision in the final.

171
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,640
I'm doing almond creme patissiere, and then I'm doing cardamom bun...

172
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,360
- OK. 
- ..and then I'm doing a nutmeg finger with sour cream jam.

173
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,000
A sour ja...

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Sou... Shall we start that again? Oh, my goodness, I'm so messing up.

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,560
- Nadiya... 
- Yeah, look, my hands are shaking. 
- Put your hand out.

176
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,880
- You are shaking. 
- Yeah, I am, I'm really nervous.

177
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,000
Nadiya has put herself under even more pressure by choosing

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,600
to be the only finalist to break with iced bun tradition.

179
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,680
I'm doing one shape fingers, and then I'm doing the other one round.

180
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,440
- Nice. 
- Round? 
- Yeah. 
- OK.

181
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,240
Why shouldn't a bun be round?

182
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,400
- That's fine. 
- My buns are round.

183
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,720
- Exactly. 
- Always.

184
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,760
You're going to be baking them individually -

185
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,800
will they touch or not?

186
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,160
- They don't touch when I bake them. 
- OK.

187
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,560
Thank you, Nadiya.

188
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,680
90 minutes remaining in the final Signature Bake.

189
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,440
That's been proving for an hour. It's doubled, so... Perfect!

190
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,360
So this is the cinnamon... Mostly cardamom, actually.

191
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,040
So I'm adding in my spices now.

192
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,720
'I tried with some spices and things in the dough during the week

193
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,560
'and I was like, "Mmm, it's in the filling."

194
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,320
'I don't think it added anything in the dough. So this is where I start

195
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,000
'getting paranoid about, "Have I spaced them appropriately?" '

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,600
Got to leave enough for them to grow.

197
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,320
That's what Paul wants in a batch bake. His buns to be touching.

198
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,080
So they're not baking, they're proving.

199
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,920
Elderflower and lemon ones, one set proving down there,

200
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,360
another set proving behind me.

201
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,800
One, two, three...four, five, six, seven eight. Done.

202
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,880
- TAMAL: 
- Ugh! Shaky hands.

203
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,640
The second proof is a chance to make even more fillings.

204
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,040
This as a citrus marmalade.

205
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,960
There's a lot more fruit juice going in, other than the clementines.

206
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,120
It won't just be pure peel, trust me.

207
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,920
I'm using lemon powder, just to make it a bit sour.

208
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,480
There is sourness from the cherry, but it's just not enough.

209
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,240
Lemon's obviously another liquid, and you don't want to put

210
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,240
liquid back in and make it watery and maybe not even set the jam.

211
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,400
- Right, apple and cranberry. 
- Obviously, now you're in the final.

212
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,760
For all that you're a gentle, sensitive, feminine,

213
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,560
hedgerow-raiding soul...

214
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,200
you WANT this now, don't you? Surely?

215
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,840
Everything about this whole process has felt very unlikely.

216
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,640
From the first phone call about the audition to being here.

217
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,000
It's almost like you're really good(!)

218
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,080
Two Star Bakers and a time in the wilderness, finds form right -

219
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,160
and I have to say RIGHT - at the last minute, and then...who knows?

220
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,720
- Focus. 
- Focus, yeah, move quick.

221
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,640
Now I've released the inner you, it's OK to say, ("I want this.")

222
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,160
You think so?

223
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,520
Bakers, one hour to get your buns in gear.

224
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,120
In they go. Good luck, fellas.

225
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,640
One batch is cooking

226
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,040
and the others will be going in in the next few minutes.

227
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,400
It's traditional for iced buns that they are a batch bake.

228
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,840
It's fine! If you want to break the mould,

229
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,440
you know, on Paul's favourite thing in the world...(!)

230
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,800
I'm really nervous about the whole non batch-baking.

231
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,600
- Why would you be nervous? 
- Because you two are doing batch-baking.

232
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,040
But it works all right for you when you break the mould,

233
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,080
do you remember that Technical in week one?

234
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,600
Yeah, that... Coming 12th was amazing(!)

235
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,880
TAMAL LAUGHS

236
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,800
Wonder if we could do with just a bit more cranberry in there.

237
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,040
I'm a little bit behind, it's nothing disastrous.

238
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,640
I just wanted to have this creme pat made and cooling.

239
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,720
Looking good, yep, happy with them.

240
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,200
- I am pretty happy with the bake. 
- That's my least favourite.

241
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,680
Nothing a little icing won't cover, I hope.

242
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,520
Might use a bit of ice.

243
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,640
Pop the pan in an ice bath just to help it cool quicker.

244
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,400
OK, I think this is as thick as it's going to get.

245
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,360
The elderflower ones are all fine, they're done,

246
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,600
but the cinnamon ones seem to be taking a bit longer.

247
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,080
A worry. Come on!

248
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
I don't know what's made it slow in there.

249
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,880
Makes me wonder, did I leave something out?

250
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,360
Very loose-set creme pat. I think it'll be just about pipe-able.

251
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,840
OK, bakers, you've got 15 minutes. 15 minutes!

252
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,480
They look strange and I don't know why.

253
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,400
My main worry at the moment is that creme pat.

254
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,960
I hope it can cool down in time, cos I'm a bit screwed if it doesn't.

255
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,160
HE EXHALES SLOWLY

256
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,720
I think I'll do the icing first.

257
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,560
- Can't use my creme pat. 
- Why? 
- It's not set.

258
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,360
Bakers, three minutes till bun time.

259
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,320
Creme pat I am not going to include, which is kind of a big element

260
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,800
of those creme pat ones to not be using.

261
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,040
- HE SIGHS 
- Oh, so frustrating!

262
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,000
OK, bakers, string up the bunting, this bun-ting is over.

263
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,240
HE EXHALES

264
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,160
It's judgment time in the final Signature Bake.

265
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,080
- I'm amazed that you got finished. 
- So am I. 
- Well done.

266
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,960
Now, the overall appearance, these have all touched each other

267
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,440
- when they've been baked. 
- SUE: Batch bakes that you pull apart.

268
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,800
But the icing is a little bit messy.

269
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,520
That's a very nice finish of the filling.

270
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,760
They all look a fairly even shape.

271
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,320
And then we come to the cardamom ones.

272
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,600
- They've not got a shine quite the same. 
- No.

273
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,080
But maybe they're going to taste wonderful.

274
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,400
The icing doesn't go with the filling.

275
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,280
It's two completely different things.

276
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,360
What I'm intrigued about

277
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,480
is I think something's missing from this dough.

278
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,840
- Cos it took way longer to cook in the oven. 
- Did you put sugar in it?

279
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,520
That's the bit I'm wondering about.

280
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,240
I don't think you've got sugar in there.

281
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,520
Which is why it took ages longer in the oven,

282
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,760
and that's why it dried out and becomes a crispy bap.

283
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,400
- Yeah, yeah. 
- With icing on it.

284
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,520
And that's what's sending all my senses out, they don't marry up.

285
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,840
The second one, totally different - soft top, icing perfect,

286
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,280
- cream good, flavour of the lemon coming through. 
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

287
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,400
And all together as a package, just dynamite.

288
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,680
I think that's sheer heaven on a plate.

289
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,000
The cream is spilling out and the lemon curd looks good

290
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,360
and they're a sheer joy to eat.

291
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,040
OK, lovely. Thank you.

292
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,120
They look most tempting. Lovely neat piping

293
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,560
with an original finish on the long ones.

294
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,480
And the little round ones are quite different.

295
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,680
There's no rips anywhere. Normally it's ripped.

296
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
That's different, that is unique.

297
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,720
What you could have done was just a little bit of icing sugar on them.

298
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,600
- Hm. 
- Just to cover up these plain bits here.

299
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,240
Let's start with this one.

300
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,400
- Holding together quite well. 
- Yeah.

301
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,200
You can really taste that jam.

302
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,920
The jam is quite sharp, and you've put the right amount in.

303
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,720
- I think those taste lovely. 
- Now... 
- Cardamom almond creme pat.

304
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,080
Cut through this.

305
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,440
Creme patissiere in the middle with almond flavour...

306
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,640
- I just think those are lovely. 
- Both of those tick the boxes.

307
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,880
They're neat, they're full of flavour

308
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,440
and they're so different as well.

309
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,120
- Fantastic. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you.

310
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,840
Let me just wipe him down. NADIYA LAUGHS

311
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,040
Oh, no, we'll do it with the hose later.

312
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,480
You've put royal icing on the top and just coloured it.

313
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,040
I would have thought that royal icing should have had a shine to it.

314
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,840
That doesn't have a shine.

315
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,080
It's a shame that your creme patissiere is not set.

316
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,360
Now, your timing has been an issue before,

317
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,040
and we're back to the same thing again.

318
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,760
But I think we need to try them, I think the bake looks good.

319
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,960
- Let's start with this one. This is cream and the apple. 
- Yep.

320
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,240
Nice and soft.

321
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,480
Overall, the texture of the bun is beautiful. The flavours are good,

322
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,680
but the only thing that lets it down is that icing. It's not right.

323
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,560
But let's move on to this, this hasn't got creme pat in.

324
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,120
So a marmalade butty.

325
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,160
- That is so good. 
- Wow. 
- Really like the marmalade.

326
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,720
The peels were beautifully tender, it was sharp.

327
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,640
I think the flavour of that's great

328
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,760
but obviously you've ran out of time.

329
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,960
The flavour of this, though, with the apple and the cream,

330
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,440
is very, very good.

331
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,720
You were just let down by time.

332
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,000
Yep.

333
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,160
If this were an earlier week and I'd got those comments,

334
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,920
I'd be feeling pretty happy.

335
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,360
I just can't get it out of my mind that this is the final,

336
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,320
and I don't want to be getting big things wrong in the final.

337
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,000
Some good comments there. "Heaven on a plate."

338
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,840
I'd like to think I'd try and remember those bits, but at

339
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,680
the same time, I'm going to remember

340
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,080
that 60g of caster sugar and think, "Argh!"

341
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,520
I'm really pleased, cos one thing I was worried about was that

342
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,880
if it didn't go well this morning I'd have just gone, "Ooh"

343
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,760
and slumped and just not felt great.

344
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,520
I mean, I don't know what it's going to be like...

345
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,320
in the Technical, but at least I can go in feeling like,

346
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,680
"Come on, let's do this."

347
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,200
It is time for your last ever...Tech Chal.

348
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,800
- It's one of Paul's recipes. Paul, any pearls of wisdom? No. 
- Nope.

349
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,520
Paul and Mary, your bungee jump awaits. Have a great time.

350
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,040
Mary, the safety harness is there.

351
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,560
Paul, we haven't bothered for you, very much a single trip.

352
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,560
For this final Technical Challenge we'd very much like you

353
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,680
to shake hands once again with Mr Pastry.

354
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:29,240
Paul and Mary would love you to make six raspberry millefeuille.

355
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,080
We're looking for thin layers of crisp rough puff pastry,

356
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,840
raspberries - natch - Chantilly cream and some fondant icing.

357
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,560
You've got two hours to complete this challenge. On your marks...

358
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,080
- ..get set... 
- ..and for one final, technical time...

359
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,280
- BOTH: 
- ..bake!

360
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,160
- NADIYA: 
- Never made a millefeuille before. I can't even say it.

361
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,600
- TAMAL: 
- I know what one looks like,

362
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,280
so that's a big advantage over most of the technicals we've had.

363
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,360
- IAN: 
- Feels like a lot to have to do in two hours.

364
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,560
The reason why we choose millefeuille

365
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,000
is because Nadiya, Tamal and Ian have all had problems

366
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,840
and issues with their pastry throughout the whole of Bake Off.

367
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,320
Now, I think this needed to be sorted out.

368
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,680
For me, it's all about the crispiness, the flakiness

369
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,480
and the butter flavour that comes through in this pastry.

370
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,720
The recipe, we've given...a lot of the method.

371
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,640
In true Paul Hollywood style, just a little bit left out.

372
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,720
After all, it's the final.

373
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,160
I'm not as experienced with rough puff.

374
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,960
It's not one that I'm a big fan of.

375
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,640
This would not be my pastry of choice for the Technical.

376
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,480
- Two hours is not a lot of time. 
- Doesn't bode well, does it?

377
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,240
What with my vol-au-vents and the cream horn,

378
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,880
they were nothing short of a disaster zone.

379
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,480
Do you think we're being tested because we did bad pastry?

380
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,960
TAMAL LAUGHS

381
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,800
It's a possibility.

382
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,560
It's a personalised challenge, just for us three.

383
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,240
- Oh, gosh, yeah. 
- It is. I think it is.

384
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,760
Paul's rough puff pastry recipe requires grated butter

385
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,880
to be folded into the dough.

386
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,320
It's grated. Keeps it nice and small, I think.

387
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,200
I guess it helps to incorporate it, I'm not quite sure.

388
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,320
I'm just going to do it like I do it at home.

389
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,080
So I'm making a block of that butter,

390
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,880
and I'm just going to incorporate it in like I do and hope for the best.

391
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,280
I'm not ignoring the instructions, I'm interpreting the instructions.

392
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,880
So it's been a slightly chequered relationship with pastry...

393
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,320
Yeah, we've...

394
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,800
..so far on Bake Off, but how are we now, are we on talking terms?

395
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,240
- We're on talking terms now. 
- Yeah?

396
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,120
Post-cream horn we've just reconciled.

397
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,800
That butter is so warm, I need to chill it in the freezer right now.

398
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,640
Now we're on to a bit of jam. I feel comfortable with jam.

399
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,040
It's just the instructions for making a jam,

400
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,200
which say, "Make a jam."

401
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,120
Probably should have got a bigger pan.

402
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,280
- "Make a sugar syrup." 
- Just says, "Make a sugar syrup."

403
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,440
Which is helpful(!)

404
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,960
- I wonder what that's for. 
- What is that sugar syrup for?!

405
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,600
I imagine it's for putting a gloss on the raspberries,

406
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,320
but I don't know.

407
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,560
"Make a 30 x 20...candy-stripe icing." (Candy-striped icing...)

408
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,360
Never made icing like this before. No experience of it.

409
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,200
Candy-striped icing?

410
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,720
I'm so confused.

411
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,640
(Candy striped...) Yeah, candy stripes.

412
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,360
You know what candy stripes look like, for goodness' sake.

413
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,880
(Agh!) Everything just seems to be taking ages.

414
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,960
I'm presuming they're going to join together. There's no sign of it yet.

415
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,440
I think the sugar syrup is for my candy stripes.

416
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,640
So that's what I'm using it for. I think that's what it's there for.

417
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,320
"Divide the pastry into three, roll each piece into 30 x 20,

418
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,480
and then bake."

419
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,600
- TAMAL: 
- Oh, it's just such a warm day.

420
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,600
I can feel it starting to melt, which is not ideal.

421
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,040
Doubting my measuring skills now. 23...

422
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,680
That's fine, just checking!

423
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,520
OK, I'm going to put this one in first.

424
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
TIMER BLEEPS

425
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,440
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

426
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,040
Oh, that's the worst pastry in the world ever.

427
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,840
Got layers, so it's OK.

428
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,800
They look horrendous, but please don't judge.

429
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,760
Ugh.

430
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,600
That's what's doing my head in.

431
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,040
Yeah, I'm happy with that.

432
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,560
I don't know how to cut these, I don't know how to cut these.

433
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,360
You do wonder why you put yourself through this at times.

434
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,000
Feel like I'm kind of losing control of this task a bit.

435
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,200
I have to measure, that's the bit I can't do.

436
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,760
And which way to cut it.

437
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,080
Oh, my God. Your pastry looks so nice.

438
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,400
Mine is awful.

439
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,840
(Chantilly, raspberries...) "Make six three-layered millefeuilles."

440
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,680
Oh, God. It's really hard keeping going

441
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,080
when you think you've done a really bad job on something.

442
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,040
I don't get it.

443
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,360
HE SIGHS

444
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,360
Where's my tray, where's my...?

445
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,760
I can't even count, I can't even do Key Stage 1 maths.

446
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,960
It's really tricky to cut, so brittle.

447
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,320
HE GROANS

448
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,520
Whatever happens here today,

449
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,120
I have to live with for the rest of my life.

450
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,840
- Knife-edge stuff, isn't it? 
- It really is.

451
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,480
How am I going to make that pretty?

452
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,920
- How, how...? How does that...? 
- OK, bakers. Five minutes left.

453
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,560
OK, bakers, your final Technical Challenge...

454
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,800
is closed.

455
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,160
Please bring the millefeuille up and put them on the old gingham cloth.

456
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,800
Mary and Paul are expecting precise, neat millefeuille

457
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,280
with crisp, flaky pastry.

458
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,680
I think we need to start with this one.

459
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,160
It looks as though one or two might topple any moment.

460
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,520
They are a mess.

461
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,160
You can see the layers, they haven't bonded on the top.

462
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,680
The middle layer is almost gone

463
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,960
and the bottom one has almost evaporated to nothing.

464
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,560
Bit of sugar syrup underneath the top would have helped bond the top.

465
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,000
The pastry, it is cooked through.

466
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,120
It looks as though you sat on the top to squash them all in.

467
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,720
This pastry's been a bit rushed. You can take off each layer.

468
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,680
This one is a little bit neater.

469
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,880
It feels like shortcrust. It's very thin, isn't it?

470
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,440
- There are flakes here. 
- Yeah.

471
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,880
The pastry that I'm taking is beautifully crisp.

472
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,880
It's ticked a lot of the boxes. Moving onto the last one, though,

473
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,520
we can see straightaway there is an issue with the top, it's not bonded.

474
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,640
It's not bonded at all.

475
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,040
That's because the syrup was not thick enough to stick it down.

476
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,040
- A few layers in there. 
- Good layers.

477
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,120
The big gaps there, to pipe like that

478
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,240
and leave big gaps is a major issue.

479
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,480
It isn't quite done, the pastry.

480
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,760
The jam is well-made, it's a very good flavour.

481
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,640
The pastry is flaky,

482
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,720
but it just needed that little bit longer in the oven.

483
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,480
Has anyone managed to get even close to the perfection

484
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,920
that Mary and Paul demanded?

485
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,000
In third position is this one, whose is this?

486
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,960
The pastry seems very odd, what have you done?

487
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,240
I grated all that butter and made it into a block,

488
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,320
and it was a like a butter block with air holes.

489
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,520
- So I think, yeah, that's why it's just... 
- Pulled apart.

490
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,200
And in second place is this one.

491
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,280
- That's me. 
- The fondant icing was not bonded. There were big gaps here.

492
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,800
And in first place...

493
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,480
The pastry's very good, very neat inside. Good, strong bake,

494
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,640
which was what we were looking for. Good layers.

495
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,120
And overall, a very neat millefeuille.

496
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,520
- Well done, Nadiya. 
- Thank you. 
- APPLAUSE

497
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,920
My goodness, that was SO tough.

498
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,760
I just got the first in the Technical in the final.

499
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,880
It's been an OK day today.

500
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,720
So my kind of past track record with Showstoppers,

501
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,320
that's what I'm kind of pinning my hopes on for tomorrow.

502
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,720
I need to nail it tomorrow, that's what I need to do.

503
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,440
One challenge remaining.

504
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,640
In just a few hours, at a very special tea party,

505
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,480
either Nadiya, Ian or Tamal

506
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,320
will be crowned the winner of The Great British Bake Off.

507
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,520
Bakers, welcome to your final challenge in the Bake Off tent.

508
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,160
No matter what happens today,

509
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,480
you should all be incredibly proud of yourselves.

510
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,920
And no matter what, you'll all be getting invitations

511
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,520
to the post-show party, where Mary will be reprising

512
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,120
her now famous twerking routine.

513
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
- Absolutely. 
- Good all the way.

514
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,520
Now, what we would love you to make today is a classic British cake.

515
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,120
A single-flavoured but multi-tiered cake.

516
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,880
Bells, whistles, jazz hands.

517
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,920
You know you can do it, you've got four hours on the clock.

518
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,760
- On your marks... 
- ..and get set... BOTH: 
- ..bake!

519
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,240
Yesterday, just want to put it behind me.

520
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,160
Today is today, it's the Showstopper.

521
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,880
- What the hell? Go for it. 
- Going to be a busy one.

522
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,560
The last challenge is always the hardest challenge.

523
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,840
We're looking for a classic British bake, such as a Victoria sandwich.

524
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,320
Such as a lemon drizzle. Such as a Battenberg.

525
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,040
Not that simple.

526
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,560
They've got to make whatever they do perfectly.

527
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:22,520
The finished result when we walk up to it has got to wow us.

528
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,560
We want them to do three tiers minimum,

529
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,520
so actually baking it could be a problem.

530
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,000
A smaller cake will bake quicker than a big cake,

531
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,280
so it's about consistency.

532
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,680
We'll be comparing each slice out of each cake to make sure

533
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,720
that each one is exactly the same.

534
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,560
This is our bakers' last chance.

535
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,600
THUNDERCLAP

536
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,480
Rain drumming overhead,

537
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,480
we're looking forward to a classic British tea party this afternoon.

538
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,440
- Morning, Tamal. 
- Morning!

539
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,360
What have you decided to do for your final

540
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,280
Bake Off Showstopper Challenge?

541
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,280
My initial inspiration was sticky toffee pudding, which I love.

542
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,160
I always like the sponge in a sticky toffee pudding to have chopped dates,

543
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,840
and I started putting more fruit into it, and I realised actually, it's become a fruitcake.

544
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,640
- Sticky toffee pudding cake? 
- Sticky toffee pudding fruitcake.

545
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,920
Tamal's triple-layered sticky toffee pudding cake contains figs,

546
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,920
dates, oranges, lemons and prunes.

547
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,600
It will be filled and topped with a date and toffee sauce

548
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,720
and decorated with spun sugar.

549
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,400
The theme was meant to be something old.

550
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,680
There were these pictures in the press a few months ago

551
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,320
about this Chinese fishing village that had been abandoned

552
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,120
and sort of overtaken by the undergrowth,

553
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,760
and I really like that idea, so it was,

554
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
the spun sugar was meant to represent cobwebs.

555
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,000
So let me get this straight - your classic British cake

556
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,840
is based on an ancient, abandoned Chinese fishing village?

557
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,200
- Yeah. 
- I love you. I love you.

558
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,640
- Humidity can play with caramel. 
- Yeah.

559
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
- Are you taking that into consideration? 
- Yeah.

560
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,960
This is the first time this has happened. Wait and see what

561
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,840
the weather does and adjust what you're doing in terms of decoration.

562
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,680
Yeah, I'm going to be working right up to the end.

563
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,600
- What's new? 
- SHE CHUCKLES

564
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,720
Tamal's journey to a final Bake Off Showstopper

565
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,360
began when his big sister Shama started teaching him to bake

566
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,720
as soon as he could hold a wooden spoon.

567
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,240
It's gone from the two of us making a fairy cake or a cookie...

568
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,520
Look how well you've done now. If it weren't for me, would you be here?

569
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,480
Well, probably not, but I'd probably be a successful billionaire

570
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,720
somewhere on my yacht in the Mediterranean!

571
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,960
- But would you be happy? 
- Yeah, I'd have a yacht!

572
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,840
I am utterly amazed by how well he's done

573
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,040
and also with his work at the same time.

574
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,840
Tamal has had to practise for the final between shifts

575
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,240
- as a trainee anaesthetist. 
- He's the full package for me.

576
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,680
He's good-looking, he's funny, he's intelligent.

577
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
Whatever happens...

578
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,800
I can't stop doing that!

579
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,040
We had perfect weather yesterday for sugar work and now we've got this.

580
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,120
This is the worst possible weather for me.

581
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,400
That 10% chance of rain forecast was a load of rubbish, wasn't it?

582
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,640
So I'm making a lemon drizzle cake

583
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,360
and I'm using the creaming method, just adding the eggs in.

584
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,440
When you cream butter, you get quite big air bubbles in there.

585
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,840
By having it already melted, you don't get quite so many air bubbles,

586
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,400
thus you get slightly denser cake.

587
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,480
It's kind of what's expected for a carrot cake

588
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,920
and what seems to suit it best.

589
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,920
I like mine with a decent kick of citrus, that's why this one

590
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,400
is getting some lemon zest. Also a bit of lemon juice, as well.

591
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,520
You've got some cinnamon and some allspice, some fresh ground cloves,

592
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,360
some freshly-ground star anise.

593
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,280
It's got to have a nice, even distribution of the fruit.

594
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,480
So I coated the fruit in a little bit of lemon juice to make it sticky

595
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,720
and then I've coated it in a bit of flour.

596
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,000
It's just to help the fruit not sink down.

597
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,280
Tamal and Nadiya are aiming

598
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,720
to perfect one cake mix for three tiers.

599
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,600
But Ian's decided to make this final Showstopper even harder.

600
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,520
It's going to be no less than five cakes.

601
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,640
Five?! Five, I mean,

602
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,800
did you realise that you were bound to be doing more cakes

603
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,600
- than anybody else? But how about your timing? 
- You've got to finish them.

604
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,880
- Yes. 
- To get consistency,

605
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,440
are you making one batch which is going to fill all of them?

606
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,320
- Cos you're never going to fit all the mix in there. 
- No, exactly.

607
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,240
I'm doing two batches. I think it's slightly ridiculous.

608
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,960
Yes, a lot of carrot. It's Ian's Colossal Curvy Carrot Cake.

609
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,840
Ian's built his own stand for his Colossal Curvy Carrot Cake

610
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,800
and he's developed a unique decoration

611
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
to bring all five of his cakes together.

612
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,080
It's difficult to describe, almost like a waterfall

613
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,280
design of a giant carrot going all the way down...

614
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,480
So like a cascading...

615
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,160
- Cascading carrot. 
- ..liquid...carrot?

616
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,720
When you were foraging, as you often do in a hedgerow, did you eat

617
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,760
any weird mushrooms that may or may not have inspired this bake?

618
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,920
You've got to wonder, haven't you?

619
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,200
My daddy's done really well to get to the final.

620
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,200
The reason Ian entered was because I wanted to go to the tea party,

621
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,960
but I didn't really know that I'd have to give up my kitchen

622
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,920
and that he would be like a man possessed with this project.

623
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,000
The kitchen's become a laboratory,

624
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,120
so I just have to leave the kitchen to him,

625
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,680
then when he goes off for his baking weekends,

626
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,200
I blitz it and then a fresh week comes and he trashes it again.

627
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,320
Go!

628
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,440
He's a rock in our family. I'm very proud of him.

629
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,920
- BOTH: 
- Good luck, Daddy!

630
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,680
Ten sponges, it's a lot of sponge to bake,

631
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,000
but then also to cool and then to ice.

632
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,240
They want precision, don't they?

633
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,760
They keep banging on about precision.

634
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,560
Just trying to get a fairly even layer throughout the different tins.

635
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,280
I'm measuring out the cake batter by eye.

636
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,200
As long as it's sort of halfway, it should be OK.

637
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,400
Just trust my instincts and get on with it.

638
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,000
Just feel like I want to quickly do my maths.

639
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,640
Hang on, I'm just going to make sure I'm using all the right sized tins,

640
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,520
cos I had a few lying around.

641
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,160
Where's my ruler?

642
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,160
They just seem a little bit thinner than I was expecting.

643
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,440
Just check that I have worked out the areas of each one correctly.

644
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,120
I'm doing a lemon drizzle cake.

645
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,600
It's definitely one of our favourite classics at home,

646
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,520
so I decided I'm going to do a wedding cake.

647
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,920
- Ooh! 
- Who's getting married?

648
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,160
We went to Bangladesh to get married and they don't do cakes there

649
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,840
and if I'd got married in this country,

650
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,240
I'd have definitely had a cake.

651
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,000
Nadiya's triple-layered Big Fat British Wedding Cake

652
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,080
will feature jewels from her wedding day

653
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,840
and saris to complete a red, white and blue theme.

654
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,360
I'm going to fill the cake, slice them into three

655
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,760
and fill it with lemon curd and then lemon butter cream

656
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,400
and then I'm going to cover the whole cake with buttercream

657
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,800
- and cover it with fondant. 
- Where do these fit in?

658
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,840
- So I'm making my own fondant. 
- Out of marshmallows? 
- Yes. 
- Right.

659
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,080
So this cake is basically your way

660
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,760
of saying to your husband, "Will you marry me again?"

661
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,360
- Sort of? 
- Maybe!

662
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,360
I like lemon cakes,

663
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,000
I like chocolate cakes,

664
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,480
I like mud cake...

665
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,160
The last few weeks have been

666
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,200
absolutely chaotic in our house, actually.

667
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,600
Guys, can you come inside and set the table, please?

668
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,400
I've been feeling what Nadiya's been doing for the last ten years -

669
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,200
looking after the children, doing the school runs - and this is

670
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,600
definitely the first time she's gone away and done something for herself.

671
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,000
The initial few weeks, she was like, "I'm out, I'm going, I'm not going to make it."

672
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,800
I think, as the weeks progressed, she's thought,

673
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,480
"I can actually do this. I am good!"

674
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,560
I don't care what happens in the final - she's a winner.

675
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,240
She's a champion in our eyes.

676
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,160
Two more minutes.

677
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,680
Two more minutes, and then we'll...

678
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Did a bit of maths, then - didn't look right in the tins.

679
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,920
Too shallow. Not enough of it. Recalculated again.

680
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,400
Melting marshmallows.

681
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,920
They're monstrous marshmallows, they will take forever.

682
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,640
I knew it'd take me a long time to get this lot in the oven

683
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,920
and I knew I'd get the fear. And guess what? I do!

684
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,920
- Right. 
- I'm encouraged to see Tamal's still putting things in the oven, though, as well.

685
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,600
TIMER BUTTON BEEPS

686
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,240
Wow! I don't want shop-bought fondant in the final.

687
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,160
Marshmallow has all the ingredients that you need in a fondant,

688
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,360
so you add icing sugar till it becomes a pliable dough.

689
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,840
I'm a mum and I'm at home

690
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,680
and sometimes I don't want to faff around

691
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,560
and I've got marshmallows at home, I've got icing sugar at home,

692
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,360
"Let's just do it," and it saves money.

693
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,600
Two hours left in the final Showstopper.

694
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,480
Is that thunder?

695
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,120
Or did I just imagine it?

696
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,640
I've frozen my cakes because when you freeze them,

697
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,760
they're so much easier to slice.

698
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,880
Got a few pans constantly going

699
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,320
so I can keep going with what I want to do.

700
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,600
This is for the sauce on top,

701
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,840
so it's a mixture of date syrup, unsalted butter and cream.

702
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,240
Got three cakes in the oven, a pan of toffee cooking

703
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,560
and two pans of caramel going, as well.

704
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm not usually a big fan of the whole multitasking thing,

705
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,680
but I kind of need to be doing different things at the same time.

706
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,320
You see, when you cut it, it just cuts so much better.

707
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,120
So this is exactly the same again

708
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,520
and this is going to go in the other three cake tins.

709
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,160
Ya-ay...eee.

710
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,960
Yeah, that's fine. I'm happy with that.

711
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,920
I'm going to just microwave this for a second.

712
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,520
The consistency I want is something I can spread, so I think this

713
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,920
is just about there, because it'll thicken up a lot as it cools.

714
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,320
I don't want to put it into the freezer when it's still really hot.

715
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,120
But it will go in there soon, just to speed up the cooling.

716
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,240
Ian miscalculated his first batch of cakes...

717
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,200
..and there's something not quite right about his second.

718
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,600
I forgot to put the oranges in with the mixture.

719
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,160
Um... So I guess it's better to discover these things now

720
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,840
rather than after it's gone in the oven, but still.

721
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,440
It's just another delay in getting them in the oven.

722
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,640
Outside the tent, the rain has stopped in time for the arrival

723
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,760
of the finalists' friends and family.

724
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,920
And a few familiar faces.

725
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,240
It is so weird being back!

726
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,920
It's amazing!

727
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,280
I don't know, I thought I would enjoy it a bit more watching,

728
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,240
but it's just made me really nervous!

729
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,200
I came here and I said, "Why am I not there?!"

730
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,480
SHE LAUGHS

731
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,080
Yeah, I would like to be in that tent, but I'm not.

732
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,680
What can you do, isn't that life?

733
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,760
I'm so pleased that's not me.

734
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,800
Or I'd have been stood on my head or doing something on the floor,

735
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,000
or tap dancing or singing or something.

736
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,800
Have I got a favourite? Nadiya.

737
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,960
I'd like to see Tamal do it, I think. Yeah, he's a cool guy.

738
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,280
Do I actually have to say?

739
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,240
My money might be on Ian because he's very different.

740
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,600
Who's family are near?!

741
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,360
All right.

742
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,920
I think...Nadiya will win.

743
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,960
So all the cakes are done. It HAS stopped raining.

744
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,000
Um... Caramel!

745
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,680
The change in weather...

746
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,000
may just have handed Tamal an advantage.

747
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,480
I wouldn't want to be doing this and thinking,

748
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,120
"I've not tested myself, I've not tried new skills."

749
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,600
Sugar work is something that I really didn't have much

750
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,640
confidence on before all this started.

751
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,160
- A lot of sugar work, Tamal. 
- Yep.

752
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,840
- Are you nearly there? 
- Cooling is the issue, now.

753
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,680
Happy, Nadiya?

754
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,480
Yeah.

755
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,080
Yeah.

756
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,880
Happy, Paul?!

757
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,240
HE LAUGHS

758
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,880
I forgot to take the cream cheese out of the fridge earlier.

759
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,800
It's supposed to be at room temperature. Spread it out a bit...

760
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,360
I said I'd make some, and it's here.

761
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,040
It's going to be tight.

762
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,240
I'm now going to make...

763
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,040
some flowers.

764
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,240
I've got to make three large ones, six medium ones and lots

765
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,960
and lots of small ones.

766
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,760
I'm trying to do as much as I can given the time restraints.

767
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,120
Bakers, we've called time on the drizzle outside,

768
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,560
the drizzle inside's got one hour left.

769
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,040
One hour, on your classic bakes.

770
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,320
These very, very last cakes.

771
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,440
- Oh, no! 
- CLATTERING

772
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,640
Left it in a bit too long! It's gone...

773
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,880
Well, at least we know it sets.

774
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,920
Oh!

775
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,120
I didn't think I was making it difficult for myself.

776
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,960
As usual, I've... Sorry.

777
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,160
How long have we got?

778
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,040
Bakers, half an hour till your personal show is stopped.

779
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,320
OK.

780
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,720
It's getting there. It's softening up a bit.

781
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,080
I just want to fill the cakes and get on with the spun sugar.

782
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,240
Which reminds me...

783
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,440
Ah! Froze my finger.

784
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,400
It's OK. We don't need fingers after this, anyway(!)

785
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,840
Ian, hurry up!

786
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,120
- Now is not the time for calmness. 
- I know. It's not.

787
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,240
Now is not the time for anything Zen.

788
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,120
- You're going to have to motor now, my love. Do you do motoring? 
- Mmmm...

789
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,880
- No? 
- Not really, but...

790
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,720
- How long have we got? 
- Bakers, three minutes.

791
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,600
Oh, Ian did actually run, then.

792
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,720
Hurry up!

793
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,960
Finished!

794
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,000
Ladies and gentlemen...

795
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,320
Bake Off 2015 is over. Whoo!

796
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,640
SCATTERED APPLAUSE

797
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,520
- Group hug, guys. 
- Well done. 
- We did it.

798
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,760
- I'm going to do a you and start crying! 
- Don't cry! 
- Don't cry!

799
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,640
I feel emotional.

800
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,120
Even Tamal, he was starting to crack at the end then

801
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,120
and he's meant to be the strong one amongst us!

802
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,480
I just, um...

803
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,680
There was a lot riding on today for me.

804
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,640
I have tried so, so hard to get everything per...

805
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,000
SO hard, to get everything perfect.

806
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,840
I had a tear in my eye as I walked out of the tent,

807
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,960
thinking, "I'm not going to ever do that again."

808
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,960
Yeah, I've been through a lot. Put a lot into this.

809
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,880
A lot on this apron, bit more to go on it, yet.

810
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,880
Yeah, no, I've gone and given it my all.

811
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,760
Nadiya, do you want a hand bringing up your Showstopper?

812
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,920
- Got it? 
- Yes, careful, careful, careful.

813
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,320
Thank you.

814
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:24,080
- It does look spectacular. 
- It's very smooth, it looks very elegant.

815
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,840
I think the flowers are very delicate, they've been well made.

816
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,000
Each one of those is beautiful. I'll take a slice out of each one.

817
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,600
What we're keen on trying, though, is getting

818
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,960
the texture of the lemon drizzle inside the same on each layer.

819
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,520
Those look a very even bake, all of them.

820
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,480
Even judging it with your finger when you're pressing the texture,

821
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,000
it's exactly the same on each one.

822
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,640
The lemon comes through beautifully through every layer.

823
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,800
The texture of the fondant is perfect,

824
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,480
your method with marshmallows is new to me and I think it's very good!

825
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,000
Now, Nadiya.

826
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,400
That's stunning.

827
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,920
The actual fondant on the outside is beautiful, it's marshmallowy,

828
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,840
and that with the whole cake itself is delicious, really good.

829
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,520
If this was your wedding cake, I think your husband's outside,

830
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,880
you're going to have to take him

831
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,160
- a whole tier a bit later on. 
- I might have to!

832
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,800
Tamal, if the abandoned Chinese fishing village can't come to

833
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,680
the table, I will give it a hand!

834
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,600
It looks spectacular.

835
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,280
It is breathtaking.

836
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,880
I don't quite understand how it all comes together...!

837
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,800
But I think you've done brilliantly!

838
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,640
It's a really muggy day

839
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,920
and the one thing spun sugar doesn't like is moisture.

840
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,240
This is quite tricky to do. To do a web, to link up the three,

841
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,680
I think is ingenious.

842
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,360
The idea of turning a sticky toffee pudding into a cake was

843
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,840
always going to be a tricky one.

844
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,960
A sticky toffee pudding is normally quite close textured.

845
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,480
The fruit looks quite evenly distributed, which is good.

846
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,360
Do you know, that really...

847
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,480
I didn't really know what to expect at all.

848
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,840
I was expecting to make rude remarks about it being a pudding

849
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,000
and not a cake. It's a BEAUTIFUL cake,

850
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,640
a wonderful filling with delicious icing on the top here.

851
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,320
I think you've done exceedingly well.

852
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,240
It's totally different.

853
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,640
The taste of the toffee almost replaces the custard.

854
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,360
One thing I was really worried about this was, was that going

855
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,200
to bake inside with the amount of fruit in there? And it's baked.

856
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,840
This works.

857
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,560
And for once, you've managed to do it on the time, as well, which is...

858
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,920
- What a time to do it! 
- Thank you! Thank you so much.

859
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,400
- Well done! 
- Thank you!

860
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,640
Ian, last but not least.

861
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,760
What a construction!

862
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,280
The thought of making five. You did make work for yourself!

863
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,040
The fact that you joined it all together with one massive

864
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,040
iced carrot down the middle is very clever. The icing is good.

865
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,320
- It's a very classic looking carrot cake. 
- Sensibly, you've gone simple,

866
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:07,360
so we're expecting something magnificent inside.

867
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:11,360
You seem fairly consistent with your mixture. They're beautifully even.

868
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,200
That's one of the best carrot cakes I've ever had.

869
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,200
And you could pick any one of them.

870
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,120
The flavour that comes through the bake is delicious,

871
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,080
the texture that comes through with the nuts, it's beautiful.

872
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,120
The sensation you get as well, with the spices,

873
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,560
gives a little bit of warmth to it. The icing is delicious, it's cool.

874
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,440
And every one of them are exactly the same.

875
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,720
Would I have thought of putting star anise in a carrot cake?

876
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:53,880
No, I wouldn't. The orange is in chunky pieces and I like it.

877
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,040
It is a different carrot cake.

878
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,520
Flavours, textures, the look - spot-on.

879
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,480
Thank you.

880
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,120
- SHE EXHALES 
- It's over.

881
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,480
It's all done.

882
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,200
TAMAL EXHALES

883
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,880
HE SIGHS

884
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,800
WHOOPING AND APPLAUSE

885
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,920
As Tamal, Nadiya and Ian join their friends and family,

886
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,320
Mary and Paul have a decision to make.

887
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,000
Paul, you said that was one of the best carrot cakes

888
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,440
you'd ever experienced.

889
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,880
Yeah, perfectly baked.

890
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,320
The depth of the flavours, stunning.

891
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,440
That is the best carrot cake

892
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,480
and who'd have thought the sticky toffee pudding cake...

893
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,760
That is stunning.

894
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,000
But what a clever man - he took a classic pudding

895
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,480
and a classic fruit cake and made them into a new classic.

896
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,720
Yeah, and this was obviously an emotional journey for Nadiya.

897
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,400
She's made her own wedding cake and it tastes amazing.

898
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,280
Is it fair to say we've never experienced

899
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,880
such incredible-tasting bakes?

900
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,040
- Incredible. All best of their type. 
- Do you think it's close?

901
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,880
- Do you know what? I think it is. 
- It must be.

902
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,680
Are you in agreement? Do you know yet?

903
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,480
- I think we will be. 
- Well, if you haven't,

904
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,880
we have prepared the mud pits, so you can wrestle it out

905
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,760
- in the time-honoured Bake Off way. 
- As you did in series one. 
- Yeah.

906
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,320
- OK. 
- Please wear the thong, Paul.

907
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,480
WHOOPING AND APPLAUSE

908
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,080
Lovely finalists, if you'd care to step up, my loves.

909
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,520
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

910
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,960
I sincerely hope that the three of you

911
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,480
are feeling incredibly proud of yourselves,

912
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,280
because you have given us the most extraordinary bakes

913
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:57,640
over the last ten weeks. Of course, there can only be one single winner,

914
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,640
and so, with real pleasure,

915
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,440
the winner...

916
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,400
of the 2015 Great British Bake Off

917
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,440
is...

918
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,720
..Nadiya.

919
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

920
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,840
There has to be a mistake!

921
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,120
- Well done, Nadiya. 
- Thank you so much!

922
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,800

PAUL CHUCKLES

924
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,120
You've got this.

925
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,680
CHEERING

926
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,720
SHE WEEPS

927
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,040
Nadiya has brought something special to the Bake Off.

928
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,520
Her ideas, her flair, her emotion,

929
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,760
her passion were all in her bakes.

930
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,640
She just nailed the whole final

931
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,480
and that was the best-tasting final we've ever had.

932
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,720
I feel really pleased. Nadiya had a pretty flawless weekend.

933
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,560
Totally the deserved winner.

934
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,160
Yeah, I'm so pleased to have got this far, really pleased.

935
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,800
Yeah, it's a huge honour.

936
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,760
I think I'm going to come round to your house

937
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,320
at some point in the next few weeks

938
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,320
and we're going to have dinner together, yeah?

939
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,640
OK. Your mummy's promised me.

940
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,560
Baking with a group of people you get on with so well,

941
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,640
you really feel proud for them when they do well.

942
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,320
It's just... Yeah, it's just amazing.

943
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,560
She's going to be insufferable now, though.

944
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,400
She'll never shut up about it.

945
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,240
She's never been the winner before, has she?

946
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,160
- She is now, though. 
- She is now.

947
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,280
I am never, ever going to put boundaries on myself ever again.

948
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,800
I'm never going to say, "I can't do it."

949
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,440
I'm never going to say, "Maybe."

950
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,000
I'm never going to say, "I don't think I can."

951
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,040
I can and I will.

952
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:39,200
I'm really proud of Nadiya. So not confident to start with

953
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,960
and over the weeks, she's grown and grown

954
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,480
and learned herself that she can do it

955
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,520
and when she came into the final today,

956
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,760
she was nervous, but she had a sort of look that,

957
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,240
"I'm going to do it," and she did.

958
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,200
Sheer perfection.

959
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,320
- VOICE BREAKING: 
- And I enjoyed every minute.

960
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,560
SHE GIGGLES

961
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,440
Well done.

962
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,640
I'm so proud of you.

963
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,840
You're amazing, you are.
