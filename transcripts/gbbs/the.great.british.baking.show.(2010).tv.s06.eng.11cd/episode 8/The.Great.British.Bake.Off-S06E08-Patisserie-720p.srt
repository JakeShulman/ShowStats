1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,960
- That cloud's shaped like a bagel. 
- That one's like a Schichttorte.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,760
- There's a baguette. 
- Couple of cobs. 
- Mate, we're obsessed.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,480
- Welcome... BOTH: 
- To The Great British Bake Off.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,640
- BOTH: 
- Brioche.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,200
Last time, a tennis cake tantrum...

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,040
..and a cracked Charlotte Russe...

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,960
- It's split. 
- Split, is it?

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,680
..meant a fond farewell to Mat.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,120
Ohh! I'm going to miss you.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,360
- But Tamal's game-changing game pie... 
- Really well done.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,920
Oh, the handshake!

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,760
..and barnstorming Bavarois made him a first-time Star Baker.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,440
Now, it's the quarterfinal...

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,920
I can only taste fear in my mouth right now.

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,040
- ..and only five bakers remain. 
- I feel like we're a herd of gazelles.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,040
Mary and Paul are the lions. And they're hungry - for bakers!

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,080
To survive the cull,

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,320
they'll have to give it their all in the Signature...

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,200
Ahhh!

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,440
..strive for Technical perfection...

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,000
I did actually see this in Mary Berry's recipe book.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,920
I thought, well, I'm not going to make that - that's really fiddly!

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,640
..and build a Showstopper of a choux pastry tower.

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,760
Ow!

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,640
- Who will stand strong? 
- I think you've done a cracking job on that.

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,840
And who will topple under the pressure?

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,040
Oh, I'm too nervous for construction!

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,080
- I've got a real treat for you. 
- Oh, great!

29
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,600
- Tasty, beautiful, unmistakably French. 
- Is it Thierry Henri?

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,200
No! He's still safe in my basement.

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,160
- No, it's Patisserie Week. 
- Oh.

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,520
Star Baker, that felt pretty good,

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,040
but we're back again and the nerves are back.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,560
Quarterfinals - big deal! Yeah.

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,640
Anything with the word final in it

36
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,320
is a bit daunting, isn't it?

37
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,720
Five of us left. There's a lot less places to hide

38
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,960
now and a lot less room for error.

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,600
I feel very fallible, oh, yeah.

40
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,480
I think it's all or nothing, now.

41
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,600
You have to deliver or you're out.

42
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,680
Good morning, bakers.

43
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,120
The following Signature Challenge has been assessed

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,840
by the double entendre police and I'm delighted to inform you

45
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,560
that this morning, Paul and Mary would love you to make cream horns.

46
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,280
And there's nothing fun to say about that whatsoever.

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,360
A cream horn is very simply a spiral of pastry

48
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,800
with some cream in the middle.

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,760
Mary and Paul would like you to make two different flavours,

50
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,320
12 of each flavour,

51
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,480
equalling 24 horns in total.

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,440
You can use rough, puff or flaky pastry.

53
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,800
You've got three and a half hours, bakers - on your marks...

54
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,440
- Horn away. 
- BOTH: 
- Bake.

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,200
I feel like I'm getting flashbacks from all of last week.

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,440
I, um... I have to get some puff pastry out, whatever kind it is!

57
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,120
Compared to the vol-au-vents, these cream horns are relatively easy.

58
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,120
You know, there's not much that can go wrong with them.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,960
- PAUL: 
- I actually think a cream horn is quite difficult to do.

60
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,640
I prefer to go down the full puff pastry route, and that'll create

61
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,200
great layers of dough, butter, dough, butter, dough,

62
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,640
so when you bake it,

63
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,160
the moisture from the butter infuses into the dough, it pulls away

64
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,120
to create steam and that's where you get the flakes in the puff pastry.

65
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,320
It's very important that you fill the horn right to the bottom

66
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,320
so that you enjoy it to the last mouthful.

67
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,280
To get perfect ones, it does need great skill.

68
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,640
I'm making rough puff pastry.

69
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,960
It's very tasty, you still get that buttery texture

70
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,400
and lightness of the puff pastry,

71
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,080
it's just a quicker method of doing it.

72
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,240
Kind of as the name suggests, you just roughly throw it together.

73
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,600
The rough puff, it controls the shape a little bit better.

74
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
That's the only reason why I chose it.

75
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,080
Flora is... She's doing full puff pastry.

76
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,520
She's quite clever like that.

77
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,920
You haven't seen it yet, Ian.

78
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,960
You really haven't seen it yet!

79
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,320
Flora's not alone in opting to make full puff.

80
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,800
- Good morning, Tamal. 
- Hiya. 
- Your puff pastry,

81
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,000
what're you doing for that one - rough puff or full?

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,120
- I'm doing full puff. 
- What flours are you using?

83
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,400
- Just using plain flour. 
- JUST plain? 
- Yes.

84
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,480
- What would you have done, Paul? 
- Mixed it with strong. 
- OK.

85
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,320
It's worked out all right for me.

86
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,360
Tamal's use of plain flour may not have impressed Paul,

87
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,120
but he's hoping his fillings of lime mascarpone

88
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,160
and malt and honeycomb cream will deliver on taste.

89
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,920
It'll be good to see what yours turn out like.

90
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,280
You're getting him full of confidence.

91
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,920
We all have our preferences.

92
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,160
Stop, listen - just...

93
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,800
- Eyes down. 
- Block it out.

94
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,800
You're like a racehorse - blinkers. Yeah?

95
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,920
Ian is not content with doing one flavour of rough puff -

96
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,560
he's making two.

97
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,720
Apparently, using cocoa and pastry, things can go wrong.

98
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,240
I don't know what those problems are.

99
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,720
I've cooked this a couple of times at home now and it's been fine.

100
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,040
Inspired by classic cake flavours,

101
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,800
Ian's creating a Mont Blanc horn with a chestnut cream filling

102
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,200
and a Black Forest Gateau horn containing cherries

103
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,040
and kirsch, a kind of fruit brandy.

104
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,840
The Black Forest Gateau one, it's going to be sort of stripy,

105
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,240
both normal and chocolate.

106
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,920
- Did you find it was more subdued, the chocolate one? For rise? 
- Um...

107
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,720
- It seemed to be about the same. 
- OK.

108
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,320
I am going to put this in the fridge for 15 minutes.

109
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,280
I'm just starting my lemon curd. I'm just conscious I need to get on with

110
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,680
as much stuff in between doing the laminations of the dough as possible.

111
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,680
One of them is coffee and vanilla swirl

112
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,880
and the other one is a brulee banana mixed in with the cream.

113
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,680
- Bananas and custard... 
- Go lovely! 
- It's just... 
- Heaven!

114
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,160
That was like a big treat for me on a Sunday.

115
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,800
The flavours are going to be perfect.

116
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,000
Paul's bananas seem to have the seal of approval.

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,400
He's confident his coffee creme pat horn will also be a winner.

118
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,640
Anything that you think could go wrong?

119
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,200
Maybe the consistency of the creme patisserie -

120
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,800
I need a lot more firmer to pipe,

121
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,640
because I'll pipe them as a swirl.

122
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,760
How are you going to obtain a thicker creme pat?

123
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,960
- I've added a bit more cornstarch and put a bit more egg yolk in it. 
- OK.

124
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,680
Nice banana-coloured shirt, as well, Paul. You look good.

125
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,040
It's all in the mix.

126
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,840
Paul is using classic, tried-and-tested flavours.

127
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,920
As ever, Flora is going a little more avant-garde.

128
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,240
I am making peach, lemon and thyme cream horns and butterscotch

129
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,000
- and smoked almond. 
- You've chosen unusual flavours, haven't you?

130
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,720
Flora is also getting arty with her toppings,

131
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,960
which include caramel wafers and tuile cigars.

132
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,800
I'm going for the ice cream look,

133
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,360
- so they'll all sit upright on top. 
- Oh, right.

134
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,880
I used ice cream cones covered in tinfoil at home.

135
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,600
- When Madonna makes cream horns, she simply uses her bra. 
- Why not?

136
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,160
- If you've got one of those conical bras... 
- You go for it.

137
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,040
'Flora's not the only one taking a risk with her flavours.'

138
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,560
So I'm doing rose, pistachio and white chocolate cream horns.

139
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,360
It's interesting. It's such a dangerous flavour, rose.

140
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,760
You can overdo it so easily.

141
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,120
Nadiya's hoping that rose syrup mixed with mascarpone and whipped cream

142
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,680
will provide the perfect balance for her floral-flavoured horn.

143
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,480
I don't want to do another week and not produce pastry.

144
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,640
It would be nice to have some puff pastry.

145
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,040
- Now, if things DO go wrong, don't lose your rag. 
- No.

146
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,400
- Bear with it and just show us what you've got. 
- (Quarterfinal, Nadiya.)

147
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,760
- It is. 
- No pressure. 
- No pressure at all. Thank you.

148
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,440
It's weird how quiet it is.

149
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,000
I feel like we're a herd of gazelles that's being

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,080
picked off one by one by lions.

151
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,200
Mary and Paul are the lions.

152
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,840
And they're hungry - for bakers!

153
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,520
It's important not to overwork the pastry.

154
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,000
So I'm doing four turns in my pastry.

155
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,760
Doing too many turns will weigh down the layers,

156
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,320
resulting in a closer texture and create a dense pastry.

157
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,920
So I think I'm going to try and do six, maybe nine.

158
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,760
Paul was saying he would have used a bit of strong flour,

159
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,000
because it holds its shape a bit better.

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,120
But I'm not having any breakages so far,

161
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,840
so I think mine is working OK.

162
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,640
Starting is the pain.

163
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,360
No, no, no, no, no.

164
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,560
The bakers must get the correct amount of overlap

165
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,160
on their pastry spirals.

166
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,520
Too much, and the pastry will be thick and won't cook through.

167
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,400
Not enough and the horns will separate when baked.

168
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,760
The biggest problem is inconsistency between them -

169
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,400
I roll them up on the cones, they all look identical, to the point

170
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,000
where I was taking pictures of them before they go in the oven.

171
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,480
They come out and they look like they're different sizes,

172
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,520
some have unravelled, some haven't...

173
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,680
Which is really frustrating.

174
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,280
Flora has decided not to shape her horns.

175
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,200
Instead, she's preparing a wafer dough for her tuile decorations.

176
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,360
I just thought I'd get the tuiles done first.

177
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm trying to do as many toppings

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,080
that looked like ice cream as possible.

179
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,160
I'm hunting for the perfect almond.

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,840
We're getting there. Finally a few really lovely flaked almonds.

181
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,720
I am a bit concerned, just because I'm just watching everybody

182
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,480
do what we're supposed to be doing,

183
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,080
ie cream horns and I don't want to start doing the pastry when I've

184
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,000
still got these in the oven, because they'll just go over instantly.

185
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,320
One tiny little tray of flaked almonds(!)

186
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,920
One, two, three, four, five, six,

187
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,880
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Fine.

188
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,920
Whether rough or full puff, the pastry must be kept cold.

189
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,840
If not, the butter will melt and it won't produce its classic flake.

190
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,600
- What's going on here, what're you making? 
- Some tuile cigars.

191
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,040
You know the bit when we asked you to do the Challenge?

192
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,960
The Challenge bit, the main bit? Like, the THING, the horn bit.

193
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,240
- The cream horns? 
- Have you started that? 
- Yes.

194
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,360
My pastry's ready, I just need to shape it, which...

195
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,080
You could shape that instead of shaping the cigars.

196
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,440
I could, couldn't I?

197
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,080
I didn't do that and I'm not quite sure why at this moment in time.

198
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,040
I've just put the cream horns in for 12 minutes.

199
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,360
I will only really know when they bake whether they are OK.

200
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,760
They are leaking a little bit.

201
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,560
I am panicking a little bit.

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,280
Paul said don't lose your rag, so that's what I'm going to do.

203
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,200
I'm going to not lose my rag.

204
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,480
You have one hour on your rough puff pastry protuberances.

205
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,200
They're puffing up. They look OK.

206
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,960
A little bit of butter always melts from the puff pastry anyway.

207
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,080
They're not...perfect.

208
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,880
Once the cream's in it, it'll hold them together.

209
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,360
- Cream horns! 
- Are we horns up, Nadiya? 
- Is that what we're doing?

210
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,600
We're horns up.

211
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,040
They look all right.

212
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,840
With 24 horns to make, they're being baked in batches.

213
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,320
I'll just get these in.

214
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,000
A bit behind scheduling, it's probably fair to say.

215
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,560
Really thick creme pat.

216
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,280
That's what I'm looking for and it'll cool down

217
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,920
and thicken up more in the fridge.

218
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,720
Not exactly a perfect creation, unfortunately.

219
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,920
I'm not using the rose water, I'm just using rose syrup.

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,880
I don't want them to be too strong.

221
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,320
OK, bakers - just 15 minutes till you give Paul the horn.

222
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,760
So let's say you've got...

223
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,360
30 seconds per horn?

224
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,840
- Yeah. 
- For fill-age.

225
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,480
- Is that going to be all right? 
- That'll have to be, won't it?

226
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,560
- Still one set in. 
- They need to cool. 
- Got to get out and cool them, yeah.

227
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,600
They look like a right dog's dinner.

228
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,080
I've probably made about 200 cream horns.

229
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,600
If you ask me, do I like cream horns...

230
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,560
..I will tell you no.

231
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,680
We're going to have a little bit of kirsch in there.

232
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,080
No, I can only taste fear in my mouth right now!

233
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,800
Just a bit more kirsch.

234
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,040
It's maybe not quite as set. It was given another two hours.

235
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,600
Ahhh!

236
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,320
It's thick, all right.

237
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,840
I think I just need to accept that they may not be perfect.

238
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,200
Oh, no!

239
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,040
I think I'm going to freeze this, just to stop them...

240
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,440
Ah!

241
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,880
I need another freezer.

242
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,080
Ah!

243
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,440
- Paul? Are you needing it? 
- No. Go, go.

244
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,600
- Ian, are you all right, mate? 
- No!

245
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,320
OK, bakers - mourn the horn, in a minute, it's gawn! One minute.

246
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,960
OK, bakers - that's it, time's up.

247
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,240
Please move your horns to the ends of your benches.

248
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,120
Paul and Mary are expecting 24 perfectly baked cream horns,

249
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,400
with a filling that reaches all the way down to the bottom.

250
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,200
I think they look very, very good.

251
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,160
They're all the same size, you've finished them nicely.

252
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,480
- Which pastry did you use? 
- I used a rough puff.

253
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,840
Start on the top one, which is the rose.

254
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,240
Nice flake.

255
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,160
It's nicely baked all the way through -

256
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,120
you can see all the layers in it, as well.

257
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,200
To get that flake on the rough puff pastry - excellent.

258
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,360
You've got the mixture right down to the bottom, and that's tricky.

259
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,680
Beautiful, buttery pastry, with that hint of rose inside, as well -

260
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,360
which works, but it's quite delicate.

261
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,840
This is the mocha, isn't it?

262
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,880
That is, yeah.

263
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,160
The flavour is quite something. It's a cracker, well done.

264
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,560
It's an exemplary horn.

265
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,520
You've got the actual twisting of the pastry so even on every single one.

266
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,680
- Mm. 
- The pastry looks baked, the filling looks attractive.

267
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,400
I'm dying to taste it, really.

268
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,000
I think I will try it with the banana one first.

269
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,280
- Pastry's good. 
- The banana's not strong enough!

270
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,520
- Really? 
- No!

271
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,320
Angry baby Paul.

272
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,320
It's so light - it needs to be pungent, you know?

273
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,600
Real kick to it.

274
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,640
Quite annoying.

275
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,480
- I really wanted that banana and custard thing, you know? 
- Oh, right.

276
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,200
So, what's in here? Creme patissiere.

277
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,960
Creme patisserie, and it's coffee and vanilla.

278
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,440
Where is it?

279
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,080
No filling in the bottom of that one.

280
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,680
- Did you pipe that in? 
- I did, yeah.

281
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,840
You didn't need to thicken it up as much as that.

282
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,320
Better have a banana for lunch.

283
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,520
You've built me up, then, Paul, and just kicked me back.

284
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,080
They're very difficult to do with a full puff.

285
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,680
You can see this is puff pastry.

286
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,120
You've managed to get that flakiness without strong flour.

287
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,240
They're a beautiful even colour, and that's good.

288
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,120
- So, this is the lime and mascarpone. 
- Yep.

289
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,200
You can see all the layers of the puff pastry going down -

290
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,440
and crispy.

291
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,200
Not too complicated, and a good flavour.

292
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,120
I can taste the malt.

293
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,880
Very unusual to choose these, and they go.

294
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,480
I think you've done a cracking job on that.

295
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,520
Really have.

296
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,240
There is an issue at the bottom, where it's been pouring out.

297
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,760
I think they're great fun.

298
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,320
It's a very nice idea to stand them all up,

299
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,960
but it hasn't done you any good.

300
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,320
We'll start with the peach.

301
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,760
Which pastry did you choose?

302
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,000
I did full puff.

303
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,120
It's not flaky enough. It's almost shortcrust-like.

304
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,240
- Do you understand? 
- I rolled it really fine.

305
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,400
I thought that was what I was supposed to do!

306
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,560
Could do with a little bit more peach - or have I missed it?

307
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,200
I'm going to pinch over here.

308
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,120
That's absolutely delicious, but it's run straight to the bottom.

309
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,200
I think you attempt too many things.

310
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,760
One should remember, it's cream horns,

311
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,680
- and not spend too much time on the extras. 
- Sorry.

312
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,320
You were being very ambitious -

313
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,680
but very difficult to get two different pastries two bind.

314
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,320
The plain rough puff and the chocolate just haven't bonded.

315
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,200
There's lots of issues with the chocolate.

316
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,280
Right, we'll take one, a decent one.

317
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,520
This is not cutting through like crisp pastry.

318
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,640
That's raw inside,

319
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,680
and the chocolate one looks quite raw, as well.

320
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,880
Yeah.

321
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,720
- The cherry liqueur... 
- Yeah, mm-hm.

322
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,960
- Far too much. It dominates everything. 
- Mm.

323
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,440
The flavour is strong.

324
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,680
- FLORA: 
- I'm completely gutted.

325
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,880
You can't make rookie mistakes in the quarterfinal.

326
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,200
Tick.

327
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,040
I really needed to get some pastry out.

328
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,520
I'm so pleased, I can't tell you how pleased I am

329
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,360
to have been able to do that today.

330
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,720
The pastry was much more tricky than I thought it would be.

331
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,440
I really got it wrong.

332
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,200
The work of a patissiere, or pastry chef,

333
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,960
is seen by many to be the pinnacle of the baking profession -

334
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,720
and yet, some of their delicacies have extremely humble origins.

335
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,720
In late 18th-century France in the city of Nancy,

336
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,600
a group of nuns sought to profit from their patisserie prowess

337
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,840
by selling small almond biscuits known as macarons.

338
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
They were dubbed the Macaron Sisters,

339
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
and their bakes became legendary.

340
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,640
Patissiere Nicolas Genot makes his macarons

341
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,080
to the nuns' original recipe.

342
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,000
This is the first time in 30 years

343
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,680
that I'm actually going to use my modern languages degree.

344
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,800
Please don't judge me - ne me jugez pas.

345
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,920
IN FRENCH:

346
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,800
The exact formula for the nuns' recipe is a closely-guarded secret,

347
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,120
and Nicolas is the only baker on the planet who knows it.

348
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,360
The macarons' popularity grew,

349
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,600
and in 1930, an enterprising Parisian baker named Pierre Desfontaines

350
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,120
spotted their potential.

351
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,400
Smothering the bottom biscuit in glorious ganache, he then took...

352
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
SHE GASPS ..another biscuit,

353
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,400
added it on top, double-decker stylee,

354
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,480
and there, the filled macaron as we know and love it,

355
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,760
was born.

356
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,480
Sounds like my kind of baker.

357
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,840
Mm!

358
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,520
Bit too small, though.

359
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,440
I think we might need just to try another one.

360
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,440
For Patisserie Week's Technical Challenge,

361
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,400
the bakers will have to tackle another French classic.

362
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,520
Quarterfinalists, what lies beneath the gingham?

363
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,680
As usual, Mary and Paul, you won't be in the tent for this little bit.

364
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,640
It is one of Mary's recipes, however - Mary, any pearls of wisdom?

365
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,840
They should be sheer perfection.

366
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,240
The sort of thing that you would find in a patisserie window.

367
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,720
MEL: Off you go, Mary and Paul.

368
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,400
See you in a little while.

369
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:16,200
So, we would like you to make nine identical mokatines, OK?

370
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,200
These are delicate squares of sponge,

371
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,160
and they're covered in buttercream and a coffee icing.

372
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,680
- You know, mokatines. You've got two hours. 
- Thank you.

373
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,040
- On your marks... 
- Get set...

374
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,360
- BOTH: 
- ..and bake!

375
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,720
What?!

376
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,080
The bakers have been given just the ingredients,

377
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,080
and a pared-down version of the recipe.

378
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,800
I did actually see this in Mary Berry's recipe book.

379
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,000
Did I read it? No.

380
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,920
I thought, "Well, I'm not going to make that. That's really fiddly."

381
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,960
Didn't read it.

382
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,560
No, I haven't heard of mokatines before, no.

383
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,680
So, a bit at a loss with this, really.

384
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,360
First of all, they've got to make a true genoise,

385
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,600
and the raising agents are purely the eggs, that are whisked.

386
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,480
Got buttercream in the middle, hasn't it?

387
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,080
- So, if I cut this down there... 
- It has.

388
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,520
..each layer's exactly the same.

389
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,360
It's all about precision.

390
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,800
The fondant icing has got to be just the right consistency

391
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,400
to make a pool in the middle.

392
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,480
Too much, it'll run down the side.

393
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,840
Too little and it won't reach the edges.

394
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,080
I think we've brought the patisserie into the Bake Off tent,

395
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,800
and I think that's a great challenge.

396
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,680
Let's hope that they do something as perfect as those.

397
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,720
So, the first line is, make a genoise sponge.

398
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,960
Helpful(!)

399
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,400
The genoise is a light, delicate sponge that's tricky to get right,

400
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,240
as it contains no chemical raising agent.

401
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,880
So, the rise in it comes from whisking the eggs and the sugar

402
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,000
until they've increased in volume.

403
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,240
No, I haven't made genoise before, actually.

404
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,120
That's one thing I haven't made.

405
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,040
Should have done, but I haven't.

406
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,080
So whipping up the eggs, putting some air into it.

407
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,120
Hopefully that's how it's meant to be done,

408
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,440
but, again, I'm not too sure.

409
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,640
I made a genoise last week.

410
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,720
So I know how to make a genoise sponge.

411
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,240
It's really important to get the egg really light.

412
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,600
Really not too sure.

413
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,360
It is a bit of guesswork on this, really.

414
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,840
I don't think this is going to go well for me, I think.

415
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,440
I don't feel like I'm very good at making cake.

416
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,360
It's like - well, that's a bit of a fundamental flaw, I would say,

417
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,880
but, you know - somehow I've managed to get away with it so far.

418
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
You do the number eight in the eggs,

419
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,280
and then if it sits there for more than three seconds then it's ready.

420
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,560
Really don't know what I'm doing here.

421
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,680
Everyone seems to be warming their butter up.

422
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,560
Of all the sponges not to have made, it would be genoise, wouldn't it?

423
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,680
I'm just folding the flour into my eggs,

424
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,080
and trying not to lose too much of the air.

425
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,760
I'm just going to make a sponge -

426
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,920
I mean, whether it's the right one, I really don't know.

427
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,760
I think that's OK.

428
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,280
Completely wrong. I know it is.

429
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,920
Cos it's not proper genoise.

430
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,160
They've not specified a baking time. Predictable of them.

431
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,600
I think it's going to need a good half an hour, at least.

432
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,560
Good - so, hopefully nothing goes wrong with the sponge.

433
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,040
Definitely going to jinx it with that, aren't I?

434
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,720
The heat from the oven will cause the air in the cake mix to expand,

435
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,880
giving the genoise its rise.

436
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,640
Just bake at 160 degrees.

437
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,600
If the bakers haven't incorporated enough air,

438
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,840
their sponge won't get the perfect height that Mary's looking for.

439
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,360
- A sponge is in. 
- Does it look genoise?

440
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,400
Er...

441
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,440
No.

442
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,040
No, it's going to be a sponge of some description,

443
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,320
but it's not going to be what I want it to be,

444
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,880
which is gutting. But never mind.

445
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,040
You never know.

446
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,480
We've had some pretty interesting turnarounds on Bake Off before,

447
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,240
and this might be one of them.

448
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,920
There's an hour and 20 minutes remaining.

449
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,680
It's a guessing game today.

450
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,000
A few minutes more.

451
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,400
I think that's OK.

452
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,760
Damn it, Ian, yours looks good.

453
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,000
Dare I say it,

454
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,920
I think I've cooked a cake.

455
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,400
I think it's all right.

456
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,280
Mine is looking not very good.

457
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,240
I'm glad it's getting lots of decoration and things on top,

458
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,840
to sort of neaten it up a bit.

459
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,080
Which is the nearest exit out of the room? That's what I'm thinking!

460
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,080
It's raw.

461
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,360
HE SIGHS

462
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,480
Don't know what I'm going to do.

463
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,760
Mary's mokatines require three different types of icing -

464
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,880
a fondant topping, a piped creme au beurre mocha

465
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,080
and a coffee buttercream for the centre.

466
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,600
Very light sponge - this is tough.

467
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,200
We'll do that again.

468
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,040
With an hour to go, Paul's having to make another cake from scratch.

469
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,600
Is it geno-easy? Or geno-difficult?

470
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,200
FLORA LAUGHS

471
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,560
- Very good strained laugh. 
- Good, strong.

472
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,120
IAN: I've been weighing out the icing,

473
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,120
making sure there's exactly the same amount in each square.

474
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,240
I'm going all out to win the Technical.

475
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,120
- TAMAL: 
- My sponge is so under-risen.

476
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,280
Maybe mine will go in the window of a French patisserie

477
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,800
that's maybe a bit down on its luck -

478
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,000
they've been through some tough times, but...

479
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,280
plucky little guys, they keep on going.

480
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,280
- So, the other one's in? 
- The other one's in, it's...

481
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,800
- At this stage of the game, it's very difficult. 
- It is, yeah.

482
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,440
Sometimes the Technical Challenges

483
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,560
do just say really glib things like "make a cake".

484
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,840
I've always said, it's one of those - you mess it up,

485
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,080
it's so close to the end, now, that's game over, really.

486
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,760
Coating the sides of the cakes with buttercream,

487
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,800
and dipping them in the nuts.

488
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,800
This is so fiddly, it's unbelievable.

489
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,560
Flat, that's how it's looking.

490
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,040
Same as before.

491
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,520
- That's it. 
- It's cooked, it's cooked, mate - come on, let's be positive.

492
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,840
It's hardly light and fluffy!

493
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,760
(Just put a lot of icing on it, and a lot of nuts.)

494
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,160
Bakers, time to start your screams - just 15 minutes on your mokatines!

495
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,360
Nowhere near enough.

496
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,640
Um....

497
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,200
Cutting it fine.

498
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,520
Pipe tiny rosettes, yeah.

499
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,320
It is looking like the picture that I saw in the book,

500
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,640
which is bizarre!

501
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,480
It could all rest on the placing of the icing.

502
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,640
- FLORA: 
- God, they're such a mess.

503
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Coat them in the almond nibs.

504
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,760
Flood the icing across the top of each cake.

505
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,320
HE SIGHS

506
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,880
- TAMAL: 
- Never made a fondant icing.

507
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,040
Oh...

508
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,360
Is it meant to look...?

509
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,000
Mary's recipe doesn't say how to make the fondant icing,

510
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,440
but it needs to be just the right consistency

511
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,760
to pour on top of the sponge and set in time.

512
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,000
Ooh...

513
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,920
Wow, why is it so stringy?

514
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,800
I need to freeze that, pronto.

515
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,280
I think this is probably the worst day of baking to date.

516
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,560
I'll never give up, I never give up.

517
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,480
Throw my dolly out the pram a couple of times,

518
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,600
but I never give up!

519
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,280
Right, bakers, one minute.

520
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,800
- Tamal! 
- What? 
- Less than a minute, now - come along. 
- OK.

521
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,480
- Can you give me a second? 
- No, Tamal.

522
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,640
Argh!

523
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,800
It's now 40-something seconds.

524
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,840
Why won't it pipe?!

525
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,360
Oh, that's so bad.

526
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,600
OK, bakers, that's time,

527
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,320
so if you'd like to bring your bakes up to the gingham altar

528
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,840
and pop them behind the photo of yourself, thank you.

529
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,080
MARY: So, bakers, what are looking for?

530
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,160
Well-risen genoise, creme au beurre piped beautifully,

531
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,600
and a good flow of icing in the middle.

532
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,520
- PAUL: 
- Start on this one.

533
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,680
- The fondant icing should be shiny... 
- Yeah.

534
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,800
..and a little bit more runny.

535
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,640
The piping is not good.

536
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,960
We have got filling in the middle, yeah.

537
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,520
It's about equal to the sponge.

538
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,960
Yes - it's a well-risen sponge.

539
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,520
- It's a very good flavour. 
- OK.

540
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,720
Moving on to the next one - these look all round much, much neater.

541
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,160
The pipe work is very good.

542
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,800
Good bit of height, don't you think?

543
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,040
Yep, very good.

544
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,480
Let's have a look.

545
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Good layer, as well, in the middle.

546
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,880
- Really very nice indeed. 
- Yeah. 
- Good genoise.

547
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,960
- Well done, that's good. 
- Yeah, nice and light.

548
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,280
- Right. 
- Here we have a genoise that hasn't risen very well.

549
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,320
- Yeah, it's quite flat, that, isn't it? 
- It's flat.

550
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,920
Let's have a look.

551
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,280
Oh, dear, it's solid when you cut into it.

552
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,800
Icing hasn't set.

553
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,000
It's almost raw.

554
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,880
It's like rubber.

555
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,680
Good flavour of coffee from the icings.

556
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,200
And that's it, really.

557
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,840
What happened with the icing here?

558
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,480
- On... 
- There's been icing halfway up - nothing on the bottom, there.

559
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,640
The fondant icing is too runny.

560
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,480
The way that they've cut the sponge,

561
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,840
you've got a really thick layer at the bottom,

562
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,480
and a very thin layer at the top.

563
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,280
- But the bottom layer looks as though it's a good genoise. 
- Mm.

564
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,560
Mm, it is a good genoise.

565
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,000
Right.

566
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,680
The creme au beurre has been done in a shell pattern,

567
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,160
and perhaps sometimes we've got a few little rosettes -

568
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,920
but we did ask for rosettes.

569
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,840
The resistance on that sponge...

570
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,560
Even though the icing on this one hasn't set,

571
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,320
it has not soaked too much into the genoise.

572
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,160
I think the genoise was slightly over-baked, as well, actually,

573
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,880
which is why you've got that tension breaking into it.

574
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,640
Mary and Paul must now decide

575
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,440
which baker has achieved the perfect mokatine.

576
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,800
In fifth place...

577
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:07,160
This genoise is very thin, and the icing has run off the top.

578
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,320
In fourth place is this one.

579
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,880
Tamal.

580
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,160
It was the overall bleeding of the icing on top of the top sponge.

581
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,960
And in third place...

582
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,520
The top is very runny. We asked for rosettes and we got shells.

583
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,080
In second place is this one.

584
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,160
The genoise was fantastic. Well done.

585
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,240
And in first place...

586
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,680
What a joy!

587
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,160
APPLAUSE

588
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,840
Very neat piping, good icing,

589
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,040
good height to your sponge - well done.

590
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,080
Thank you.

591
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,720
Technicals don't feel like my Achilles heel any more.

592
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,680
It's almost like - I feel like I'm having an out of body experience -

593
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,480
I feel like I didn't even do any of that,

594
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,160
I feel like, "I didn't do that - who gave you that first?"

595
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,360
I'm pretty nervous about tomorrow, because today's been so average.

596
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,880
I was really hoping that I could sort of up the ante.

597
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,440
I thought that went very well.

598
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,480
HE LAUGHS

599
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,360
Weren't expecting that, were you?!

600
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,400
No, that was a complete disaster.

601
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,360
Still got one more to go tomorrow. Better just bake your heart out,

602
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,080
and see what you can come up with.

603
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,280
Just one challenge stands in the way of the bakers and the semifinal.

604
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,000
Going into Showstopper day,

605
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,480
there is certainly one person who's looking very, very strong.

606
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,520
Nadiya.

607
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,120
MARY: I mean, she was top in both of the challenges.

608
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,800
And to dominate it in the quarterfinals the way she has done,

609
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,400
first and first, that's never happened before.

610
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,920
But on the other hand, the unflappable Paul -

611
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,400
he's a good baker...

612
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,600
And yet unable to make a genoise.

613
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,760
He hadn't got that knowledge - and I'm amazed,

614
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,400
because he has such skill.

615
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,600
Flora, she's in a very precarious position

616
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,920
if she has a bad day today.

617
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,400
You can slip down coming into the quarterfinals,

618
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
- I think the pressure gets to them. 
- Yeah. 
- Yes.

619
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,520
I think they do struggle.

620
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,960
We'll see what happens. Showstopper day - let it commence.

621
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,000
Morning, all. Now, so far, your bakes have been dainty and petite -

622
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,600
now we would like you to go large.

623
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,680
Paul and Mary would like you to create a religieuse a l'ancienne.

624
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,480
- Mm! 
- Now, this is a choux mountain

625
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,920
in the shape of a nun.

626
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,240
We want her to be at least three tiers of eclairs -

627
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,280
we also would love her to be freestanding.

628
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,600
- No dowelling, please... 
- No. 
- ..and decorated with buttercream.

629
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,440
- You've got four hours on the clock - on your marks... 
- Get set...

630
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,640
- BOTH: 
- ..bake!

631
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,600
- PAUL: 
- I do need it to go well.

632
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,760
It's a construction - that's what it comes down to,

633
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,680
and obviously the flavour in there, as well,

634
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,280
so there's a lot of elements to get right, on this. Not easy.

635
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,360
The religieuse a l'ancienne is a tower of eclairs

636
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,080
stacked on top of one another,

637
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,560
each tier supported by a shortcrust pastry disc.

638
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,360
I'm absolutely dreading this one.

639
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,000
It's designed to be an eye-catching

640
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,160
and impressive centrepiece to a party,

641
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,280
which means it needs to stand for a number of hours without collapsing.

642
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,160
The last practice I did for the whole thing

643
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,680
looked beautiful for about five minutes,

644
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,440
and then just made a gentle topple down.

645
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,640
What we're looking for is a structural marvel

646
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,240
being baked to perfection.

647
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,280
Inside must be filled beautifully with the flavour of their choice -

648
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,880
the flavour must come through.

649
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,080
The eclairs have to be strong and crisp.

650
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,240
If they're underbaked, haven't been dried out, they'll bend,

651
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,320
which would be ghastly.

652
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,360
It's the last chance for them to impress us

653
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,560
to get through to the semifinals.

654
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,120
All eclairs start with a choux pastry,

655
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,120
which produces a light and airy bun.

656
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,640
To succeed in this challenge,

657
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,840
the bakers must find a way to reinforce their eclairs.

658
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,720
- Morning, Tamal. 
- Hello, morning.

659
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,280
What sort of flour have you used in your eclairs?

660
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,120
- I'm using strong bread flour for my... 
- Do you approve of that? 
- Yeah.

661
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,200
- So, it's structurally pretty sound. 
- Yeah.

662
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,880
And what flavours are you having?

663
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,960
I'm doing a mango and passion fruit creme pat.

664
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,200
- A classic. 
- Yeah.

665
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,440
You're playing safe!

666
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,640
Tamal's also gone for a pistachio creme pat and raspberry filling.

667
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,280
He's hoping his strong flour

668
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,720
is another safe bet to keep his choux tower upright.

669
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,640
I've done one full timed run, which was like a beginning thing,

670
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,920
and I didn't do it in the time, but it all stood up.

671
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,960
I've rewritten my method, and hopefully that will work.

672
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,880
Like Tamal, Ian's also using passion fruit as one of his flavours.

673
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,360
I'm calling it a nun with hidden passions.

674
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,600
It'd be great if I could tell some exciting story

675
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,520
about a nun with hidden passion I met on my travels somewhere,

676
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,560
but, um... no, nothing as exotic as that.

677
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,840
Ian's nun, on the other hand, IS exotic,

678
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,680
with fillings of cardamom and coffee, and pistachio with vanilla.

679
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,000
Hidden among these

680
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,680
are eclairs containing a passion fruit creme pat.

681
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,920
What flour are you using?

682
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,160
I'm using very strong flour.

683
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,200
- Very strong flour. 
- Very strong flour. I just need that rigidity.

684
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,960
It's quite a rough thing - it can make it quite brittle

685
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,840
at the same time as making it strong.

686
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,720
- Mm-hm. 
- It depends how you bake it, really.

687
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,400
You're quite a scientist, aren't you?

688
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,240
- This is my kind of challenge. 
- I can see that!

689
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,800
Kind of thinking through all the various elements of it.

690
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,280
The ruler's out, it's all good.

691
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,800
- Good luck, mate. 
- Thank you.

692
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,720
I read somewhere, if, when you lift the choux,

693
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,640
you get a good V on the spatula, like that,

694
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,800
you've got enough egg in it.

695
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,920
If it's too runny, then it'll make it balloon too much,

696
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,720
so... And we don't want that.

697
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,520
That's good.

698
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,680
I'm using half plain and half strong flour.

699
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,320
I've always found that just a little bit of strong flour

700
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,440
helps to strengthen it a touch.

701
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,600
For her fillings,

702
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,280
Flora's chosen a coconut creme pat for one eclair.

703
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,200
The other will contain vanilla creme pat with a lime and basil curd.

704
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,200
How high do you think this will be?

705
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,640
It's been around about there when I've done it at home.

706
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,120
- A Dalek, essentially. 
- A Dallick? 
- Yes! 
- Yes, a Davros.

707
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,440
- What's a Dallick? 
- A Dalek.

708
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,080
- Oh, a Dalek! 
- From Doctor Who, a Dalek.

709
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,400
- You're saying it in Gaelic. 
- Gaelic? A Gaelic Dalek?

710
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,920
A Daelic.

711
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,480
Unlike the others,

712
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,200
Nadiya and Paul have chosen not to go with strong flour.

713
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,760
- Morning! 
- Morning, Paul, morning, Mary.

714
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,880
The flavours are going to be vanilla banana.

715
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,560
- Banana? 
- Banana again! 
- Banana again.

716
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,240
Is it going to be mega banana-ey?

717
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,160
This is going to be banana-tasting, I guarantee.

718
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,800
Paul's banana eclairs will be topped with a red cherry glaze.

719
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,040
He's making a raspberry and basil filling for his other eclair,

720
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,080
iced with a chocolate fondant.

721
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,280
Everything under control -

722
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,120
let's just hope we get that banana flavour.

723
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,960
And make sure the creme pat doesn't curdle,

724
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,560
- otherwise we'll have banana splits. 
- HE CHUCKLES

725
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm using a star nozzle to pipe,

726
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,160
just to help with the construction of them.

727
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,760
- IAN: 
- It's the corrugation that gives strength to the structure.

728
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,360
I'm hoping that that principle extends to the eclair.

729
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,600
- Morning, Nadiya. 
- Morning. 
- What flavours are you doing?

730
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,160
I'm doing bubble gum and peppermint cream.

731
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,280
How are you getting that bubble gum flavour?

732
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,840
- Bubble gum essence. 
- Oh, this is going to take me right back.

733
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,760
I absolutely love candy and sweets,

734
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,960
and these are my two favourite flavours.

735
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,280
It puts a smile on your face!

736
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,320
- Yeah, it's quite nostalgic. 
- It puts a smile on your face.

737
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,240
Nadiya's the only baker not using a fruit flavour

738
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,080
in any of her fillings - instead, her candy-inspired choux buns

739
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,440
will be topped with bubble gum icing and a peppermint fondant glaze.

740
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,000
- Can't wait to try that bubble gum. 
- Thank you!

741
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,560
All of the bakes today, they have to be slightly overdone, than under,

742
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,920
because if they're under, you just run the risk of them becoming soft.

743
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,600
Soft, in terms of construction, it's a no-go.

744
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,640
Right...

745
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,680
- IAN: 
- It's quite a juggling act.

746
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,720
There's sort of the taste, the texture

747
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,640
and the strength and the structure.

748
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,560
And I don't want to have a pile of eclairs,

749
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,080
I want to have tower of them.

750
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,280
- FLORA: 
- I'm a bit concerned about the flavours and the fillings.

751
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,400
The lime curd is probably what I would say I'm most concerned about.

752
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,800
I haven't practised it with the creme pat.

753
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,480
They will taste bananas today.

754
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,320
A few extra for luck, going in there.

755
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,160
Definitely going to give you a stronger flavour, blitzing it.

756
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,480
Might even put banana essence in.

757
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,160
Is that a risk?

758
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,640
This is strong stuff, it really is.

759
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,240
Having the fresh stuff's probably always better.

760
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,440
Some quite nice, juicy passion fruit.

761
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,840
This tastes like bubble gum.

762
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,120
Oh, yeah.

763
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,240
They're looking good. Yeah, I'm happy with that.

764
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,480
Just going to turn the temperature right down now,

765
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,080
and then put the spoon in the door,

766
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,360
just to try and get all the moisture out.

767
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,920
OK, bakers,

768
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,960
the abbey bell is tolling,

769
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,240
and it's saying two hours till your Sister Mary Eclairs

770
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,520
needs to be back in the abbey.

771
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,800
Pleased with them so far.

772
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,760
They should make for quite sturdy construction.

773
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,400
They're fine.

774
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,880
I tap them, just to make sure that they're hollow,

775
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,320
and to make sure that they're cooked all the way through,

776
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,760
and they're not going to collapse.

777
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,480
They feel strong, but light at the same time.

778
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,680
- Well done, Paul! 
- So, it's... 
- It's gone well, hasn't it?

779
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,440
- It's not over till it's over. 
- I know it's not over yet.

780
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,040
- It's not over till it's over. 
- It's not over till the big nun sings.

781
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,280
- TAMAL: 
- So, this is the shortcrust pastry

782
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,880
that's going to make up the discs that go between the tiers for this.

783
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,120
They've got a lot to carry on their little pastry shoulders.

784
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,920
Big responsibility, guys!

785
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,840
This your first nun?

786
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,880
- No, she's my eighth nun. 
- Gosh, you get through 'em.

787
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,840
- I've had a few nun disasters, some nun landslides. 
- OK.

788
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,520
Some nun explosions.

789
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,600
I'm just dreading construction.

790
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,920
Is it bonne, or are we bricking it? ALARM BEEPS

791
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,240
- Bricking it - yeah, exactly. 
- Bricking it.

792
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,840
- I might put them on the back here. 
- OK. 
- Can you excuse me?

793
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,200
- Yeah, no, absolutely fine. 
- Mm-hm.

794
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,240
(Bricking it.)

795
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,800
He bigger ones are starting to get soft.

796
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,000
It's not what I wanted.

797
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,800
Soft is not good.

798
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,640
I can't taste which one's which of mine.

799
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,520
That's coconut...

800
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,200
I think.

801
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,640
In just 40 minutes,

802
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,960
Mary and Paul are expecting to see five choux pastry masterpieces...

803
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,080
Agh! Time, time, time.

804
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,960
..and with all the components now made,

805
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,360
everything rests, quite literally, on the strength of the eclairs.

806
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,160
Oh, I'm too nervous for construction!

807
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,720
- NADIYA: 
- This is my glue, yeah. Sugar water and glucose.

808
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,440
SHE SIGHS

809
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,960
This one, it's just... Ooh!

810
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,000
I'm not looking forward to this bit.

811
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,320
I'm trying to avoid it!

812
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,560
It's a serious nun.

813
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,800
Oh, my hands are shaking now!

814
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,440
Stop shaking, stop shaking.

815
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,320
(Please hold, please hold.)

816
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,920
Hey! Get back.

817
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,880
Ow!

818
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,960
So hot, it's unreal.

819
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,200
Ooh!

820
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,560
Come on.

821
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,680
The sugar syrup is really crystallising.

822
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,160
20 minutes to go.

823
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,240
Keep going, keep going.

824
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,040
- TAMAL: 
- This is my second batch of caramel.

825
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,840
It's really frustrating, cos I was nearly there.

826
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,320
Come on!

827
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,680
- TAMAL: 
- I'm going to be so glad when this stupid nun thing is done!

828
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,080
- PAUL: 
- Piping's not brilliant.

829
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,680
How can I change that? How can I change that?

830
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,120
Oh!

831
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,640
Icing sugar everywhere!

832
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,200
It'll stiffen up the icing sugar.

833
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,640
Hopefully it's worked.

834
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,880
Right, I don't want to make a HABIT of this, guys,

835
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,120
but you've got one minute left. One minute.

836
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,360
I'm nearly there.

837
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,680
- PAUL: 
- No, no, don't do this to me.

838
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,480
Please put your constructions at the end of your benches.

839
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,160
Time is up.

840
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,280
(That was so stressful!)

841
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,440
It's up, and it's standing.

842
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,280
The bakers have a two-hour lunch break before they're judged.

843
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,280
Light steps, light steps.

844
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,840
Their creations, if made correctly, should remain standing.

845
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,240
But, with a place in the semifinal at steak,

846
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,760
any collapse could be disastrous.

847
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,960
Tamal, please bring up your nun.

848
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,040
MARY: Well done, it's holding up.

849
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,520
The piping is a little bit haphazard,

850
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,800
but it's beautifully detailed.

851
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,000
OK, we have raspberry and pistachio.

852
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,760
I hope it's not overbaked.

853
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,880
No, it's fine.

854
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,480
The flavours are lovely. Sharp.

855
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,640
In these sort of things, you really want something

856
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,320
that's going to punch you between the teeth, and it does.

857
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,000
Mango and passion fruit - hello.

858
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,040
This SHOULD work.

859
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,480
And it does.

860
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,920
Quite difficult for these things to stand up, you know -

861
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,480
- and you used strong flour, didn't you? 
- Yeah, strong flour,

862
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,960
and I baked the eclairs longer than I would do normally.

863
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,920
- I like it. 
- Well thought through.

864
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,520
- Well done, Tamal. 
- Thank you.

865
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,440
Here you go, Paul.

866
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,680
Erm... It has collapsed, though.

867
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,960
It's meant to stand up for some time.

868
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,160
At the end of the day, something like this,

869
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,280
would normally last three or four hours

870
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,320
before it even went to a party to be broken into, you know?

871
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,960
- The colours are fascinating. 
- You've got good piping on it.

872
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,040
Trying the bubble gum, Mary?

873
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,800
I will be brave.

874
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,200
The choux pastry is actually nice and soft.

875
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,920
It's got a lovely bake on it, actually, when you look underneath.

876
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,640
That's bubble gum, isn't it?!

877
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,200
That is potent and the icing's very good.

878
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,560
I'm afraid it's not quite my favourite.

879
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,920
Now, the green one is obviously the peppermint, OK.

880
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,960
The actual cream inside's fine, and the choux bun is OK,

881
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,840
but I just think the flavourings are slightly over the top.

882
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:06,040
Good creme patissiere, good choux buns, almost stayed up -

883
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,560
the two flavourings, both too strong for me.

884
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,600
Paul, can I give you a hand?

885
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,800
Yes, please, yeah.

886
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,680
So, we know you had a problem, and it didn't hold up.

887
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,120
- Obviously we can see they've collapsed. 
- Mm.

888
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,000
The colour of the choux pastry looks good,

889
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,800
but I think that's part of the problem.

890
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,560
- It's so light... 
- Right. 
- ..that it can't support it.

891
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,880
- The actual piping is a little bit haphazard. 
- Mm.

892
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,560
But everything else I think's good.

893
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,840
Very good, in fact.

894
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,120
I think you've done the icing particularly well.

895
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,000
You've got a high shine on it.

896
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,120
This is a banana one, isn't it?

897
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,840
- You put some banana extract in there. 
- I did put three extra drops in.

898
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,080
Bit artificial, but the banana's coming through.

899
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,520
It's OK. It's not going to blow your mind, but I think it's OK.

900
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,240
I saw it going, and I lifted it -

901
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,040
I was not confident in it staying any longer.

902
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,560
The bake on them looks OK.

903
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,240
You've got reasonable piping, they're all the same length.

904
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,480
Is this one lime and basil?

905
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,000
Not getting either.

906
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,840
Are you sure you put it in?

907
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,440
Yeah, I did about seven limes.

908
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,920
Not coming through. Let's try this one.

909
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,160
I get the creaminess of the white chocolate in that, but that's it.

910
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,880
- No coconut either? 
- No.

911
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,440
- Sorry. 
- Thank you very much, Flora. 
- Sorry.

912
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,840
It's holding up.

913
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:12,160
It would look fine for a celebration.

914
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,240
The coffee is really lovely.

915
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,120
- Coffee and cardamom. 
- Mm.

916
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,240
- Really good. 
- Good!

917
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,400
They enhance each other quite well. I never thought of that before.

918
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,520
- Spot on. Nice and tart passion fruit. 
- Mm-hm.

919
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,760
I was a bit worried, initially, about the choux buns,

920
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,120
- but I don't think there's any other way around this. 
- No.

921
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,600
You had to create something that was going to be stable...

922
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,000
- Yeah. 
- ..and hold flavour.

923
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,400
Very good.

924
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,640
You pair of fiends.

925
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,120
- This was a really difficult challenge, wasn't it? 
- Yeah.

926
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,680
I think coming into this challenge

927
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,320
we had four people that were potentially in trouble.

928
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,360
- Tamal, Flora, Paul and Ian. 
- Yeah.

929
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,760
Overall, Ian and Tamal have actually saved themselves.

930
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,320
I think strong flour was always going to be the way forward,

931
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,920
because it had more rigidity to hold up the weight that it did.

932
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,280
And the flavours on both of those guys' were very good.

933
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,400
- We had a bit of a flavour explosion... 
- Oh, dear.

934
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,600
..in this corner here.

935
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,000
Those two flavours - big mistake.

936
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,800
Nadiya's bake was very good, the choux pastry was very good.

937
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,320
Bearing in mind she'd raced ahead,

938
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,920
and was all set for Star Baker, does this slightly change things?

939
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:23,800
It doesn't really change it so much, because she's shown us other skills.

940
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,760
It's a really difficult position for us,

941
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,480
because what we've actually got to do is move someone

942
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,200
we thought originally was going to be in trouble today,

943
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,240
which was Tamal,

944
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,240
into the possibility of being the Star Baker, along with Nadiya -

945
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,000
and then Ian, I think, saved himself,

946
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,640
so I think he's moved middle ground.

947
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,480
On the other side of the coin, there, you've got Flora and Paul,

948
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,040
who are in a bit of trouble.

949
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,320
I was really disappointed in Flora's, because it should taste of lime.

950
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,360
Paul's flavours are in abundance -

951
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,760
but you only liked 50% of them, it's fair to say.

952
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,360
You got the banana flavour, but it was a bit artificial.

953
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,120
We're going to get together in a minute

954
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,240
and have a full discussion about everything.

955
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,440
- Let's put the kettle on, then. 
- We should, probably.

956
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,320
- You might need something stronger. 
- Hip flask, Mary? Same as usual?

957
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,360
Let's get on to that.

958
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,080
Quarterfinalists, I'm as pleased as punch -

959
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,440
I've got the really nice job, this week,

960
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,880
of telling you who Star Baker is.

961
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:25,360
Now, this person absolutely nailed it yesterday,

962
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,160
and they provided us today

963
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:32,240
with the most vivid, Day-Glo nun I've ever experienced in my life.

964
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,960
This week's Star Baker goes to Miss Nadiya.

965
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,240
APPLAUSE

966
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,560
Well done.

967
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:47,080
I'd like everybody to stay in this tent every single week...

968
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,560
and it's with total personal sadness...

969
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:55,200
..that I have to announce that leaving us today...

970
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,920
is Paul.

971
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,880
- That's fine. 
- What a champion dude you are, sir.

972
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,120
Come on, guv'nor.

973
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,320
That's OK.

974
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,720
Ohh!

975
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,840
Right from the beginning, I was in this to win it.

976
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,480
I've had some real fantastic highs -

977
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,840
- I've had some really bad lows! 
- HE CHUCKLES

978
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,440
I've had some really bad bakes - but that's the nature of it,

979
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,880
you're not going to come in here and just bake everything to perfection.

980
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,040
Really gutted, mate.

981
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,120
I knew it was me.

982
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,960
That bullet had my name written on it -

983
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,640
it was so, so not fair that Paul went.

984
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,880
- Unlucky, buddy. 
- Cheers, Paul. 
- Unlucky, mate.

985
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,920
MARY: This really wasn't Paul's weekend.

986
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,200
His genoise didn't go too well - he should have known that.

987
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,840
Paul was in a very difficult position

988
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,880
coming into the Showstopper - he really had to blow our minds,

989
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,800
and, unfortunately, he didn't do that,

990
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,200
and that's why Paul had to go.

991
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,360
I hope your taste buds recover. I'm so sorry!

992
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:49,200
That means that I am coming back to participate in the semifinals!

993
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,840
Yes!

994
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,720
Nadiya won the first two challenges coming into today.

995
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,520
She did let herself down on that Showstopper,

996
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,560
but when we looked at the choux bun and the filling,

997
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,920
they actually tasted fine.

998
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:05,160
Nadiya was Star Baker because yesterday she had a fantastic day -

999
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,080
top of both challenges.

1000
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:11,520
Today she made good eclairs, but, oh, those flavours weren't so good.

1001
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,520
I've had good fun, it's been brilliant.

1002
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,600
OK? You owe me a pint.

1003
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,320
I owe you such a big pint!

1004
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,000
Yeah, I'm going to make genoise again,

1005
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,240
and I'll make sure I know how to make the damn thing.

1006
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,240
Live to fight another day!

1007
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,360
Yay!

1008
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,320
I really didn't think that was going to happen

1009
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,200
after yesterday morning's dog's dinner.

1010
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,880
I'm so excited, I could streak down this river.

1011
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,600
Yeah, that's how excited I am.

1012
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,800
SHE SIGHS

1013
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,600
Next time, it's the semifinals...

1014
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,000
My hands are shaking.

1015
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
This is the least funny thing I've ever done.

1016
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,240
..and the bakers must get to grips with chocolate...

1017
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,040
Ian, there's chocolate in the microwave,

1018
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,400
chocolate on the hob, chocolate in the proving drawer.

1019
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,280
'They face a technical challenge that's out of the ordinary...'

1020
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,840
We're going to stagger your start times.

1021
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,480
'..and then show off with a centrepiece

1022
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,840
'that will earn them a place in the final.'

1023
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,480
Perhaps I was a little bit too ambitious on this one.

1024
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,120
Anyone got any free hands?

1025
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,000
There's nothing good coming out of that oven this afternoon.
