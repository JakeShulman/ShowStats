1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,960
'12 fresh bakers are preparing for battle like warriors of old.'

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,720
Warriors?

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,200
No, worriers. As in - they're worried. Worriers.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,600
I was going to say, they're not dressed as warriors.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,680
That's why they don't have breastplates on.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,040
- Don't worry. 
- All right. Welcome to a brand-new series of...

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,960
BOTH: The Great British Bake Off.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,560
When I applied, did I think I'd get on? No, I didn't.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,280
My daughter entered me for the competition

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,280
and when I got the initial phone call, I thought it was a joke.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,240
It hadn't really felt real until we saw the tent.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,240
I can't even describe... I don't have any words...

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,800
I never imagined I would actually get here.

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,960
Now that I'm here...everything...

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,320
My jaw is just on the ground.

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,480
I just want all of my bakes to be right, nothing to be raw

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,640
and everything to be risen and everything to taste good.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,040
You know the Paul Hollywood stare - he looks at something

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,640
and then looks up at you. I'm dreading that.

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,400
I am such a big fan of Mary.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,680
If I can even make her swallow a piece of my cake,

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,520
that's quite a big deal!

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,040
MEL: 30 brand-new challenges.

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,600
Nervous, really nervous.

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,760
12 new bakers.

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,400
My wife gave me two bits of advice.

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,680
Make sure you don't go out the first weekend

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,880
and don't make any jokes.

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,440
But only one can be the winner of The Great British Bake Off.

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,200
I'm quite random.

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,600
You know, I can be making a cake

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
and you can have a meat pie by the time I've finished.

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,520
We are back in the glorious grounds of Welford Park, Berkshire,

34
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,640
and limbering up for another baking marathon.

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,840
- Ooh, crunchy. 
- Focus. Focus.

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,760
- All right, feel the burn. OK, ready? 
- Yeah, yeah.

37
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,840
Ready?

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,160
BOTH GROAN

39
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,040
- Lunge! 
- Good!

40
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,760
BOTH GROAN

41
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,640
BOTH: It's cake week!

42
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,280
The bakers are about to face their first-ever challenge.

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,480
There'll be a couple more over the next two days,

44
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,000
after which, one will be crowned Star Baker

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,520
and one will be asked to leave the Bake Off.

46
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,240
Welcome, everybody, to the tent.

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,960
Now, I know you've been practising, probably for months -

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,040
the breads, the cakes, the biscuits.

49
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,400
That's all over.

50
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,400
All you have to do now is impress our lovely judges - Mary and Paul.

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,120
Now, this is your first Signature Challenge.

52
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,760
And for this, we thought we'd start you nice and simply

53
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,600
with a very basic Madeira cake. Easy.

54
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,680
Surely it's got to be three tiers with lots of sugar crafts, that kind of thing?

55
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,600
- No. No, Melanie. 
- Really? 
- Very simple. So, for the very first time,

56
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,560
you've got two hours to complete this. On your marks.

57
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,760
Get set.

58
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,280
Bake!

59
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,200
We're cooking. The oven's on - the process has started.

60
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,040
Trying to do my preparation properly.

61
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,600
My sister's last words were, "Make sure all the tins

62
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,120
"are always well-greased and lined and everything."

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,280
My hands are shaking so much, it's really difficult to cut.

64
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,000
Do you know what? I never get bored of coming back to Bake Off,

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,560
and this year, we've got 12 fantastic bakers to break in.

66
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,480
Madeira cake, for me, is one of the great classics.

67
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,680
It's a close-textured, beautiful, plain cake,

68
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,360
but it should have a dome and a crack on the top.

69
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,080
I'm happy that there will be different flavours

70
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,760
but I don't want it too far from the classic, because you can't beat it.

71
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,000
That's my thyme, which I'm taking leaves off,

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,080
and then I'm going to blend it together

73
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,440
with some lemon zest to release the flavour.

74
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,360
Born in Lithuania, Ugne is an office administrator

75
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,640
who lives in Essex with her partner and two children.

76
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,000
She has two burning passions - British baking and body building.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,840
Her lemon and thyme Madeira cake

78
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,800
will be topped with a lemon glaze and crystallised thyme sprigs.

79
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,320
Hopefully, the taste will be good and my crack will show!

80
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
SHE LAUGHS

81
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,480
- Morning, Nadiya. 
- Hey, Nadiya.

82
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,840
Right, can you tell us all about your Madeira, please?

83
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,760
It's green cardamom and orange Madeira.

84
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,920
Is that the only flavour in your Madeira cake?

85
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,360
Just the orange zest and green cardamom powder.

86
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,240
Interesting using the cardamom.

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,000
It could be fantastic or it could be disastrous.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,560
Yeah, if you put too much in and it can taste quite medicinal,

89
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,360
and too little and you can't taste it, so it's finding a balance.

90
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,600
- And you're happy with the balance at the moment? 
- Yes.

91
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,560
Nadiya learned to bake during her home economics lessons

92
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,000
at school in Luton.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,480
She now lives in Leeds with her husband, Abdal,

94
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,520
and is full-time mum to Musa, Dawud and Maryam.

95
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,080
They've given the thumbs-up to her Madeira with its candied orange

96
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,040
and cardamom-flavoured glaze.

97
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,840
My kids keep telling me that they're really proud of me,

98
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,280
but I think my eldest son

99
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,400
will definitely feel a little bit disappointed

100
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,920
if I didn't get through.

101
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,680
- Morning, Paul. Morning, Mary. 
- Good morning, how are you?

102
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,360
Very well, thank you, very well.

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,600
What inspired you to do this and what about the ingredients?

104
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,960
Well, I've been lucky enough to do quite a bit of work in the Caribbean,

105
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,200
so quite a bit of ginger in there.

106
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,800
The classic Jamaican ginger idea, and then some lime mojitos in Cuba.

107
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,320
OK.

108
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,680
When Ian isn't working as a travel photographer,

109
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,680
he's a stay-at-home dad to George and Zoe in Cambridgeshire.

110
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,680
His Somewhere West Of Madeira Cake will have coconut-based batter.

111
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,240
- It's going to be different. 
- I hope so. I hope so.

112
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,000
Just get those flavours balanced.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,360
Yeah.

114
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,840
The consistency of a Madeira cake batter is crucial.

115
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,600
Slow that down so I don't cover everyone in it.

116
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,520
It needs to be liquid enough to produce steam in the oven,

117
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,200
which should encourage the Madeira's distinctive crack

118
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,520
on the surface of the sponge

119
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,400
- Morning. 
- Morning.

120
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,320
- Mat, what have you chosen to do? 
- Erm...

121
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,440
So, I'm making a gin and tonic Madeira cake.

122
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,640
- That's original. 
- Is it?

123
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,720
Are you actually putting gin into the cake?

124
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah, a little bit. It's more of a gin and tonic glaze than it is gin in the cake.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,080
As long as we get that balance through on the top.

126
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,640
- I think putting it on the top is more of a gesture than anything else. 
- Yeah.

127
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,840
Mat began learning to bake three years ago,

128
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,200
in between shifts as a London firefighter.

129
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,320
His G&T Madeira will be brushed with a fresh lemon glaze

130
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,840
containing seven shots of gin.

131
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,600
I always serve gin and tonic with just a little bit of regret.

132
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,160
- Oh, really? 
- Just a little bit. 
- I've got plenty of that.

133
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,200
Three of the bakers have gone strictly Madeira.

134
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,160
These are the types of cakes my mum used to make all the time.

135
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,440
No frills - just a very classic, traditional Madeira cake.

136
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,200
They are only using the classic citrus flavours.

137
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,240
I've tried adding poppy seeds and things

138
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,960
and I thought it's just nice

139
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,800
the way it is with the orange and lemon in it.

140
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,760
And it's like the one that we eat at New Year in Scotland.

141
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,600
At home in Perthshire, Marie bakes almost every day,

142
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,840
much to the delight of her five grandchildren.

143
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,480
Her zingy citrus Madeira cake is one of their favourites.

144
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,280
Once it's baked, I'll drizzle it with some light icing.

145
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,640
It still will have the crack on top you look for in a Madeira cake

146
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,720
but it'll keep it a little bit moist.

147
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,160
- Morning, Dorret. 
- Morning. 
- So, how about your Madeira cake?

148
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,360
For the first challenge, I thought, "You just want to see the cut of my jib,"

149
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,720
so I've just gone with a bit of lemon zest and some candied lemon as decoration.

150
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,120
Nothing wrong with doing something simply and well.

151
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,600
Dorret is a project accountant

152
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,920
and lives in Preston with her husband and daughter.

153
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,880
She's been baking since she was 11, and has been honing

154
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,760
her simple Madeira for the last 40 years.

155
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,680
How have they turned out at home?

156
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,400
Perfect, with a nice dome and a crack in them,

157
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,200
and a very close-textured cake.

158
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
They should be quite light, as well.

159
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,520
- OK. 
- Good luck. 
- I'll take that from someone who's strategically important to this.

160
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,040
LAUGHTER

161
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,600
- I'm loving the fact that Paul has been deemed strategically important. That's a first for him. 
- Thank you.

162
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,160
I want to play with the twist, so not full orange or lemon.

163
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,920
And I really like blood oranges, I think they're the sweeter fruit.

164
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,000
Flora lives in Perthshire, and at 19, is this year's youngest baker.

165
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,720
Her harshest critics are her younger sisters,

166
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,480
but they've approved her blood orange Madeira.

167
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Flora's breaking with tradition in her cake mix.

168
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,960
I think almonds in the mixture helps with the moisture

169
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,040
because a Madeira cake can be quite dry.

170
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,840
Fingers crossed!

171
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,360
Alvin's gone for something a little more substantial in his cake mix.

172
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,000
- My Madeira is going to have figs. 
- They're dried figs?

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,200
They're dried and slightly rehydrated. Really moist.

174
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,520
Alvin's a nurse and lives in Bracknell with his wife

175
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,840
and two children.

176
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,120
As well as adding figs, he's infused his batter with orange

177
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,560
- and fresh vanilla. 
- How do they disperse?

178
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,800
My aim is for them to be suspended, and they were

179
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,680
when I was practising it at home, so...

180
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Never thought of chopping them up?

181
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,360
Cos I like them chunky.

182
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,200
OK, fair enough.

183
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,920
Alvin isn't the only baker daring to add fruit.

184
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,320
- Good morning. 
- Hello. 
- Paul is obsessed with dispersal of chunks.

185
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,240
- My chunks are well-dispersed. 
- Good, that's all he cares about.

186
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,440
- Do they drop down to the bottom, or do we expect... 
- Oh, no. 
- ..to see them all the way through?

187
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,320
If they're at the bottom, they're meant to be there.

188
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,120
Sandy is a child welfare officer and lives and works in Leeds.

189
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,520
Her apricot Madeira is flavoured with almond liqueur.

190
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,920
Paul shook my confidence in that the fruit would all sink to the bottom.

191
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,760
I've got to have real faith in my own ability.

192
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,520
Powerhouse of self-confidence going on.

193
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,720
Time to go in, I think.

194
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,560
So, fingers crossed!

195
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,160
I'm going to put it on for ten minutes on a higher temperature,

196
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,800
then after ten minutes, I'm going to lower it down.

197
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,760
It just gives it time to heat up quickly to get a rise.

198
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,560
Ahh! I haven't even set my oven.

199
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,120
Ah! I forgot to set the oven, because at home, we've got an Aga.

200
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,920
So used to having it on all the time.

201
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,360
Oh, well.

202
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,000
Bakers, one hour has gone. One hour to go.

203
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,840
Plenty of time.

204
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,800
I'm just going to put it in the oven.

205
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,560
Hopefully, it's got enough time to cook, fingers crossed.

206
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,280
Otherwise I'll be in trouble!

207
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Trying to get nice, even slices.

208
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,680
Madeira cake is traditionally topped with a light glaze

209
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,480
and candied fruit.

210
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,720
The fruit must be brittle.

211
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,920
I'm going to pop them into the oven, just for five minutes, and it will crisp them up a wee bit.

212
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,160
And the glaze should be thin, translucent and full of flavour.

213
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,280
That's a lot of gin. Let's keep that in it.

214
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,760
Fingers crossed.

215
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,680
I really want to do well at this

216
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,960
because there's a lot of people that don't know this side of me.

217
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,680
When he's not baking, Stu's a lead singer in a band

218
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,480
and a professional musician.

219
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,760
His lime and chocolate Madeira will be topped with a rum and lime glaze.

220
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,160
It's well on its way to being cooked,

221
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,520
if not already burnt,

222
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,280
so I'm just going to let that cool and see what I'm looking at.

223
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,880
- Now, Paul, I have one question. 
- Yes.

224
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,040
You know that you have the same facial hair as Paul Hollywood.

225
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,280
- You have the same name. 
- I've been waiting for someone to say that.

226
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,600
What is going on, Paul.

227
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,960
I'm slightly younger. Slightly younger.

228
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,680
Everyone's slightly younger. This Paul is a prison governor

229
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,200
in Swansea. He has a penchant for sugar craft,

230
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,120
but today, his decoration will be simple candied lemons,

231
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,520
on top of his lemon, ginger and caraway seed Madeira.

232
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,760
There's no hidden agenda here...

233
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,120
HE CHUCKLES

234
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,280
- There is no hidden agenda. 
- You don't wear as much hair gel as the other Paul,

235
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,800
- which is a relief to us. 
- No, I don't.

236
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,560
That's 30 minutes, bakers. 30 minutes!

237
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,960
Can't afford ear defenders.

238
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,000
Watch it like a hawk.

239
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,280
This last part of the bake is crucial.

240
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,560
This is when the centre should cook through,

241
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,360
producing the Madeira Holy Grail.

242
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,720
- Looking for a crack. 
- SHE LAUGHS

243
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,400
My cake's not cooked in the middle, but the top is really brown.

244
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,040
So, I'm just covering the top, so that it doesn't burn.

245
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,600
It's just the temperatures. I don't think I've got them right.

246
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,560
OK.

247
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,760
I'm happy with that.

248
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,840
I think it looks great. It's got a lovely crack.

249
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,720
I think it's all right.

250
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,320
I'll dress it up and try and make it look pretty.

251
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,880
What's happened with the crack? What's going on?

252
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,280
I have a little two.

253
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,680
But two's better than one. One crack bad, two cracks better.

254
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,200
Two cracks better.

255
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,280
Famous in Leeds is the three-crack Madeira.

256
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,840
MEL: One baker has a novel way to moisten his cake.

257
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,600
I've made a syrup for the cake, like a lemon drizzle.

258
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,480
So, using the syringe just to inject the syrup in, just a little bit,

259
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,360
I don't want it to be too soggy, but it just helps to get the flavour in.

260
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,160
As a trainee anaesthetist,

261
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,440
Tamal is well-versed in the art of injecting.

262
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,440
He's using a rose-water syrup to moisten his pistachio-flavoured cake.

263
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,720
I know Paul has this thing about there not being too much rose-water,

264
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,800
so hopefully I've got the balance right.

265
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,560
Eugh...

266
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,440
I might be pushing my luck.

267
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,360
Phew! Didn't snap it.

268
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,680
It's well-dispersed.

269
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,240
You know it.

270
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,240
Obviously, I'm a bit disappointed with the colour.

271
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,760
Right, M'DEARERS, you have five minutes left on the old clock.

272
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,960
Five minutes.

273
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Argh! I'm going to take it out now.

274
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,680
- Ah! 
- HE MUTTERS SOFTLY

275
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,960
Right, bakers, time to reveal your cracks.

276
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,520
Step away from your bakes and then move them to the side.

277
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,080
Thank you.

278
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,680
For the very first time,

279
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,040
the bakers will face the scrutiny of Mary and Paul.

280
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,720
Looking at it, you've got a very lovely colour

281
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,200
all the way round the outside.

282
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,600
We've got our dome.

283
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,960
You have got a split. You've hit all the criteria so far.

284
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,240
And also... Now, you just listen as I drop this on the plate.

285
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,560
PLINK

286
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,520
That's how it should be. This is proper candied.

287
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,880
It's not sticky and wet.

288
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,640
MEL: That's a Bake Off first, the candied drop test.

289
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,480
I've never seen you do that before, Bez.

290
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,200
- MARY: Now it's just whether we've got that cardamom right. 
- Yes.

291
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,280
For me, there's the right hint of cardamom.

292
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,760
It doesn't overpower it.

293
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,360
I think you've done a very clever variation. Well done.

294
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,400
- Well done. 
- Thank you. 
- You've done really well.

295
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,520
So, when you baked it at home, it had a perfect crack?

296
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,000
- There's a little one there. 
- Yeah!

297
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,080
I'm not getting the strong thyme flavour at all.

298
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,960
It is overwhelmingly lemon.

299
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,960
What the problem is...

300
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,400
when you put coconut into a cake like that,

301
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,840
it tends to bind the whole thing together,

302
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,320
and so it's like chewing on wallpaper paste.

303
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,720
I'm just wondering...

304
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,400
When I think of Madeira cake -

305
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,520
half chocolate and half lime, it isn't, to me, a Madeira cake.

306
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,520
What is that on the top?!

307
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,440
Um, yeah, my glaze sort of turned into caramel a little bit.

308
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,680
Slightly!

309
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,600
The flavours are all wrong, really. It's quite bitter.

310
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,600
Lovely texture, perfect bake all the way round.

311
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,320
I love it. I think the flavours coming through are stunning.

312
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,840
Well done.

313
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,480
Now we have the surprise of the figs at the bottom.

314
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,920
You did mention...

315
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,920
I did say, it was my concern about them dropping down to the bottom.

316
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,520
However, the texture of the Madeira is fantastic.

317
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,600
Great distribution of the fruit inside.

318
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,840
- Hasn't dropped to the bottom. 
- Thank you. 
- Because they're small.

319
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,920
- Hello, Paul. 
- Hello, Paul.

320
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,160
- Right. 
- THEY CHUCKLE

321
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,000
Er, it's stayed quite flat.

322
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,920
It's overbaked.

323
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,200
I think it's a fun idea

324
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,160
to think about, gin and tonic,

325
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,000
but in fact, the gin, for me, is not there.

326
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,720
- I love what you've done to the apple. 
- Mm-hm. 
- Very good.

327
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,000
We've got a bit of a dome on it and we've got the crack.

328
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,760
But it is down to the flavour on this.

329
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,040
I love that.

330
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,120
- Really? 
- I do. The flavours are lovely, so balanced.

331
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,640
I think it tastes amazing.

332
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,600
It is a lovely colour that you would expect from a Madeira cake,

333
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,280
and you've got a crack on the top.

334
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,920
I'm not sure how crisp your candied peel on the top...

335
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,480
Not very.

336
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,760
I think your texture's fantastic.

337
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,800
I think you've got a proper Madeira cake.

338
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,000
However, it's quite bland.

339
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,600
Well, it looks as though you've got a good bake

340
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,120
and it's got a nice dome, and there's a crack across the middle.

341
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,600
It looks good.

342
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,200
..Oh, I like that.

343
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,440
MEL: That's amazing.

344
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,920
- You've done these before, haven't you? 
- Mm.

345
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,840
It's lovely. Need's nothing else, the orange is coming through.

346
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,720
That's a perfect Madeira. Good bake.

347
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,680
- Thank you. 
- Well done. 
- Thank you.

348
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,120
- Can I take the pith, Marie? 
- Of course you can, yes.

349
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,320
- Thank you. 
- Thank you.

350
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,760
I'm really so pleased. It's wonderful.

351
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,520
Wonderful. Couldn't have asked for anything more!

352
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,920
They liked it! It's a miracle.

353
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,200
Paul and Mary were much more critical

354
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,960
than I thought they would be on the first challenge.

355
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,560
Yes. Wallpaper paste.

356
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,000
That's going to live with me for a little while, I think.

357
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,560
The bakers were able to plan and practise

358
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,560
for their first challenge.

359
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,960
Their second is a total mystery.

360
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,640
Bakers, welcome to your first-ever Technical Challenge.

361
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,840
Now, this one has been set by lovely Mary

362
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,160
and it is quintessentially British.

363
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,560
It is more British, even, than Morris men,

364
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,960
beefeaters and chicken tikka masala.

365
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,000
Mary and Paul are not going to be in on the action for this next bit,

366
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,880
so before you go, any advice for the bakers?

367
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,280
Read the recipe at least twice, to get familiar with it,

368
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,360
and then weigh very carefully.

369
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,080
MEL: Paul, any words?

370
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,520
Good luck.

371
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,800
Right. Brief.

372
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,840
Excellent. Off you go, now.

373
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,400
So, they've popped off, which leaves you, us

374
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,240
and that sneaky little recipe lurking under the gingham.

375
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,560
Paul and Mary would very much like you to make a walnut cake.

376
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,480
Not a coffee and walnut cake, this is the decaf version.

377
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,320
You have got 1 hour and 45 minutes.

378
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,000
Very good luck. On your marks.

379
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,920
- Get set! 
- BOTH: Bake!

380
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,000
All the bakers have the same ingredients

381
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,200
and a stripped-down version of Mary's recipe.

382
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,000
I fairly know how it's supposed to be done.

383
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,480
I don't want to talk too much, because I might fail.

384
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,840
So I'll just keep it to myself.

385
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,840
I think I've made it years and years ago,

386
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,880
and I don't think it really worked.

387
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,600
There we go, Mary, the first Technical Challenge.

388
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,640
Walnut cake - where do you think they could go wrong?

389
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,720
Well, first of all, they have to make a sponge mixture

390
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,360
and chop the walnuts in it.

391
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,800
If they don't chop them reasonably finely, they'll sink to the bottom.

392
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,360
You can see all the layers, you see all the buttercream,

393
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,240
and you can see the nuts inside the sponge as well.

394
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,400
Now, there should be a nice, even layer of frosting all over the cake.

395
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,000
This will be a new frosting for them they do over hot water.

396
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Follow the directions and it'll be fine.

397
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,800
I'm not sure what a perfect size for a walnut is at all.

398
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,040
Just getting really paranoid about the size of these walnut pieces.

399
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,000
If they're too big, I'm scared they are going to drop down, and I think

400
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,960
if they're small enough, they'll incorporate nicely into the cake.

401
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,680
Well, if you buy chopped nuts, they're usually about that big.

402
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,160
I think that is the perfect walnut size.

403
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,800
I can't see how it can't be.

404
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,160
125...

405
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,320
Mary's recipe requires the bakers to use

406
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,640
the creaming method for their mix.

407
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,040
Just creaming my butter and caster sugar.

408
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,640
I'm adding the eggs gradually. If you add it all in one, it curdles.

409
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,560
Somehow, I misread it. I'm doing the all-in-one.

410
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,800
It will work - trust me.

411
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,280
Just putting the flour and the walnuts in very, very slowly.

412
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,520
Folding it in.

413
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,240
Mixing them in like this. I hope that's right.

414
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,720
They're smaller than I would normally chop.

415
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,120
Hopefully, they'll just disperse evenly in the mix.

416
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,480
I'm going to put them in the oven now.

417
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,760
Mary's recipe only gives an oven temperature.

418
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,440
It doesn't say how long to put it in the oven for,

419
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,800
so I'm guessing about 20 minutes.

420
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,120
I'm going to put them in about 15, 20 minutes.

421
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,080
Just chucked it all in as one, really.

422
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,200
Mary does do a lot of the all-in-ones.

423
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,160
Bakers, you've got one hour left.

424
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,200
- Are you starting your caramel? 
- Yeah.

425
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,800
I am making the caramelised walnuts, getting the caramel on.

426
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,560
So, it's a tablespoon of water.

427
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,480
It's the 150g of sugar.

428
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,240
This is the bit that could go horribly wrong.

429
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,360
If I move away, it will go disastrously wrong.

430
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,720
It's just a waiting game.

431
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,440
The secret to perfect caramel is not to stir it

432
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,520
and not to let it crystallise.

433
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,200
The bakers are looking for molten sugar crystals...

434
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,680
Come on.

435
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,160
..that should be a rich golden brown.

436
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,640
It's going. It's going.

437
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,840
OK.

438
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,640
I'm going to make another caramel.

439
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,840
Looks good. Looks good.

440
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,680
I will caramelise my walnuts and I will try to do some sugar work, maybe.

441
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,200
This is sticky work.

442
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,680
- That's definitely not happening. I'm starting again. 
- Why does that happen?

443
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,240
- I don't think there was enough water in it. 
- OK, OK.

444
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,000
Mary said one tablespoon - I'm going to break the rules.

445
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,600
MEL GASPS

446
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,280
- Stu! 
- I know, it got me in trouble in the last round, didn't it?

447
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,400
- Is this wise? 
- Well, I need caramel.

448
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,760
I'm worried that it's not melting. The sugar's not melted completely.

449
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,040
I'm going to start again.

450
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,400
HE SIGHS

451
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,920
BIRDSONG

452
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,560
Now, it's nearly 20 minutes. Opening the door,

453
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,040
I don't want to open the door.

454
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,880
They look fine. Nice rise, nice bounce.

455
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,520
Perfect.

456
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,280
Oh, no.

457
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,960
It's not even.

458
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,560
That's my disaster.

459
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,640
Because when I arranged the racks, I didn't put it properly.

460
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,240
It was tilting.

461
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,520
Could you prop it up on some walnuts? No, that's ridiculous.

462
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,360
- No. No. 
- No, no.

463
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,720
- Don't stir it. 
- Are you sure?

464
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,120
Just slowly, slowly. It will just all go all at once.

465
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,200
It's bubbling a little bit, but not enough.

466
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,600
Mary's recipe stipulates an unusual meringue-style frosting.

467
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,560
I'm just looking at the ingredients and it says four tablespoons

468
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,400
of water into egg whites, caster sugar and cream tartar.

469
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,640
It just seems a bit odd to be putting water into a meringue.

470
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,400
So, is this the right thing to do?

471
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,840
The meringue ingredients should be whisked over a pan of hot water.

472
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,040
I think it's meant to be light, fluffy and shiny.

473
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,160
If the sugar doesn't dissolve completely,

474
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,040
the frosting will be grainy.

475
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,160
I'm whisking it until it's very white, very sticky up the side

476
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,280
and a lot more voluminous.

477
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,040
It feels like it's almost at the right consistency now.

478
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,080
Perfect.

479
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,160
Doesn't look like it's going to stay up for me.

480
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,520
Bakers, you've got ten minutes.

481
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,560
I don't know about that. I don't think my caramel's happening.

482
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,440
Back in the game with this caramel. Third time.

483
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,840
Let's try to assemble it now.

484
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,680
The cakes should be sandwiched with vanilla buttercream

485
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,000
to create a perfectly level finish.

486
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,560
SHE GASPS

487
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,240
Ah, no. Nothing happened.

488
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,120
I'm just going to cover it with the meringue and that's it.

489
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,720
Five minutes, please, bakers. Five minutes.

490
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,480
Holy shenanigans.

491
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,720
It's like render.

492
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,280
I'm just checking to see how steady your hands are.

493
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,240
- God, they're awful. 
- Thank God you're not a surgeon.

494
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,480
I need to get a couple of walnuts in here,

495
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,400
even if I can only get one in.

496
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,480
Right, bakers, Mary's walnut Technical Challenge is now closed.

497
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,800
I've noticed that I'm the only one that's left the sides completely uncovered.

498
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,280
Please bring your bakes up and pop them

499
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,760
behind the photo of yourself on the gingham altar.

500
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,320
Mary and Paul are expecting 12 perfect walnut cakes

501
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,720
with three even layers of sponge,

502
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,600
sandwiched with buttercream and covered with a smooth, shiny

503
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,760
meringue-style frosting, plus ten caramel-coated walnuts.

504
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,080
Start with this one. The icing doesn't look too bad, does it?

505
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,720
It's quite smooth.

506
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,680
We've got a good height.

507
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,840
The nuts are cut fairly small.

508
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,960
They're even within the sponge.

509
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,840
Sponge is very good.

510
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,400
Buttercream good, and the icing is slightly crystallised.

511
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,240
- Mm, they haven't cooked it out. 
- Very slightly.

512
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,920
Moving on to number two.

513
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,480
Nice layers.

514
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,360
Oh, dear.

515
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,880
- Granular. 
- Yeah.

516
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,600
That's a shame.

517
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,160
Now, this looks more like it, doesn't it? You see the swirls.

518
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,680
Nice sponge on this.

519
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,840
Very grainy, again.

520
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,400
It's a very nice sponge.

521
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,280
- Mm, chopped the nuts quite well in there. 
- Yes.

522
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,760
The icing, though, is like eating sugar.

523
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,880
Now, we've only got one walnut

524
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,880
and I've got a sort of feeling there may have been a disaster.

525
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,480
I think there was an attempt at a caramel right on the end.

526
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,400
What's the texture like?

527
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,960
- Soft, not quite whisked enough. 
- No.

528
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,080
Right, let's move on.

529
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,760
Now, this looks OK.

530
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,360
- Nice swirly effect, good appearance. 
- Nice sponge.

531
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,200
Now, this person has gone to a lot of extra trouble.

532
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,600
- Very good marshmallowy topping. 
- It's much smoother.

533
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,760
Now, moving on to number eight.

534
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,480
- It's nice and even, isn't it, the layers? The buttercream. 
- Yes.

535
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,160
The caramel has flowed a bit round the nuts, but I rather like that.

536
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,000
- It looks quite nice. 
- Good colour.

537
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,360
- Something happened to the icing here. Perhaps there wasn't enough. 
- Perhaps. 
- Perhaps.

538
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,800
- It's not there, anyway. 
- No, it's definitely not there.

539
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,960
I don't know where the rest of it's gone.

540
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,360
- Very grainy. 
- Very grainy.

541
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,640
The nuts seem to have all crammed into one area, haven't they? Right to the edge.

542
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,080
I think the nuts could have been chopped up a little bit smaller, couldn't they?

543
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,480
- Lots of buttercream, isn't there? 
- A little bit uneven.

544
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,160
- I think the walnuts are just a little bit coarse. 
- A little bit too big, yeah.

545
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,200
- Finally, on to number 12. 
- Three even layers.

546
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,920
The frosting is quite neat. However...

547
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,560
It's granular.

548
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,680
- Very granular. 
- Yeah.

549
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,680
Paul and Mary will now reveal whose walnut cake was technically perfect...

550
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,360
and whose wasn't.

551
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,960
Last place is this one. Whose is this?

552
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,920
- Everybody else covered their cake, and that was a key criteria. 
- Yeah.

553
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,680
11th position is this one.

554
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,400
Paul is tenth, Sandy is ninth, Ian eighth,

555
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Mat is seventh, Flora sixth,

556
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,120
fifth is Dorret, and Tamal comes in fourth.

557
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,200
And in third place, very nice finish in this,

558
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,520
lovely swirls.

559
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,360
And in second place is...

560
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,240
..this one. Whose is this?

561
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,480
It's a nice cake, lovely caramel on the top,

562
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,840
and it did look very attractive as well.

563
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,880
I expect you all know who number one is.

564
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,240
Who is number one?

565
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,840
A beautiful sponge - lovely layers.

566
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,720
It's a perfect cake and it's what we asked for.

567
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,080
- Thank you. 
- Well done.

568
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,440
- It was awesome! 
- SHE LAUGHS

569
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,440
- It was amazing. 
- Well done.

570
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,960
- Very nice. 
- Well done. 
- Good work.

571
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,560
That made up for the Madeira cake!

572
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,080
I'm pleased that I managed to pull it off at the last minute,

573
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,720
that that caramel is not going to ruin me, you know what I mean?

574
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,240
I'm here to be judged, and they've judged me

575
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,640
and they've put me in 12th place, and I'm OK with that.

576
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,200
No, of course I'm not. I don't want to be 12th place!

577
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,360
HE SIGHS

578
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,240
One challenge remaining.

579
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,720
A last opportunity to claim Star Baker.

580
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,080
A final chance to avoid being the first to leave the Bake Off.

581
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,480
Who's strong for you, Mary?

582
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,080
Oh, I think Marie.

583
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,320
She was the one that was calm, got on with her own thing.

584
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,760
- I think Flora did really well. 
- MEL: She did.

585
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,160
MARY: And Nadiya did very well.

586
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,200
But then in the Technical Challenge, Nadiya was last.

587
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,880
If you cut a walnut into four pieces, that's too big.

588
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,840
- So, I'd say half that. 
- An eighth?

589
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,160
I wasn't going to make it as precise as that.

590
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,520
- But you are as precise as that. 
- What about the men?

591
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,520
Tamal came fourth in the Technical.

592
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,400
Alvin came second and I actually liked his Madeira, too.

593
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,760
Who is in real trouble?

594
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,680
Stu really didn't make a good Madeira cake.

595
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,600
And likewise, Ian is another one.

596
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,080
And Paul... Particularly in trouble at the moment.

597
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,480
I think you'll stay, mate. I think you're all right.

598
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,200
- I hope so. 
- I'm not so sure. 
- He's had a weak start.

599
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,000
Bakers, good morning, welcome to your Showstopper Challenge.

600
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,720
We're going to be taking you back to the 1970s today,

601
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,640
when Mary was rocking out with some wing collars to Boney M,

602
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,440
and Paul was dancing on his own to The Nolan Sisters.

603
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,200
- Times haven't changed for Paul. 
- No.

604
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,720
What we're asking for in this challenge is

605
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,520
a Black Forest gateau, which graced many a menu back in the 1970s.

606
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,280
You've got three and a half hours.

607
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,800
- On your marks. 
- Get set! 
- BOTH: Bake.

608
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,440
It's a classic from my era, along with the prawn cocktail

609
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,160
and the steak Diane.

610
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,440
It's very retro and I wasn't even there.

611
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,240
This is the first Showstopper so they've got to show off,

612
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,920
they've got to impress us.

613
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,120
We want to see good chocolate work, it's got to look special.

614
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,840
60g.

615
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,880
You've got to choose your sponge wisely

616
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,520
to go inside the Black Forest gateau.

617
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,360
You want something light like a genoise or a whisked sponge.

618
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,320
But traditionally, a chocolate sponge. Simple enough.

619
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,440
I'm mixing the dry into the chocolate butter mixture.

620
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,480
If you mix the dry ingredients into the eggs, you start getting clumps

621
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,720
and you have to beat it quite a lot to get rid of those.

622
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,360
Tamal's aiming for a rich, dark chocolate sponge,

623
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,440
which he'll fill with a cherry ganache before enveloping his gateau

624
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,000
in a tempered-chocolate collar.

625
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,480
The cake, when I practise at home, it's been pretty good.

626
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm definitely not in chilled-out mode,

627
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,440
so I don't really want to be chilled out until it's all done.

628
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,960
A classic Black Forest gateau is a decadent blend of chocolate,

629
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,280
cherries, fresh cream and Kirsch liqueur.

630
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,320
But not everyone's a purist.

631
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,000
- Morning, Stu. 
- Morning, Paul. Morning, Mary.

632
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,920
Right, buddy, what's your interpretation

633
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,360
of the Black Forest gateau?

634
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,880
OK, I've called it Purple Forest gateau,

635
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,120
because I've used beetroot in it, so it's a nice moist cake.

636
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,840
You don't think the original sponge was moist enough?

637
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,320
It's pretty moist, but I just wanted to do something slightly different with it.

638
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,360
Stu's beetroot and chocolate sponge will be sandwiched together

639
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,680
with a mascarpone cream, then covered with Italian meringue.

640
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,880
You're going to show off your chocolate work.

641
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,240
What is your chocolate work?

642
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,880
OK, so it's going to simply be some truffles...

643
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,080
and also some chocolate trees around the outside.

644
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,600
Good luck, mate. Are you all right for time at the moment?

645
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,760
I think I'm fine for time.

646
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,280
Pink is a very hard scale to gauge.

647
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:03,000
Flora's also decided to give the '70s classic a bit of an update.

648
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,560
Cherry powder makes it quite pink, but not quite pink enough,

649
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,440
so I'm going to add a little bit of colouring.

650
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,800
Flora's going to layer her cherry and chocolate sponges

651
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,760
with fresh cream and cherries.

652
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,320
She'll decorate it with chocolate and Kirsch truffles.

653
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,080
I've got all the classical elements.

654
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,480
All that retro is still there, but are they too pink?

655
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,040
I'm not sure.

656
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,200
I had my bedroom walls painted fuchsia pink for a very long time.

657
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,280
We'll try and avoid tacky pink.

658
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,440
I like working with chocolate.

659
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,440
I like working with alcohol. This is the perfect bake for me.

660
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,520
Dorret plans to fill her gateau with a cherry chocolate ganache

661
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,040
and chocolate mousse.

662
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,280
She's making two types of sponge.

663
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,640
Now, explain to me what an Alhambra sponge is.

664
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,480
Well, the first part is made with a sabayon warmed in the bain-marie.

665
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,520
Then the melted butter. And then cocoa and flour.

666
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,440
And it makes a very dense, rich sponge.

667
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,240
- This isn't looking brilliant, actually. 
- Give it a good whisk.

668
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,400
SHE CHUCKLES

669
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm going to have to start this one again. This isn't working.

670
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,600
- MEL: Oh, Dorret, really? 
- It's not supposed to look like this.

671
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,960
Don't panic, and just make sure you get it right. You've got mousse, you've got lots of things going on.

672
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,960
You've already started, you're in control, you've got hours left.

673
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,680
- We'll leave you to it. 
- Thank you. 
- Thanks, Dorret. 
- Good luck.

674
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,160
Cakes are going in the oven now.

675
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,960
I thought I'd do four thin ones

676
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,680
cos I'm absolutely terrible at slicing.

677
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,360
So, I'm making one big sponge, slicing it in two.

678
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,640
It's a liquid chocolate cake, so you add boiling water to the batter.

679
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,280
It makes for quite a sticky, gooey chocolate cake,

680
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,680
which is exactly what we want.

681
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,320
Nadiya will layer her sponges with chocolate ganache

682
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,840
and a smooth cherry jam,

683
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,040
before covering it in a chocolate mirror glaze.

684
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,800
They're a little bit liquid, so I've got to be really careful.

685
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,440
Come on.

686
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,520
TIMER BEEPS

687
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,520
Both Ian and Sandy are planning to bake more than just sponge.

688
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,040
I've been to the Black Forest on a few school trips,

689
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,960
beautiful part of the world, and the Black Forest gateau

690
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,200
we had there had this shortbread base.

691
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,120
On top of her chocolate shortbread, there'll be three chocolate sponges

692
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,560
layered with cherries and fresh cream.

693
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,040
My last practice one was like...

694
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,000
Ooh, it was straight. It was powerful.

695
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,840
It had that real sort of trendy look, you know.

696
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,520
I try to model myself like that as well.

697
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,120
Random with a trendy twist.

698
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,440
The base is going to be one huge macaroon,

699
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,760
which I think works very well.

700
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,240
Macaroon's something I make quite a lot of.

701
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,360
I'm going to play to my strength here.

702
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,880
Ian's chocolate macaroon will sit underneath a genoise sponge,

703
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,240
topped with a giant three-dimensional chocolate tree.

704
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,680
This tree - are you piping it out, or what?

705
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,480
So, it's going to be essentially made of caramel, that will give it the strength.

706
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,640
And then it's going to be covered in chocolate,

707
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,400
and maybe if I have time, I'll pipe some little flowers and maybe some animals.

708
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,080
Animals? We have had no animals yet.

709
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,040
I can't wait to romp in your forest, Ian. Looks lovely.

710
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,320
- The animals, Mary. 
- Thank you!

711
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,480
OK, bakers, that's one hour remaining. One hour.

712
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,080
Happy with it.

713
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,640
I'm happy with the overall appearance.

714
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,040
They're darker than I would have liked.

715
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,120
But I think that's going to be OK.

716
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,720
Oh, no, they need a bit longer.

717
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,360
My Alhambra sponge is going in the oven - it will take about 12 minutes to cook.

718
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,120
At two hours, I expected all the cakes to be done,

719
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,360
so I'm about 12 minutes behind.

720
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,560
I'm just about to take my cakes out, if you...

721
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,400
- Go ahead 
- Just a last check. 
- No, go ahead.

722
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,160
- MEL: That oven's doing lovely things to your hair, Marie. 
- Is it?

723
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,000
It's lovely. It's like being at a Rod Stewart gig. It's great.

724
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,360
MARIE CHUCKLES

725
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,960
Marie's genoise sponges will be layered with fresh cream

726
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,240
and a cherry syrup - all decorated with dark chocolate ganache

727
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,680
and a copse of tempered-chocolate trees.

728
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,600
Your ganache that you're putting on the top -

729
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,240
is that just going to be a disc of ganache just covering the top,

730
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,000
- or is it going to come down the side as well? 
- Hopefully, it will dribble down beautifully.

731
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,600
And not along the sides. So, just come down as if it's...

732
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,960
You want it to cascade down the sides a little bit?

733
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,000
Yeah, uh-huh, I think so. I think that might be quite a nice look.

734
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,320
- OK. 
- All right.

735
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,120
They still look pretty pink on the inside.

736
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:36,240
They feel quite different to how they felt at home. They're springy. So that's good.

737
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,080
That's how they rise at home. They're a nice soft consistency.

738
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,960
You get a nice thick layer of cream in there, it'll treble in size.

739
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,040
Paul will decorate with a tempered-chocolate tree bearing fruit

740
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,760
and cherries.

741
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,840
This is one cake the governor hasn't shared in prison.

742
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,760
Presumably, all your bakes have to go through an X-ray machine?

743
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,600
We're not that high security to do that, but, er...

744
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,400
Oh, good to know.

745
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,920
I sense this is not a laughing matter for you, Paul.

746
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,560
- I'm backing down now. 
- Not with security, that's for sure.

747
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,600
I'm just assuming the position. Cuff me.

748
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,520
It's a nightmare for security...

749
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,240
They shouldn't be rising like that.

750
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,720
Got a little bit of a rise that I wasn't expecting.

751
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,680
But they're cooked and they're dense,

752
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,840
which is how they're supposed to be.

753
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,480
As the sponges cool, work can begin on showstopping decorations

754
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,240
- and fillings. 
- Mm.

755
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,240
So, the jam is just tinned cherries originally.

756
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,160
We'll try to get up to about 104 ...in temperature.

757
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,920
There's a bit of technical knowledge.

758
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,600
Matt's cherry- and-Kirsch-flavoured jam

759
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,160
will be spread on his chocolate brownie cakes.

760
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,000
I've done it twice at home. So this is, so far, the most accomplished dish.

761
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,640
Third time - shouldn't be any problems.

762
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,080
So, I'm just preparing my mixture for my shiny chocolate glaze.

763
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,320
It's like a mirror effect on the cake.

764
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,160
Alvin's mirror glaze will smother layers of almond chocolate sponge

765
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,800
that will be topped with shards and curls of tempered dark chocolate.

766
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,600
Confidence is growing,

767
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,600
because I feel like I'm in control and I think I've got plenty of time.

768
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,800
All depends on the tempering of the chocolate.

769
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,400
The only way to create crisp, shiny chocolate is to temper it.

770
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,160
Tempering chocolate is quite a tricky thing to do.

771
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,840
It's a process where slowly heating the chocolate

772
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,840
breaks down the sugar crystals in the cocoa butter.

773
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,840
You've got to not overheat it, and then lower the temperature

774
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,280
by usually adding little bits of chocolate to it.

775
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,360
As it cools, the crystals reform, creating a glossier chocolate to decorate with.

776
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,240
I'm just trying to cool it down, ideally to 31 degrees.

777
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,040
I'm looking for 32.

778
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,440
I don't know what I'm looking for. Just saw everyone else do it.

779
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
I don't know what temperature it's got to be.

780
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,200
Just looks good, don't it?

781
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,920
Yeah, looks quite good.

782
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,200
- Ian, when I think of the Black Forest... 
- Mm.

783
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,720
..my first thought is - elephants.

784
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,480
You know all the elephants that roam around there?

785
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,400
The savanna that is the Black Forest.

786
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,160
Exactly!

787
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,840
Ian's not the only baker venturing beyond the forest for inspiration.

788
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,840
When I found out what we were going to make,

789
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,120
the first thing that came into my mind is the cherries falling out,

790
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,600
and I thought a saucer and a cup would look nice on a cake,

791
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,200
like on sideways,

792
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,840
falling over, and cherries are spilling out of it.

793
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,680
Ugne's chocolate tea setting

794
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,840
will top her three buttermilk chocolate sponges.

795
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,040
- Are you making cups and saucers? 
- Yeah.

796
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,400
Nice. UGNE CHUCKLES

797
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,560
I've got two colours for my chocolate,

798
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,880
so I'm going to pipe it on to my acetate, let that dry

799
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,320
and then cover it with a whole layer of dark chocolate,

800
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,200
so it will form the collar around my cake

801
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,320
and when I peel it off, hopefully there'll be a really nice shine.

802
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,960
I hope it will look good on the final cake.

803
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,760
I don't want it to look too much like a small child has done it.

804
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,120
Bakers, you've got half an hour, half an hour

805
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,560
till you bring your Black Forest gateaux to be judged.

806
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,200
So as that hits 32, it's coming out, it's going in that piping bag,

807
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,200
cutting the end off, piping some trees,

808
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,360
let them go off, finish off doing the cake,

809
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,080
cover it in Italian meringue.

810
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,280
Come on.

811
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,640
Kirsch in there.

812
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,680
You're supposed to measure this, aren't you, but...

813
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,800
The danger...

814
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,640
If you oversoak the sponge, it's going to be super-saturated,

815
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,160
it's not really nice to eat.

816
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,760
SHE GASPS

817
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,440
It does look delicious.

818
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,000
You enjoying that?

819
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,040
I just don't want to compromise how it looks.

820
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,800
Rather than putting it in a ring, I'm trying to get it out again.

821
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,000
Just put acetate around, and then when I'm done with it, I just lift it off.

822
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,440
So, it's a good way of doing it and being able to see the level of the cake at the same time.

823
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,000
The mousse is not going to be set. Needs to go back in the fridge.

824
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,840
This is my mirror glaze.

825
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,760
It's got gelatine in it, so it sets nice and firm.

826
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,320
It gives it a really clean look.

827
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,840
Panicking inside.

828
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,920
You can still see elements of the sponge underneath, which is a shame, really.

829
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,480
I don't really believe in luck, but I think, you know, if I stay calm

830
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,640
and keep pushing, I'm going to be all right.

831
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,360
OK, bakers, you have five minutes...

832
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,320
before we will be gambolling through your forests.

833
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,920
Is that enough time for this? Is there any point doing this?

834
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,400
- Yes. Yes. 
- Going to do it. I'm doing it.

835
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,080
Come on.

836
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,680
Is less is more, or more a winner?

837
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,440
That's what I need to think now.

838
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,480
Not bad, not bad.

839
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,960
I don't know if it needs it.

840
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,680
HE GROANS

841
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,000
SHE TUTS

842
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,760
(No!)

843
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,480
I can't believe this is actually happening.

844
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,920
- Dorret, what's to be done? 
- Nothing.

845
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,800
Oh, no, no, no, come. There's lots to be done.

846
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,200
- Piping is a great thing. There's no need to get upset. 
- There's every reason. 
- No, because it's just a cake.

847
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,120
- It's not just a cake. 
- It is just a cake.

848
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,200
It's just a cake.

849
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,920
Bakers, Showstopper time is up.

850
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,720
That doesn't mean you're going to go home.

851
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,960
It doesn't mean you're going to go home.

852
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,320
- We'll see. 
- It tastes great. It tastes great. You're all right.

853
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,080
It's judgment time.

854
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,480
Flora, would you like to bring your creation up?

855
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,760
You've made a very big cake.

856
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,880
Having said that, you've broken it up with detail.

857
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,720
- And that piping all the way round is sheer perfection. 
- Mm.

858
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,520
I like that. The textures are good. It's soft. It's moist.

859
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,720
I was nervous about that cherry sponge but it works very well.

860
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,720
It was brave of you to do it.

861
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,920
Maybe a little bit more kick from the kirsch would have been better.

862
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,600
- There's not much alcohol coming through. 
- OK.

863
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,360
This looks impressive.

864
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,320
I think it looks very theatrical.

865
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,200
You've shown us that you can do some nice chocolate work on the top.

866
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,640
I want to get in there.

867
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,920
- The sponge is disappointing. 
- Oh. 
- It is very, very close.

868
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,440
It's not good.

869
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,320
Oh, that's disappointing.

870
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,880
It is a different presentation.

871
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,120
It's very simple but those trees are absolutely stunning.

872
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,480
When you look at that it screams that it is Black Forest gateau.

873
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,880
The sponge looks very light.

874
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,840
I love it.

875
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,640
- Oh! 
- SHE LAUGHS

876
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,800
The sponge is lovely. It's beautiful and soft.

877
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,840
Lots of cream in there. The cherries have a nice kick to it as well.

878
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,240
Tastes absolutely wonderful. It's a sort of classic.

879
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,680
As classic as you can get. You should be proud of that.

880
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,720
It's just for me it looks too simple.

881
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,000
It looks totally modern.

882
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,320
There's good flavours.

883
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,160
Did you soak that as well - the sponges?

884
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,720
Yes, with kirsch syrup.

885
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,080
Yeah. You can taste that all the way through it.

886
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,600
I think you've made a fantastic looking cake.

887
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,120
You've really done the chocolate well.

888
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,680
Everybody loves a chocolate brownie

889
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,520
and that's a different thing to put in a Black Forest gateau.

890
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,720
I think that tastes exceedingly good.

891
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,560
The tempering of the chocolate

892
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,160
and the way you have done the tree, I think, looks impressive.

893
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,920
I like the distinct layers you've got.

894
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,680
The texture in the sponge is fantastic.

895
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,360
The flavours are coming through, nice rich chocolate.

896
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,800
That is a good cake.

897
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,040
A different idea to show us that you can do shortbread at the bottom

898
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,800
but I don't know how much it adds to it, really.

899
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,280
The piping around the top...

900
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,240
it looks like it's from the '70s.

901
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,320
I've tried many times to put collars round cakes and it's...

902
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,200
particularly first time in a tent,

903
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,960
it was jolly difficult, and you've achieved it.

904
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,800
That's great. The cherry juice you put in the ganache,

905
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,880
you've got a nice sharpness coming through.

906
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,200
Marries really well with the beautiful sponge

907
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,480
which is lovely and soft,

908
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,440
and then the cream with the cherries in it as well.

909
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,440
You know you're eating a Black Forest gateau

910
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,320
- but you know you're eating something special, too. 
- It's very good. 
- Well done. 
- Thanks very much.

911
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,560
Stu, would you like to bring your forest to the judges?

912
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,760
Erm...

913
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,440
It's interesting what you've done.

914
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,720
I like the idea of the Italian meringue.

915
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,760
We are looking for some tempered chocolate or skills with chocolate.

916
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,600
Let's have a look inside.

917
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,600
If I remember rightly you've got a beetroot-flavoured cake.

918
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,320
What beetroot does is it brings colour and moisture to a sponge.

919
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,000
On a Black Forest gateau, to use it as a carrier to put more cream

920
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,960
in between, what that does is just closes the texture up even more.

921
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,560
And so what you're left with is almost it feels it's got

922
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,120
the texture of a raw sponge going through it.

923
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,640
It's quite contemporary, it's minimalist.

924
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,040
I think it looks really smart.

925
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,520
The shine on there I think is wonderful.

926
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,880
It's all down to the flavour.

927
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,160
- Beautiful. 
- Lovely. 
- Yeah. The textures are quite soft

928
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,840
and they almost melt in the mouth.

929
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,440
You've got that nice sharpness of a fresh cherry coming through as well.

930
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,800
- Very different and very good. 
- Thanks. Fantastic.

931
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,720
Would you like to come up, Dorret?

932
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,160
INAUDIBLE

933
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,120
What happened?

934
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,640
I had to re-do one of the sponges so that put all my timings out

935
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,360
so my chocolate mousse didn't set.

936
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,800
It's a shame. It looks like a mud slide.

937
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,960
I've got a sort of feeling it's going to taste rather good.

938
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,800
Now, the Alhambra sponge, is this the denser one sitting at the top?

939
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,400
Yeah.

940
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,800
It's like rubber. Like chewing on a rubber tyre.

941
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,640
There's no aeration in them.

942
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,760
The bottom layer is good. It's got a beautiful chocolate flavour in.

943
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,200
Lovely flavour of the cherries and the kirsch.

944
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,000
However, it looks a bit of a mess.

945
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,120
I think you should be proud of this.

946
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:29,360
It's totally different and you promised we'd get the odd animal.

947
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,040
- An elephant is an odd animal in the Black Forest! 
- A rabbit... 
- It really is! 
- Exactly.

948
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,560
- It looks quite clean, sharp, neat. 
- Yeah.

949
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,040
But let's hope it looks the same inside.

950
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,040
I think it's rather clever to have that different base.

951
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,560
You've shown us many skills, that you can make a good macaroon.

952
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,720
I think its fantastic. You've really got a good blend of flavours in there

953
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,920
and it looks very, very smart, too.

954
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,240
Phew! Thank you very much.

955
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,200
Mary and Paul will now take stock of the weekend and decide who

956
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,560
will be this year's first Star Baker and who will be leaving the tent.

957
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:31,520
It's been a mammoth day on the old Black Forest Gateau Showstopper.

958
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,760
- It wasn't a mammoth, it was an elephant. 
- It was an elephant of a day.

959
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,120
- Can you see the wood for the trees, guys? 
- Tamal did well.

960
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,200
- Yeah. 
- I thought the collar was a fantastic idea.

961
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,400
I think Marie has done very well.

962
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,440
I think Flora has to be mentioned, too.

963
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,720
And Nadiya, particularly in the Black Forest cake.

964
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,840
It was absolutely superb.

965
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,400
Can I focus on the bottom end of the spectrum?

966
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,600
Stu had quite a lot of work to do.

967
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,200
He tried to vary each different thing and it just didn't work.

968
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,960
Ugne, look at the Technical, she was first, but she struggled

969
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,520
in the Signature, and I think she struggled again in the Showstopper.

970
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,440
What about Dorret, who had a very unfortunate day at the office?

971
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,400
Yes, it was just what happens in the Bake Off at the last minute.

972
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,960
It's just the mousse, the mousse, the mousse.

973
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,160
If you fail on a Showstopper you're in trouble.

974
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:23,120
Just finally, for people watching at home, when they're thinking about

975
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:27,840
making a Black Forest gateau, how small should the cherries be chopped, Paul?

976
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,640
MEL: An eighth?

977
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,560
- MARY: Sixteenth. 
- Go away. 
- Oh!

978
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:54,920
Bakers, congratulations. A very busy and brilliant weekend.

979
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,520
I have the great job this week.

980
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,280
I get to announce Star Baker.

981
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:05,720
Now, Star Baker this week goes to somebody whose Madeira had

982
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,440
a magnificent crack.

983
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,320
Plus the Showstopper featured trees

984
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,760
so large they would dwarf even the redwoods of California.

985
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,160
This week's Star Baker is

986
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:21,080
Marie. Congratulations, lovely. Congratulations.

987
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,880
I have the slightly less pleasant task this week.

988
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,480
We can't take you all with us into next week

989
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,320
so I'm afraid the person who won't be joining us next week is...

990
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,920
..Stu.

991
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,000
- So sorry, Stu. 
- So sorry, Stu.

992
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,280
Come on. In you come.

993
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,120
CHATTER

994
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,280
It's a shame to be the first to go but I just got out-baked

995
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,000
and had a couple of mishaps but it's been an awesome experience.

996
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,960
I'll remember this for ever and...

997
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,920
Oh, well. Back to music.

998
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,680
Stu never got started. He just tried to be too clever.

999
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,840
It wasn't a true Black Forest cake.

1000
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,960
Then you go and put beetroot in it and meringue on the top.

1001
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,320
It certainly wasn't his week.

1002
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,600
You don't get in that tent unless you are a good baker.

1003
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,800
He should be very proud of himself getting this far.

1004
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,280
The problem is you're the bottom of a pack of great bakers.

1005
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,120
Every time I go into the tent, I think, "Am I really here?"

1006
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,560
And it's just wonderful that I've got Star Baker.

1007
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,600
Now, "Have I really done that? Are you sure?"

1008
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,360
So, I got away with it.

1009
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,840
My mum said, "If you get kicked out in the first round

1010
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:43,080
"don't bother coming home," so it's quite nice that I can fly home

1011
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,440
and be greeted by my parents.

1012
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,640
That will be quite lovely.

1013
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,560
CHATTER

1014
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:54,040
The wife will be pleased. At least I will be able to go home tonight and sleep comfortably, that's for sure.

1015
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,280
Live to fight another week. Yay!

1016
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,520
CHATTER

1017
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,440
It's been like that. And I've got the taste for it now

1018
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,600
and it's just, I want to keep going, I want to keep going.

1019
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,280
- Well done. I'll see you next week. Get some rest. 
- Yes, yes.

1020
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:13,080
I actually feel as though I've been initiated truly into what Bake Off really means.

1021
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,560
I want to go home and I just want to put my feet up and have a good rest.

1022
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,920
CHATTER

1023
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,880
Cup of tea - no cake!

1024
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,960
Next time...

1025
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,480
It's starting to look a bit like a snail.

1026
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,200
'.it's biscuits.' Ooh!

1027
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,160
- With a Signature Bake... 
- Oh!

1028
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,760
..that's baked twice...

1029
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,360
Oh, I know. Jenga.

1030
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,240
..the thinnest Technical Challenge ever devised...

1031
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,480
This thin.

1032
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,720
- ..and show-stopping biscuits... 
- I've just snapped it.

1033
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,600
..presented in show-stopping boxes...

1034
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,880
made from show-stopping biscuit.

1035
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,960
Nothing shall escape. Not even the macaroons.

1036
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,600
- But who is cut out... 
- I'm so happy about it.

1037
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,080
- ..to be Star Baker... 
- Come on.

1038
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,720
..and whose Bake Off dreams will crumble?

1039
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,840
If I leave you're coming with me.

1040
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,080
I'll take that.
