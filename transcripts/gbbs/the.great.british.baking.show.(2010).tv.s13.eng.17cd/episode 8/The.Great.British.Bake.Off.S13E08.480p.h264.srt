00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,055
Hello, viewer, it is pastry week.
What's your favourite pastry, Noel?

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,535
I love a flaky pastry, Matt.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,935
Hmm me too. Like this fella here.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,615
Listen, mate, I can't pay you back
this week. Something's come up.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,015
Also, I know I said I'd give you
a lift to the airport

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,295
but it's not gonna work out.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,335
Ah. So flaky!

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,095
So flaky.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,535
Welcome to The Great British
Bake Off.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,855
Last time it was custard week.

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,695
Is there such a thing as
too much custard? No! No.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,975
Sandro looked set for success...

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,975
A little bit of the sauce.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,415
...But it was Syabira...

15
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,375
The judges are gonna be smashed!

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,615
...who conquered custard...

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,935
That custard gateau is impressive.

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,375
...and earned the Star Baker crown.

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,975
Janusz melted under pressure...

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,695
My ice cream didn't set.

21
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,655
...but in the end it was
Kevin who had his final wobble...

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,175
Oh, no.

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,855
...and became the latest baker
to leave the tent.

24
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,535
I'm nothing but proud, really.

25
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,855
Now...

26
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,695
I wanna see baking nirvana.

27
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,895
...it's the quarterfinal...

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,695
Should have paid attention.

29
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,415
...and pastry week.
Oh, my God.

30
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,255
The final five face
a super-sweet signature...

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,295
I don't wanna present raw pastry!

32
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,335
...and get on a roll
with a tricky technical...

33
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,415
Manga tout.

34
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,775
Man jay tout?
Ooh, that's got confusing!

35
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,415
...but it's back to school
for some...

36
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,695
Too much maths!

37
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,455
...with a spectacular
storybook showstopper.

38
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,935
Ahhh! That's hot.

39
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,295
But who will have
a fairy-tale ending...

40
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,135
Shame it wasn't
an ice cream competition.

41
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,055
...and for whom is this chapter
about to come to a close?

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,575
It is just mind-blowing right now.

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,215
I can't believe it. I reached
the quarterfinal.

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,495
It's exciting times.

45
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,415
Good luck, babe.
Best of luck, you too.

46
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,575
Dude, best of luck, man.

47
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,815
It is just mind-blowing right now.

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,455
I mean, I can't believe I'm here.

49
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,495
I'm now surrounded
by all star bakers.

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,015
We just don't know who's leaving.
It could be anyone.

51
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,775
But there is no weak link.

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,775
Quarterfinals, quarterfinals,
quarterfinals. Yeah!

53
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,255
I think now there's the stage that
any mistake can eliminate you.

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,055
There is no room
for a bad bake now.

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,135
Bakers, welcome back to
the tent for pastry week.

56
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,015
Uh, Noel what immediately springs
to mind when I say the word "party"?

57
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,775
Oh, Studio 54, 1977,

58
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,455
Bianca Jagger comes in
on a white horse.

59
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,215
Andy Warhol's there supping prosecco

60
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,615
out of Evel Knievel's chest wig.

61
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,575
That's right, vol au vents.

62
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,575
For your quarterfinal
Signature Challenge

63
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,535
the judges would like you
each to bake

64
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,055
a batch of 12 sweet vol au vents.

65
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,375
Your vol au vents should be made
from beautiful, flaky,

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,855
rough puff pastry and filled with
a sweet mouthwatering filling

67
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,055
of your choice.

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,055
You have two minutes,
and one hour and 58 minutes.

69
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,535
On your marks. Get set.

70
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,215
Vol au vents!

71
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,415
I have never heard
of, like, vol au vents before.

72
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,735
Do you know, it's just like party
food you get from the supermarket?

73
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,975
Vol au vent - it's
something so from '70s.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,295
It's pastry week.
We've given the bakers two hours

75
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,055
to produce sweet vol au vents.

76
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,855
Now, traditionally, we think
vol au vent, we think savoury.

77
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,695
But we've put a slight twist on it.

78
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,015
Ancl they're normally savoury.

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,375
This is sweet vol au vent.
It's like another new level.

80
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,975
Puff pastry lends itself
to either sweet or savoury.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,575
The key thing is with this challenge
is getting that lamination

82
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,895
and getting that
beautiful golden colour and crisp

83
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,215
on the vol au vent itself.

84
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,135
The filling has to pack a punch.

85
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,575
It can be anything they like.

86
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,375
It needs to be both light
so they don't spoil

87
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,295
the flakiness of the pastry,
but they need to be flavourful.

88
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,655
It's the quarterfinal
and we're expecting

89
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,295
nothing but perfection from
our five amazing bakers.

90
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,815
I think with my signatures,
usually I'm calm.

91
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,215
Then again, things
can still go wrong.

92
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,895
I mean, uh, you never know.
It is the tent after all.

93
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,895
Because this is
the quarterfinal

94
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,415
Paul and I will be really ruthless.

95
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,935
I mean, we have to have
everything perfect.

96
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,295
I think at this time
in the competition

97
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,095
any little mistake
will be picked on.

98
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,575
We'll see.

99
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,135
Syabira, hello.
Hello, hi. Good morning.

100
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,095
Good morning, Syabira.

101
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,255
Star Baker last week.

102
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,135
It's in the past now.
Again. It's clean slate this week.

103
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,815
Again. Again.
Tell us about your vol au vent.

104
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,695
It's called citrus dreams
vol au vent.

105
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,015
It's a pastry case
and then inside it's gonna be

106
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,615
orange and mandarin and,

107
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,175
I put a little bit hint
of clove and cardamom

108
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,855
to enhance
the flavour of the orange itself.

109
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,455
So what's actually in
the vol au vent?

110
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,975
Have you got a creme pat
in there, or...?

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,455
It's a... orange and mandarin
cream cheese.

112
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,335
Oh, orange. Oh, right OK.

113
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,015
Enhanced with orange liqueur,
Syabira is hoping

114
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,655
the citrus cream cheese-filled
vol au vent will be enough

115
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,335
to maintain her strong run
in the competition,

116
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,335
landing her Star Baker
for a third week running.

117
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,655
That sounds good.
Are you comfortable with this one?

118
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,455
I hope so.

119
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,935
Do you wanna be in the semifinal?

120
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,215
Course she does!

121
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,135
I want to. How much?

122
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,175
Very much. Honestly very much!

123
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,535
All right, good luck. Good luck,
Syabira. Thank you. Thank you.

124
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,535
Maybe they expect something
more like creme pat

125
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,495
but I tried with the custard.

126
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,295
It's just, it's not enough
to enhance the flavour

127
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,815
so I hope I'm making
the right decision here.

128
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,615
Yet to match Syabira's success...

129
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,295
I just lose track of, like, time.

130
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,215
And then at the end
I start panicking.

131
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,695
...Abdul is keen to impress

132
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,015
with his take on
the classic vol au vent.

133
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,135
My vol au vents, I,

134
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,775
I don't have much rise on them

135
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,535
because that's how
I just prefer them.

136
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,335
Because if I get too much rise
they go wonky.

137
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,615
Hi, Abdul. Hello. Hello, Abdul.

138
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,935
I don't want to spook you

139
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,295
but you are the only baker
who hasn't had Star Baker.

140
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,695
Yes, I know, yes!

141
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,575
So what about doing it today?
No pressure.

142
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,255
I will try. So, you know, each week
I've been giving my best.

143
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,615
What I find always helps you
with your confidence

144
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,775
is someone reminding you that you
haven't been Star Baker

145
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,415
at the beginning of the day!
Yeah, yeah.

146
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,415
I'm prepping him.
I want him to do it.

147
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,935
Abdul's path to success lies

148
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,255
with vol au vent clipped
in chocolate

149
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,335
topped with strawberries

150
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,015
and filled with a berry compote
and coconut creme pat.

151
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,495
I heard that Paul just likes

152
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,215
the feel of coconut on his feet.

153
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,055
So he grates up coconuts,
puts it on his carpet

154
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:39,495
and his lovely fake-tanned feet just
crunching away on coconut shavings.

155
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,255
It's an image, innit?
It is. It is indeed.

156
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,175
You take that with you
through to the semifinal.

157
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,335
Rough puff pastry consists
of four simple ingredients...

158
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,455
So this is just flour,
water, salt and butter.

159
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,855
...and one baker keen
to keep his flavours

160
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,455
in the same vein is janusz.

161
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,775
Strawberries and cream.

162
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,135
You know, it's a classic one,
so hopefully they will like it.

163
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,455
Janusz. Hello.
Hello, janusz. Hello.

164
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,175
Tell us about your vol au vent.

165
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,575
I've decided to make basically
strawberries and cream.

166
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,215
Is it whipped cream inside it or...?

167
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,495
Uh, I'm gonna make creme pat. That
holds strawberries much better.

168
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,935
Janusz will fill each rough puff
vol au vent

169
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,335
with fresh strawberries covered
in a summer fruit liqueur glaze.

170
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,055
He's planning to put a twist on
the classic combination

171
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,375
by replacing the more traditional
cream base with custard.

172
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,775
So you've got creme pat cream
and strawberries.

173
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,695
Well, creme pat and strawberries.
OK.

174
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,015
Yeah. No cream. No cream.

175
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,535
OK and how are you gonna make sure
your creme pat's not gloopy?

176
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,135
Well, I'm gonna try it.

177
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,015
If it's gloopy I'm gonna replace it
with whipped cream!

178
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,295
Or? I've got a plan for it.

179
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,335
If it's gloopy,
it's gonna be whipped cream

180
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,695
and then you're gonna know
that it was gloopy.

181
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,015
The plan is to grate
some frozen butter

182
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,295
and use that for the lamination.

183
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,295
The key to successful lamination...

184
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,015
You don't want the butter
to be soft at all.

185
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,335
You want it to still stay cold.

186
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,015
...lies in keeping the layers
of pastry and butter

187
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,175
as cool as possible.

188
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,535
I'm gonna grate my frozen butter.

189
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,095
It looks like cheese.

190
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,215
Cold, cold,
cold, and never melt your butter.

191
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,975
Failure to do so means
the butter will ooze out,

192
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,335
the layers will be lost

193
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,935
and the vol au vents
will have no rise.

194
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,375
They go to the freezer now.

195
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,495
But one baker is throwing
caution to the wind.

196
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,175
Everyone else is using cold butter.

197
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,135
I actually need
room temperature butter.

198
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,735
Still want chunks
of butter in here.

199
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,055
Maxy plans to fill her
experimental vol au vent

200
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,255
with Chantilly cream

201
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,735
laced with gooseberry
and cloudberryjam.

202
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,895
She's hoping to avoid any butter
leaks by selecting a robust pastry.

203
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,375
I've used strong bread flour

204
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,695
and I used, like,
room temperature butter

205
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,135
which I broke up into pieces.

206
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,575
So you used room temperature...
Yeah.

207
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,655
...popped it in, folded it initially
and then popped them in the fridge.

208
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,215
Yeah, and I used ice-cold water
as well.

209
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,575
And how many folds did you give it?

210
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,775
Three. So...

211
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,735
Three singles or three book?

212
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,375
Three... Three doubles. Yeah.

213
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,895
Three doubles.

214
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,695
OK.

215
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,695
While still keeping his pastry cold

216
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,295
Sandro is putting
a different twist on his dough.

217
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,295
I'm just really coating
this with sugar.

218
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,215
So there's a lot of caramelisation.

219
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,055
He's also hoping
some inside knowledge

220
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,535
will give him the upper hand.

221
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,735
So I'm making a key lime cheesecake
vol au vent.

222
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,495
I chose these flavours
because I want to get a handshake.

223
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,535
And Paul loves... that's his
favourite dessert is Key lime pie.

224
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,175
Sandro aims to get Paul onside

225
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,215
with his version of
the classic Key lime pie

226
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,895
using a lime creme pat,

227
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,775
lime jam and ginger biscuits

228
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,095
but, as it's his favourite,
Paul's expectations are sky-high.

229
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,415
OK so what limes are you using?

230
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,415
Are you using Key limes
or are you using Persians?

231
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,295
I'm using limes.

232
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,495
Green ones! Any, any limes. Oh,
I like, I like the Key limes. Oh!

233
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,655
Bakers, you are halfway through!

234
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,855
It's getting a bit soft now

235
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,295
so I'm gonna quickly pop it back
in the freezer.

236
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,615
I'm gonna allow it to chill again.

237
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,015
Refrigerate it for 20 minutes
and then it's time to bake.

238
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,415
As their pastry chills,
the bakers now have

239
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,815
the opportunity to make
a start on their fillings.

240
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,455
My pastry is chilling.
I'm making my creme pat.

241
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,775
Now I'll start making the custard.

242
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,335
I'm putting in coconut extract which
should enhance that flavour.

243
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,855
I've got two jams to make.

244
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,935
Gooseberry and cloudberry.

245
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,535
Mandarin cordial, orange zest,
a little bit of clove and cardamom,

246
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,855
cream cheese and whipping cream.

247
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,255
I'm just making cream
in case my custard is gloopy.

248
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,095
Lime jam.

249
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,055
I mean, it tastes like lime,
it's thick how I want it to be.

250
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,975
Hello! Hi.

251
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,975
How's it going, do you want me to
touch all your stuff?

252
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,335
You can touch if you want. It is...

253
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,695
What's that for?
It's for doing egg wash on my, uh...

254
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,135
Egg wash. Yeah.
I egg-washed a priest once.

255
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,095
What?!
He wasn't looking.

256
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,015
Bit of a bust-up, just egg-washed
his legs.

257
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,855
Came out lovely, all crispy.
Oh, gosh.

258
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,415
This has gone weird, innit? Yes!

259
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,575
Hmm, that is lime.

260
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,055
That is definitely lime.

261
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,735
In creating their vol au vents...

262
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,615
Now I'm gonna roll it
and do the shells that I want.

263
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,935
...speed is of the essence...

264
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,295
I'm gonna roll this out
into a rectangle.

265
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,695
...as the shells must be
assembled and baked

266
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,015
before the temperature of
the pastry rises and butter melts.

267
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,695
It has to be nice and neat
but at the same time not to try

268
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,695
and melt the butter too much.

269
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,015
Base layers nice and thin.

270
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,415
I'm gonna have 12 bottoms
and then 20 for tops.

271
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,255
A typical vol au vent shell is
formed by

272
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,935
layering hollow circles
of pastry into a tower.

273
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,855
But, once again, Maxy
has other ideas.

274
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,895
They are squares.

275
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,135
I'm going for a square-shaped
vol au vent.

276
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,935
Maxy. Yes, darL Tell me if it's
gloopy. You be the judge. OK?

277
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,495
It's on the thicker side.

278
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,055
If you've got cream,
put some cream in it.

279
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,655
Whipped cream. Mm.
OK, I will.

280
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,695
Bit of egg wash after egg wash.

281
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,135
And then it's going straight into
the oven. How long do we have left?

282
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,415
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

283
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,335
Exactly what I thought.

284
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,775
Matt, all this talk
about handshakes.

285
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,015
Have you had a handshake? Hmm.

286
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,935
I mean, I've never had a handshake.

287
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,655
What, in your life? No.

288
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,375
Would you like one? Yeah.

289
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,935
How did that feel?
Oh, it was nice.

290
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,135
Was it all right? Yeah.

291
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,775
The difference is Hollywood's palms
are very hairy.

292
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,655
I know. He makes me comb the hair
on his hands sometimes.

293
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,535
They need to be baked
for about 20 minutes.

294
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,095
I've put about ten to 15 minutes.

295
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,695
So it's 190 degree.

296
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,375
13 to 15 minutes.

297
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,575
Don't know what's gonna happen in
the oven. You just don't know.

298
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,295
I don't wanna get my hopes up
too high.

299
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,295
<i>SANDRO GASPS</i>

300
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,255
Oh. It's not been on.
My oven's not been on.

301
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,575
The oven wasn't hot.

302
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,975
I forgot to press
the, the on button.

303
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,735
So could still work out

304
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,175
and it could be
an absolute fail today.

305
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,455
Give me the custard.

306
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,055
Just give me the custard.

307
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,655
With assembly time at a premium...

308
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,175
It's only two-hour challenge.
We're all gonna struggle.

309
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,295
Vol au vent brown.
Why is it not browning?

310
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,095
...it's essential they have
any other elements prepared.

311
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,375
Just gonna prep everything.

312
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,775
I'm just chucking in
my little strawberries

313
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,335
into my elderflower syrup.

314
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,615
Quick and easy to make.

315
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,655
It's gonna be a tight one
as per usual.

316
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,615
This biscuit is not
the most important thing

317
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,015
so, as long as these keep
its shape, then it's fine.

318
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,255
I found out that I cannot make
custard, so there we are.

319
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,575
I moved on to make my summer fruit
punch glaze.

320
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,935
This is the pecan praline
with orange zest.

321
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,895
Important thing is this berry

322
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,215
and the custard cools down really
enough before I put it in the shell

323
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,575
because, or else
the shell goes all soggy.

324
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,495
See, I could never be a baker cos
I don't like the early starts.

325
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,815
I am the same as well. Are you?

326
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,335
I am not a morning person at all.

327
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,975
What time do you go
to bed at night?

328
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,455
I, my usual time is about 1.30
to, uh, two o'clock, uh...

329
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,815
Oh, really? Yes, yes. And when do
you wake up then in the morning?

330
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,415
Ancl I wake up around,
9, 9:30, 10.

331
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,415
Do you know what? I think
you should probably go

332
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,935
and get yourself checked out because
you might actually be a teenager!

333
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,135
I haven't got...

334
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,055
I think it's cooked. Really?

335
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,535
It's gonna be the worst vol au vents
I've ever made.

336
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,095
They're not golden yet.

337
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,815
Ancl they're really leaning.

338
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,095
I think it's done cos I can see
the bottom is actually golden.

339
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,095
If the bottom is golden
remove them.

340
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,415
All right, I'll take it out.

341
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,895
The butter is leaking, actually.

342
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,175
It's the first time I've seen
the butter is leaking out.

343
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,495
They're OK. They're laminated.

344
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,615
They should be fine.
They go to the freezer now.

345
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,095
It's cooked.

346
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,415
I'd say...

347
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,055
...another five minutes,
but that's really cutting it short.

348
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,775
I don't wanna present raw pastry.
Oh, God!

349
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,095
Now, Matthew, if you're a good boy
and you do the time call well

350
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,855
you can have a chocolate.

351
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,095
Bakers, you have 15 minutes!

352
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,855
There you go, good boy.

353
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,335
15 minutes and they're not
even out the oven. Ha-ha!

354
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,895
They look terrible.
They're all wonky.

355
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,375
The, the butter's just coming out.

356
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,295
It's just oozing out.
Everything is lopsided.

357
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,895
There's not even one perfect one.

358
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,735
I'm just piping some cream
onto my vol au vents.

359
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,615
It's just whipped cream.

360
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,495
Think custard worked out in my head
but not in real life.

361
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,135
I'm gonna sprinkle some
praline at the bottom

362
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,095
cos it's gonna sit at room
temperature for a while.

363
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,855
I'm just taking out
the middle bit now

364
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,255
so I can fill it
with the custard.

365
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,615
They look like Yorkshire puddings,
they do.

366
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,255
Look at this business...
Mess.

367
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,255
Oh, are they a bit flat
or something?

368
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,055
Not happy at all.

369
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,055
But it's all right. It'll do
for today. Nothing else I can do.

370
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,095
Not sure anyone's ever said "it'll
do" on Bake Off. Yeah, it'll...

371
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,695
What's happening with
these trousers today?

372
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,015
Thought I'd go with leather trousers
so it's easy to clean.

373
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,295
Show Prue your leather trousers

374
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,215
and she'll forget about
the height of your vol au vents.

375
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,015
She'll forget, yeah! Good luck.

376
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,975
I'll sit there like that with my...
just. ..Vol au vents.

377
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,015
Handshake from me!

378
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,775
You know what? I'm just gonna take
'em out. Got no choice.

379
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,175
What a disaster, eh?

380
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,895
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

381
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,015
How great do these look?

382
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,215
I am just gonna pipe it in.

383
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,855
I don't know if I can even put
the cream in.

384
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,615
I can't believe this, honestly.

385
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,775
Full of ginger - I can smell it.

386
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,855
Ah, I'm pushing myself
and I'm breaking my shells.

387
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,415
Cos it's warm,
it's just too liquidy.

388
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,255
This is really not good.
Really, really, really not good.

389
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,135
Oh, my God.

390
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,815
So hopefully everything
will be perfect

391
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,135
because if you're doing classics
you cannot really go wrong on them.

392
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,655
Ah, stress!

393
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,495
This is so risky.

394
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,015
Just the final bits left,
so just pushing myself.

395
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,895
Ah breathe, breathe, breathe!

396
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,335
Bakers, your time is up.

397
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,695
Please step away from your bakes.

398
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,975
Bit messy.

399
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,535
Why?

400
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,895
Look how BLEEP they look.

401
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,735
Maxy, it's OK.

402
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,455
It's judgement time for
the bakers' sweet vol au vents.

403
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,295
They're not even a quarter of the
height I expect them to be. Mm-hm.

404
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,095
Uh, so they are very flat
and very pale.

405
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,015
I think the butter leaked as well.

406
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,055
This is the first time where
the butter leaked.

407
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,935
There's no butter on there at all.
It's bone dry.

408
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,975
It's OK, the chocolate's solidified
round the side.

409
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,655
It's so pale and so thin it's almost
just a sheet of puff pastry

410
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,415
with bits on the top. OK.

411
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,215
I think you've got
too many flavours in there.

412
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,015
Because there are too many flavours

413
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,055
you can't taste anything
individually, and it's a bit murky.

414
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,455
Bit under baked and too thin.
Ancl too complicated. Poor Abdul.

415
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,695
That's OK. Could we think
of something nice to say?

416
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,295
Welcome to the quarterfinal!

417
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,855
Thank you so much, guys.

418
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,215
They're all over the place,
aren't they? Yeah, yeah.

419
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,055
We didn't ask for a leaning tower
of Pisa.

420
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,095
You've got a burnt biscuit sitting

421
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,535
on top of quite a dark
and very low vol au vent.

422
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,855
The flavour is amazing.
But it needs to be much lighter.

423
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,495
Vol au vents should be nice
and light and airy.

424
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,415
You, it melts in the mouth. Yeah.

425
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,415
Pastry's over baked
but think the flavour is fantastic.

426
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,855
I don't agree that
the ginger biscuit's burnt.

427
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,695
That's burnt! What do you think?

428
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,015
I think it looks over baked.

429
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,335
Thank you. Here am I trying
to help you, Sandro!

430
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,535
He's brutal today, in't he?

431
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,895
He IS brutal today.

432
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,375
They're quite attractive. I quite
like what you've done

433
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,375
with the strawberries on the top
with the glaze.

434
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,535
They're a bit uneven.

435
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,895
Probably needed
a little bit longer in the oven.

436
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,735
They're a little pale
for a vol au vent.

437
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,495
How did you get on with the creme
pat? What creme pat? What creme pat?

438
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,895
Oh, it never happened!

439
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,895
Oh, I take it gloopy, then.
It never happened!

440
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,935
So what we've got here
is creme Chantilly, is it?

441
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,415
It's just whipped cream. Just cream.
Strawberries and cream.

442
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,055
This is really still raw inside.

443
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,455
It's a bit boring

444
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,375
because all there is
is cream and strawberry

445
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,255
and pretty dry vol au vent.
HE HUFFS

446
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,015
It's a shame, actually.
The creme pat would've worked

447
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,495
if you'd put cream with it.

448
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,295
Thank you.
Thank you.

449
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,055
My vol au vents decided to go
for a dance in the oven.

450
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,575
Um, they spread, you know,
they're all over the place.

451
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,655
Bit irregular in size.
Bit irregular on height,

452
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,375
a bit irregular on colour. Not very
appealing to look at. I know.

453
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,895
A bit dry. And quite flat.
Yeah. I...

454
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,455
I expected them to be much higher.

455
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,415
Square's actually quite difficult
to do.

456
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,015
Round is easier, which is why most
vol au vents are round.

457
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,375
I think they needed a longer
bake time, for sure.

458
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,975
Probably. Were you rushed for time
at the end? I was. Yeah.

459
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,375
It's just raw down at
the bottom here.

460
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,055
Really thick band of raw pastry.
Really under baked, isn't it?

461
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,135
Sorry.

462
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,415
I had a terrible time
making them, so...

463
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,615
Oddly I didn't think both jams
would work, but they do.

464
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,135
The gooseberry and the cloudberry
are, are delicious.

465
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,495
Unfortunately, you do get that
overriding flavour

466
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,495
of raw pastry sitting there
on the bottom. Thank you.

467
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,895
Thanks, Maxy. OK.

468
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,975
They liked the flavours, though.

469
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,895
Yeah, I knew they were
going to be raw.

470
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,295
Oh, gosh.

471
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,295
I like the overall look of them.
I think they look quite authentic

472
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,095
and all pretty much
the same size as well.

473
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,455
Nice height. Looks like you've
trapped the butter inside it

474
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,975
because you get the height without
the lamination on the outside.

475
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,975
The pastry's just about
cooked through.

476
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,935
It's a little doughy in the middle.

477
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,455
Probably about two minutes away
from being perfect.

478
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,575
What did you put down at
the bottom? The orange praline.

479
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,175
Cos that's gone back to a liquid

480
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,655
because it's got liquid on top
of it. Which is nice.

481
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,095
I think the flavours are beautiful.
I really do.

482
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,375
This is a delicious vol au vent.

483
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,695
The custard inside is light

484
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,335
and the pecan praline
is just delicious.

485
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,655
Think you've done a nice job
with those vol au vents, well done.

486
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,855
Thank you. Thank you.

487
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,175
Well clone. Thank you.

488
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,735
Paul says two minutes from perfect.

489
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,135
If I have those two minutes.
I don't.

490
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,855
The rise - Pauls aid it should be
four times. That's a bit crazy.

491
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,175
The flavours were good.

492
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,535
But it's pastry week
so I do have to be

493
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,135
a bit worried, seeing
as I had undercooked pastry.

494
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,495
Pauls aid it was boring.

495
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,055
Well, strawberries and cream,
you cannot go wrong with it

496
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,575
but, at the same time,
I can understand why it's boring.

497
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,215
I feel like if it was
just perfectly risen

498
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,335
and all of that, I would've got
my handshake today. Huh-huh!

499
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,015
I don't even want it now.
Now, I don't want it. At all.

500
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,135
The bakers have no idea
what they'll be asked to make

501
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,455
in the mystery that is
the Technical Challenge.

502
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,255
Bakers, it's time
for your Technical Challenge

503
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,935
which today has been set by

504
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,935
Prue-lio lglesias!

505
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,655
Ah, we love your music.

506
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,455
Ah, so sexy. Yeah.

507
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,575
Even better without the moustache.
Yeah. Agreed.

508
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,615
Will you give us some words
of advice, please?

509
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,375
Bakers, there are 29 ingredients
in this recipe.

510
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,735
So please get the balance right.

511
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,775
As ever, the Technical Challenge
will be judged blind

512
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,135
so we're gonna have
to ask Prue-lio Englesias

513
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,095
and Paul Hollywood to leave
the tent.

514
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,655
They'll probably kiss.
Yeah.

515
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,335
For your Technical Challenge,

516
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,935
Prue-lio would like you
to make eight spring rolls.

517
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,535
Featuring a delicate pastry
that have been deep-fried

518
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,215
to crispy perfection.

519
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,455
And they must be served
alongside a dipping sauce.

520
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,855
You have one hour and 20 minutes.

521
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,095
On your marks.
Get set. Bake!

522
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,135
Aye aye 6Y-

523
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,655
What is this, mate?

524
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,215
Right. The deep fryer.

525
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,055
I am quite surprised with spring
rolls, I'm not gonna lie.

526
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,975
Never made them before.
First time making them.

527
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,495
It's new thing to do.

528
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,495
My mum she used to make them,
but I don't remember much, though.

529
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,455
Should've paid attention.
Should've paid attention.

530
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,815
Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out
what I'm doing. I don't know.

531
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,895
So Prue, spring rolls.

532
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,735
I mean, I don't think many
people make spring rolls

533
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,415
but I thought
it's a great test.

534
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,895
After all, it is the quarterfinal
and it's quite difficult.

535
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,415
So the pastry's tricky.

536
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,735
Ancl I think we'll have some
of the bakers struggling

537
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,975
with huge great bubbles

538
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,455
and those bubbles come
because the water's in the pastry.

539
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,815
<i>And we haven't tom them
how much water.</i>

540
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,055
If it's too wet the bubbles will be
huge and ugly and misshapen.

541
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,535
But they should be more like this
one, which is absolutely smooth.

542
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,855
I think it's a great challenge.

543
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,295
It's nice to have something
savoury in the tent, actually.

544
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,135
Yeah, isn't it? When we
have so much sweetness.

545
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,655
All crispy. Nice thin pastry
with a beautiful breakdown

546
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,655
of all that filling together.

547
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,695
You've got a bit of everything
in there.

548
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,375
It's a great snack.

549
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,895
Sorry, what did you say?!

550
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,735
It's easy for you to say, Prue.

551
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,015
Mm!

552
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,295
The first part is make
a stiff dough and rest.

553
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,615
I just don't know how
much water to put in.

554
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,415
I'm literally just guessing.

555
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,055
Maybe one more tablespoon.

556
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,415
You have to not add a lot.
It's quite stiff.

557
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,295
A stiff dough is required
for a smooth shell.

558
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,055
I think my dough is very stiff.

559
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,055
At the same time it has
a nice spring.

560
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,935
If the bakers add too much water,

561
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,455
unsightly bubbles
will appear when fried.

562
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,135
It says stiff dough.
But it is a bit smooth.

563
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,655
Maybe it's a bit too soft - I don't
know. How is it meant to rest?

564
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,655
Are we meant to cover it,
or what do we do?

565
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,535
All right, soak the noodles
and wood ear mushrooms.

566
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,695
What even is that?
Wood ear mushrooms?!

567
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,015
Perfect.

568
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,015
These mushrooms look so weird.

569
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,935
Is this your mushrooms? Yeah.

570
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,535
Do you ever go foraging?

571
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,935
A long time ago.

572
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,615
Did anyone go with you or
you just took it upon yourself?

573
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,975
Me, uh, me and my neighbours.

574
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,015
You and your neighbours?! I suppose
it's big, isn't it, in Sweden?

575
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,895
Yeah. They're like they're more
in touch with nature.

576
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,295
With nature, definitely.

577
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,175
Pretty much always naked
and eating mushrooms.

578
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,935
Do you miss those times? Um...
The sort of mushroom nakeds?!

579
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,335
Getting kidnapped by your neighbours
and going foraging!

580
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,015
I miss those times!

581
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,535
If you tried that now, wouldn't work
out, I don't think. Not in Peckham.

582
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,855
No. I don't even live in Peckham.

583
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,895
So then I need to cut
cabbage and manga tout.

584
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,655
Man jay toot?

585
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,615
Mang toot?

586
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,295
Is this a mange-tout?

587
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,775
Cut into fine...
This must be man jay-tout.

588
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,215
I don't really do
these kind of foods.

589
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,775
OK, I need to cook these

590
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,095
but it doesn't really say how much
of what to put in.

591
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,495
Well you know you need to figure out
the proportions.

592
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,535
That was expected
on a technical this week.

593
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,015
So that black mushroom
is very strong taste,

594
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,335
you don't want to put
too much in it.

595
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,615
Ah. Forgot about the mushrooms.

596
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,895
Oh, they're massive, man.

597
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,455
I think I need to chop them.

598
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,095
Bakers, you are halfway through.

599
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,015
I'm gonna start panicking now.

600
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,015
I'm starting step number four.
Knead the dough

601
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,735
and divide it into eight
equal pieces.

602
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,095
Roll out one piece of the dough
to eight centimetres circle.

603
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,535
Repeat with another piece of dough

604
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,175
so you have two
eight-centimetre circles.

605
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,695
Sprinkle the top of one of

606
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,055
the circles of dough
with cornflour.

607
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,575
Then place the other one on top.
Ancl then roll it to 22 centimetre.

608
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,255
Whoo, that's got confusing! Wow.

609
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,855
Too much maths!

610
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,295
This is like a full-speed
spring roll-making competition.

611
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,135
I don't know how people can get this
done in one hour and 20 minutes.

612
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,535
Place the two circles of dough in
the pan and cook on both sides.

613
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,975
Right, quick!

614
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,735
Fold the dough in half so that you
have two transparent wrappers.

615
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,255
Perfect, I can see my fingers.

616
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,855
So now I need to trim each wrapper
into square shape.

617
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,815
I'm on step number seven, uh,

618
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,895
which is assemble
and seal the spring rolls.

619
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,775
Paul and Prue demand
sumptuous spring rolls

620
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,455
packed full of flavour.

621
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,335
The technique for filling is put
a good, generous amount

622
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,335
so they've got a taste
of everything.

623
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,015
They get things to taste -
delicousness-ness-ness-ness.

624
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,055
If short-changed...

625
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,135
I don't want too much of this.

626
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,735
...the dominant taste
will be the pastry shell.

627
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,535
Maxy, do you make
this sort of thing, often?

628
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,495
I BUY this sort of thing often.

629
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,255
Yeah. When I saw we had an hour
and 20, I was like,

630
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,975
I'd just go down the takeaway.

631
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,535
I'd get some spring rolls,

632
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,455
I'd probably get
a chow mein while I'm at it.

633
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,615
What's stopping you?

634
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,935
Well, we don't have that luxury

635
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,615
of leaving this place!
Oh, that's a shame.

636
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,175
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

637
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,415
I need to fry them. Oh.

638
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,735
Bye-bye, babies!

639
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,095
In order to achieve the crisp golden
brown shells Paul and Prue expect...

640
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,255
Sounds like frying.

641
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,655
...the oil temperature
needs to be hot enough...

642
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,975
That is 180 degree.

643
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,335
...they must be fried
for long enough...

644
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,055
They need to cook for another maybe
three to four minutes, really.

645
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,855
...and be monitored carefully.

646
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,295
Let's swap side.

647
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,735
But it's no mean feat...

648
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,975
Sauce... Sauce. I'm multi-tasking.

649
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,535
...when the bakers have
clipping sauces to prepare.

650
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,055
The list doesn't say a thing,
so we're just gonna wing it.

651
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,175
I think it will be difficult
to get the right blend, definitely.

652
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,455
Soy sauce.

653
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,815
Fish sauce.

654
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,095
Palm sugar.
Why is this so stressful?

655
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,175
I'm gonna taste
and then I'm gonna adjust.

656
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,135
Ugh!

657
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,335
That is horrible! Oh, bleurgh!

658
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,735
They're turning to the raw side.
Turn to the other side, dudes.

659
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,255
So it's eight.

660
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,855
They're looking crispy.

661
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,335
Matt, would you buy that? Yeah.
I've already got a deep fat fryer.

662
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,575
No not the...

663
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,095
That was a nice way of putting,
"Er, no!"

664
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,015
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

665
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,255
Oh, my goodness!

666
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,615
This is crazy!

667
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,855
Come on, guys. These are coming out.

668
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,375
Uh-oh. I just under-fried it
but I don't think I have time.

669
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,935
Come on, time is very tight.

670
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,455
None of them cracked.

671
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,375
Come on.
I think I made mine too small.

672
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,015
Come on, buddy.

673
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,895
I'm ready for this technical
to be over.

674
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,495
Bakers, your time is up.

675
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,215
Oh, God, they're tiny!

676
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,975
Please bring your spring rolls down
to the gingham table

677
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,735
and place them behind
your photographs.

678
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,335
Mine are so small compared
to everyone else's. Oh, God.

679
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,615
Doesn't matter.

680
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,735
Paul and Prue are expecting eight
identical spring rolls

681
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,015
with crisp golden-brown pastry,

682
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,335
a delicious filling

683
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,655
and a perfectly balanced
dipping sauce.

684
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,135
So, start with this one.

685
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,175
There's a LOT of bubbles in this.

686
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,535
That means there's too much water
in the dough.

687
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,455
Yeah. And it's not been
fried enough.

688
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,855
It's still quite raw -
you can see how clear that one is.

689
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,415
It should've stayed in there
a little longer.

690
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,735
Let's have a look inside.

691
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,135
Filling looks quite good.

692
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,335
Yeah, it looks busy,
doesn't it?

693
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,935
The flavour's good.

694
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,655
Dipping sauce is nice
and sharp as well.

695
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,495
It just needs to be deep-fried
for longer.

696
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,175
Yeah. Right.

697
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,055
Moving on, they're a bit dinky
but they're quite crispy.

698
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,535
The issue is there's not much
filling. It's all pastry.

699
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,895
Ancl because it's mostly
pastry it's a bit stodgy.

700
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,855
Hmm. I mean, it tastes OK, just not
enough filling. Yeah.

701
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,375
OK, the next one.
Let's have a look. Crispy.

702
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,335
Lovely crack when you cut it.

703
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,895
But the air holes
are a little bit big

704
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,095
so it's probably
a little bit wet.

705
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,735
Lots of mushroom in there.

706
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,055
There is, isn't there? Yeah. Hmm.

707
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,415
There's a little bit
too much mushroom.

708
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,215
It's definitely
a mushroom spring roll.

709
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,655
OK. Moving on, they're
all roughly all the same size.

710
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,495
The bubbles are there but not quite
as big as some of the others.

711
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:44,375
Nice blend inside.
The actual mixture content is good.

712
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,655
I like the crisp pastry very much.

713
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,895
It's beautifully thin, that pastry,
and the dipping is nice. Lovely.

714
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,295
OK moving on to the last one here.

715
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,775
There's only seven, not eight.
It's a shame we're missing one.

716
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,055
What? I made eight!

717
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,455
These air holes are huge.

718
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,735
It's a pity, because where it's
crisp, it's really nice.

719
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,535
The pastry is delicious
and very crispy.

720
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,735
And the sauce is good.
But where's the eighth?

721
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,695
Paul and Prue will now rank

722
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,215
the spring rolls
from last to first place.

723
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,775
In fifth place we have this one.

724
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,215
Maxy, too small, too much pastry,
not enough filling. Yeah.

725
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,935
In fourth, we have this one.
Whose is this?

726
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,855
Syabira,
it's not been fried enough.

727
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,175
In third place is this one.

728
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,975
Abdul, bit too much mushroom.
But they were good.

729
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,415
In second spot...

730
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,975
...we have this one. Whose is this?

731
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,375
Pretty good.
But where was the eighth?

732
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,535
Deep-fried eight,

733
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,975
seven ended up on the plate,
don't know what happened.

734
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,535
Genuinely!

735
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,015
Who atejanusz's spring roll?

736
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,815
Probably me!

737
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,615
Well, that means in first place,
we have Sandro.

738
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,975
The pastry was excellent.
Delicious and lovely clipping sauce.

739
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,175
Well clone.

740
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,055
Ha-ha!

741
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,415
That's what my kid does.
He's like "Aah!"

742
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,895
Yeah, now that I've got
the tech win

743
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,175
it has evened me out and I'm just
trying to secure my spot.

744
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,495
I made eight spring rolls.
Ancl there were seven.

745
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,415
Still came second.

746
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,495
Not bad.

747
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,415
It's very tough competition
at the moment.

748
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,895
Other bakers is really good.

749
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,735
So tomorrow I would
need to be more focused.

750
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,655
We are all just neck
to neck, literally.

751
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,135
It is just too close
to call between all of us.

752
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,815
Gonna make sure I have
a good rest and

753
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,655
smash it tomorrow, hopefully.
Hopefully.

754
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,255
I hope I... I hope I will.

755
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,815
The bakers have just one more
pastry challenge...

756
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,935
Good luck, guys.

757
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,895
...in which to impress the judges.

758
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,415
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

759
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,815
It's time for your pastry
showstopper challenge.

760
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,775
Now, for your showstopper
this week

761
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,255
Paul and Prue would like you each
to bake an incredible 3D pie scene

762
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,655
inspired by your favourite childhood
story or nursery rhyme.

763
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,095
Your scene can either be
sweet or savoury

764
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,855
but must consist of eight pies,
shaped and beautifully decorated.

765
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,535
Hickory dickory dock,
you have four hours on the clock.

766
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,295
On your marks.
Get set. Bake!

767
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,815
OK. I'm so scared.

768
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,175
I've got 12 pages to my recipe
for one bake.

769
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,255
I've got a book for my one bake.

770
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,575
I mean it is the quarterfinal

771
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,935
so you've got to give it, like,
your absolute best.

772
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,415
The showstopper challenge our bakers
have to face

773
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,255
is a storybook pie scene.

774
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,855
We want the bakers to create
a scene

775
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,175
that's instantly
recognisable when we look at it.

776
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,055
So it could be any nursery rhyme,

777
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,455
any children's story,

778
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,775
it is down to the bakers,

779
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,655
but the star of this
particular challenge

780
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,735
has to be the crust.

781
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,375
When I cut into the pie I wanna
see a beautiful, thin pastry,

782
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,855
creating a beautiful, buttery
flavour with

783
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,575
a filling that packs a punch.

784
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,135
I know what's my favourite.
Pork pie.

785
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,215
Can the bakers make
a really good pastry

786
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,975
that properly holds their filling?

787
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,295
Ancl that is all about not getting

788
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,095
the filling too wet, which
will make for a soggy bottom

789
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,615
and not have it too stiff,
so that it's too dry or hard.

790
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,455
This is pastry week
and to be honest I'm not happy

791
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,295
with what they've created
so far. They should be doing better.

792
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,935
We've got five fantastic bakers.
There is no room for error.

793
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,295
If they just crack out eight perfect
pork pies, I will not be impressed.

794
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,975
I wanna see baking nirvana.

795
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,615
Abdul. Hello.
Hello, Abdul. Good morning.

796
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,975
Tell us all about your pie scene.
What are you doing?

797
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,055
Um, so my pie scene is based on
the book Treasure Island.

798
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,095
Ancl the curry that I'm bringing is
called Khatta Baingan which means,

799
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,495
uh, bittersweet aubergine.

800
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,855
Inspired by his mum's recipe

801
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,255
Abdul hopes to strike gold this week
with his Treasure Island theme.

802
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,575
He's making a selection
of sweet and savoury pies

803
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,855
depicting the island,

804
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,215
boat and chest
in meticulous detail.

805
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,535
So the pie scene itself
will have an island,

806
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,815
uh, that will be made out of,

807
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,175
uh, apple and blackberry
crumble tart.

808
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,935
This sounds great. I mean...
Well, it sounds good.

809
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,295
...the idea of the apple
as the island

810
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,615
and the curry as,
as the ship. Yes.

811
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,095
What pastry is that sitting in?

812
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,575
Um, so the pastry I'm making,
I'm making two types of pastry.

813
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,455
There's sweet shortcrust
and there's a shortcrust.

814
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,735
It sounds good. Good luck, Abdul.

815
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,375
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

816
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,735
The bakers can use whichever
pastry they wish

817
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,775
when creating their
fairy tale bakes.

818
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,335
Get this into a breadcrumby,
sweets pastry.

819
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,095
Selecting the correct type of pastry
and filling is crucial

820
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,535
as they need to take into account

821
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,855
both flavour
and structural integrity.

822
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,135
Initially I'm making a filo pastry.

823
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,575
But that is not sturdy enough.

824
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,535
So this is the hot oil pastry.

825
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,855
It's like hot water crust
but hot oil.

826
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,735
Syabira, good morning.

827
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,295
Hello, good morning. Hello.

828
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,015
Tell us all about your pie scene.

829
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,415
I am making jack And The Beanstalk
today.

830
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,175
I admired jack during my childhood

831
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,655
cos he could climb up
his very tall beanstalk

832
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,775
up to the sky.

833
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,575
And I was little at that point
and I can see the coconut tree,

834
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,415
actually very high up to the sky.
So I try to...

835
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,495
So this is jack
and the Coconut Tree!

836
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,415
Jack and the Coconut Tree
in Malaysia!

837
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,935
And, just like
the protagonist in her story,

838
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,935
Syabira is aspiring to reach the top
spot again this week

839
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,935
with her elaborate two-tiered
structure

840
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,615
complete with jack, a giant,

841
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,975
his castle and
of course the beanstalk,

842
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,815
all fashioned using
a unique Malaysian pastry.

843
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,175
Your filling is?
Chicken rendang filling.

844
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,655
It's a very traditional filling
that I really like.

845
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,135
I usually eat it with rice.

846
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,935
You could put rice
and that into a pastry.

847
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,655
It's too much carbs - you don't want
that on your calorie counter!

848
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,695
No, no, no, I do, I really do!

849
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,135
Is it? I never know people
put rice in a pie!

850
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,495
Look forward to this, cos these
flavours sound amazing.

851
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,295
Thank you. They do.
Good luck. Thank you.

852
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,535
Thank you.

853
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,975
As well as ensuring
the pastry's fit for purpose

854
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,335
the bakers must carefully choose
what goes inside their pies.

855
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,095
For the Chana dal I'm basically
gonna cook it in, in, in water

856
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,015
because it takes about 40 minutes
for it to, like, go soft.

857
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,295
The aubergine and the potatoes are
kind of the main, main aspect of it.

858
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,135
Ancl it seems that curry is a hot
choice of filling in the tent today.

859
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,615
I am using home flavours.

860
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,455
Spicy chicken which is
a recipe that has been passed down

861
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,375
from my mum and my grandma.

862
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,535
Maxy's hoping to bounce back from
her disappointing signature with

863
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,855
a bake that is out of this world.

864
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,175
And the star of her Twinkle Twinkle
pie scene will be

865
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,495
a curry-filled globe

866
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,295
made with thin sheets
of delicate filo pastry,

867
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,575
a risky gamble, given its
notoriously delicate nature.

868
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,015
Tell us about the globe.

869
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,695
The globe is going to be made out
of filo pastry.

870
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,215
FILO pastry? Yeah.
Quite tricky.

871
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,815
You're going to make filo pastry?

872
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,095
Yeah. By yourself.

873
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,175
Yeah.

874
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,575
That's a bit of a feat to make
a decent filo pastry.

875
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,975
You need to harness this.

876
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,495
You struggled with time in the last
couple of weeks now. Yeah.

877
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,215
I think you need to bring it back,

878
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,055
try and just get this focused on
this, as quickly as possible.

879
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,135
Thank you. Thank you.

880
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,815
Good luck. Thank you.

881
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,215
Recognise my ambition here
cos I'm making filo,

882
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,175
which is a bit, a bit tricky.

883
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,175
So I'm starting off
with the ice cream.

884
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,215
Whilst I'm doing that
I'm also doing the savoury pastry.

885
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,215
These leather trousers are made
out of rough puff pastry. Wow.

886
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,575
See the food colouring
a little bit there?

887
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,775
Ha!

888
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,615
Chicken rendang, which is my
favourite classic food that I love

889
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,975
to cook all the time,

890
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,375
I've tried the spiciness level
on week three.

891
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,415
The judges can handle it.

892
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,175
Is it very SPICY?

893
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,415
So I've got onion, mustard, parsley.

894
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,255
I'm gonna put some pepper,
there's already salt in it.

895
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,415
Janusz has decided

896
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,375
to dedicate his bake
to man's best friend.

897
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,455
So my sausage dog's name is Nigel.

898
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,815
Sausage dog pie will be
a sausage doll,

899
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,775
sausage log - no, it's gonna
be not a sausage dog meat!

900
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,575
It's gonna be a SAUSAGE meat!

901
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,095
Janusz is hoping the judges
will lap up his unique take on

902
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,615
the Very Hungry Caterpillar,

903
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,975
consisting of a picnic scene
with an elaborate decorative tree

904
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,695
and each pie shaped
to represent its contents.

905
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,575
Have you made a lot
of food inspired by your dog?

906
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,855
I haven't made any food inspired
by my dog. That's the first one.

907
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,295
Will he be watching this?
Have you got a message for Nigel?

908
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,375
Well, he's gonna be even on a TV.

909
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:42,255
Nigel if you're watching, woof woof,
woof, woof-woof-woof.

910
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,975
Aww! He's gonna appreciate this.

911
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,775
Yeah. Get off that sofa!

912
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,295
Never!

913
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,655
Whilstjanusz has opted for
a canine twist to his tale,

914
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,135
Sandro's going for a more
traditional approach to the story.

915
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,895
So my 3D story is based on
the Very Hungry Caterpillar.

916
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,935
Uh, which I've read to
the kids I was working with.

917
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,495
Sandro's pulling out all
the stops with two side dishes

918
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,575
and a staggering selection
of meat and fruit pies,

919
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,935
each one individually
shaped to depict

920
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,935
both the caterpillar
and his daily diet.

921
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,255
In the story, are those all the
things that the caterpillar eats?

922
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,095
And more, yes.
And he eats a lot more.

923
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,695
I've got about 16 pies altogether.

924
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,615
Oh, my goodness.

925
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,455
You are overdoing it, Sandro.
Yes!

926
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,095
What kind of pastry?

927
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,535
The pastry, welll wouldn't, I
don't know the name of the pastry

928
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,095
but it's done with flour and water.
Right.

929
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,135
Pastry dough.
Just flour and water?

930
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,575
And some seasonings and butter.
Oh, right.

931
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,975
I think we'd better
leave him to it.

932
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,295
Absolutely - we'll leave you to it.
Good luck, Sandro.

933
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,695
Thank you. Good luck. Thank you.

934
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,175
Bakers, you are halfway through!
Was that too much?

935
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,215
I need to hurry up!

936
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,535
With at least eight pies
to make and bake...

937
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,935
Ice cream cone.

938
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,895
Now let me get that baking now
since the oven is free.

939
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,655
...the bakers must juggle the complex
production line of pasties.

940
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,055
I've got all the fillings ready,
all the pastries ready.

941
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,375
I'm gonna start baking my pies
in a moment.

942
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,695
Ancl with varying fillings,

943
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,175
timings and temperatures,
it's no mean feat.

944
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,495
My little stars.
So ideally I'd like to begin with

945
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,695
the cases of my fruit tart.

946
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,975
I'm rushing!

947
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,055
Page four of 15.

948
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,055
Haven't done the pears yet,
chorizo's done?

949
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,735
So now, tree castle,
still on castle.

950
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,615
Ancl whilst most are going for
the methodical approach...

951
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,575
Oh, I forgot to put my bay leaf
in there. Ah.

952
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,335
...Maxy is freestyling.

953
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,855
I should've put this in earlier.

954
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,175
Might've put a bit too much cloves
in here.

955
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,215
Ah, I didn't work this out properly.

956
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,255
I don't know if I'm burning my rice.

957
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,455
I've forgotten quite
a few important things.

958
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,615
With fillings made and chilled...

959
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,975
Allow that to thicken.

960
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,855
...the bakers must now shape
and assemble their pies.

961
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,295
They're apple pies.
So bake them, shape them,

962
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,655
bake them, shape them.
There's my apple.

963
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,575
So this is the large boat,
basically,

964
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,175
that I'm making right now.

965
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,055
This is gonna be cherry pie,
which is really quick to make.

966
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,815
This will go in the oven to bake.

967
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,615
Go on, have some cherries and
paprika. See what that's like.

968
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,975
What, is that what you're doing -
cherries and paprika?

969
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,655
No, yeah. I'll,
I'll get it ready for you. One sec.

970
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,535
Is this a thing or have you just
made this up?

971
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,015
No, they're gonna eat it, so...

972
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,775
I have paprika sometimes
on baked beans.

973
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,895
That's how classy I am.

974
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,495
Hmm, yeah, it's good.
Is it really?

975
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,455
Are you just mucking about? Yeah!

976
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,775
Oh, was that not what
you're gonna do? No.

977
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,135
My eyes feel fuzzy.

978
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,015
My liver's doing something
it's never clone before!

979
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,295
Sort of turning round.

980
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,015
Just need this to cool.

981
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,535
Don't want it to affect the pie,
don't want it to be too soggy.

982
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,535
Jack gonna taste
a very rustic boy

983
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,855
with rendang filling,

984
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,215
his little legs, hands,
now jack is a decent boy.

985
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,175
Bakers, you have one hour left.

986
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,415
Oh, gosh.

987
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,735
This might go completely fail.

988
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,575
OK. In it goes.

989
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,895
With multiple pastries going into
the oven at different times,

990
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,175
the bakers are feeling the heat.

991
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,975
Right now, I'm multitasking.

992
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,895
Uh... mix spice with the apples.

993
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,535
Ooh, I was reading the wrong bit.
OK.

994
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,135
I'm looking, I'm way...
I'm missing a plum.

995
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,815
I don't even know.
They're all muddled up now.

996
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,735
The bakers need to create
a three-dimensional scene

997
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,135
that looks spectacular
from all angles.

998
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,055
We have the octopus legs coming out.

999
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,895
I'm gonna poke these in
the filling,

1000
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,775
so it's gonna be, like,
standing up.

1001
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,055
Imaginative and intricate
decoration is required.

1002
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,575
This is my treetop.

1003
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,855
That's Noel's head underneath.

1004
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,735
I asked him for help, he helped.

1005
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,455
I'm making creme pat
to go over my fruits in my cups.

1006
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,055
So, this is the ice cream cone.

1007
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,135
Now it's just decorating,
putting them all together.

1008
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,655
Would you like some cheeses?

1009
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,535
I'm not on schedule.

1010
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,175
Ooh, arr, me hearties!

1011
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,535
Arr!

1012
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,095
Would you have liked to have
been a pirate in days gone by?

1013
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,535
Oh, my God, that must have
been crazy. No way, man. Yeah.

1014
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,295
There was, like, so much,
like, bloodshedding.

1015
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,775
You wouldn't have wanted
to make someone walk the plank?

1016
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,215
Uh, no, not really, no.

1017
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,615
Not even Paul Hollywood?
Ooh, no.

1018
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,695
It's a good way to get rid of him.

1019
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,655
The dog will be there for half
an hour.

1020
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,935
Ancl those - eight, ten minutes.

1021
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,575
Ah, OK. Filo pastry for the globe.

1022
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,975
I don't have a watch, do you?
I ain't got a watch.

1023
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,295
Shall we make it up? Yeah.

1024
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,335
What do you reckon? Half hour?
Half hour.

1025
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,695
Bakers, you've got half
an hour left.

1026
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,095
Slowly everything is going in.

1027
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,175
There's only 30 minutes left.
This is crazy, man.

1028
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,575
I'm putting a layer
of spinach in,

1029
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,015
cos my mum always
cooks spinach,

1030
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,535
so I just thought might
as well put it in my pie.

1031
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,455
Then it's rice.

1032
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,175
I'm running out of time.

1033
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,655
Oh, they're starting to pop
and crack a bit.

1034
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,175
I'm gonna give my fish
one more minute,

1035
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,975
because they always say
that my pastry is raw.

1036
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,655
So I'm covering cracks up
with some land.

1037
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,015
Ideally I would've wanted to go
a bit thinner.

1038
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:02,495
I'm making a pear,
but I think it's gone pear-shaped.

1039
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,935
Look, I don't have time.

1040
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,095
My pastry is breaking!

1041
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,295
Oh, it needs a bit more time.

1042
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,655
Cooked. Ow, cooked.

1043
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,935
Ah!

1044
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,655
Little stars.

1045
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,255
Come on, sausage dog, bake.

1046
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,335
Gotta make the neatest one the face
and I'll try and hide the cracks.

1047
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,175
Ancl they smell delicious.

1048
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,335
Don't know how to put
the giant together.

1049
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,055
It's too big of a giant.

1050
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,455
I'll take it as a giant is
sitting down.

1051
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,895
Bad, bad giant.

1052
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,815
I've still got BLEEP in the oven.

1053
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,135
These are meant to be clouds.

1054
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,655
I don't know if they look
like clouds.

1055
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,295
Nope, it wouldn't stick.

1056
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,015
I might need to settle
with only one beanstalk now.

1057
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,655
That's a little bit of glitter
to make my fish fishy.

1058
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,615
Some of them I have painted,
so that's good.

1059
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,135
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

1060
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,095
I think it's baked.

1061
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,215
Come on.

1062
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,975
Oh, you look cute.

1063
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,775
Ah! That's hot.

1064
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,255
Bakers, your time is up.

1065
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,855
Please step away from your bakes.

1066
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,735
Yay! It's all clone.

1067
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,215
It's so ugly.

1068
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,295
I'm so glad it's finished.

1069
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,895
Oh, we've clone it.

1070
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,335
After four hours making
their Showstopper pie scenes,

1071
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,735
with a place in
the semifinal at stake,

1072
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,215
the bakers now face
the judgement of Paul and Prue.

1073
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,015
Janusz, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

1074
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,015
Janusz, I think you could have
made the fish

1075
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,735
more obviously defined. Yeah.

1076
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,775
If you hadn't told me it was
a fish, I wouldn't have known.

1077
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,135
The salmon's beautifully cooked.
The pastry's all right.

1078
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,095
I mean, it could be
a little bit flakier,

1079
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,575
cos it's mainly just one big lump
of salmon.

1080
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,975
This is the sausage meat, is it,
in the dog's head? Yes.

1081
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,335
Personally, I don't like big gaps in
between that.

1082
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,015
Normally you'd fill that with
a gelatine or something.

1083
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,535
Basically, this is a sausage roll.

1084
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,495
Sausage meat is nice.

1085
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,775
It's all a bit dry.

1086
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,615
Now this one is...? Dauphinoise.

1087
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,735
The pastry's quite nice.

1088
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,455
It's packed out,
so as you cut into it, it's solid.

1089
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,015
Mmm.
It's a nice eat, that one.

1090
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,215
We're on to pudding now.

1091
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,415
This is apple.

1092
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,935
It's lovely.
It's a bit dry inside, that.

1093
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,335
That apple mixture should be
a little bit wetter than that.

1094
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,695
I think your flavours in all
of them are good.

1095
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,495
I just think the interaction
with the crust

1096
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,855
and the interior is where
it fails slightly.

1097
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,855
It needed another element to it
to wet that mixture down inside.

1098
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,335
Thanks, janusz. Thank you.
Thank you.

1099
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,535
I mean, overall it's
quite effective. It's pretty good.

1100
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,015
You can see what it is.

1101
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,815
It's a bit rough and ready.

1102
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,135
So this is the Chana dal?

1103
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,935
Aubergine curry
with Chana daL

1104
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,655
I think the flavour is amazing.

1105
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,015
The aubergine in
the curry is spectacular.

1106
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,135
It's really tasty.

1107
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,775
Right, let's have
a look at this crumble.

1108
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,135
I love that. Just delicious.

1109
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,855
I think the pastry's nice and short.

1110
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,375
Again, it's nice and thin,
it's crispy.

1111
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,935
Overall I think you've done
a good job,

1112
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,655
surprisingly, how simple that is.

1113
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,935
Thank you. Thanks, Abdul.
Well done.

1114
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,135
I think it looks quite attractive.

1115
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,695
You've had a bit of issues
with it cracking here, haven't you?

1116
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,935
Yeah. That's a lot of pie filling.

1117
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,255
But I like the flavour. OK.

1118
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,375
The pastry's sort of lost,
because it's a bit soft.

1119
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,935
It's very dry inside.
It's like a sandwich, not a pie.

1120
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,615
The bottom of it is just raw.

1121
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,375
Let's have a look at these cherry.

1122
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,735
Tough as old boots.

1123
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,375
Did you make the ice cream?
I did.

1124
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,455
Shame it wasn't
an ice cream competition.

1125
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,975
That's really nice.

1126
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,095
I think basically overall you've
lost your way with this pastry.

1127
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,175
OK.

1128
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,415
The star really, for me,
is the stars at the moment.

1129
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,655
The half globe has lost its way
a little bit.

1130
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,375
Shall we start with these?
Yeah.

1131
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,455
I quite like the taste.

1132
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,815
I think it needed something
with it, though,

1133
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,535
because as it's cooled,
it's turned into a pate.

1134
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,055
Right. The globe.

1135
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,935
I would've baked
that filo for longer.

1136
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,975
You want that flake in a filo.

1137
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,335
I think filo was probably
the wrong choice for that.

1138
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,015
This is the cloud. Yeah.
It's beautifully baked.

1139
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,895
It's a nice short pastry to go
with a lovely creamy top.

1140
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,655
If I've got one complaint,
I think the ratio of fruit

1141
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,255
to cream is a bit wrong.

1142
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,615
You need a bit more fruit
and a bit less cream.

1143
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,455
But otherwise, it's just perfect.

1144
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,575
Thank you.

1145
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,135
Thank God.

1146
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:29,135
It's clever, using this pastry.
Thank you.

1147
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,815
Because it's bulletproof
and you can't go wrong.

1148
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,055
Very, very good.

1149
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,335
That's lovely.

1150
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,495
Flaky, falls apart,
buttery on the fingers.

1151
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,055
The filling is spicy,
but still moist

1152
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,335
and somehow luscious.

1153
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,735
It's a real treat.

1154
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,975
Unctuous.

1155
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,615
Unctuous, that's
the word I'm looking for.

1156
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,495
I mean, this is your other pie,
isn't it? Chicken rendang pie.

1157
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,655
The pastry, thin, thin, thin.

1158
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,935
Filling is well packed.

1159
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,175
It's a nice-looking pie.

1160
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,495
Mmm, the chicken is delicious

1161
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,455
and it's all being kept inside
a very neat parcel.

1162
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,575
If I had any quarrel
with it, it is a little dry.

1163
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,935
Well done. Thank you.

1164
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,695
Well done. Thank you.

1165
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,695
Well done.

1166
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,135
I've got mixed emotions.

1167
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,775
I think I've got
a mixture of good and bad comments.

1168
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,935
I just hope I've clone enough
to save me.

1169
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,975
The ambition was something that
definitely worked against me,

1170
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,375
but they liked my ice cream.

1171
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,895
I feel a little bit traumatised,

1172
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,575
because it's the quarterfinal.

1173
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,375
You want it to be amazing,

1174
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,935
and it just wasn't quite...

1175
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,735
It was really disappointing.

1176
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,375
For three out of five of them,
pastry wasn't very good,

1177
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,295
and all their pies were
too dry inside.

1178
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,055
I thought Syabira's was very good.
Yeah.

1179
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,735
Clever. Good choice of pastry and
when you got into the pie,

1180
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,255
it was a beautiful curry inside.

1181
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,575
And also, Abdul's pastry
was beautiful.

1182
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,335
The aubergine curry was fantastic.

1183
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,495
When you look atjanusz's,

1184
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,015
actually, they looked great,

1185
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:09,015
but where he lost it really is not
necessarily his flavours,

1186
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,015
they were all quite dry.
Yeah. Very.

1187
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,695
And there were big gaps in
between

1188
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,375
the pie and the filling.
Too much air.

1189
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,735
And I thought Maxy,
I loved her chicken,

1190
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,775
but then you looked at
the filo half globe.

1191
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,335
The filo wasn't good.

1192
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,175
Overall, I think she struggled,

1193
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,775
and she's not the only one
to struggle.

1194
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,095
Sandro. Really bad.

1195
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,535
The actual pie itself
wasn't baked enough.

1196
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,855
It was quite raw inside.

1197
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,375
What he should have clone is a much
smaller, thinner caterpillar.

1198
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,375
I know it's a hungry caterpillar who
eats a lot,

1199
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,175
but it could've been a smaller one.
Yeah.

1200
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,015
I'm quite disappointed.

1201
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,015
In line for going home,

1202
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,455
I think obviously Maxy.

1203
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,935
And for me, obviously Sandro.

1204
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,135
Bakers, luckily for me this week
I have the lovely job

1205
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,615
of announcing Star Baker.

1206
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,935
Ancl the person who is Star Baker
this week is...

1207
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,855
Syabira.

1208
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,815
Well done.

1209
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,455
We've grown attached to all of you

1210
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,135
and we don't want to say goodbye
to anyone here,

1211
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,175
but I'm afraid we do
have to say goodbye.

1212
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:32,695
So I'm sorry to say the person
leaving us this week is...

1213
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,575
Maxy.

1214
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,055
Gosh.

1215
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,255
<i>|</i> Told you 9W5-

1216
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,615
Well done, Maxy.

1217
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,575
Oh, Maxy. You've done really well.
Really well.

1218
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,255
You've been so brilliant, honestly.

1219
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,095
I can't believe it.

1220
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,815
I had a bad, bad week.

1221
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,775
I knew it. I knew it was me.

1222
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,015
I knew it was coming,

1223
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,615
but I was hoping my Showstopper
would've saved me.

1224
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,975
You got through to
the quarterfinals. I know.

1225
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,175
That's a big thing. Yeah.

1226
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,615
It's really sad to go,

1227
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,975
but I'm HAPPY

1228
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,975
and I'm proud that I made it
this far.

1229
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,375
You're a lucky boy. I am. Yes, I am.

1230
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,415
Couldn't be happier.

1231
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,375
I've still got a chance to get to
the finals.

1232
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,175
I'm through to the semifinals.

1233
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,455
How weird is that?

1234
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,575
Stay calm.

1235
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,415
Just go in, give it my best again,

1236
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,535
and then hope.

1237
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,135
Please don't cry.

1238
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,495
I'm trying not to cry.

1239
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,935
Maxy's leaving.

1240
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,135
Ahh, sad.

1241
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,455
<i>Best buddy.</i>

1242
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,775
I don't know whether she can cry
or laugh, she's like...

1243
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,375
She's both. She's a mix.

1244
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,895
I'm sorry. I feel so confused.

1245
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,855
I don't know if
I want to be happy or cry.

1246
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,335
It was really sad to lose Maxy.

1247
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:46,735
She's been one of the strongest
bakers coming into today.

1248
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,135
It was very close between
Sandro and Maxy,

1249
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,455
and Sandro's really got to
watch it now.

1250
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,095
Next week is still a clean slate.

1251
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,735
I have to fight for the spot to be
in the final,

1252
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,375
which is a dream for me.

1253
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,575
Next time...

1254
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,855
Anything I can do? Stay away.

1255
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,695
...it's a patisserie semifinal

1256
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,215
for the four remaining bakers.

1257
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,015
Oh, my God. I burnt my caramel.

1258
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,735
There's no time to wobble,

1259
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,455
with a Signature that demands
precision... I'm stressed.

1260
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,775
...a testing Technical...

1261
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,135
I'm trying to hold back my tears
right now. Please stay.

1262
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,895
...and a spectacular towering
Nordic Showstopper.

1263
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,335
My hands are shaking.

1264
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,975
Get this wrong, they're going home.
