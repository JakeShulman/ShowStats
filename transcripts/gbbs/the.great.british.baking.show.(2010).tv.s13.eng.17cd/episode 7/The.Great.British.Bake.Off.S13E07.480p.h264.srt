1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,655
Last time...
Matt, what are you doing? Whoa-oh!

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,015
...Halloween came early in the tent.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,735
I've decided to dress as Noel,
so I'm baking in heels.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,255
While Syabira... I love it.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,935
...left the judges spellbound...

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,655
Handshake. Thank you.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,655
First in Technical,
great Showstopper.

8
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,935
Wow.

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,255
...claiming the Star Baker crown,

10
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,015
Kevin's cake...
Oh, man alive.

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,295
...was a horror show.

12
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,015
It does look a bit of a mess.
But Dawn's cat...

13
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,335
That is shocking.
..Was cursed.

14
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,015
Can't really taste anything.

15
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,615
And she was the sixth baker
to leave the tent.

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,575
One of the absolute best experiences
of my life.

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,335
Now... ls there such a thing as
too much custard?

18
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,695
No. No.
..It's Custard Week.

19
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,415
So I'm ready for you, ice cream.

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,695
With a Signature where no-one wants
to sink to the bottom...

21
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,255
Float the island.

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,775
Float, baby, float.

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,775
...a Technical with a timed twist...

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,455
What? What? What?

25
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,775
I just feel like I've been summoned
into a naughty tent.

26
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,895
...and a Showstopper...

27
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,455
I wish I had three arms, honestly.

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,855
...where the custard must hold
itself together...

29
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,375
It's quite wobbly.

30
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,015
It's super jiggly. Jiggle jiggle-

31
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,375
...as much as the bakers.

32
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,455
Oh, no.

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,895
The freezer is four degrees.
It's going to be melting.

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,495
But the thing is, there's so many
custard things you can make.

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,495
Everything. If you think,
there's a custard slice.

36
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,215
But they could even do
pain aux raisins again. No.

37
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,815
Last week was amazing,
I would say that.

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,975
I was wondering if I'm ever going
to be a Star Baker

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,615
and once I got it, I hope everyone
else will get it, as well.

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,575
It is Custard Week, so there
is a lot that can go wrong.

41
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,895
With confidence it's, uh,

42
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,895
it's in the mid ground
at the moment.

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,695
Custard, custard, custard, custard.

44
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,615
I kind of love making custard.
There's just so much you can do.

45
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,895
You get creme anglaise,
creme patissiere, creme au beurre.

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,935
I had no idea that there were so
many different varieties of custard.

47
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,775
Creme legere, creme chiboust,
creme mousseline.

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,455
I thought custard was just custard.

49
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,175
Bonjour, mes amis.

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,575
Welcome back to
le grand blanc... tente.

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,015
For your Signature challenge,

52
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,495
Paul and Prue would like you
to create your take on

53
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,335
the classic French dessert
iles flottantes.

54
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,775
The judges are looking
for eight perfect portions

55
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,295
of poached meringue floating on

56
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,255
a sea of silky smooth
creme anglaise.

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,295
The flavours are up to you.

58
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,295
The judges just want to see some
beautifully presented floaters.

59
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,135
You have an hour and a half.

60
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,415
On your marks. Get set.

61
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,575
Bake.

62
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,135
I never heard of floating
island before.

63
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,775
I heard about floaters a lot,
but not floating island.

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,575
The last time I had a floating
island is when I last practised this

65
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,055
and it was absolutely filth.

66
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,495
It's a bit of a funny one.

67
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,055
I like the custard, but I'm not
a fan of poached meringue.

68
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,655
Reminds me of baby food a bit.

69
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,215
It's Custard Week this week.

70
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,575
One of my favourite things
to eat ever.

71
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,215
Now, they've got
to make eight floating islands.

72
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,135
Basically they're a poached meringue
floating in English custard,

73
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,375
creme anglaise.

74
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,615
I normally buy custard,
because it's much easier to go

75
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,375
and get a 50p can, innit?
HE LAUGHS

76
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,175
So we want to see introduction
of colour, flavour and texture.

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,135
I'm just gonna make eight
little biscuits.

78
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,975
Lychee. Oh, they're like eyeballs.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,975
I always like making
floating islands.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,695
Silky smooth and light
and it melts in the mouth.

81
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,335
They are the most delicious.

82
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,175
So, how does it feel after
last week?

83
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,575
Did you get a handshake
and you won the Technical

84
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,335
and you won Star Baker?

85
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,495
That is actually
a very nice achievement,

86
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,815
but we're all back to
the clean slate this week. Wow.

87
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,735
Who are you? What are you doing now?

88
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,055
I'm making mojito cocktail,
actually. Mojitos.

89
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,495
Now you're talking my language.

90
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,055
Syabira's meringues will be coated
in a layer of sand crumble,

91
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,575
flavoured with mint leaves
and lime zest.

92
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,175
Her creme anglaise will be presented
in bowls painted

93
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,175
with palm trees
to complete her mojito islands.

94
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,615
Only a mojito lover can live in that
mojito island.

95
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,855
Everything that you serve will be
only mojito.

96
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,375
Mojito cake, mojito flavour,
mojito toast, mojito jam.

97
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,535
Rather than saying good morning,
you say mojito.

98
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,975
And if the judges need something

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,535
to sober them up after
Syabira's mojitos,

100
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,215
janusz has just the recipe for
the morning after.

101
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,135
I've decided to celebrate
my favourite morning drink,

102
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,335
vanilla latte.

103
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,575
So it's gonna be a... Oh, I thought
it was going to be Bovril. No!

104
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,135
So you've got coffee
in the custard.

105
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,495
Two espressos,
but it looks like latte.

106
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,095
Nice, OK.
Yeah, that's a really nice idea.

107
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,175
Janusz's floating island nods
to his perfect breakfast

108
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,055
with a coffee and
vanilla creme anglaise,

109
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,095
served alongside a bite-sized
marmalade-flavoured biscuit.

110
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,455
Is this the first time you've come
across it yourself?

111
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,335
I had it before in Poland.
We call it soup of nothing.

112
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,935
Soup of nothing?
Soup of nothing.

113
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,815
That's how a floating island
should be.

114
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,575
It should just disappear in
your mouth.

115
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,775
Yes.

116
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,015
Now I'm making the custard.

117
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,575
There's milk and double cream
in this.

118
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,215
I'm gonna then add
the orange zest and vanilla paste.

119
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,055
Not only are Paul
and Prue expecting

120
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,415
the creme anglaise
to be perfectly smooth...

121
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,335
I'll have lime and
rum creme anglaise.

122
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,375
The judges are gonna be smashed.

123
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,535
...they also want it to have
a perfectly balanced taste.

124
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,335
Rose can really easily become
an overpowering flavour.

125
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,695
I always stop just before I think
I should.

126
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,015
Ancl I'm just gonna add
some cardamom.

127
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,575
Sandro is taking it one step further

128
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,215
and going all out
with his flavour profiles.

129
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,735
I've not had that wow
with the flavours yet.

130
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,575
I've just had the,
"Oh, it tastes nice."

131
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,575
Which is great, but I want
that, like, oh-oh-oh-oh!

132
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,055
His flavours bring together
creme anglaise

133
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,295
with a cherry jelly,

134
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,455
chocolate shavings,

135
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,735
and a caramelised almond
and hazelnut topping.

136
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,615
Plus he's bringing in
a boozy element

137
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,575
to give the wow factor he's after.

138
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,215
The custard is going to
be brandy-infused

139
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,575
and then I've got cherry jelly
with a bit of rose prosecco in it.

140
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,775
Have you practised this?

141
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,335
I have practised it and I thought
it's just a bit too simple,

142
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,895
so I added the alcohol in it.

143
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,095
I'm just really trying

144
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,575
to make sure the flavours are all
well balanced.

145
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,975
Kevin's also adding a tipple
for the judges.

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,615
I've never tried popping prosecco
with a sword.

147
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,455
I normally just do it the safe way
with a towel over the cork.

148
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,815
But it's not the custard
he's adding it to.

149
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,855
The meringue will be flavoured
with prosecco and...

150
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,775
How much prosecco?
Eight tablespoons.

151
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,975
It'll deflate a bit, but as long as
you whisk it enough, it comes back.

152
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,735
Kevin's prosecco meringue
will float in a sea

153
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,335
of rose creme anglaise
topped with lychee

154
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,775
and raspberry coulis.

155
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,175
In keeping with the island theme,

156
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,215
his decoration will be
a tuile biscuit,

157
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,575
coloured pink
to look like tropical coral.

158
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,935
You could've done an island
you see in the middle of a loch.

159
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,255
Oh, that'd be too cliche.

160
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,055
Could've done Nessie.
A bit on the nose.

161
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,815
With Nessie sort of in there.
Nessie in the loch.

162
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,415
Hey, Matt, do you like my cake?
It's a Pac-Man cake.

163
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,095
Didn't Pac-Man have an eye?

164
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,735
Yeah, he had an eye, yeah.
Thanks. Thanks for your help. Yeah.

165
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,255
Dun-dun-dun-dun dun-dun-dun-dun.

166
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,495
Bakers, you are halfway through.

167
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,135
Right, now I can pour it inside this
mixture of eggs and sugar.

168
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,775
Ancl then get it back in the pan

169
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,455
and then cook it until
it's thickened.

170
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,015
Custard needs to be cooked low

171
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,335
and slow to get
the consistency just right.

172
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,695
There's a lot that can go wrong.

173
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,655
The custard can be overcooked.
It could be undercooked, as well.

174
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,015
It's a process that cannot
be rushed.

175
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,015
You just need to keep on whisking it
until it's thickened. Strong arms.

176
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,975
Cook it too quick
and the eggs will scramble.

177
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,095
You mustn't boil it.

178
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,935
It shouldn't get above about
80, 85 degrees.

179
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,895
But remove it from the heat too soon

180
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,175
and it will not thicken enough
and the floating islands will sink.

181
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,055
This is taking years to thicken up.

182
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,455
I am quite patient,

183
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,775
but this is just...

184
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,415
just... just a bit too much.

185
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,735
Maxy's poached meringue will sit in

186
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,255
a lagoon of creme anglaise
and blueberry sauce.

187
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,935
It'll be topped with caramelised
sugar swirls and glitter dust.

188
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,655
I've seen people actually lose

189
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,255
years of their lives
stirring custard. Stirring away.

190
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,615
Thinking it's not gonna happen,
then suddenly it does happen.

191
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,935
Yeah, it does.
Ancl they get really excited.

192
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,535
Yeah.
Have you ever stirred custard, Matt?

193
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,375
I get the Bird's to do it.

194
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,735
See what I've done there.

195
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,975
It's a bit thicker.

196
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,295
Ancl I think we're clone.

197
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,495
It's looking good.
It's the right texture.

198
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,295
This is kind of done.

199
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,655
It looks really runny,
but it should be all right.

200
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,135
With their custards completed
and left to cool...

201
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,775
I'm gonna pop it in the fridge.

202
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,735
Uh, meringue.
Am I right or a MERINGUE?

203
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,215
...the bakers move on to making
the all-important meringue islands.

204
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,095
I'm making
the French meringue style.

205
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,975
So in this case I whisked my
egg whites to a soft paste.

206
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,415
Now I'm adding sugar.

207
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,415
Gradually.

208
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,775
Once it reaches stiff peaks

209
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,095
and all my sugar is there,

210
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,575
I will then shape them
and start poaching them in water.

211
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,535
Abdul's poached meringue
will be topped

212
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,695
with caramel swirls

213
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,775
and sit in an orange creme anglaise,
marbled with a cherry coulis.

214
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,655
Is this something
you've made before?

215
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,415
I had never even seen these before.

216
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,975
You're quite good
with meringue, though, aren't you?

217
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,535
My wife's made of meringue.

218
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,975
Uh-huh. Well, she was.

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,375
She's just an eggy liquid

220
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,095
in the bottom of a pan now,
but, you know.

221
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,535
Interesting. We still get on.

222
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,615
So, the show's been getting

223
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,975
a few letters of complaint that
we've been stressing

224
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,375
the bakers out a little bit
with our time calls

225
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,255
and that we need to be
a little bit more soothing. OK.

226
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,615
So I've been practising, OK...
OK.

227
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,975
...a kind of soothing time call.
Ready? Yes.

228
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,935
Bakers,
you have half an hour left.

229
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,255
Let's not panic just yet.

230
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,175
I'll do eight tablespoons
of prosecco.

231
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,855
It'll deflate a bit, but give it
a chance to whip back up.

232
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,895
Whipping the meringue to just
the right degree is crucial.

233
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,495
Stiff and glossy.

234
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,215
Not enough and it won't be firm
enough to hold its shape...

235
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,855
This is abstract art now.

236
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,695
...making it tricky to successfully
form identical floating islands...

237
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,535
just trying to get them
as same as possible.

238
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,895
...that will hold firm in liquid
for poaching.

239
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,615
It's gonna be a very generous
portion.

240
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,975
I don't want to be called
as a stingy lady.

241
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,215
I'm gonna pipe meringue
that's gonna look like latte foam.

242
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,575
But, yeah, my hands are literally,
like, shaking.

243
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,895
Have you been drinking? No!

244
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,575
Not for a long time now.

245
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,215
I'm gonna begin poaching,

246
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,175
so I'm gonna poach my meringues
in the milk.

247
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,935
Let's try the first one.

248
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,295
So I'm gonna poach them
for two minutes on each side.

249
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,615
Everyone will be poaching
their meringues in liquid.

250
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,575
Mine rely on steam,

251
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,055
because you will destroy
the piping.

252
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,615
My meringues have just gone wrong.

253
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,575
They're way too soft
and just totally collapsed.

254
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,015
It's like the Titanic.
In what way? Little icebergs.

255
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,335
Little mini icebergs. Oh, right.

256
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,695
I thought you meant
the tragic ending. No!

257
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,175
If you touch them on the outside
and they look good

258
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,655
and fluffy, it's almost ready.

259
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,055
At least that's what I think.

260
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,095
OK, that looks good.
This one is clone.

261
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,415
Floaters are clone. I'm happy.

262
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,695
What you looking at? I'm looking
at that magic over there.

263
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,975
Oh, yeah. I know.

264
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,615
Yours look like that.
Yeah, yeah.

265
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,775
These are not good.
They just look a bit rough.

266
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,055
Coat them in the minty sand.

267
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,655
Bakers, you have 15 minutes.

268
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,975
I'm going to start putting
the custard in.

269
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,615
Prosecco jelly has set.

270
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,815
It's a minty sand topped with
the creme anglaise.

271
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,175
Nice bit of retro kitsch
glassware.

272
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,695
Oh, this coffee smells good.
There we are, baby.

273
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,975
Ancl now I'm gonna jazz this up now.

274
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,935
This is my cherry coulis.

275
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,655
Right, meringues next.

276
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,935
They're very delicate things.

277
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,575
Float the island.

278
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,055
Float, baby, float.

279
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,855
I mean, they do float.

280
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,655
Oh, that's a sorry-looking one.

281
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,975
How long do I have left?

282
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,495
Bakers, you have one minute left.

283
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,815
Oh, boy.
Time pressure, time pressure.

284
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,615
Just the final decorations.

285
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,015
OK, so this is the raspberry
and lychee coulis.

286
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,215
Blueberry sauce.

287
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,535
Add the hazelnuts.

288
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,215
Oh, coraltuile is ready.

289
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,335
Final decorations.

290
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,215
Dunk 'em in.
Think I'm just rushing a bit.

291
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,375
This is looking messy!

292
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,095
My hands are literally shaking.
Too much coffee.

293
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,335
Oh, my God.

294
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,415
Bakers, your time is up.

295
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,615
Please step away from
your floating islands.

296
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,695
Oh, that's cool.

297
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,495
They look like coated
breaded chicken.

298
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,895
Yeah. Isn't it?
Coated breaded chicken? What?

299
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,735
That's the last thing
I want to hear, Sandro.

300
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,855
<i>SHE CHUCKLES</i>

301
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,015
The bakers' floating islands
will now face

302
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,575
the judgement of Paul and Prue.

303
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,135
Hi, Syabira.
Hello, Syabira. Hi, hello.

304
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,815
I actually thought it was
a deep-fried chicken.

305
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,135
Yes, that's what Sandro was saying.
Sitting in a bechamelsauce.

306
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,415
That's delicious, as well.

307
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,615
I think it is a floating
desert island.

308
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,175
It's covered in sand.

309
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,575
It does look great.

310
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,175
It is a lime creme anglaise
topped with

311
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,895
the meringue,
coated with the minty sand.

312
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,895
As always, there's nothing wrong
with your flavours.

313
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,415
They're fresh,
they're very distinct

314
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,055
and your meringue
is beautifully poached.

315
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,095
It's a great mojito.
The custard is perfect.

316
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,335
It's the lime in that.

317
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,695
It's got that sharpness that
cuts through,

318
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,215
so it's not too sweet.

319
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,655
Very clever. Well clone, Syabira.

320
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,935
You're in some kind
of crazy groove.

321
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,215
They look nice.
They look quite attractive.

322
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,535
The meringue's lost its height

323
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,855
because of probably
the weight of the caramel.

324
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,535
You have orange custard.

325
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,935
Look at that custard.
And then we have a cherry coulis.

326
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,495
It is absolutely delicious.

327
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,975
It's very sweet,

328
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,655
but the custard's
an excellent flavour.

329
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,815
I love the orange. OK.

330
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,255
I'd like to have seen the meringue
a little bit more robust.

331
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,615
Looks quite appetising.

332
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,455
I'm not sure it's enough
for a dessert.

333
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,855
The combination of flavours
is really delicious.

334
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,375
The acidity of the puree sets off
the meringue's sweetness perfectly.

335
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,335
It's lovely. The blueberry's got
a lovely tartness to it.

336
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,415
But the creme anglaise could've been
a little bit thicker.

337
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,455
It's quite effective.

338
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,775
Looks like a latte.

339
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,375
Your creme anglaise texture
is absolutely perfect.

340
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,935
It's thick enough.
As a latte goes, it's delicious.

341
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,415
There's just enough coffee in there.

342
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,775
It's very delicate
and I love the flavour and texture.

343
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,015
It's delicious.

344
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,655
I mean, I'm really tempted
to keep going,

345
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,535
but I won't cos I've got more
to come. Thank you. Thank you.

346
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,215
I think it looks busy.

347
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,095
I do think they look quite
pretty though.

348
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,935
You have the cherry jelly,

349
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,895
bit of prosecco,
spiced custard with brandy.

350
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,535
Certainly got brandy in it.
It certainly has.

351
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,975
It's very alcoholic.

352
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,215
I think that the custard is perfect
from a texture point of view.

353
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,655
You'd have been better not to
have the prosecco in the jelly. OK.

354
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,695
Because the brandy's quite enough.
I think you got carried away.

355
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,895
Thank you. Thank you.

356
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,775
I think the puree, it's probably
slightly watered it down.

357
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,055
It's slackened off
the creme anglaise. Hmm.

358
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,215
The custard is smooth as anything.
I love the prosecco.

359
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,535
It's a lovely light mouthful,

360
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,775
but it does mean that the islands
are a bit squashed. Yeah.

361
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,575
The meringues have disintegrated
with the prosecco,

362
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,975
so the alcohol has broken
the meringue apart.

363
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,415
The lychee is delicious.
Mmm. Thank you.

364
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,735
That was another mixed one.

365
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,455
Bottom of a pretty good bunch
is an OK place to be.

366
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,495
Pauls aid it looks like
a chicken and bechamel,

367
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,015
but they said the custard was
perfect. I'm very pleased.

368
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,535
Too much going on.
It was too busy, which it was.

369
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,055
Game plan going into
the Technical

370
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,895
is I'm sitting at the back,

371
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,935
so I've got the whole view

372
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,575
to see what everyone else is doing.
HE LAUGHS

373
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,375
The bakers were able
to practise their floating islands,

374
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,695
but have no idea what awaits them
in the Technical challenge.

375
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,215
Well, bakers, it's time
for your Technical challenge,

376
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,335
which today has been set by
Prue be-doo-be-doo.

377
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,015
Prue be-doo, any words of advice?

378
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,495
Take your time and keep your cool.

379
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,215
That cannot be it.

380
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,815
That is it.

381
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,295
As ever, this Technical challenge
will be judged blind,

382
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,775
so we're going to have
to ask these two to hop it.

383
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,935
Go on, get out of here.
Don't want you round here.

384
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,255
For your Technical challenge,

385
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,175
we're gonna do something
a little bit different.

386
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,775
We're gonna have a staggered start
time and a staggered finish time.

387
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,375
What? What? What?

388
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,095
BLEEP just got real.

389
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,135
So could everybody leave
the tent except for Sandro.

390
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,095
What? Bye-bye.
No, but wait.

391
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,775
What is... going on?

392
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,335
No pressure.

393
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,615
The judges would like you
to make six pistachio

394
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,455
and praline ice cream cones.

395
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,175
Your cones should be dipped in
chocolate and nuts

396
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,535
and then topped with a pistachio
and praline ice cream.

397
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,815
You have two hours and 45 minutes.

398
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,695
On your marks. Get set.

399
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,775
Bake.

400
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,095
This is the most nervous I've felt.

401
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,615
Normally the other bakers are here,

402
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,295
so I get to sort of see
if I'm on the right track,

403
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,655
but today I'm all alone.

404
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,895
Pistachio and praline ice cream cone
for a Technical. This is a first.

405
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,215
It's Custard Week

406
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,455
and to make good ice cream, you need
to be able to make good custard.

407
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,575
I'd like there to be at least one
and a half scoops in there.

408
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,095
I always feel cheated when I get
a cone

409
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,615
that's just a little mound on
the top.

410
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,135
They have to make their own cones.

411
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,495
They should be golden brown,
not pale,

412
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,055
and of course if they're too dark,
they'll be too brittle.

413
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,775
Ancl you get that nasty burnt taste.
Slightly burnt taste.

414
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,255
One of the really tricky things
about this challenge

415
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,375
is the timing.

416
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,055
If they don't get their ice cream
frozen properly,

417
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,335
we are going to have pistachio soup.

418
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,015
Ancl we're doing staggered starts

419
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,335
to make it absolutely fair when
we're judging.

420
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,695
Shall we try, then, Prue?

421
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,935
Mmm. That is beautiful.

422
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,455
The cone is crispy.
Silky smooth ice cream.

423
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,375
The texture from
the praline inside is lovely.

424
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,215
It's really good, strong
pistachio flavour.

425
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,575
Even on a cold clay, Prue,
having ice cream, actually,

426
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,935
it doesn't really matter, does it?
I know. It tastes great. I know.

427
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,055
I've never even heard of
a custard ice cream.

428
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,975
I just know it needs to be frozen,
so gotta be pretty quick.

429
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,335
To begin with, it says
to make creme anglaise.

430
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,695
This is a mixture of double cream
and milk.

431
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,135
I'm gonna wait until it starts
to simmer,

432
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,655
which is already...
It's getting there.

433
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,175
Come join the party, baker two.

434
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,255
Come and join us.

435
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,175
The judges would like you
to make six pistachio

436
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,215
and praline ice cream cones.

437
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,495
You have two hours, 45 minutes.

438
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,255
On your marks. Get set.

439
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,335
Bake.

440
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,695
It is very empty and very quiet.

441
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,015
I think more or less I know what
I'm doing.

442
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,775
So I'm ready for you, ice cream.

443
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,015
These eggs will be creamed
with some sugar.

444
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,735
Ancl then mix that in.

445
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,055
Baker three,
would you like to join us?

446
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,895
Don't look so frightened. You're OK.

447
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,655
The judges would like you
to make six pistachio

448
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,215
and praline ice cream cones.

449
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,015
On your marks. Get set.

450
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,055
Bake.

451
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,855
This is weird.

452
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,175
Oh, I just feel like
I've been summoned into

453
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,055
a naughty tent.

454
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,495
Just like, "Oh, we've been naughty,
haven't we?"

455
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,455
Never made ice cream with custard.

456
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,575
I need to get this creme anglaise
to cool down as soon as I can.

457
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,335
That was weird, weren't it?
Yeah, it was strange

458
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,775
being the only person in here.

459
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,375
Have you made anything like
this before?

460
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,535
I've never made ice cream before.
It's not a thing, innit?

461
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,415
The ice cream man comes over
to your road

462
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,775
and he parks right in front of
the house, as well.

463
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,175
You don't go, "Sorry, love.
Sorry, love, we make our own."

464
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,455
We've made it already, yeah.

465
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,095
Hello, baker four.

466
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,215
On your marks. Get set.

467
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,495
Bake.

468
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,495
I don't know anything about
ice cream, to be honest.

469
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,495
I've got no idea. Clueless.

470
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,495
Let's just start.

471
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,055
The key is to keep an eye on
the custard when it's cooking,

472
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,615
so you don't get scrambled eggs.

473
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,855
So it needs to be cooked on
the stove until it gets thickened.

474
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,135
Baker number five.

475
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,095
On your marks. Get set.

476
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,735
Bake.

477
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,135
I've made ice cream before.
I've got an ice cream maker at home.

478
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,055
I can do this.
It's just like being at home.

479
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,135
I'm looking for my custard
to thicken up.

480
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,495
Until it's thick enough to coat
the back of a spoon.

481
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,095
I'm gonna do it a bit thicker than
I did the floating island custard.

482
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,015
Baker six, would you like
to join us?

483
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,695
On your marks. Get set.

484
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,295
Bake.

485
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,415
Yes. The last one in. So, this is
the first time I'm making ice cream.

486
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,375
This is the first time I'm seeing
this machine, so... let's see.

487
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,495
Creme anglaise is nearly ready.
I'm happy with the way it looks.

488
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,455
It's all a bit crazy. Yeah.
Staggered.

489
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,815
I know!
Maybe it's because of the ice cream.

490
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,375
They don't want it to get melted...
Yeah, that is it, I think.

491
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,335
...when the next judges...
It's quite breezy here, isn't it?

492
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,775
Yeah, it's very breezy.

493
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,735
It's like a gale.

494
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,015
I've made my creme anglaise.

495
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,455
It is looking pretty decent.
I'm quite happy with it.

496
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,775
It's gonna go to the ice bath.

497
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,215
So it's cool enough for
the ice cream machine.

498
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,095
The bakers need to reduce
the temperature

499
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,455
of their creme anglaise
as quickly as possible.

500
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,455
That's in the fridge.
In the fridge.

501
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,415
But where they cool it is crucial.

502
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,615
You can't put a hot creme anglaise
into the freezer.

503
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,655
The temperature difference,
it might cause a issue.

504
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,975
Into the fridge.

505
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,255
I chill in the freezer
to get it down as fast as I can.

506
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,255
Adding warm creme anglaise to
a freezer

507
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,575
will cause the freezer's
temperature to rise.

508
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,015
And now it can go to the freezer.

509
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,175
And may prevent the ice cream from
setting later in the challenge.

510
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,415
It's cooled, which is good.
Yeah, that's ready.

511
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,415
I am adding in my pistachio paste.

512
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,095
I'm gonna add the food colouring.

513
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,415
Pistachios shouldn't have too
much colour.

514
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,295
It says to churn and then to freeze.

515
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,095
When it gets really thick
and ice creamy,

516
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,455
I will turn it off,
however long that will take.

517
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,095
It'll probably take about 45 minutes
to churn. I don't know.

518
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,455
If this works out,
I'll be so proud of myself.

519
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,575
Right, now I'm gonna
make the...

520
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,215
...waffle cones.

521
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,175
I've got an idea of how it's clone.

522
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,735
I'm gonna whip up my egg whites,
then sift in the flour

523
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,095
and icing sugar,
fold in the butter.

524
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,775
That looks good.
It looks the right consistency.

525
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,495
I'll start cooking them now.

526
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,815
I'm gonna go for it.

527
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,455
I'm just gonna trust the press.

528
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,535
First one is in. Lid is on.

529
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,895
I give them two minutes
and wait patiently.

530
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,295
Pop it in for three minutes.

531
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,535
Five minutes, four minutes.

532
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,055
I just need this to be golden.

533
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,415
Three, two...

534
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,695
Hello.

535
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,815
Not there yet.

536
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,735
Yeah. I'm going for a goldeny type
colour and just roll it.

537
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,055
Not brown, just golden.

538
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,695
Once it's done, you just need to
roll straight away and let it set.

539
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,375
Tighter at the bottom.

540
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,975
Something is burning.

541
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,455
Something's burning.

542
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,575
Or is it me?

543
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,175
Oh, no!

544
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,415
Oh!

545
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,615
What?

546
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,615
Whoa-oh!

547
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,815
I just made an ice cream cone.
That's really cool. Ha-ha!

548
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,535
It's six, right?

549
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,615
I'll go again.

550
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,015
I'm going to do it for less time.

551
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,295
Well, that's better.

552
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,335
Ow! It's so hot.

553
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,975
Well, I definitely didn't
perfect it.

554
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,335
Look at that.

555
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,495
Hmm.
You ever clone that before?

556
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,175
I've never made
a waffle cone before.

557
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,695
So you just did that. I'm gonna be
obsessed with waffle cones now.

558
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,535
Yeah, are you getting
a waffle cone maker?

559
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,455
It feels fine.

560
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,615
Don't try that at home, children.

561
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,975
Burning, burning, burning.
I smell burning.

562
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,895
Whoa, man. They're burnt.
What is going on?

563
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,175
OK, even less time than that.

564
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,215
Final one.

565
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,255
Chicka-ching! Hot, hot!

566
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,975
That is six.

567
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,455
This one is OK. This one is OK.

568
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,815
I'm moving on to next step.
Make the praline.

569
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,615
Caramelise my sugar,
put it on top of the pistachios.

570
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,335
When I was a kid,
pistachio ice cream

571
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,175
was something you had on holiday.
Yeah.

572
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,895
On the Algarve. Sort of like,
"Ooh, ooh, they've got pistachio.

573
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,455
"Ooh, they've got pistachio!

574
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,775
"Ron, they've got pistachio.
Did you want pistachio?

575
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,455
"You like pistachio.

576
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,335
"No, just vanilla?
He just wants a vanilla."

577
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,135
It's getting there, baby.

578
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,375
I'm just gonna stop churning it.
It's pretty thick.

579
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,975
I think it's clone.

580
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,255
Scrape the ice cream into a bowl
and fold through the praline.

581
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,335
Freeze.

582
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,175
Make sure that's all in there.
And now it can go to the freezer.

583
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,175
So I need it to set quick,
quick, quick, quick, quick.

584
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,695
It's gonna freeze. Should be OK.

585
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,935
I will be leaving this in the
freezer for as long as possible.

586
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,855
Dip the ice cream cone rims
in melted chocolate,

587
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,655
then in chopped pistachios.
Pistachios on my wafer.

588
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,255
What I'm actually gonna do is put
some melted chocolate in. Yeah.

589
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,895
Ooh, yeah, I'm gonna put that
in there.

590
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,695
You just gonna do that?
I'm just gonna do it.

591
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,015
Like a little secret extra. Wow.

592
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,375
I hope my ice cream is freezing.

593
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,735
I'm gonna see my ice cream.
It's still soft.

594
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,975
It's set. I'm happy, happy.

595
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,175
The freezer is four degrees.
It's gonna be melting.

596
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,855
Ah, stress.

597
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,815
I'm praying really hard silently
so my ice cream sets.

598
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,655
Baker number one,
you have five minutes until judging.

599
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,695
It's cold.
Everything's cold right now.

600
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,215
How many scoops do they want?
I'll try and do two.

601
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,615
Then I've just got to drizzle
chocolate sauce.

602
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,895
I'm gonna do it in the freezer,
the rest of this.

603
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,415
A little bit of the sauce.

604
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,415
Baker number two,
you have five minutes.

605
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,655
Baker number one,

606
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,415
I am coming to get your bake now
for judging.

607
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,975
Happy?

608
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,495
Sir, madam.

609
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,095
These look quite attractive.

610
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,815
They've managed
to get two balls on.

611
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,175
I mean, the green's about right,
as well, the colour.

612
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,815
And the cone is absolutely lovely.
It's crisp. Mmm.

613
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,455
I can't hear anything.

614
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,535
It's nice and creamy,
the ice cream, and set.

615
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,215
The baker has filled
the inside with... With chocolate.

616
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,935
"Chocolate. It stops
the ice cream soggying it up.

617
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,495
That is delicious.

618
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,975
My ice cream didn't set.

619
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,255
It's so hard, mate.

620
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,215
It's like water.

621
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,815
Baker number three,
you have five minutes left.

622
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,095
Baker number two,
I'm coming for you.

623
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,735
Thank you.

624
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,055
That looks like it's been in
the sun for six hours,

625
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,735
pouring out the bottom hole.

626
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,975
The cone seems to be crisp enough.

627
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,015
The praline's good.

628
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,775
It's a good flavour,
but it's just not set.

629
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,255
The freezer didn't cool down
my ice cream. It's melting.

630
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,215
I feel like I want to give up
this challenge.

631
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,815
If it melts, it melts.
I did my best.

632
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,015
Baker number three,

633
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,095
I'm coming to get your bake
right now.

634
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,535
Thank you. Thank you.
Ah, it's just melting.

635
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,975
I'll get it there quick.

636
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,735
There you go.
It's very soft. It's not set.

637
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,095
It's just like liquid.

638
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,215
Oh. Mmm. Oh!

639
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,535
It's leaking all over,
even down the side.

640
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,895
Because the ice cream is so unset,

641
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,655
the praline doesn't have
the proper crunch it should. No.

642
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,535
A sort of pistachio soup.

643
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,935
It's fine.

644
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,255
It seems fairly stable.

645
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,175
I was going to do a second scoop
on top, but don't think I will.

646
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,095
Baker number four, your time is up.

647
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,175
Well, the ice cream looks set.

648
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,455
Try a little bit of that cone.

649
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,375
Mmm, the ice cream tastes nice.

650
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,095
Very crunchy praline.

651
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,735
Shame we didn't get
the second scoop.

652
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,855
That's a mean ice cream.
Delicious, but not enough.

653
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,615
I wonder if the ice cream's
a bit on the soft side.

654
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,015
I'm just trying to keep it neat.

655
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,495
Baker number five,
I'm coming for your bake right now.

656
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,375
Happy?

657
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,695
Down to the wire.

658
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,055
The most obvious problem
immediately is that

659
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,295
the chocolate is just
a great ugly lump on top. Yeah.

660
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,135
The wafer's good, good texture.
You do get a little bit of praline.

661
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,455
The ice cream mix itself is good.

662
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,695
It is melting very, very quickly.

663
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,255
It's melting very quickly. Eeesh.

664
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,175
It feels weird,
like everyone is watching me.

665
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,775
Baker number six, your time is up.

666
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,455
Thank you. Thank you.

667
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,775
The wafer looks a little too dark
and too brittle.

668
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,015
They're over baked.

669
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,815
The ice cream is nice
and smooth.

670
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,255
It's just melting pretty
quickly now.

671
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,655
Paul and Prue will now rank
the ice creams from worst to best.

672
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,495
In sixth spot, we have this one.

673
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,935
Syabira.

674
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,175
Ice cream wasn't set.

675
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,055
In fifth place, we have this one.

676
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,455
Janusz. It wasn't set, was it?

677
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,935
Abdul is fourth

678
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,735
and Kevin third.

679
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,615
In second, we have this one.

680
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,495
Maxy, these are pretty good.

681
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,935
You needed to put more ice cream
on it to create a bigger dome.

682
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,975
Which means we have this one.

683
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,735
Sandro, absolutely delicious.

684
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,095
Nothing wrong with it at all.

685
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,895
I feel great.
I got my first Technical win.

686
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,255
They still taste great.

687
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,975
They are just more sort
of smoothie than an ice cream.

688
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,415
It's terrible. Disappointed.

689
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,695
There's always a rainbow
after the rain.

690
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,015
Let's do this. Four more hours.

691
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,655
Happy Custard Week, everybody.

692
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,535
Custard Week. I love custard.
Who'd have thought it?

693
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,295
Coming from northern stock,
anything with custard is good.

694
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,775
You can't just claim custard
from the north, you know that? Yeah.

695
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,935
There's a little village just
outside Bolton... Here we go.

696
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,655
...called Custard and that
is where it all came from. Really?

697
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,375
No, don't be ridiculous.
Of course not.

698
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,455
You had me there.

699
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,295
We've whittled down
to six really strong bakers now.

700
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,935
It's getting harder and harder,
isn't it?

701
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,895
Syabira did really well in
the Signature. Yeah.

702
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,455
But she was last in the Tech.

703
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,815
Whereas Sandro didn't do too well
in the Signature with what he did,

704
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,815
but he won the Tech.

705
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,255
So you've got these two
sort of jumping around.

706
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,255
Ancl then you look at everybody else,

707
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,575
they're all again smack in
the middle.

708
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,495
Ancl now you're in this position

709
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,815
where any challenge
you make one mistake, you could go.

710
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,895
Which is harsh, isn't it?

711
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,215
Bake Off is tough. It's brutal.

712
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,575
Oh, I can't bear it.
I wouldn't watch it. It's brutal.

713
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,055
Or be involved in it.
I'd wipe it off my CV.

714
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,375
Good morning, bakers.

715
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,855
Welcome back to the tent
for your Showstopper challenge.

716
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,455
Today Paul and Prue would
like you to bake

717
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,655
an exquisitely-decorated
set custard gateau.

718
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,575
Your gateau must consist
of multiple baked layers

719
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,535
and be sandwiched
and supported

720
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,175
by beautifully-flavoured,
perfectly set custard.

721
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,975
You can make any style
of gateau you like,

722
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,615
but the set custard elements must be
the star of the show.

723
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,615
I thought Paul Hollywood was
the star of the show?

724
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,935
Used to be. Now it's set custard.

725
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,295
Imagine being usurped
by set custard.

726
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,335
Oh, it's a tough business.

727
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,335
You have four hours.
On your marks.

728
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,615
Get perfectly set.

729
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,615
Bake.

730
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,815
This bake here, I need this
to be, like, perfection.

731
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,455
It's gonna be my, like,
do I get my Star Baker?

732
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,135
It's a personal favourite,

733
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,415
so I'm really excited to make this

734
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,335
and I hope the judges like it.

735
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,135
We've had pouring custard,

736
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,775
we've had frozen custard,

737
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,815
so for the Showstopper,
we're going to have set custard.

738
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,175
So, obviously there's many different
types of custard.

739
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,055
Creme pat, creme diplomat,
creme mousseline.

740
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,055
There has to be baked elements
in there.

741
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,815
There are so many different avenues
they could go down.

742
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,375
So, strawberries, I need 400 grams.
I'm gonna just reduce them.

743
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,295
Well, there are lots of ways
to set custard.

744
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,535
Most people would use flour
and a bit of gelatine.

745
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,695
It needs to be silky and soft,
but it must be firm.

746
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,575
So that when you get a slice,
it doesn't just bulge out.

747
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,695
I am thinking about
texture, flavour,

748
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,175
texture, flavour,
texture and flavour.

749
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,855
Ancl time.

750
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,255
Custard gateau has
to look amazing.

751
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,415
Lots of flavour,

752
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,615
lots of colour,

753
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,655
but custard has
to remain the hero.

754
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,695
Morning, Syabira.
Hello, Syabira.

755
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,135
Morning, hello. Hello.

756
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,415
Tell us about your custard gateau.

757
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,775
I'm making pina colada

758
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,295
custard cake today.

759
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,015
You see, there's
a theme going on here.

760
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,535
We're getting mojitos,
we're getting pina coladas.

761
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,935
It is a cocktail week this week.

762
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,295
Both Noel and I are big fans of
pina colada.

763
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,535
Paul always buys me pina coladas
when we go out. No pressure.

764
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,135
Syabira's cocktail gateau will
feature delicate pineapple flowers,

765
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,215
a coconut rum creme legere

766
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,815
and alternate layers
of pineapple creme pat

767
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,575
and rum sponge with
a tropical ingredient.

768
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,695
I'm adding the coconut milk inside
now to give

769
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,015
the coconut taste in the sponge.

770
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,335
I'm excited,
because I tried this cake alongside

771
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,295
a proper pina colada drink.

772
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,615
Pina colada, cake,
pina colada, cake,

773
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,935
pina colada, cake.

774
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,895
This is myjoconde sponge.

775
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,935
It's an almond-based sponge.

776
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,615
It's nice and moist.

777
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,215
The bakers want baked elements
to be both light enough

778
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,815
to avoid compressing
the silky set custard...

779
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,815
I'm making a traditional
Polish sponge.

780
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,735
It has both flour
and potato starch.

781
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,735
It brings the lightness
to the sponge.

782
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,095
...and firm enough
to structure their gateau.

783
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,175
I am going to make
a coconut sponge,

784
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,135
so it's more robust.

785
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,175
While most bakers are using sponges
to support their custards...

786
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,615
just starting my dough now,
so I'll start laminating it shortly.

787
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,255
...Abdul has been inspired
to do things differently.

788
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,615
So I'm basically making
a Mille-feuille.

789
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,455
Oh, nice.
So tell us about the puff pastry.

790
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,895
So I tried a rough puff pastry.
I'm actually using your recipe.

791
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,655
Oh, you'll do well with this.

792
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,655
You're gonna go far, Abdul.

793
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,015
Do you know...
What a move from Abdul.

794
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,895
Actually, that recipe is,
I think, as good as a puff pastry.

795
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,255
Yes. That's what I noticed,
as well.

796
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,655
I did notice there's a slight...
What is happening here?

797
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,695
What's happening here?
Can we just have a moment for this?

798
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,055
Abdul's Mille-feuille will be made
with layers

799
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,935
of compressed rough puff pastry

800
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,295
that will sandwich chocolate
creme patissiere

801
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,735
and vanilla creme diplomat,
along with strawberries,

802
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,255
raspberries and caramelised peaches.

803
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,215
But even with Paul's recipe on
his side, he needs to keep his cool.

804
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,375
In this weather, what you do is you
incorporate grated frozen butter

805
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,815
to add between the layers
and laminate them.

806
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,215
Oh, my hands are, like, freezing.
Frostbite.

807
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,575
Right, this needs to be in
the oven, like, asap.

808
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,935
So, they're gonna go to
the oven only for 20 minutes,

809
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,655
because they are just small
little cakes.

810
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,495
This will go in
for about 25 minutes.

811
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,935
So, pastry is gonna be in
the fridge

812
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,255
to chill for about 20,
25 minutes.

813
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,815
I'll start making my custard.

814
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:01,215
I'm currently mixing together
cornflour, eggs and caster sugar.

815
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,215
As the bakers move on
to their custards...

816
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,255
You just need to stir it patiently.

817
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,375
I'm making set custard.
It's really quick and easy to make.

818
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,695
...Sandro is chancing
a different method.

819
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,375
I'm doing it through the microwave.

820
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,735
How? Explain.

821
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,375
It'll go in to microwave for about
30 seconds at a time

822
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,615
until it thickens.

823
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,495
So rather than using a pan,
you decided to use a microwave?

824
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,015
Yeah. How do you feel about
the meecro-wavay, Paul?

825
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,455
If it works, it works.

826
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,855
Sandra's ambitious three tiers will
consist of three different custards,

827
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,655
a vanilla layer,
a coffee layer and a mango layer.

828
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,015
It'll be decorated
with butter cream roses

829
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,695
all in memory
of a very special person.

830
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,015
I wanted to do a tribute
to my friend that I lost.

831
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,655
She was, like,
helping me get on here.

832
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,255
I didn't even want to get on here,
really, like at the time.

833
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,895
What, and she encouraged you to...?

834
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,735
She wanted me to join the show.
Really?

835
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,095
Yeah. She would've loved
a cake like this for her birthday.

836
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,415
Well, she'd be very proud
of how you've done.

837
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,935
Yeah, she will be super proud.

838
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,255
Sandra's Showstopper isn't
the only one

839
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,975
to be inspired by someone special.

840
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,375
The Showstopper is a tribute
to my father-in-law who passed away.

841
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,335
He would've been really proud
to hear that I'm in the tent.

842
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,695
I just never got the chance
to let him know.

843
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,055
Maxy's gateau will feature exotic
layers of coconut

844
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,295
and almond dacquoise,

845
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,535
joconde sponge,

846
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,055
a lime and passion fruit curd

847
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,055
and a cascade of tropical fruits,

848
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,215
all set in place with
a more traditional filling.

849
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,535
I am making a creme pat.

850
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,135
Classic vanilla.
I want to keep it simple.

851
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,495
This is supposed to be about
the custard.

852
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,815
Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's gonna be
the hero, the custard, isn't it?

853
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,855
Yeah.

854
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,175
Some bay leaves,
some thyme to infuse

855
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,295
with my honey custard.

856
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,855
The judges are looking for custards
with perfectly-infused flavours.

857
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,735
I'm putting in pineapple
and lime.

858
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,695
I hope this will taste
exactly like a pina colada.

859
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,575
This is my chocolate
raspberry custard.

860
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,895
Janusz is taking his flavour
inspiration

861
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,095
from a favourite holiday.

862
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,335
So, I'm whisking Neapolitan set
custard gateau.

863
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,215
It's gonna consist
of three different custards.

864
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,855
Janusz's trio of custards will
comprise of

865
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,215
a dark chocolate
and raspberry custard,

866
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,975
a strawberry and ruby
chocolate custard,

867
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,295
and a white chocolate
and vanilla custard.

868
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,855
Keeping to his Italian theme,

869
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,215
he is soaking
his sponges in limoncello

870
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,535
and finishing off his cake
by decorating

871
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,095
with a white chocolate drip.

872
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,255
Have you practised?

873
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,815
I did practise, and I baked it in
high heels, as well.

874
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,135
You baked it in high heels?

875
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,295
Yes, just to make sure that
I can walk in those shoes that I had

876
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,615
for Halloween Week.

877
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,295
So that was me, 6 a.m. in my kitchen,
in my high heels.

878
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,575
In your high heels.

879
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,015
You know, I just feel like

880
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,655
there are too many rules in
this tent, you know.

881
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,455
It's really important that
the bakers get

882
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,855
to express themselves, you know.

883
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,895
Um, so, with that in mind,
bakers,

884
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,935
take as much time as you like
and bake whatever you want.

885
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,015
Paul won't like that.
Bakers, you are halfway through.

886
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,815
I'm taking them out of
the oven now.

887
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,055
The other cake is ready.

888
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,695
I am. I'm really happy with them.

889
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,615
Pop these in the freezer
so they cool quickly.

890
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,775
I've got one and two.

891
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,255
The puff pastry will try to rise,

892
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,215
but the trays above will
compress it.

893
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,175
I need the custard to be
a bit thickened.

894
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,215
I'm using gelatine, fully.

895
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,215
The consistency of
the custard is key

896
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,615
to a successful gateau.

897
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,695
Gonna go into the microwave
for about 30 seconds at a time

898
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,855
until it thickens.

899
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,295
And making the perfect silky
but firm custard

900
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,935
involves careful timing.

901
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,695
It's a bit grainy.
Like, usually it's very smooth.

902
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,055
Maybe it's the cornflour that
I didn't mix in properly.

903
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,415
I'm gonna make it again
just to be safe.

904
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,935
Thicken it too much and the custard
will be gloopy to eat.

905
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,815
See how set this custard is?

906
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:41,535
It's just right. Ooh.

907
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,855
But under cook it...
I'm a bit worried about this.

908
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,135
...and it could be a sloppy mess.

909
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,255
It's not thickening up.

910
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,935
At home, it would've been done
by now.

911
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,575
The pan's not very hot.
Have you had the wrong one on?

912
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,215
No, no, I haven't.
This is the right one.

913
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,375
Well, it's not very hot...

914
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,135
...at all. That's why.

915
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,455
It should be quite soft
when you slice into it.

916
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,615
That is a big bowl of custard.
I feel like I could jump into that.

917
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,975
Believe it or not,
we'll use pretty much all of it.

918
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,855
Really? Aye. Well, it's a set
custard gateau.

919
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,215
There needs to be...
You need a lot of custard.

920
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,575
...a lot of custard. Yeah. Ls there
such a thing as too much custard?

921
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,135
No. No.

922
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,015
Kevin's immense three litres
of custard

923
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,655
will be decked with nectarines

924
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,015
and raspberries upon
a dacquoise base.

925
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,375
The gateau will be topped
with raspberry jelly

926
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,975
and finished with
a cascading swirl

927
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,575
of Swiss meringue butter cream,

928
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,535
prosecco-infused macarons,
and bay leaves.

929
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,895
The thyme going in there's
going to be interesting... Hmm.

930
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,535
...to see how that works.
And the bay.

931
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,895
And bay, as well. And the bay.
Have you practised this at home?

932
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,935
Yeah, uh-huh. And when it comes to
the setting times for each layer,

933
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,215
have they managed to work OK?

934
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,575
Yeah, yeah they worked OK.

935
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,135
Ah. I'm setting the custard
with gelatine.

936
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,495
So it's like that,
it's just stacked? Yeah.

937
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,095
I think it sounds absolutely
wonderful

938
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,895
and I hope you pull it off.
So do I. Thank you.

939
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,975
Bakers, you have one hour left.

940
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,855
I wish I had three arms, honestly.

941
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,655
Or maybe eight, like an octopus.

942
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,255
I'm behind, because I had to make
one of my custards again.

943
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,135
I'll try to catch up as much
as possible.

944
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,535
While some bakers are waiting
for their custards to set...

945
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,615
It's going in the fridge.

946
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,815
...others are ploughing ahead

947
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,215
and assembling their gateau
with unset custard.

948
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,855
The hot custard needs
to be set together with the cake

949
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,175
so that it gels together.

950
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,175
I'm just putting the dark chocolate
and raspberry custard in.

951
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,495
And then a thick layer of custard.

952
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,935
Working with unset custard
makes it easier to create

953
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,295
the generous layers
the judges are looking for.

954
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,935
The custard layers are about
this thick.

955
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,535
Similar.

956
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,295
They wanted exactly
the same layers of custard to cake.

957
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,095
But deeper layers of custard...

958
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,215
Add another layer.

959
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,495
...require a longer setting time...

960
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,775
It's a lot of custard.

961
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,815
...to ensure a sturdy Showstopper.

962
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,255
It goes to the freezer!

963
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,895
Fridge. I need to let it set as
quick as I can.

964
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,655
Hopefully it will set on time.

965
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,015
You can see, like, it's not fully,
fully brown yet,

966
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,895
but it's only brown on the edges,
so, yeah,

967
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,455
maybe I'll just take it out now.

968
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,535
I hope this cools as instantly
as possible.

969
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,415
Syabira, we need to let
the bakers know

970
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,335
that they've got half an hour
left. Can you...? Mm-hmm.

971
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,655
Can you tell them all,
but in Malay, please?

972
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,055
Bakers, you have...

973
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,535
You all speak Malay, right?

974
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,215
It's an international language,
isn't it? Exactly.

975
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,735
Definitely not enough time,
but we'll try.

976
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,655
Press speedy mode on.
It's time to assemble now.

977
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,695
So now I'm getting the layers of
the coconut and mango clone.

978
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,215
I'm now spreading the hero of
the show, my custard.

979
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,295
It is ready now.

980
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,575
So to add some support,
I added raspberries.

981
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,095
Set.

982
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,175
Definitely not set yet.

983
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,975
How do you think this bake is going?
Do you think you're on schedule?

984
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,455
I'm a bit behind, because I had
to make my custard again.

985
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,495
It was grainy and I was like,
"You know what?

986
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,775
"Paul Hollywood will
notice that."

987
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,735
And I didn't want...
He'll put you in custurd-y.

988
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,855
Yes, he will put me in custody.

989
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,575
My passion fruit and lime curd.

990
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,775
That joke was a TRIFLE corny.

991
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,135
Orangey Madeira-type sponge
with vanilla custard.

992
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,135
I am so scared to open it.

993
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,735
But I've touched it
and it's pretty soft.

994
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,055
I'm still just waiting for
the custard to set.

995
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,855
I'm hoping it'll set quite quickly.

996
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,415
It's super jiggly. Jiggle jiggle.

997
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,135
Now I'm assembling the joconde
sponge with the coffee custard.

998
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,055
Bakers, you have
15 minutes remaining.

999
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,415
Cakes.
- You can do it.

1000
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,695
So, this is the peach layer.

1001
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,855
Pipe with butter cream.

1002
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,695
Let's do this, like, ruthless.

1003
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,415
I'm gonna coat them with
white coconut rurn.

1004
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,375
Creme legere. Creme legere is
a whipped custard cream.

1005
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,295
That looks nice. Can I drink that?
Yeah, you can.

1006
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,895
Maybe I'll just pour it over
my feet.

1007
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,535
That's a custard treatment.

1008
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,935
Custard treatment?

1009
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,895
It's actually good,
because all the sugar,

1010
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,775
all the butter,
it's actually moisturising.

1011
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,255
I haven't had a custard treatment
for a while, have you?

1012
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,975
No, never.

1013
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,495
Just set.

1014
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,175
As long as it's set inside.

1015
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,775
Would you like me to...?
I'll just turn it. How do I do it?

1016
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,135
You're gonna try
and pipe in there, all right?

1017
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,615
I'm cake boarding
and dowelling every layer.

1018
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,975
Yeah, come on, strong.
All right, all right, all right.

1019
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,975
Come on, Matt. We ain't got time.
Pipe really hard. I'm doing it!

1020
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,495
Oh, like that. Oh, like that.
All right. There you go, yeah.

1021
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,735
It's quite wobbly.

1022
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,055
Let's go, go, go, go,

1023
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,935
go! Go! Go! Go, go,
90, go, go, go, go, go,

1024
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,855
Done. Look at that.
I made a cake!

1025
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,215
That's not stable.

1026
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,735
Right, if you get Star Baker,
I want a cut.

1027
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,655
I'm sharing it with you. Yeah.
I'll give you 5%. Yes, please.

1028
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,775
All right.

1029
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,495
Oh, no.

1030
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,375
Not cool, not cool.

1031
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,095
The dowels aren't keeping it
stable enough.

1032
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,375
I'm gonna present it on two stands.

1033
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,695
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

1034
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,335
I'm getting stressed out.

1035
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,375
This is the vanilla custard now.

1036
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,735
If I'm making a cake,
there will be drip on it.

1037
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,775
Hopefully the flavour is
pina colada.

1038
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,615
Really pretty purple roses
and rosettes.

1039
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,935
The dried pineapple is gonna be
like a flower.

1040
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,335
Neapolitan ice cream.

1041
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,815
Trying to decorate as much
as possible.

1042
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,375
I'm very pleased with how it
turned out. I need more time.

1043
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,975
Do you need any help?
I'm trying to pipe that all over.

1044
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,415
Just, uh... I can't stop thinking
of my friend though, now.

1045
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,775
You pipe, we pile.

1046
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,695
It's three of us. Come on.

1047
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,655
I'm getting a bit overwhelmed.

1048
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,015
It's a very jiggly cake, babes.
I know.

1049
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,415
I'll go and help Kevin.

1050
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,495
Mmm. Yum, yum, yum.

1051
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,855
I know. We've got ten seconds.
What do you wanna do?

1052
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,495
Some nectarines.
Bakers, your time is up.

1053
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,815
Oh, that'll do, that'll do.

1054
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,055
Yeah, that's it, that's it.

1055
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,815
Please step away from your bakes.

1056
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,495
Well done, everybody.

1057
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,575
Sandro, how did you manage this?
Uh...

1058
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,015
You need to tell me what kind
of witchcraft you used inside.

1059
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,415
Witchcraft.

1060
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,335
Because that is crazy next level.

1061
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,895
It's judgement time

1062
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,655
for the bakers' showstopping
set custard gateau.

1063
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,455
Abdul, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

1064
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,295
It looks absolutely lovely, Abdul.

1065
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,175
It looks very professional.
Quite stylish.

1066
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,495
Let's have a look, shall we?

1067
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,375
We have raspberry
and chocolate creme pat,

1068
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,055
vanilla creme diplomat
with caramelised peaches.

1069
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,055
That big enough for you, Prue?

1070
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,375
Now, what are you trying
to tell people?

1071
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,335
Right...
Paul, you greedy man.

1072
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,655
The custard in both layers
is definitely the hero.

1073
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,135
I think the texture of
the custard's perfect.

1074
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,615
The pastry needed longer
in the oven. OK.

1075
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,455
Probably needed another five minutes
just to get a bit of colour as well

1076
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,695
more than anything else.

1077
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,055
But overall, I like the textures
and the flavours.

1078
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,935
I think you've got the idea of
a Mille-feuille spot on.

1079
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,255
Thank you. Really good job.

1080
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,575
Well clone, Abdul. Well done.

1081
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,695
Thank you.

1082
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,535
It looks impressive.

1083
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,895
I like the variety of colours
in the piping.

1084
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,895
I think it looks lovely, and then...
And the drip, drip.

1085
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,615
Obviously the drip.
The drip is perfect.

1086
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,655
There's a chocolate
and raspberry custard,

1087
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,575
there is a ruby chocolate
and strawberry custard,

1088
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,935
and a white chocolate
and vanilla custard.

1089
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,495
The proportion of custard
to sponge is good.

1090
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,775
Sponges are nice.

1091
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,095
All the custards are too gloopy
and too dense,

1092
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,215
too thick on the mouth.

1093
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,295
It's not fresh enough.

1094
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,655
I would've thought all those
flavours would be very fresh.

1095
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,015
The custard's more like
wallpaper paste.

1096
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,175
Don't mince your words, then.

1097
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,775
It is.

1098
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,855
Thank you.

1099
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,775
I don't know whether it's formal
or informal.

1100
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,455
I don't know whether it's messy
or very attractive or artistic.

1101
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,335
I'm not quite sure how
to look at it.

1102
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,135
Yeah, I'd say it's slightly messy
and really attractive.

1103
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,455
It's eclectic.

1104
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,375
Wow. Wow, look at that.
Look at that.

1105
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,175
I think your flavours are great.
Your sponges are good.

1106
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,175
However...

1107
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,095
...I'm not sure it celebrates
custard and makes it the hero.

1108
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,975
This is a beautiful cake.
The sponge is perfect.

1109
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,695
The icing's lovely.

1110
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,455
The problem is this was supposed
to be about set custard.

1111
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,895
There's very little custard

1112
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,495
and none of it is set.

1113
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,695
Thank you, Maxy.
Thank you, Maxy. Well clone, Maxy.

1114
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,055
Thank you.

1115
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,095
It is a pina colada custard cake.

1116
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,575
Well, I think it looks amazing.

1117
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,855
It is so unusual.

1118
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,175
You actually coated it with custard.

1119
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,575
It's much easier to just slap
butter cream all over it.

1120
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,855
It's just fantastic.

1121
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,255
Wobble-icious.

1122
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,295
Oh, my goodness.

1123
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,575
Wow. The amount of custard in that.

1124
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,535
It's great, isn't it?

1125
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,095
That's what it's meant to be
and it's set.

1126
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,215
That custard gateau is impressive.

1127
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,535
I've never had one with
so much custard in it

1128
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,695
and be that stable.

1129
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,575
The lime that comes through,

1130
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,175
the pineapple and then your coconut.

1131
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,215
I think the whole thing together
is just spectacular.

1132
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,855
And the other thing
that's impressive about

1133
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,175
so much custard is that
it's not too gluey

1134
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,495
and it's not rubbery.

1135
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,815
I mean, you've just hit it right.

1136
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,935
Look at the wobble on that.
I know. Like a jelly.

1137
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,575
Well clone, Syabira.

1138
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,935
Well done. Well clone.

1139
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,175
Smashed it.

1140
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,855
Syabira.

1141
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,415
I think it looks great. Very neat.

1142
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,095
The piping is absolutely exquisite.

1143
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,415
It's both bold and modern
and yet very creative.

1144
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,055
So, the bottom tier sponge
is coconut

1145
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,695
and you've got the mango custard.

1146
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,055
Well done.

1147
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:15,015
The second tier in the middle
is a joconde sponge with

1148
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,015
a coffee custard
and the top tier is

1149
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:22,055
a... orange sponge with
a vanilla custard.

1150
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,135
I think the bottom one's a triumph.

1151
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,015
It's clever.
The coconut mango is nice.

1152
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,775
Mmm, I love it.
That is a wonderfully light sponge.

1153
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,695
The coffee,
the sponge is really good.

1154
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,015
The coffee custard's
a bit glutinous, dry.

1155
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,135
OK.

1156
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,135
I think every one
of those cakes is highly sale able,

1157
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,655
absolutely delicious
and would be gobbled up by anybody.

1158
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,815
Well done. Well clone.

1159
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,135
Thank you.
Shall I bring this back?

1160
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,375
Thank you. Thanks. Thanks, mate.

1161
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,455
Well done.

1162
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,855
Kevin, would you like to bring up

1163
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,975
your set custard gateau
Showstopper?

1164
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,255
Do you want a hand?
Yeah, please.

1165
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,375
Have we had an earthquake?

1166
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,095
Wow, it's literally just...

1167
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,055
...dropped as it's opened right up.
Yeah.

1168
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,775
Right, let's have a look at the...
Yeah.

1169
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,575
See if we can get a slice.

1170
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,255
So what we have here is
a dacquoise sponge

1171
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,375
topped with honey,
thyme and bay set custard.

1172
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,975
Topped with raspberry jelly.

1173
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,655
Do you know,
that custard is amazing?

1174
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,135
It's so unusual.

1175
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,895
The more you have it in your mouth,
the nicer it is,

1176
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,615
and it goes beautifully with
the raspberries.

1177
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,095
The thyme and the bay is amazing.

1178
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,375
It works really well together.
It is delicious.

1179
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,775
It's a shame that it looks a mess.
Yeah.

1180
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,335
Thank you. Thank you.

1181
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,615
Well done. Well clone.

1182
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,015
They were ever so nice about
the flavours.

1183
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,695
They were really,
really nice about it.

1184
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,415
You know, if there's
a bit of hope there, I'll take it.

1185
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,175
I feel like I made my friend proud.

1186
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,135
I hope I'm in the chance
for Star Baker.

1187
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,615
You just never really, really know.

1188
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,255
I think Syabira clone a really good
job with her Showstopper.

1189
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,615
It is just unbelievable.

1190
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,335
I'm just like,
"Did I really make that?"

1191
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,175
I feel like I'm just standing there

1192
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,015
and I'm accepting it,
but at the same time,

1193
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,375
I feel like, 0h,
I nearly melt down to the floor,

1194
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,335
cos it's just too much
to handle.

1195
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,655
That didn't went as well
as I planned.

1196
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,135
I've made a gloopy custard.

1197
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,455
Definitely that puts me in
the bottom,

1198
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,455
so it's up to the judges.

1199
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,735
Well... That was a lot of custard.

1200
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,055
Yes.

1201
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,575
Or not, in some cases. No.

1202
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,895
Janusz was disappointing.

1203
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,215
It wasn't only that his custard
didn't taste great,

1204
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,175
they were gluey and spreadable.

1205
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,855
You said wallpaper paste. Yes.

1206
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,455
How do you even know?

1207
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,495
Ancl why have you been eating
wallpaper paste?

1208
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,855
Shall we talk about Kevin?

1209
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,015
The flavour were essentially
the best ones in the tent.

1210
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,615
They were amazing.

1211
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,935
What, thyme and bay?

1212
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,295
But unfortunately, the stability of
the whole gateau

1213
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,975
was not strong enough
and it just collapsed.

1214
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,775
If they were set,
they were often gloopy,

1215
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,495
and if they weren't set,
they tasted nice.

1216
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,055
You have to get it just right,
and I'll tell you who did,

1217
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,095
and that was Syabira.

1218
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,655
She really triumphed, didn't she?

1219
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,175
She had thick custard,
the flavours were terrific.

1220
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,895
It looked great.
The design was just so modern.

1221
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,975
What about Sandro?
He did a lot of work, didn't he?

1222
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,695
He's always ambitious.

1223
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,575
I think two of those cakes
were pretty well perfect.

1224
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,895
The bottom layer, the mango,
stunning.

1225
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,655
Who do you think is in trouble?

1226
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,215
I think Kevin, andjanusz is also
in line to go home.

1227
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,855
I can't believe that aboutjanusz.

1228
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,975
It tasted awful.

1229
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,495
Well done, bakers.

1230
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,775
That was a tough week.

1231
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,135
There were some very
impressive bakes,

1232
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,735
but there can only be one
Star Baker

1233
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,335
and the Star Baker this week is...

1234
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,575
Syabira.

1235
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,855
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

1236
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,935
OK, that leaves me with
the horrible job

1237
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,975
of announcing the person who will be
leaving us this week.

1238
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,975
Ancl you're such
a small little gang now.

1239
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,495
This is going to be horrible.

1240
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,175
The person who's leaving us this
week is...

1241
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,175
Kevin.

1242
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,335
Sorry.

1243
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,415
Well clone, Kevin. Thank you.

1244
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,735
I'm nothing but proud.

1245
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,215
The imposter syndrome's real and...

1246
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,055
...coming into this competition

1247
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,855
I didn't feel like I deserved
my place, but...

1248
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:13,015
I feel like I can count myself
as one of this talented bunch.

1249
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,695
Like... Oh, my...

1250
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,535
That custard is just extraordinary.

1251
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,855
I'm very sad to see Kevin go,

1252
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,535
but that custard will remain with me
for the rest of my life.

1253
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,455
I'm going to go home and do it.

1254
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,335
I think he's invented something
wonderful.

1255
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,975
Syabira got Star Baker again

1256
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,975
because that was
a proper custard gateau.

1257
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,495
She just smashed it
on every single department.

1258
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,175
Aren't you a clever girl? Thank you.

1259
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,375
Thank you. Twice.

1260
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,095
I wouldn't have imagined I would get
a Star Baker.

1261
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,775
Second in a row, that's wild.

1262
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,375
It's one crazy journey that I had
this week.

1263
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,975
Honestly, insane.

1264
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,335
A little bit sad I didn't get
Star Baker,

1265
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,695
cos I thought, like,
I was pretty close.

1266
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,455
I'm feeling good to be back
for another week.

1267
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,375
Oh, yeah, we're through to
the quarter-finals, innit? Yeah.

1268
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,855
OK, I'm through to
the quarter-finals.

1269
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,215
Whoo!

1270
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,415
Next time...

1271
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,655
What is this, mate?

1272
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,935
...it's the quarter-finals.

1273
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,495
I think it's cooked.

1274
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,615
Pastry Week.

1275
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,335
Oh, that is horrible.

1276
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,655
The bakers must perfect
their puff...

1277
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,175
I don't want to present raw pastry!

1278
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,135
...for a super sweet Signature...

1279
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,615
This is crazy, man.

1280
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,175
...tackle a tongue-twisting
Technical...

1281
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,335
Man-get-out.

1282
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,775
Mange-ay tout.

1283
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,335
...and create a showstopping
storybook of pies.

1284
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,495
I'm expecting nothing

1285
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,175
but perfection.
