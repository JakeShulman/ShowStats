1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,776
Hey, Matt, it's Bread Week,
and as a special treat

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,696
for the viewers, I've brought
in my mate Roger Crust.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,040
He's a loaf of bread
but he can actually talk.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,400
Noel, don't be ridiculous.
Bread can't talk.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,560
That's what I thought
but check this guy out.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,640
Say "hello" to Matt.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,120
Noel, I will tolerate your whimsy
to a point

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,920
but we do have a show to host.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,760
Oh, what's that about?
Why didn't you say hello?

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,920
Sorry, I got a bit shy.

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,240
Bit shy?

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,520
Well, I've never seen
a celebrity before.

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,760
What about me?

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,960
Can I still say welcome to
The Great British Bake Off?

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,480
Yeah, all right.

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,120
Sorry I got shy again.

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,560
Welcome to The Great British
Bake Off.

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,320
Off. There I did the end bit.

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,480
Roger Crust!

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,840
MATT: Last time...

21
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,360
Kakow!
The bakers battled biscuits...

22
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh, this is so stressful.
Why did I make it so thin? Right.

23
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,640
And while Maxy's
magnificent mask...

24
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,120
I think it looks totally amazing.

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,720
Won her a first Star Baker...

26
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,160
GASPS Oh.

27
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,720
Carole's cookie crumbled.
It's fallen.

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,840
But it was Maisam's mask
that slipped...

29
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,960
I'd have liked you to do just
a little bit more. Maisam.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,200
And she became the latest baker
to leave the competition.

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,240
This is definitely not
the end of my baking journey.

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,640
This time...
Oh, my God, OK.

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,240
The bakers are on Paul's patch.

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,120
I'm trying to get 'em in the proving
drawer before he gets over here.

35
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,080
Bread...
Panic. Ah!

36
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,520
They must impress
with perfect pizzas...

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,360
Oh. Forgot my mozzarella.

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,800
Tackle a classic
French patisserie...

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,200
I'm just getting rid all of
the feelings I've got.

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,680
And recreate a Swedish
celebration cake.

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,760
This is Tomorrow's World.
What's happening?

42
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,960
Who will be partying?
I was born in Sweden.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,480
OK. So you know what you're doing.
I've got an idea.

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,600
And who will be left
with that sinking feeling?

45
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,760
Didn't see this coming.

46
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,760
Bread week, challenging week.

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Paul's favourite.
Good luck to everyone.

48
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,040
After last week's escapade I did
lose a little bit of confidence

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,160
but then I've got my lucky big pants
on now!

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,160
My apple catchers!
So, ready for anything today.

51
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,360
I think it was my flavour choices
that got me where I was last week

52
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,560
and I just hope they like
these ones.

53
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,480
I'm scared stiff
about my bread decision.

54
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,160
It will either pay off
or it'll be catastrophic.

55
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,080
Good morning bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

56
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,320
Now, both Rebs and Abdul are a bit
under the weather this week but,

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,600
uh, with your permission we thought
we'd send them both straight through

58
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,680
to the final. I hope that's OK.
THEY LAUGH

59
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,040
Only joking!
They're just going to miss a week.

60
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,720
Hopefully they'll be
back next week.

61
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,200
Now for your Signature Challenge
the judges would love you

62
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,040
to make two sharing sized pizzas
that need to be delicious.

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,680
They should be the kind
of pizzas that make Paul

64
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,960
and Prue say "Mamma Mia!"

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,640
or the title of any other film
starring Pierce Brosnan.

66
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,960
You can take inspiration
from anywhere around the world.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,640
Goldeneye.

68
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,080
Good luck, bakers.

69
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,760
The Thomas Crown Affair!

70
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,000
You have two hours.

71
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,000
On your marks.
Get set.

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,840
Mrs Doubtfire!

73
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,160
I mean, he wasn't even starring
in that film.

74
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,840
No, but he was in it.

75
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,880
Pierce Brosnan played the new
boyfriend of the woman that...

76
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,976
Shall we go and watch it?
Yeah, let's go and watch it.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
All right, bye-bye.

78
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,840
Bake!

79
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
THEY LAUGH

80
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,000
I've made pizza more than once,

81
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,920
less than ten.

82
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,560
Pizza, seems simple, doesn't it?

83
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,280
Bit of sourdough starter.

84
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,800
Bit of yeast.
A little bit of beetroot juice.

85
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,600
Two hours is not
a huge amount of time.

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,760
I would spend most of that
preparing the dough.

87
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,520
The dough's got to be
a little bit wetter than normal.

88
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,320
So, you get those sort of bubbles

89
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,560
and these tend to scorch on
the top which I love.

90
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,800
I'm very much a firm believer

91
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,880
of pineapple does belong
on a pizza.

92
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,280
That's, like, controversy that, innit?

93
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,120
PAUL: Overload with too many
fillings will cause problems to

94
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,720
the base cos it won't be able
to bake properly.

95
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,720
So, good strong flavours,
not too many of them.

96
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,000
What we're looking
for is golden brown on the outside,

97
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,440
punching with flavour.

98
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,600
Look at this,
it didn't really blend well.

99
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,520
And we need two, ideally identical.

100
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,120
Ooh, I'm just going to start again.

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,080
I hope I have enough
sourdough starter.

102
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,760
James, morning.
Hello, James. Good morning.

103
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,080
Tell us all about your pizza.

104
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,360
So, I went for
the controversial option.

105
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,840
I went for a ham
and pineapple pizza.

106
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,040
I've tried to upscale it
a wee bit, so using pancetta.

107
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,640
I think you're very brave James.

108
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,840
I mean we might have been one of
the many people who think that

109
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,960
it's a crime to put pineapple
on pizza. Are you?

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,800
Uh, how did you know we might.
Why is that?

111
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,560
I don't know.

112
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
When you're a kid you love the idea
of a Hawaiian pizzarette thing.

113
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,800
Yeah, exactly.
It's blows your little mind.

114
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,680
MATT: James certainly hopes
that his grilled pineapple

115
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,680
and pancetta take on the classic Hawaiian

116
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,920
will blow Paul and Prue's minds.

117
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,320
But his choice of dough

118
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,000
might cause a bigger stir.

119
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,360
I had some strong bread flour
and I've also balanced it

120
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,480
with about, I think, 14%,
spelt flour. Why?

121
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,560
It just gives it like a slight sort
of nutty flavour. Really?

122
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,760
14% gives you a nutty flavour?

123
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,960
This is wild. You're talking nuts,
you're talking pineapple.

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,560
You're talking ham. Put some
toothpaste in there, I'm in.

125
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,360
Good luck James.
Cheers, thank you.

126
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,720
Is 14 too much spelt flour?
Is it too little? I have no idea.

127
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,360
Whatever flour the bakers use,

128
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,760
of equal importance is kneading
their dough until it's smooth

129
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,600
and stretchy,

130
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,640
to achieve the texture
the judges will be expecting.

131
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,480
I'm kneading.

132
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,320
Where did you see this technique?

133
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
In a book.

134
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,640
That wasn't from mine!
No.

135
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,400
I do it slightly different.

136
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,080
Care to elaborate?
No.

137
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,400
I actually learnt from my food tech
teacher in Year seven.

138
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,720
Don't know if it's
the right technique?

139
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,440
There's actually four of you doing
the same technique.

140
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,840
Really?
Yeah.

141
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,240
If he's not going to tell us, then
I just need to crack on,

142
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,360
do it my way and see what he's got
to say about it.

143
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,160
The practice went really well.
My family loved it.

144
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,080
I only got a tiny slice for myself.

145
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,360
Maxy will be hoping for a repeat
performance with the judges.

146
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,840
Last week's Star Baker has drawn

147
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,360
inspiration from her
favourite roast,

148
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,000
topping the pizza with lamb

149
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,280
and flavouring the dough
with rosemary.

150
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,600
I'm looking forward to that lamb.
Should be interesting.

151
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,720
How is it being Star Baker?

152
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,000
I still can't believe it!

153
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,960
I'm so happy!

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,480
You've got stars on, haven't you?
It's for you. Oh, thank you.

155
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,960
It's a little tribute.

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,400
Thank you, Maxy.
Thank you. Good luck. Sounds lovely.

157
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,960
Thank you.

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,920
I just hope I live up to the
expectations that they've got now.

159
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,440
NOEL: When they're happy
with its consistency

160
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,320
the bakers need to cover
their dough...

161
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,256
If you use shower caps
it's just sort of reusable.

162
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,456
I always nick them from hotels,

163
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,536
so if you ever have any just pass
them on to me, please.

164
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
And rest it in the proving drawer.

165
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,960
Off you go.

166
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,120
It needs to double in size
and then we know that it's ready.

167
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,120
MATT: But one baker still hasn't got
a dough to prove...

168
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,520
I abandoned my plan
with the beetroot juice.

169
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,400
It didn't foam up really well.

170
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,120
Having abandoned her first dough,
Syabira is making a second.

171
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,160
We wasted 20 minutes
just to figure out this dough.

172
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,880
I'm just going to put this onion

173
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,800
and start grinding
and make my sambal.

174
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,840
Syabira's spicy Malaysian prawn
sambal paste will provide the base

175
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,520
for her pizzas which will be topped
with prawns, anchovies,

176
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,680
and another South East Asian
speciality, the stinky bean.

177
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
I don't know if it's appropriate
to say.

178
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,480
Usually it stinks
when you have a wee. Ha!

179
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,200
So you're feeding Paul Hollywood
something that's going to make

180
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,440
his wee-wee smell?

181
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Yeah, that's how you mark
your territory.

182
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,400
That's why I love this lady.

183
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,720
While Syabira finishes prepping
her dough...

184
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,640
Ah, this is nightmare.

185
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,840
Most of the other bakers
are making headway...

186
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,320
Creme fraiche, cream cheese,
egg yolk.

187
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,376
With the sauces that will add
flavour and moisture

188
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,040
to their pizzas...

189
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,400
I decided to make my own tomato
sauce from scratch instead

190
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,000
of actually using passata.

191
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,280
And while most have gone
for savoury flavours...

192
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,280
It'll take about 40 minutes or so
to reduce right down to a thick jam.

193
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,160
Kevin's hoping to hit
the sweet spot.

194
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,720
I can't get behind
the idea of pineapple on pizza

195
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,720
but I thought I'd try another
kind of fruit.

196
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,480
This recipe's called
"Now Bring Us Some Figgy Pizza."

197
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,800
Kevin's hoping to balance his sweet
chilli jam and balsamic glaze

198
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,360
{\an8}with salty halloumi
and fresh rocket.

199
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,120
And the figs?

200
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,640
The figs I've just chopped
into little chunks

201
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,000
to scatter over the top.

202
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,320
Interesting.

203
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,496
Good luck. Look forward to trying
it. Thank you. Thank you.

204
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,080
Looks delicious. Good luck.

205
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,160
Figs had the Prue approval.
A-Prue-val...

206
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,320
Kevin's is the only
vegetarian pizza.

207
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah, I just need to let this boil
and boil and boil and boil

208
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,680
and boil and boil and boil.

209
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,000
While he can relax
until he's ready to bake...

210
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,680
Some black pudding.
There is lots to do.

211
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,200
The other bakers have additional
elements to cook.

212
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,000
Lamb's my favourite meat.

213
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,840
If I had long enough time
I would've made roasted lamb.

214
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,960
But Dawn's not letting
the brevity of the challenge

215
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,080
interfere with her preferred cut.

216
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,520
It's a beef stewing steak.

217
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,760
It's a relatively cheap cut
of beef, actually,

218
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,920
but it's lovely,
if you can give it a long cook.

219
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,920
So, I've cut it quite small in
the hopes that I can get it

220
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,120
to get reasonably tender in time.

221
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,480
I'm a little bit nervous about that
but we'll see.

222
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,160
Before baking Dawn till top her
pizza with mozzarella

223
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,000
and fresh chillies,
and for added Tex Mex appeal

224
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,000
she'll garnish
with sour cream and guacamole.

225
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,640
We've had it for dinner twice
at home.

226
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,200
I made two sharing size pizzas
and two of us didn't share.

227
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,280
We just ate the whole lot!

228
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,800
And she's not the only baker
looking stateside for inspiration...

229
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,360
You can't beat a Texas smoky
barbecue rub - you can't beat that.

230
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Americans do barbecue the best.

231
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,920
I'm going to get the peppers chopped
up and my pineapple of course, yeah.

232
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,360
Not only is Sandro combining
tropical fruits

233
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,880
with the taste of the USA,
he's topping with Spanish chorizo

234
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,160
and filling the crust with
a little flavour of France.

235
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,280
So I'm stuffing it
with Camembert and honey.

236
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,480
Good, I love a stuffed crust.

237
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,920
And I'm making it heart-shaped
just to add some love to it.

238
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,200
Good luck, Sandro.
Thank you.

239
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,160
That smells so good.
Can you do the judging?

240
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,720
Yeah.
Yeah?

241
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
Bakers, you are halfway through!

242
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,320
It's rising.
Imagine that.

243
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,936
Well, they don't have to imagine it
because they are halfway through.

244
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,640
Sometimes it helps to imagine
things... Yeah, but why...

245
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,480
just before they happen.
But you said it after. Oh, yeah.

246
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,080
My bread seems to not be rising,

247
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,200
which is a little bit alarming

248
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,480
because it's never happened before!

249
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,720
HE LAUGHS

250
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,640
We just keep it in there
until I'm ready to roll a minute.

251
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,040
I'm going to try
and get a second bread dough going.

252
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,720
Hopefully that'll be ready in time.

253
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,560
What are you doing?
Cutting up some reblochon.

254
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,640
What's that?
It's a cheese that you don't like.

255
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,440
I don't like any cheese.
What else is going in it?

256
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,200
More cheese.
Oh! Which one?

257
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Some gruyere.
You're making these up. no, I'm not.

258
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,840
{\an8}Carole's Gruyere
and reblochon cheeses

259
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,160
{\an8}will be combined with pancetta,

260
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,960
{\an8}potatoes and onions to recreate

261
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,120
{\an8}the classic French
dish tartiflette.

262
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,880
So, you're putting tartiflette on
a pizza? That's not unusual.

263
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,120
Where did you have this?

264
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,080
We used to move boats from
the UK down to the Med. Right.

265
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,560
Used to have to eat pizza
cos it was quick and on the go,

266
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,760
and this is one
of my favourite ones.

267
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,800
OK, so that makes sense.
Good luck. Thank you. Thank you.

268
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,120
When it comes to combining
national dishes with her pizzas

269
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,000
Carole is in good company.

270
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,120
I just think the combination works
really well

271
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,880
and it's a different approach
towards pizza.

272
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,440
Good morning, good morning.
Good morning, Janusz.

273
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
We want to know all about
your pizza.

274
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,680
I'm doing full English breakfast
on pizza.

275
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,320
There's going to be some
black pudding,

276
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,680
there's going to be sausage,
there's going to be bacon.

277
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,560
Mushroom and baked beans.

278
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,440
Oh!

279
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,640
I was feeling happy until you said
baked beans.

280
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,720
MATT: To complete his full English
Janusz is adding Cheddar

281
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,240
and mozzarella,

282
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,840
and in the middle he'll crack an egg

283
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,680
a few minutes before removing
the pizzas from the oven.

284
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,800
I'm not really concerned

285
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,240
and I'm hoping they're going
to like the flavours.

286
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,920
Right, it's risen, which is good.

287
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,120
Are you on schedule? I think so I'm
about to shape the dough.

288
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,880
Then I'm going to throw my
toppings on and bake. Go on, then.

289
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,320
Yeah.
Go on, then. Go on, then!

290
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,440
The second batch, it's not proved
enough yet, either way.

291
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,400
So, I think let's go for batch one.

292
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,240
Usually it's a wee bit kind of
puffed up and crispy

293
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,440
but I think it's just going
to be crispy!

294
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,560
They've got a little bit of
a hole going on.

295
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,160
Put potato over it.

296
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,680
SHE LAUGHS

297
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,240
The beef is not as tender as
I wanted it to be. It's too chewy.

298
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,160
How long do we have?

299
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,160
You have half an hour left
to make your pizzas!

300
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,680
I can't delay more.

301
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,096
Basically, if it's going wrong
you've still got time to order one.

302
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,680
THEY LAUGH

303
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,600
THUNDER CRACKS

304
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,440
As my English teacher used
to say that is a symbolic downpour.

305
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,720
I'm going to bake one at a time.

306
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,800
I've tried at home baking couple
at a time

307
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
and they don't bake as well as one.

308
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,680
Dawn, Sandro and James...

309
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
Bake, baby, bake.

310
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,200
Are also using this strategy.

311
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,440
I'm using the stone because I think
you get much better result.

312
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,680
Everyone else is baking both their
pizzas at the same time.

313
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,600
Think these are a well bit well cut

314
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,680
and all stuck together.

315
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,520
Nothing can compare
with stinky bean smell.

316
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,480
I don't know how to describe it.
It's just stinky.

317
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,200
Right, ready, steady.

318
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,920
I'm going to set my timer for ten

319
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
and then have a look
and see how they're doing.

320
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,040
220, ten to 12 minutes.

321
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,720
Oh, come on.

322
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,960
Normally, when I put them in
they kind of go "puff"

323
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,720
and they're done really quickly.

324
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,640
Not going to jinx it -
the crust is puffing up slightly!

325
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,920
HE LAUGHS

326
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,600
I never knew pizza dough
could be so stressful.

327
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,960
Egg is going in. Don't let me down.

328
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
And this is a typical breakfast
for you?

329
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,120
This is a Sunday breakfast
when you went out on Saturday.

330
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,200
Would you go to Revenge
in Brighton? I prefer Legends.

331
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,320
Oh, you prefer Legends, right, OK.

332
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,920
I can see that you've been there!

333
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,200
Well, I'm familiar with the concept.

334
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,840
Oh! Glasses.

335
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,200
That's looking good, innit?
Yeah, not bad.

336
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,960
See, spelt flour,
it's the way forward.

337
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,600
That's how you do it, Mr Hollywood.

338
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,840
It's got a lot of grease
but I'll say it's baked.

339
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,400
MAXY: Oh, no. Bit oily.

340
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,600
How does one ungrease a pizza?

341
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,400
Same way I ungrease my forehead.
Oh, I see.

342
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,000
With a little bit of a dabbing.

343
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,600
How long have we got left?

344
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,400
You have 15 minutes remaining!

345
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,400
It was going so well.

346
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,720
Kevin, I've put too much cheese
on mine. No such thing.

347
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,680
Well, I know that but it might be
in Mr Hollywood's eyes.

348
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,280
It's just a sea of cheese.
Great!

349
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,360
A bit soft underneath.

350
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,040
I'm going to give it another five.

351
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,560
I'll swap them over as well.

352
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,200
The oven must be a bit uneven.

353
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,600
Oh, forgot my mozzarella!

354
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,280
Oops! I knew there
was something missing.

355
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,840
I'm just going to sit here
and watch them.

356
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,320
It's a bit different in size.

357
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,960
One, two, three.

358
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,720
No.

359
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,960
Oh, my God! OK.

360
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,840
Ooh! Sorry!

361
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Bakers,
you have one minute remaining.

362
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,520
Nope.

363
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,640
There's just so much oil
in the middle.

364
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,280
Egg is runny.

365
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,080
Stick some figs on and then some
drizzle some balsamic glaze.

366
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,960
I think it's a winner.

367
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,280
I'm going to do it 30 seconds
and then blowtorch the egg,

368
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,760
what can you do?

369
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,000
Oops!

370
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,720
20 more seconds. 19, 18...

371
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,920
It's hot but let's make it hotter, eh?

372
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
16, 15...

373
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,760
Bottom is cooked.

374
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,160
It's just cooked.

375
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,760
Bakers, your time is up!

376
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,200
Please step away from your pizzas.

377
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,960
I think the egg yolk will be runny.

378
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,400
It should be excellent.

379
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,800
I think I've overdid it again.

380
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,400
The bakers will now have their
pizzas judged by Prue and Paul.

381
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,280
Hello, Syabira.
Hello. Hi, Syabira.

382
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,400
{\an8}This is my sourdough
and yeast dough pizza base.

383
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,600
{\an8}It looks great. I like the walls
that you've managed to build

384
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,520
{\an8}and I like the way you've kept it
all inside.

385
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,880
It looks very neat.

386
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,080
Good base on it - crispy.

387
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,720
I have anchovies,

388
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,200
dried shrimps and chilli.

389
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,720
Can't get all the flavours?

390
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,440
Except the chilli.

391
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,880
It's slightly overwhelmed
by the chilli.

392
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,160
But, nevertheless,
it's a great structure inside.

393
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,360
Thank you.
Yeah, well done.

394
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,680
{\an8}I think you've slightly overdone
the base.

395
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,280
It is very dark.

396
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,360
{\an8}Love your whole pizza
parlour table.

397
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,800
It's still runny.

398
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,000
It's still a bit, runny great.

399
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,600
I can't take him anywhere. Honestly!

400
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,480
There's so much in there.

401
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,520
PRUE: The crust is lovely and thin.
Thank you.

402
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,360
Weirdly, I'm not getting like huge
amounts of flavour from it.

403
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,920
It needs to be a little bit
more punchy. Thank you.

404
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,000
Well done.

405
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,920
{\an8}It's very pretty. Yeah.

406
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,856
{\an8}That base looks quite nice.
Going to be fascinating

407
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,320
to see what it tastes like.
I like the colour.

408
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,520
Yeah. Your dough looks a bit dead.

409
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,040
The chilli on the bottom works
beautifully well

410
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,240
with the balsamic and then
that little hint of fig.

411
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,680
I just think some of it's too sweet.
OK. Well done.

412
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,880
{\an8}The base looks all right.

413
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,480
You've got a bit of life in there.

414
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,200
The shape is awful.
Yeah. This one's all over the place.

415
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,920
Love the colours on the top, though.

416
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,440
Nice texture on the crumb
on the end. Thank you.

417
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,000
You promised us an upscale version
of ham and pineapple.

418
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,080
I think you've done it.

419
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,560
Thank you!

420
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,440
I just think it's a little bit too
dry. You need more tomato.

421
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,880
Fair dos, thank you.

422
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,320
{\an8}Probably could've had a little bit
more water to your dough. OK.

423
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,840
Just to allow a bit of fluffiness
to it cos there's no rise.

424
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,800
Surprisingly bland.

425
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,480
OK...
Was that beef mince?

426
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,880
It's not mince.
It's, uh, stewing beef.

427
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,880
Mince would've been better. Yeah.

428
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,376
That would've given you more
of a punch.

429
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,776
I think you've chosen
the wrong meat.

430
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,520
The chilli is strong.
I'm disappointed. Never mind.

431
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,840
There's lots more time.

432
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,480
Quite a thick base, isn't it?
Yeah.

433
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,680
It's a little bit more like
an American pizza.

434
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,240
Mm! Flavour is fantastic.

435
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,720
Thank you.

436
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,960
It's quite rich, that lamb,

437
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
you've got a great blend
of seasoning. It's delicious.

438
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,600
The only issue, for me,
is I think that base is too thick.

439
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,120
It does need to be a little bit
thinner. Thank you. Thank you.

440
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,200
It's a great shape.

441
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,920
It really looks so inviting,
doesn't it? Yeah, it does.

442
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,320
Thank you, darling.

443
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,640
This is really messy pizza.

444
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,400
Yes, it is!

445
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,520
I think your barbecue flavours
inside with the pineapple

446
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,840
and the Camembert
running all the way through

447
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,560
cos it carries such a nice flavour.
Pleased with that.

448
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,120
It's ingenious. You have got quite
a lot of different flavours there,

449
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,720
but they're still separate,
aren't they?

450
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,416
I'd have one of them if I was
in a pizzeria.

451
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,560
Oh. Yeah.
That's great. Well done.

452
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,040
You put too much of it on because
it's spewing out all over the place.

453
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,200
Can't really see the pizza at all. Hmm.

454
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,400
Little on this is better
than a lot. OK.

455
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,120
You've layered on so much

456
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,040
that that's basically what's
happened to the base. Hmm.

457
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,480
It should be holding.
Mm-hm.

458
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,040
Tastes divine.

459
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,880
It's absolutely beautiful.

460
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,400
So, you only made one mistake -
too much of a good thing!

461
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,560
Thank you.
Thank you. MATT: Well done.

462
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,560
Your worst nightmare.
I didn't even look at it.

463
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,080
I just looked at you!

464
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,760
Who doesn't want too much topping
on their pizza?

465
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,960
Usually, it's not enough topping.

466
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,160
It was bad. It was bad.

467
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,320
Oh!

468
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,960
I didn't get a handshake
but I think I was almost there.

469
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,760
I am glowing. Probably the
foundation on my skin but, yeah,

470
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,760
I'm very happy. I'm super happy.

471
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,240
The bakers were able to practice
for the first challenge

472
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,320
but the next one is a mystery.

473
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,720
Bakers, it's time
for your Technical Challenge.

474
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,320
Which today has been set by
the priest of yeast,

475
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
Paul Hollywood.

476
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,760
You have to be fast
and accurate with this recipe.

477
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,840
Mm-hm. Amen.

478
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,800
OK, as ever this challenge
will be judged blind

479
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,120
so we're going to have to ask these
two poppets to exit the tent.

480
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
For your Technical Challenge

481
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,000
Paul would like you each to make
a dozen identical pain aux raisins.

482
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,240
Your pain aux raisins must be evenly
filled with raisins

483
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,640
and a smooth creme pat.

484
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,720
Each pain aux raisins should have
a crispy flaky laminated dough

485
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,560
and should be rolled to a perfect
swirl which keeps its shape.

486
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,320
One more thing -
Paul has specifically said

487
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,040
he doesn't want tails.

488
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,120
You have two hours and 45 minutes.

489
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,800
Seems ample.

490
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,720
Oh, it seems like plenty of time.

491
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,040
On your marks...
Get set... Bake!

492
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,560
I think I have an idea
of what we're making.

493
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,680
Bread with raisins.

494
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,960
That is quite a challenging one I
must admit.

495
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,200
PRUE: So, Paul pain aux raisins -
that's not bread.

496
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,840
Basically, it's an enriched dough
when you think about it... Yeah.

497
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,560
With butter folded through it.

498
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,800
They've got to make a dough,
knock out your butter,

499
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,120
place it onto two thirds of the
dough, fold over the exposed bit,

500
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,640
fold it up and that is, basically,
one turn.

501
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,120
You have to repeat that process
of folding another three times.

502
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,080
But they roll it out again
a bit more?

503
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,360
Yeah, they need to pop that
into a fridge,

504
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,560
cos if they don't all
the butter just falls out

505
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,200
and it's as dry as a bone.

506
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,000
We did mention the tails.

507
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,760
As you roll up the pain aux raisins,

508
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,760
you're left with
a little bit at the end.

509
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
If the pain aux raisins is not
proved enough it'll pop the end out.

510
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,800
And it's called a little tail.

511
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,320
We don't want that.

512
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,720
Let's try a pain aux raisins.
Perfect texture, isn't it?

513
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,680
Hmm! I'd forgotten how good
these are. Just so divine.

514
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,200
Can I have another cup of tea?

515
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,680
Make a dough...

516
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,080
using 25g of the butter.

517
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,600
Which is very open
to interpretation.

518
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,720
I think I'm going to melt
the butter so that there's

519
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,520
a bit of warmth to get
the yeast activated.

520
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,920
Um, oh, wait no.
It says place it in the freezer.

521
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,880
This is an enriched dough.

522
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,640
So, it's along a similar line
to a brioche kind of bread...

523
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,880
An egg.

524
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,240
So it just requires
a bit of attention.

525
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,280
I think there probably is
a technique

526
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,840
but at the moment I'm just bunging
it all together.

527
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,880
I'm really not sure.

528
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
Say hello to someone that you love.

529
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,680
Hello, Brad. That's my boyfriend.
What's he look like?

530
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,840
He got no hair.
He wears the spectacles. Glasses.

531
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,720
Is he on the "Guess Who" board?

532
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
THEY LAUGH

533
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,760
It's actually pretty much done.

534
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,680
Going to place it in the freezer.

535
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,080
Just for five minutes.

536
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,160
With the remaining butter
we're going to make a rectangle

537
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,000
to go in to the dough.

538
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,840
LOUD TAPPING

539
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,120
I'm just getting rid all of
the feelings I've got.

540
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,840
To give the pain aux raisins
their flaky texture,

541
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,520
the bakers must fold butter
into the dough

542
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,760
in a process called lamination.

543
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,360
Roll the dough three more times,

544
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,120
chilling between each one.

545
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,840
If the dough gets warm, the butter
could leak out during baking...

546
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,680
Roll and chill, roll and chill.

547
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,840
Resulting in dry, tough pastries.

548
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,680
The butter has torn
underneath the pastry

549
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,440
so it means pastry's going to touch pastry,

550
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,360
but I've gone and done it now!
HE LAUGHS

551
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
How did it go?
Did you get a handshake?

552
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,400
No, I didn't.
What did Prue say?

553
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,200
She said it was bland.
That's fighting talk. I know.

554
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,760
Do you reckon you could take Prue
in a fight? Course I could.

555
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,960
I'll handle Paul -
don't worry about that.

556
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,920
Ah, that's a deal. So, we're sort of
almost a wrestling partnership.

557
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,640
We are, aren't we, like a tag team?

558
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,280
Can't wait,
I'll go and order some trunks?

559
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,640
This is my last fold.

560
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,160
So, back for chilling.

561
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,640
Very helpful.
It says, "Make the creme pat."

562
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,960
It's like a French custard.

563
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,320
It's egg yolks and sugar and milk,

564
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,200
and cornflour, basically.

565
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,080
The key to a perfect creme pat which
I often struggle with is patience.

566
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,040
Don't be scared of it -
treat it with absolute contempt.

567
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,040
Creme patissiere I can make
with my eyes shut.

568
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
Creme pat should be smooth
and creamy.

569
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,440
This is the right consistency.

570
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,600
If it's too thin
it'll make the dough soggy.

571
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,120
I thought it would firm up.
Didn't see this coming.

572
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,336
And now it needs to go to
the fridge as soon as possible.

573
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,040
It takes a long time to cool.

574
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,280
So, they're halfway through
and it's a two hour 45 challenge.

575
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,760
I can't really do the maths.
I can do the maths.

576
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,440
OK, you go for it. OK.

577
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,280
Bakers,
you have eleventy five minutes left!

578
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,560
LAUGHS

579
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,000
You're halfway through.
Ah!

580
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,680
Last roll.

581
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,480
So, now I need to roll it to

582
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,560
30 times 40.

583
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,320
Did you get those guns
from doing this? Yeah.

584
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,240
See, kids, if you roll pastry enough
you can have guns like that.

585
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,640
Like that.

586
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,160
Look at that.
I know.

587
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,960
Slightly smaller than mine.

588
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,840
Spread the cream patisserie
over the dough.

589
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,040
Sprinkle the raisins
and orange zest over the creme pat.

590
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,880
Roll into a sausage.

591
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,160
{\an8}Now we're rolling up
really tightly.

592
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,320
It's gonna be a big sausage.

593
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,880
Just going to divide them into 12.

594
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,120
{\an8}Problem is trying
to get them all the same size.

595
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,280
30 divided by 12?

596
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,760
If I do three centimetres.

597
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,680
That was a bit wobbly.

598
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,400
Oh, dear.

599
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,920
They are quite gooey.

600
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,520
Very wet.

601
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,000
The creme pat didn't quite
work out.

602
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,480
I'm pinching my tails

603
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,480
because Paul Hollywood
doesn't like a tail.

604
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,520
Well, that's your tail there,
so you tuck it in underneath.

605
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,360
Hopefully it'll keep it
where it's meant to be.

606
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,360
How much time have we got left now?

607
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,080
Bakers, you've got an hour left.

608
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,160
I mean, what you do with
the hour is up to you,

609
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,560
I'd do some baking,
but, obviously, it's up to you.

610
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,040
Prove is the one that worries me
cos how long do you prove it for?

611
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,640
I'm going to prove them
for around 25 minute.

612
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,480
If the pain aux raisins are
underproved they won't develop

613
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,760
the flaky texture
the judges expect.

614
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,520
I will just prove them until
I think it looks fine and ready.

615
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,840
They do need to put on some puff.

616
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,040
I haven't even bothered putting
them in a proving bag.

617
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,280
They're not going to dry out.

618
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,640
They're covered in a layer
of liquid creme pat anyway.

619
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,600
Who knows how they're going to end
up? This is uncharted territory.

620
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,520
I feel like patience is
the name of the game right now.

621
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,960
They are getting bigger now
so I'm quite, quite happy.

622
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,440
So what would you normally
be doing of an afternoon? Napping.

623
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,600
Yeah. Know where I sleep the best?
Where?

624
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,000
In the theatre.

625
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,560
What was that one that was about
Boy George?

626
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,000
Taboo.
Taboo.

627
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,920
I was in the original cast of it.
Oh, maybe it was...

628
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,680
Might have seen me. Oh, made an
impression didn't I, on that?

629
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,000
Cringe.

630
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,560
Ooh! Seems like this thing
has gone really hard

631
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,480
and the butter leak out.

632
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,640
Oh, stressing me out now!

633
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,960
They haven't puffed up as much as
I thought they would

634
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,280
but I don't know how much they're
meant to puff up.

635
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,720
Egg wash and bake.

636
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,280
Come on, boys!

637
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,080
They probably have to go in
for about 12, 15 minutes or so.

638
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,600
Until they are golden brown
and beautiful.

639
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,560
The thing I should've put them
on two trays

640
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,200
cos when they grow they're going to
bump into each other.

641
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,000
Schoolboy error.

642
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,240
Start the timer.

643
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,320
I'm going to go ten minutes
to start.

644
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,840
They're looking pretty decent,
I hope.

645
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,920
I think they're looking OK-ish.

646
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,560
I've got a nice view of all the
butter weeping straight out of it.

647
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,200
No, this is grim viewing.

648
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left!

649
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,360
OK.

650
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,360
They look all right.
They smell good.

651
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,120
I see lamination for the nation.

652
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
OK, so those are definitely ready.

653
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,440
It doesn't look like what
I've seen in the supermarket!

654
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,400
Almost had one of those moments.

655
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,840
Oh, dear that's a bad one.

656
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,640
Big tail.

657
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,440
On the sides they've not cooked
very evenly - yet another issue.

658
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,600
They're only just touching.

659
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,120
Make the icing and drizzle
over the cooled pain aux raisins.

660
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,600
Fan power.

661
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,920
How long we got left, guys?

662
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,000
Bakers, you have one minute left!

663
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,480
Panic! Oww!

664
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,720
It's a bit runny, this icing.

665
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,720
It's a dollop in the middle

666
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,240
and it does its thing.

667
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,880
Oh, dear, that's not very neat.

668
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,480
Is it too hot?

669
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,560
Oh, I hope I've got enough icing.

670
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,640
This is a good one -
that stays up front.

671
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,040
I wish my sizes were more
equal but...

672
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,280
They are what they are.

673
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,880
Bakers, your time is up!

674
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,560
Well done matey.

675
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,000
Elbow!

676
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,920
Please bring your pain aux raisins
down to the front

677
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,840
and place them behind
your photograph.

678
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,760
How did you get them so round?

679
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,360
How you did that I have no idea -
that's not fair.

680
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,880
I hate technicals.

681
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,040
Prue and Paul are looking for 12
flaky pain aux raisins

682
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,680
filled with a smooth creme patisserie

683
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,840
and they have no idea
whose are whose.

684
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,680
PAUL: Now, these are quite flat.

685
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,920
PRUE: That looks as if
the butter ran out of it.

686
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,280
The butter did run out of it.

687
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,640
The flavours are all right
but it is quite doughy.

688
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,280
A similar thing with this one.

689
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,600
They're square, got too many on a
tray, so they've joined together.

690
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
It's lost quite
a bit of butter, as well.

691
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,160
There's a bit too much icing
for me.

692
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,000
Yeah. Too packed together.

693
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,760
Moving on,
I quite like the look of these.

694
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,120
Yeah, nice and golden.

695
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,400
High, quite wide. No tails.

696
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,000
You have a flake.

697
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,080
Good flavour.
Very good.

698
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,600
Moving on...

699
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,880
{\an8}If I was in a shop, would you have
that one or that one?

700
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,880
Yes.
"Same price, sir."

701
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,720
Flavour's OK but so irregular.

702
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,560
These are all regular.

703
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,480
Some of them have sprung a little.

704
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,040
Yeah. Bit small again.

705
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,080
Needed to be a bit bigger
than this. Not quite risen enough.

706
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,240
Nice flake.

707
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,040
Flavour's good - just needed another
ten, 15 minutes proving.

708
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,440
Moving on. They are too small.

709
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,920
Underproved again
but flavour's good.

710
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,600
Very good orangey flavour.
I love that.

711
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,920
I quite like the look of these.
Yeah, some of them.

712
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,720
I'd feel a little cheated
if I got that one.

713
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,400
Hmm.
Actually, that's really nice.

714
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,640
It's not bad, its lamination's all
right. Flavour?

715
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,240
Lovely flavour, lots of orange.

716
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,480
Yeah.

717
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,440
These are...
Every one's got a tail.

718
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,160
They've definitely sprung.
It's well risen.

719
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,080
It's lost a bit of butter there,
can you see?

720
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,200
How dry it is down there.

721
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,200
The flavour's quite nice.
But the tail's a little bit ugly.

722
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,080
And, also, that's too much icing.

723
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,040
MATT: The pains aux raisins will now
be ranked from last to first place.

724
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,920
In eighth place, we have this one.

725
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,000
Carole, they're the wrong shape,
aren't they?

726
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,760
Because you had too many on the tray
and so they stuck together.

727
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,080
It's much too much icing
and underbaked.

728
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,000
In seventh, we have this one.

729
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,680
Underproved, you just didn't allow
them to grow. They're very skinny.

730
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,880
Dawn is sixth, Syabira is fifth,
Sandra is fourth,

731
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,280
and James is third.

732
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,640
Right, well, now we're getting into
the really good ones.

733
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,960
Um, who is this? This is number two.

734
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,800
Maxy, they tasted lovely
and they're very nice and tall.

735
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,000
One or two of them could have been
a little bit bigger.

736
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,120
Thank you.

737
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,520
But in first, we have these.

738
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,440
You had beautiful colour,
great flake and great flavour.

739
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,120
Well done.

740
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,960
My God!

741
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,680
I just cannot believe I got
the first in Technical

742
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,256
on the Bread Week because bread is
wild, it has a mind of its own.

743
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,800
Yours were really good.

744
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,400
I was so worried about my little buttons

745
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,240
but they got me a second place
so I'm quite proud of them.

746
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,040
Little bit of a disappointment.
But it was my fault.

747
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,760
{\an8}That went better than I thought.
Second last rather than last.

748
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,480
{\an8}HE LAUGHS

749
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,200
NOEL: Just one challenge remains
before Prue and Paul

750
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,800
decide who will be this
week's Star Baker

751
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,880
and who will be leaving
the competition.

752
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,400
Good morning, bakers,

753
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,800
welcome back to the tent
for your showstopper challenge.

754
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,720
Now, today, the judges
would like you

755
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,920
to create your own interpretation of
the Swedish smorgastarta.

756
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,280
Can you say that word again?
I've never heard it before.

757
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,160
Sure, Swedish.

758
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,280
A smorgastarta is Swedish
for sandwich cake.

759
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,920
The judges are looking for

760
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,200
an incredible savoury
celebration cake

761
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,480
made up of layers of sliced bread
with delicious fillings

762
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,400
and topped with exquisite
savoury decorations.

763
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,400
You have four and a half hours.

764
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,720
On your marks...

765
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,040
Get set...

766
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,080
Bake!

767
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,360
I had never heard of a smorgastarta.
Trying to search them, I was like

768
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,840
I'm not sure that these actually exist.

769
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,840
I think they've just made it up.

770
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,480
Gone to Sweden quite a bit,
but I've never had one of these.

771
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,080
Smorgastarta, it's going to be interesting

772
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,760
how people say it, isn't it?

773
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,400
Smorgasarte, smurgest... urgh.

774
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,000
Smorgastarta.

775
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:37,280
"Smorgas" - Swedish for sandwich,
torta, cake. Sandwich cake.

776
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,280
So you've got bread layers with
savoury fillings all the way down.

777
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,720
A savoury outside

778
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,960
and a beautiful decoration on
the top.

779
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,400
So I look at my list, it's just
a lot of things to make.

780
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,200
I'm nervous of some of our bakers
going a bit over the top.

781
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,320
I'm going to have three different fillings.

782
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,080
Sausages and a lot of cheese.

783
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,640
If you have fillings that are too wet,

784
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,200
it's going to soak into the bread

785
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,320
and then you'll get just
a sodden mess.

786
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,440
That's what exactly I did
for my practice.

787
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,560
You want it consistent with
a beautiful all-round flavour.

788
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,360
There's too much in it.

789
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,040
Must look like a cake
and taste like a sandwich.

790
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,040
It's the beast. Argh!

791
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,760
Hello, Carole. Hello, Carole. Morning.

792
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,000
Tell us all about
your smorgastarta.

793
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,680
I've been to Sweden quite
a few times now

794
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,560
cos we've got some friends over there.

795
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,800
And I'm doing a fish one

796
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,240
because if you go in one of
the supermarkets over there,

797
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,120
it is all fish.

798
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,840
MATT: Mackerel and salmon take
centre stage

799
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,560
in Carole's smorgastarta,
along with pickled cucumber and egg

800
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,800
sandwiched between white
seeded bread.

801
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,416
Can you tell us about the dough
itself? Can you tell me the flour?

802
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,840
Uh, one kilo of flour.

803
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,320
How much liquid? 750.

804
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,640
That's not the recipe that you've
just told me.

805
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,800
Go on. It's too dry.

806
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,240
Probably down to the amount of flour
you've got on the bench.

807
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,360
I'm going to get some more water.
Good luck, Carole.

808
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,960
He's a Prince of the East,
isn't he?

809
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,040
I was getting all, like, flustered
talking to him.

810
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,480
NOEL: A dependable bread is
the foundation

811
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,200
upon which every great smorgastarta
is built.

812
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,200
I'm just making
a plain old white bread

813
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,000
cos it's the easiest thing to do.
Can't go wrong.

814
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,720
But that's not stopped some bakers

815
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,360
being a bit out there with their
flour choices.

816
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,840
I'm using emmer flour.

817
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,400
I only discovered it
a couple of days ago.

818
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,320
I wanted to get that kind
of Greek,

819
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,480
slightly nuttier sort of flavour
to the bread

820
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,000
and I'm using an ancient type
of wheat

821
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,280
that my friend's son grows.

822
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,120
Inspired by her holidays
to Greece,

823
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,520
Dawn's nutty wholewheat bread will
be stuffed

824
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,520
with olives and feta

825
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,520
and sandwich pulled chicken souvlaki
and tzatziki.

826
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,400
Are you using coriander in this?

827
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,040
I have not got coriander in it. No.

828
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,920
Unusual. I'll tell you,
I don't like it.

829
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,040
Coriander's in everything
and sesame seed?

830
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,280
I know. I know. No, I haven't put
any sesame in there.

831
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,360
No sesame either. OK.
So it's the flavours that I like.

832
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,400
Good luck, look forward to this.
Thank you.

833
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,960
MATT: When they're happy
with its texture...

834
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,120
It sort of springs back.

835
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,160
The bakers need to get
the dough proving...

836
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,720
Yes!

837
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,600
And crack on with
the cooked elements...

838
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,960
This is fool-proof recipe.

839
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,840
That will fill their
sandwich cakes.

840
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,280
I don't know why they trusted me
with a deep fat fryer.

841
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,320
I wouldn't have allowed you
to have that.

842
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,040
Yeah, I said, "Guys, no.
Me and deep fat fryer - come on!"

843
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,920
I feel like, at the end of the day,
I'm going to walk off over there

844
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,000
and I look behind me
and the tent'll be in flames.

845
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,360
If there are flames,
you know who caused them.

846
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,360
MATT: Fiery curry sauce will cover
Janusz's showstopper

847
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,640
and it'll be filled with
fried cod and mayo,

848
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,680
crispy chips and mushy peas in

849
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,640
homage to his favourite post-pub
meal.

850
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,320
I honestly think it sounds
completely mad

851
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,920
and if you can pull it off,
I'll be so impressed.

852
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,080
Well, I must be mad.
Anyway, good luck with it.

853
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,520
Thank you.

854
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,120
Fish and chips is
a peculiar British thing,

855
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,840
especially with vinegar
and everything, yeah.

856
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,120
Which is really good.

857
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,880
NOEL: But Janusz is not
the only baker reimagining

858
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,000
a national staple through
their smorgastarta.

859
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,160
So nasi lemak is one
of Malaysian favourites to go for,

860
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,800
I am actually trying to mimic
the kick of ginger

861
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:10,040
and a bit of, um, the taste of the
coconut in this mousse.

862
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,040
Inside Syabira's nasi
lemak-flavoured smorgastarta

863
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,800
will be another Malaysian speciality.

864
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,320
Roasted chicken in
a spicy sambal paste

865
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,360
sandwiched between layers of
seeded bread.

866
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,560
This challenge is right up your
street, isn't it?

867
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,480
You've managed to incorporate
so many different flavours in there.

868
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,000
Obviously textures as well.

869
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,000
I hope it works.
Yeah. It'll interesting.

870
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,760
And it's lovely the way you stick to
your Malaysian roots, I love it.

871
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,160
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

872
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,360
This is the sambal,

873
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,560
dried shrimp, onion,
chilli paste. Whoo-whoo!

874
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,840
And Syabira has competition in
the spicy stakes.

875
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,840
I like my food to be proper seasoned

876
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,920
like, all the flavours coming through.

877
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,880
I mean, it'll keep vampires away.

878
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,760
So Noel might not like it much.

879
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,680
Coated in maple bacon
and cream cheese

880
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,360
and filled with pulled beef brisket,

881
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,480
sloppy Joe sauce and spicy sirloin steak,

882
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,720
Sandro's three tiered smorgastarta

883
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,360
has been designed to meet
a particular need.

884
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,080
You know when you go to
a festival

885
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,960
and you get really, really tipsy,

886
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,920
you need something to bring down
the drunk,

887
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,040
so you go for the burger
that looks most appealing.

888
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,200
MATT: You go to a lot
of festivals, don't you, Prue?

889
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,160
I saw her at Wireless last year.

890
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,440
Glastonbury. In the mosh pit.

891
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,000
Definitely getting barbecue vibes
from you, mate.

892
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,480
Yeah, I mean, I am Brazilian,
after all.

893
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,520
It's a proper meat fest, isn't it?
All right,

894
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,880
Sandro, good luck, man.
Yeah, sounds interesting.

895
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,000
Thank you.

896
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,680
I would say they're doubled.

897
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,800
MATT: When they're happy
with their first prove...

898
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,440
We have black dough,

899
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,560
we have a white dough.
What more can you want?

900
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,160
The bakers need to shape
the dough into tins...

901
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,320
Just knocking out the air.

902
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,000
He's over there. I'm trying to get
them in

903
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,960
the proving drawer before he gets
over here.

904
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,720
I'm just spreading out the filling.

905
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,600
And prove it again before baking.

906
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,160
I'm going to make wee buns
that look like pandas.

907
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,480
Which personally is my favourite
part of this dish.

908
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,160
You know, I love a panda.

909
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,960
With the aid of squid ink,
James is making two-tone milk bread

910
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,720
and filling it with char sui pork
and plum sauce

911
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,280
for a Chinese panda-inspired
smorgastarta.

912
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,480
I have a tattoo of a panda,
first one I got,

913
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,800
and it was because in 2016, pandas
were made no longer endangered

914
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,560
so I thought that we should
celebrate them being closer

915
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,440
to back to normal, you know?

916
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,960
It's like they're going for a wee
bath, isn't it?

917
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,240
SINGS: Pandas in a jacuzzi.

918
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,160
MATT: Bakers, you are halfway through.

919
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,240
My bread's not even in the oven yet.

920
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,680
It didn't rise as much as
I wanted it to,

921
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,480
but, hopefully, it rises more in
the second rise.

922
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,960
Maxy's making a plain white
and seeded wholemeal loaf

923
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,680
for a showstopper that's based on
a classic seafood smorgastarta

924
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,680
she remembers from her childhood.

925
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,720
I thought I'd stick to the traditional,

926
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,976
seeing as I was born in Sweden.

927
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,360
OK, so you know what you're doing.

928
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,240
Don't really, but, you know,
I've got an idea.

929
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,280
It sounds quite fresh,

930
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,720
the idea of the flavours seem
to balance all the way through.

931
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,320
It's just getting that look. Yeah.

932
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,200
Well, you've been having a good week
so far, so let's hope it continues.

933
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,760
Thank you so much. Thank you, Maxy.

934
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,520
I do feel extra pressure.

935
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,640
Everyone expects me to be able
to make a masterpiece.

936
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,200
Let's do this, babes.

937
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,240
My dough has proved - it's time
to bake.

938
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,960
This hand has been specially
moisturised today

939
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,320
so I can get that shake.

940
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,160
While the others start baking...

941
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,120
Are you joking me?
It wasn't preheating.

942
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,160
Maxy risks falling behind.
That's a nightmare.

943
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,240
And besides a cold oven,
she faces a daunting challenge.

944
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,320
I'm trying to make mayonnaise
for the first time.

945
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,440
I've never made mayo in my life.

946
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,440
Mayonnaise - is that hard?
Yeah. I've only done it once before.

947
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,960
Why does one make mayonnaise?
Can't you just buy mayonnaise?

948
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,440
You get better flavour
and it shows skill as well.

949
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,800
So I'm going to make my own mayo.

950
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,960
One of those weird things that
people do.

951
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,840
This is a workout, oh, gosh.

952
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,080
You need the fats of the oil
to emulsify with

953
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,600
the fats of the egg yolks.

954
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,800
I was whisking too hard.

955
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,560
Janusz has made
a rather fine mayonnaise.

956
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,040
It's good. My first-ever mayo.

957
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,360
It's not rocket science, I think.

958
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,560
I just hope I have enough
cooling time.

959
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,360
Bakers, an hour and 46 minutes ago,

960
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,000
we should've told you you have
two hours and 46 minutes remaining.

961
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,960
An hour left. An hour left, yeah.
I did the maths.

962
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,840
So I'm looking for it
to sound hollow.

963
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,560
It's got a nice beat to it.

964
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,240
They haven't puffed up as much as
I would've liked.

965
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,040
MATT: If the bakers cut their bread
now, it'll tear.

966
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,000
It's like a game of chicken,

967
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,880
trying to decide when
I dare cut it.

968
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,960
Most are using the cooling time
to work on their decorations.

969
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,240
What are you doing there?

970
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,440
So I'm building a little person

971
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,120
and he'll be holding
a little fishing rod.

972
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,880
What are you going to call him? Rod?

973
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,000
Rod. I like it.

974
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,400
If it was a woman, you could call
her Annette.

975
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,720
But they're not holding a net.

976
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,920
Right. It's a rod.
I did my best.

977
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,280
Rod will sit on Kevin's two-tier
smorgastarta

978
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,480
which is based on his wife's
favourite fish pie recipe.

979
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,480
I've baked for years,
but I didn't really cook.

980
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,800
My wife had to teach me how to cook.

981
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,640
She makes a mean fish pie,
so I think it's a pretty safe bet.

982
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,080
Whether from the sea...

983
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,440
So I've got salmon and smoked haddock.

984
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,240
They'll go with some prawns.

985
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,600
Or the land...
Oh, yeah, that's ready.

986
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,040
The savoury elements need
extra attention.

987
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,080
What are you doing now? What's this,
Tomorrow's World, what's happening?

988
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,320
I don't want great chunks.

989
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,840
Before they can fill
the baked smorgastartas...

990
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,880
It looks like human flesh,
to be honest.

991
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,136
If you had to eat someone in
the tent, who would you eat?

992
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,200
Matt. Matt?! Yeah. Really?!
So I can soak up all his jokes.

993
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,000
Wow, what about me?
Nothing? Am I the wishbone?

994
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,960
They're still a little bit warm,
but I think we're OK to cut it.

995
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,680
Thought it'd be like fleecing
a sheep.

996
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,920
Comes out quite nicely.

997
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,440
Oh, look at them pandas.
This one's missing an ear.

998
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,920
I don't know where it went
cos it's not in the pan.

999
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,040
Has anyone seen one of James's ears?

1000
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,840
In my pocket.

1001
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,280
Oh. Oh, no!

1002
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,440
Feels quite close in texture

1003
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,760
and doesn't feel very light
and fluffy.

1004
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,040
Bakers, you've had four hours.

1005
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,560
You're "smorganmindys" need to be
finished in half an hour.

1006
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,400
So the first layer is the fish
filling with pepper sauce.

1007
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,120
Going to put the eggs.

1008
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,200
This is the plum sauce going on

1009
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,680
and I'm going to shred some cabbage
and start layering it up.

1010
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,280
That was close.

1011
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,080
This is the fish pie filling.
And I need some prawns.

1012
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,120
So I'm adding the sirloin
steak filling.

1013
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,560
This really felt weird, I'm doing
a savoury cake.

1014
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,800
How's this all going?

1015
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,360
Yeah, good,
just going to put the second...

1016
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,040
I've just realised I needed four
layers, not three.

1017
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,840
So you've got to make
a whole layer out of...

1018
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,200
that.

1019
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,320
It's like a burger, innit?

1020
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,040
I don't have enough time, so I'm
just trying to power through.

1021
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,880
I'm just going to spray vinegar on
chips, and now mushy peas.

1022
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,560
My mousse is very runny,
I'm not happy with it.

1023
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,240
So stressful about my mousse.

1024
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,240
I tried to do it neatly.

1025
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,480
Change of plans - I'm going to use
cream cheese,

1026
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,880
mix with this one, add more ginger.

1027
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,160
I'm about to pipe curry sauce
and it's turning by itself

1028
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,120
which is pretty helpful.

1029
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,360
It's a bit runny
so it's not covering it well

1030
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,200
but I'm going to stick stuff on
the side to hide that.

1031
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,000
It's going to be a milder taste of
the coconut milk

1032
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,920
with the cream cheese.
It's a hiccups, isn't it?

1033
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,080
How long have we got left,
if I can ask?

1034
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,200
You have ten minutes left.

1035
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,760
Oh, this is untidy.

1036
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,440
Something just fell off.

1037
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,880
We are slicing the babe in half.

1038
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,120
My boyfriend designed it.

1039
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,200
It's the future winner
of Great British Bake Off.

1040
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,200
Lots of decorating.

1041
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,240
I'm feeling quite good about it.

1042
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,440
We'll put the good panda at the top
- he deserves pride of place.

1043
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,440
I think this could send me home.
It's not looking too hot.

1044
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,080
We can make it.

1045
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,920
Trying to use a chive to make
a fishing line.

1046
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,680
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1047
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,080
You are kidding me.

1048
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,800
Oh, no! His backside's fallen off.

1049
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,480
Stay. Oh, God.

1050
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,360
INDISTINCT

1051
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,320
I'm so sorry for whoever has
to hoover after me.

1052
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,120
That's very fiddly under pressure,
this bit.

1053
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,200
Anything else I do is
going to make it look worse.

1054
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,680
Oh, I'm just throwing things
on now.

1055
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,880
There we go.

1056
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,040
Your time is up.

1057
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,400
Sure.

1058
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,440
Please step away from
your "smorkalorkadorkens".

1059
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,760
That was a long one.
We're a little bit older now.

1060
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,120
Well, actually a lot older.
Oh, gosh, what a mess.

1061
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:36,720
The bakers' smorgastarta will now
face the judgment of Pru and Paul.

1062
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,600
Janusz, would you like to bring
up your smaller tortoise?

1063
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,880
Wow!

1064
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,560
Unbelieve-a-bubble.

1065
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,560
To be honest, I think the idea of
fish and chips in a sandwich

1066
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,160
is disgusting. LAUGHTER

1067
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,560
Wow! You've got a layer of fish,
it's on potatoes,

1068
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,800
and a layer of mushy peas in
curry sauce flavoured icing.

1069
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,320
Oh, my goodness, look at that.
That looks really beautiful.

1070
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,560
Very clever fellow.

1071
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,080
Your bread is lovely,
it's really light.

1072
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,960
You do get fish and chips
all the way down,

1073
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,840
including the mushy peas and the
curry sauce on the outside.

1074
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,680
It's ingenious.

1075
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,200
MATT: Are you still disgusted, Pru?
PRUE: No.

1076
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,520
I have to eat my words. That is
delicious. Thank you.

1077
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,920
Thank you. Fantastic.
Well done. Fantastic.

1078
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,000
WHISPERS: Genius.

1079
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,080
How very Fanny Cradock.
It's very '60s.

1080
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,360
I think it's absolutely lovely.

1081
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,200
Thank you. Maybe because
I practically come from the '60s.

1082
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,120
Right. I did a white seeded bread,
the bottom layer is

1083
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,920
a mackerel mousse with
beetroot on top. Look at that.

1084
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,480
With another layer of avocado
and egg, and the next layer is

1085
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,160
salmon mousse with salmon slices
and pickled cucumber.

1086
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,880
The beetroot layers with
mackerel is lovely.

1087
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,040
The egg and avocado needs a bit
more basic seasoning.

1088
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,880
Salmon and pickled
cucumber's lovely.

1089
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,080
Your bread is still a little
bit too dry. OK.

1090
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:24,640
I would have gone more rye to
balance with the fish. Hmm. OK.

1091
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,720
Thank you. Well done.

1092
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,360
It's a bit wonky but I like the top
with the panda on it. It's clever.

1093
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,560
Thank you.

1094
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,880
It's milk bread that's been marbled
with squid ink,

1095
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,240
plum sauce and char siu pork,

1096
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,880
and pork belly done in a sweet
chilli sauce. MATT: Wow.

1097
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,360
PRU: Your marbling worked, didn't
it? Yeah, I was quite proud of it.

1098
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,280
I actually quite like the flavour.
It's a bit one-dimensional.

1099
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,400
OK. It feels like the same all
the way through.

1100
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,320
Can I just mutilate a panda?

1101
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,840
Come on, Pru, there's not many left
as it is.

1102
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,400
That really is nice bread.
It's lovely. Thank you.

1103
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,400
I wondered what this was. It is
a bloke. It's a fisherman, yes.

1104
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,800
It's crazy, Kevin.

1105
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,000
It's clever. I mean, it's
wilted a lot around here.

1106
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,880
I'm not sure this is
the correct choice.

1107
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,320
Yeah, I roasted them and
I overdid it.

1108
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,880
The fillings are fish pie
and devilled eggs,

1109
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,200
and pickled gherkins and radishes.
I like the flavours.

1110
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,440
The bread is slightly over-baked,
it's dry and it shouldn't be dry.

1111
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,040
Yeah. I think it's a
little bit messy but it's amusing

1112
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,080
and it tastes really good.

1113
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,120
Thank you.

1114
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,520
I must say it's certainly colourful.

1115
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,000
I think it's a little
messy on the top.

1116
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,960
I've got white loaf and I've got a
seeded wholemeal loaf as well.

1117
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:10,160
Fillings are salmon and avocado, egg
and cress, and prawn and crayfish.

1118
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,000
I think your three fillings
are delicious, well seasoned

1119
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,280
and balanced, and they actually all
go together quite nicely.

1120
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,720
The seeded one is a little bit too
heavy. The white is lovely.

1121
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,080
But I honestly congratulate you for
trying to do two breads anyway.

1122
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,760
It's a lovely idea. Thank you.

1123
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,360
It looks absolutely astonishing,
it's beautifully constructed,

1124
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,080
it's really original,
it's wonderful.

1125
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,160
The bottom layer is
eggs with cucumber

1126
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,880
and the middle layer is
the roasted marinated chicken.

1127
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:54,680
And the top layer is the sambal
anchovy cream with peanuts.

1128
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,440
Mm! The chicken in particular
is delicious. Isn't it?

1129
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,960
Really delicious. It's really good

1130
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,840
and the lightness of the cucumber
adds to that,

1131
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,120
it balances everything out.

1132
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,120
Terrific design, really good
flavours. Unusual.

1133
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,840
It's lovely. Thank you.

1134
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,840
That was amazing.

1135
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,240
You've got a little bit of a lean.

1136
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,656
But I'm not surprised with the
amount of meat inside this thing.

1137
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,200
It's ridiculous.

1138
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,720
I've got the shredded beef,

1139
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,880
sirloin steak and I've got sloppy
Joe's in there.

1140
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,640
The bread is baked beautifully,
it's soft, it's light.

1141
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,880
The frosting balances well
with the inside,

1142
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,000
because inside you've got that tang
coming from the barbecue.

1143
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,640
You cannot identify any of the food

1144
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,120
because the barbecue sauce
overwhelms everything.

1145
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,640
I don't see a lot of difference
between them all,

1146
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,960
but it really is delicious.
Thank you. Well-made though.

1147
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,040
Yeah, thank you. Thank you.
Well done, Sandro.

1148
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,920
Dawn, I think it really looks
lovely, it's a very simple design.

1149
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,800
Let's hope it tastes as nice
as it looks.

1150
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,920
Ooh. MATT: Look at that.

1151
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,840
PRU: I think the bread's good,

1152
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,560
but some of the bread slices are
just too thick.

1153
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,120
Yeah.

1154
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,920
You're missing dried mint,
sesame seed, coriander,

1155
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,040
all these key flavours that,
in Greece, is well known.

1156
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,600
It's about identifying the flavours
and it's too bready as well. Yeah.

1157
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,520
Bread Week has been
an embarrassment.

1158
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,920
I think I'm at the bottom of the
pile this week. I'm quite concerned.

1159
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,760
I'm really pleased with myself
because I took a big risk.

1160
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,720
You know, it looks like
fish and chips.

1161
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,840
They loved it, which I'm very happy.

1162
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,000
The one redeeming feature was
the little cucumber man.

1163
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,240
I'm pinning my hopes on him.

1164
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,200
So, eight bakers. Did that make
the competition a little tougher?

1165
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,000
Honestly I think the show stopper
had been one of the most

1166
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,040
difficult I've judged ever.

1167
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,760
There were some exceptional
things in that showstopper.

1168
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,760
I think Janusz has done
exceptionally well.

1169
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,680
But I think Syabira's
was even better.

1170
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,440
Sort of Malaysian favours,
they were fantastic.

1171
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,360
Sandro should be up there as well.
His pizza was excellent,

1172
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,480
fourth in technical and the bread
was exceptional.

1173
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,600
This morning, I was pretty sure
Carol would be leaving

1174
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,880
because she did so badly yesterday

1175
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,200
and I think she's saved herself.

1176
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:39,720
For me, she's still in that bottom
three, along with Dawn.

1177
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,560
That was pretty bland.

1178
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,320
I think Kevin struggled as well.
It looked a bit of a mess.

1179
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,400
You've got to look at Kevin,
Dawn and Carol. Because

1180
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,160
they were all so equal, we have to
look at all their scores carefully.

1181
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,360
Hello, bakers.

1182
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,320
I've got the brilliant job this
week of announcing the Star Baker

1183
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:09,120
and the person who is Star Baker
this week is...

1184
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,120
Janusz.
CHEERING

1185
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,680
Thank you.

1186
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:26,600
And I have the horrible job of
announcing who's going home.

1187
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,320
And the person going home
this week is...

1188
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,720
Well, this week,
nobody's going home.

1189
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,920
APPLAUSE

1190
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:49,960
The judges felt, given the quality
here and the fact that Rebs and

1191
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,440
Abdul aren't here, that everybody
deserved the chance to bake again.

1192
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,880
Thank you so much.

1193
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,960
Hearing that you are a Star Baker,
it's a feeling out of this world.

1194
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,080
You just cannot believe it,
that someone says,

1195
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,520
"No, you're the one this week."

1196
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,240
Janusz is very artistic.

1197
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,720
Almost illusion in some
of his bakes.

1198
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,480
He's clever and he's certainly one
to watch going forward.

1199
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,200
Wow.

1200
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,360
I dodged a bullet.

1201
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,920
So relieved. That was like
squeaky bum time.

1202
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,000
For the next few days
I just want to sleep but no,

1203
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,360
it's practice every day.

1204
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,400
I've got my online shopping coming
tomorrow, I'm going

1205
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,320
to be on the ball.

1206
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,960
They were all thrilled to bits
because nobody had to go,

1207
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,336
they're all friends, they don't
want to see their friends go,

1208
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:39,280
but sooner or later we have
to send two bakers home

1209
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,440
and that's not nice.

1210
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,760
Next time...
Cheat. We have a cheat in the tent.

1211
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,560
It's back to full strength for a
Bake Off first... It's Mexican week.

1212
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,120
And the bakers are confronted with
a yeasty signature...

1213
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:58,680
Like a generous portion, I do.
A meaty technical...

1214
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:03,520
Like a mad professor, I am flinging
things into a bowl.

1215
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:07,240
And a teetering, towering
dairy-soaked showstopper.

1216
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,080
Why is it so bulged to this side?
Oh, my goodness, I'm going to cry.

1217
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,800
Who will win out in the ultimate
Mexican stand-off...

1218
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,560
Oh, my God.
And whose time in the tent is up?

1219
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,240
Looks like you sat on them.
Now I'm in panic mode.

1220
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,840
Are you a Star Baker in the making?

1221
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,920

series of Bake Off, visit...
