00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Hello, viewer. Hello, Noel.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,800
Are you excited for Mexican Week?

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,880
I'm really excited,

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,240
although I don't feel like
we should make Mexican jokes,

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,720
cos people'll get upset.

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,320
Oh, no Mexican jokes at all?
I don't think so.

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,880
What, not even Juan?

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,440
Not even Juan.

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,800
Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,240
Last time, Bread Week saw
two empty spaces in the tent...

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,360
Both Rebs and Abdul
are a bit under the weather.

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,520
...Carole and Dawn
hit a bad patch...

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,760
Surprisingly bland.

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,880
OK.

15
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,520
They're the wrong shape,
underproved and underbaked.

16
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,760
...and Sandro was in the running
for Star Baker...

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,320
Wowzers!

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,040
...but Janusz's creativity...

19
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,280
It's ingenious.

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,200
...saw him take the crown
for the second time.

21
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,520
When it came down to
who was in for the chop,

22
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,800
the judges gave the bakers a break.

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,120
Nobody's going home.

24
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,560
This time...

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,080
Nerves, man, nerves.

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,760
...we're back to full strength...

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,880
I think that all eyes
are going to be on me

28
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,320
and Abdul after missing last week.

29
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,760
...for a Bake Off first.

30
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,160
It's Mexican Week.

31
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,960
The bakers will do battle
with an enriched Signature...

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,080
Oh, no, they're burnt.

33
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,400
...get into a Mexican stand-off
with a street food Technical...

34
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,120
Don't go mad, Carole.

35
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,200
...and try to pull off
a dairy rich extravaganza

36
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,840
in a mucho challenging Showstopper.

37
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,360
Just don't want it to collapse.

38
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,240
Are you worried about your crack?

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,640
All the best, my darling.

40
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't really know
much about Mexican cuisine,

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,640
so this is an absolute adventure.

42
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,880
See you in a bit. Good luck.

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,120
When someone says Mexican food,
my mind goes only to fajitas.

44
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,840
That's where my knowledge stops.

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,080
Yeah, Mexican food's fun,

46
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,680
but Mexican baking -
what do the Mexicans bake?

47
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,760
I did have to research it,
cos, you know,

48
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,760
you just do the savoury, really.

49
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,880
I love Mexican food,

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,960
so I'm looking forward
to bake it in a tent.

51
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,200
Bakers, welcome back to the tent
for Mexican Week.

52
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,080
Now, today, Paul and Prue
would like you each to bake

53
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,560
12 individual pan dulce.

54
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,200
Pan dulce or sweet bread
is the collective term

55
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,760
for a whole array
of Mexican sweet treats.

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,080
Now, your pan dulces should be made
using one of the yeasted varieties,

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,680
and you should present the judges
with 12 identical tasty buns.

58
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,000
Which is also Paul's nickname.

59
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,520
You have two and a half hours.

60
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,480
On your marks.
Get set.

61
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,720
Bake.

62
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,040
Pan dulce, it means sweet bread.

63
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,600
It's not a cake, it's not a bread.

64
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,400
I've never had them before,

65
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,000
so I don't know how they're
supposed to be like.

66
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,360
Now, what is a pan dulce?

67
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,840
Well, basically, it's an
enriched bread, an enriched roll.

68
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,560
There are dozens and dozens
of varieties of this,

69
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,440
and they change
from region to region.

70
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,920
Because it's an enriched dough,

71
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,320
it's going to be
a little bit slower proving.

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,120
They've got to get that dough rising
as quickly as possible.

73
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,360
Oh, my God.

74
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,800
Mexico is full of vibrancy,
colour, wonderful food,

75
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,880
great flavours, and that's what
we expect this week from the bakers.

76
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Nerves, man, nerves.

77
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,080
Hello, Janusz. Hello.

78
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,200
Tell us about your pan dulce.

79
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,880
So I've decided to make conchas,

80
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,240
and I've decided to decorate them
as little cactuses.

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,720
Cacti.
Cacti, yes.

82
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,040
Cacti.
That is correct.

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,320
Janusz is making one of the most
popular of pan dulces,

84
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,680
known as concha.

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,440
It's a sweet enriched roll with
a crunchy craquelin topping.

86
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,760
His coconut-flavoured bread will be
contrasted with a limey crunch.

87
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,440
I'm using plain flour for this ones,

88
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,400
because they were more cakey,
which I liked.

89
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,080
So less pan dulce, more cake?

90
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,320
It's going to be... mix.

91
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,200
You look a little perturbed, Paul.

92
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,360
OK, interesting.

93
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,200
I look forward to this one.
Thank you. Thank you. Good luck.

94
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,480
Janusz is not the only baker
creating conchas

95
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,760
in the form of a Mexican icon.

96
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,840
I'm making corn on the cob
pan dulce.

97
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,080
Corn is very popular in Mexico,

98
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,560
and if I read correctly, they say
it's more than 60 varieties.

99
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,520
Hello, Syabira. Hello.

100
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,720
So are you happy about Mexican Week?

101
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,560
Yeah. Have you been to Mexico?

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,040
Yes, I have.
Did you do a tequila shot?

103
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,760
I like tequila, yeah.
Do you like tequila?

104
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,120
Yeah.
In the morning, yeah?

105
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,120
Mexican Week... I do tequila
just to get through this show.

106
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,760
Slam a couple of those down.

107
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,720
Me and Prue do, yeah.

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,840
Celebrating a vital component
of Mexican cuisine,

109
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,520
Syabira's conchas will have a corn
and coconut custard filling,

110
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,280
and be decorated
to resemble corn on the cob.

111
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,960
And are you going to cut each piece
to create the corn look?

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,720
Yeah. I'm using this one. Yeah.

113
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,200
All right, OK. Interesting.

114
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,760
OK, well, I trust you on the
artistic side. Look forward to it.

115
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,880
Thank you.
Thank you.

116
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,800
With limited time,
today's challenge is all about

117
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,240
how the bakers ensure their dough
gets enough of a prove.

118
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,040
I'm making sure that my ingredients
are already quite warm

119
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,040
just to kick-start
that proving process.

120
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,520
I've combated my proving time
with time saver yeast.

121
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,720
That really saves time.
A new discovery.

122
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,640
The recipe that I've got,

123
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,680
it actually uses
a tiny bit of baking powder.

124
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,000
Think it helps to make it a bit
more like a cake than a bread.

125
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,320
Another baker who has opted for the
most popular of pan dulces is James.

126
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,520
It's going to be
a wee concha number.

127
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,120
It's vanilla and cinnamon
and coffee.

128
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,080
So I've tried to keep it
a bit traditional,

129
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,320
there's some chocolate in the top
crunchy bit as well.

130
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,200
James' soft cinnamon and coffee
concha buns will have a chocolate

131
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,880
and coffee crunchy top, and he'll
create delicate caramel oysters,

132
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,760
complete with edible pearls.

133
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,760
Cos it's based on a shell, I thought
I'd kind of stick with that theme.

134
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Lovely. Thank you James.
Cheers. See you soon.

135
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,320
That's looking spot on now.

136
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,840
Once the dough is made...

137
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,720
Soft and stretchy.
That's my aim, soft and stretchy.

138
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,480
...it is essential the bakers
develop the gluten,

139
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,960
or their pan dulces
will be dense and tough.

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
I have to knead this by hand now.

141
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,080
Feel like it could have
a bit more liquid.

142
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,760
Feels a bit too tackyish.

143
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,880
No Mexican way of kneading bread
that I know of.

144
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,920
When Paul's around,
I'll knead it his way.

145
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,960
There are over 1,000 types
of pan dulces baked in Mexico,

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,440
including besos,
a romantic little number.

147
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,000
With besos, it refers to as kisses,

148
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,560
where two buns are basically
just kissing each other.

149
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,360
It's been chosen by Abdul.

150
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,120
In Spanish,
besos literally means kisses.

151
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,920
Abdul's buns will come
rolled in coconut,

152
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,040
dyed the colours of
the Mexican flag,

153
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,600
and stuck together with jam
and buttercream.

154
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,120
I searched online to see, you know,
what the texture really is

155
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,080
and it's usually a bit more denser.
It's not very soft bread.

156
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,480
Really?
That's what, at least...

157
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,880
I've just come back from Mexico.

158
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,440
Oh, yeah. Did you have the besos?

159
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,360
I did.
Oh, OK!

160
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,200
Unfortunately he knows all about it.
Uh-oh! Yes.

161
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,560
Good luck. Flavours sound lovely.
Thank you so much.

162
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,920
Thank you. Thank you.
Good luck.

163
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Dough's smoothish,
so now I'm going to get it proving

164
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,280
for about 30 minutes.

165
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,960
Dough is looking good,
lovely and stretchy.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,840
About 25 minutes.

167
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,000
At home, I'd leave it for an hour.

168
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,440
With dough stashed in
the proving drawers...

169
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,080
So my dough is proving now.
I'm making the topping.

170
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,560
...for those making conchas,

171
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,360
the buns must be topped with
a simple cookie dough.

172
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,160
So it's like a biscuit
and a bread combined, I guess.

173
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,880
Like craquelin,
a sugar, butter and flour mix

174
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,680
must be rolled wafer-thin
before cutting out.

175
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,600
So these are just for
the tops of the conchas.

176
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,320
They'll just kind of sit on top
as like a wee hat.

177
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,200
Sandro's not only making
a concha topping,

178
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,080
but also planning a tasty base.

179
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,000
Mine's going to be quite sweet cos
I'm mostly dipping it in caramel,

180
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,360
and having some hazelnuts
for crunch.

181
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,800
Sandro's salted caramel
and coffee conchas

182
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,840
will have a praline custard filling.

183
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,080
They'll be finished off with
a caramel and hazelnut base.

184
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,760
The idea is to do like a salted
caramel cappuccino bomb thing.

185
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,280
I'm behind schedule!

186
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,520
Having missed bread week,

187
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,960
Rebs is determined
to make every second count.

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,200
I have everything broken down

189
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,000
to literally the minute
of what I've got to do,

190
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,720
because today I'm managing my time.

191
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,600
Rebs plans vanilla concha buns
topped with lemon craquelin

192
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,640
and served with whipped cream
lemon curd on the side.

193
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,480
Have you ever done
Mexican food before?

194
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,960
I love a nachos night.
Love a nacho.

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,200
There's something amazing about
Mexico. Magical.

196
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,560
I want to go to the Mexican
Day Of The Dead festival.

197
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,200
SHE GASPS
Yes!

198
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,080
The one place that I'll fit in.

199
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,560
SHE LAUGHS

200
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,360
This is aniseed and ground anise.

201
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,600
With her pan dulces, Carole's
embracing Mexican flavours...

202
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,680
Used typically in Mexican cooking.

203
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,600
...finding the language
rather trickier.

204
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,800
I am making anise and orange de pan.

205
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,560
You're making what, sorry?

206
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,320
Pan de Denise.

207
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,240
Denise? Is that someone you know,
or...?

208
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Carole's the only baker
making a pan de anis pan dulces.

209
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,520
Her light fluffy Chelsea bun-style
bake will be filled

210
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,760
with a zesty orange
and aniseed curd.

211
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,280
I think it sounds delicious.
And does it have a name?

212
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,840
Oh, it's just your anis de...
de pan, I think.

213
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,360
There's more than one baker
opting for a tongue-twisting title.

214
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,920
I'll be naming my bake snap mella.

215
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,800
Bella la n... Bella naranja,

216
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,840
which translates to "pretty orange."

217
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,960
Maxy's Bella naranja conchas
will be packed with orange

218
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,520
and cinnamon flavour,
have a crispy topping,

219
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,760
and be served with cinnamon
Chantilly on the side.

220
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,560
Who won Star Baker last week?

221
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,240
Janusz.

222
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,720
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he got his second Star Baker.

223
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,680
Is he your main competition,
do you think?

224
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,880
He's my best mate.

225
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,640
There's going to be a point where
you're going to have destroy him.

226
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,360
You know that?
I know, I know, I know!

227
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,040
Across the tent...

228
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,360
SHE SIGHS

229
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,000
...is one more baker who's making
the most popular of pan dulces.

230
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,320
I'm doing conchas,
and they're conchas with a kick.

231
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,960
Dawn's classic Mexican combo
of chocolate- and chilli-flavoured

232
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,200
conchas will come with a green
and red craquelin topping.

233
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,080
The flavours sound good. I like the
idea of the chilli in the chocolate.

234
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,400
Yes.
What chilli?

235
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,520
Er, these ones, birds' eyes.

236
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,120
How many are you using?

237
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,440
Quite a few.

238
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,200
Right.
Good.

239
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,640
Kevin's also on a quest
for big flavour...

240
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,560
So I'm making the rum butter,
so equal parts butter

241
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,720
and soft dark brown sugar.

242
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,840
...but rather than go spicy,
he's gone boozy.

243
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,320
Once it's baked,
I'll soak it in a rum syrup.

244
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,120
Kevin's the only baker
making Mexican borrachitos.

245
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,080
Translated as "little drunkards,"

246
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,080
the alcohol-soaked bake will rest
on a desiccated coconut base.

247
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,760
I just quite liked
the image of these buns

248
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,560
kind of tottering around
like little drunk people.

249
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,200
So is Mexico a real place?

250
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,800
I think so.

251
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,120
What?
I think it's like Xanadu.

252
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,320
Like Oz?
Yeah, like Cleethorpes.

253
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,800
Hmm, OK.

254
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,960
Bakers, you are halfway through.

255
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,320
Has your dough proved... good?

256
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,560
Er, not really, not as good
as it used to at home.

257
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,640
Hmm.

258
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,800
After the first prove...

259
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,040
Soft.

260
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,560
...for those making conchas,
shaping is key.

261
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,200
Just sort of roll it out, then you
kind of just fold it in on itself.

262
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
Fold it over.

263
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,560
And then I like grab them into,
like, a wee ball like this,

264
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,840
and then voila.

265
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,960
Just kind of fondling the balls,
you know.

266
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,040
They're not the best.

267
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,880
Bit small, some of them.

268
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,480
But I can't find my ruler,
so it's a bit of a guessing game.

269
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,200
The addition of filling
ups flavour...

270
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,040
We put ganache in the middle,
chocolate and chilli, in that order.

271
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,960
...but runs the risk
of slowing the second prove...

272
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,440
I'm putting the sweetcorn in
to just give, like,

273
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,880
the celebration of Mexican flavour.

274
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,840
...as does the trademark
concha topping, if not paper thin.

275
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,440
I'm cutting my cookie crust.
It goes on top.

276
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,560
And then you kind of, like,
hug it around the dough.

277
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,400
And then we're going to cut them
so it resembles sort of cacti.

278
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,320
Scoring the craquelin topping...

279
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,840
Crucial step.

280
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,560
...allows the creation of elaborate
patterns as the dough grows.

281
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,680
Just doing four lines.

282
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,640
Each of these should
sort of pop apart,

283
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,840
and you get, like,
a grid effect on it.

284
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,200
Right, I'm going to put them in
the proving drawer.

285
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,040
There is some big ones
and there's some small ones.

286
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,880
With second prove under way...

287
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,800
OK, babies, grow for me nicely.

288
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,120
...the bakers turn their attentions
to decorative touches.

289
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,600
Besos itself are usually covered
with desiccated coconut,

290
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,440
and I thought, "Hey, you know what?
Why not I mix in the red,

291
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,800
"green, white and kind of make,
like, a Mexican flag?"

292
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,280
Right, how's it all going?
Er, I'm all good so far.

293
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,560
Did you desiccate the coconut
yourself?

294
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
No, it was desiccated for me.

295
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,080
Cheat! We have a cheat in the tent.

296
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,080
I'm going to try and make
my caramel oysters.

297
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,520
All I'm going to do
is spoon a wee bit in,

298
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
and just kind of work it
up the sides effectively,

299
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,840
and that should give us
a wee hemisphere,

300
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,960
and we'll join the two of them
together later,

301
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,400
and we'll have an oyster.

302
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,880
These are just little fondant
daisies. Very spring time vibes.

303
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,120
With proving time at a premium...

304
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,880
They're not as proved as
I wish they were,

305
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,560
but I need to get them in.

306
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,440
...the bakers must decide
when to draw the line...

307
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,720
I'm going to give them
an extra five minutes.

308
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,280
...on when their bakes are ready
to hit the oven.

309
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,880
Off you go.
They're a bit flat.

310
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,760
I think I might be Mexican
in my soul.

311
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,160
Maybe you should join us and bake.

312
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,040
I'm not sure about baking.
Never been sure about baking.

313
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,680
Always seems like
a waste of time to me.

314
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,960
To be fair, yeah.

315
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,280
I'm joking, I love baking.

316
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,120
All right,
I'm going to put 'em in now.

317
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,480
So now it's just baking.

318
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,280
Some of them
are better than others.

319
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,920
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

320
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,640
Prue's earrings.

321
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,800
I'll give them back to her.
Yeah, please do.

322
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,040
I don't want them overcooked,
cos they'll be dry.

323
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,040
And then I don't want them
undercooked and they'll be raw.

324
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,520
Is that your own mortar and pestle?

325
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,000
No. That's a big boy,
that is, innit?

326
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,400
When people say they like baking
and they have one of those,

327
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,120
I go, "Wow, yeah.
You're the real deal."

328
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,640
I've got one at home.

329
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,440
For those who got bakes in early,
their pan dulce time is up.

330
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,320
They're done, they're done,
they're done.

331
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,640
They're like little brains.

332
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,480
Could say I done some
Mexican brains.

333
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,920
It's come up pretty well, er,
there are a couple of cracks.

334
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,840
I mean, the sizes are
roughly the same.

335
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,480
The pattern I wish was more
consistent across them.

336
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,600
It does look like corn.
That's what I'm happy with.

337
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,720
The remaining bakers face
an anxious wait...

338
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,240
Do you think they're nearly ready?

339
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Ooh!

340
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,040
Ooh, a couple of them
have burst out the top.

341
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,840
...while their rivals crack on...

342
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,960
Now these bad boys
are ready to soak.

343
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,200
...with assembly...

344
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,480
I'm just putting in my white
chocolate buttercream,

345
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,320
and then there you go,
they're smooching,

346
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,840
so, like, mwah, mwah, mwah.

347
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,080
...glazes...

348
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,880
Generous portions.
Like a generous portion, I do.

349
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,760
...and decoration.

350
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,080
Oyster. Clam, I don't know.
I don't know sea shells, do I?

351
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,400
How we doing for time?

352
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,240
Bakers, you have
five minutes remaining.

353
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,040
Right they're going to come out.

354
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
Grand.

355
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,440
For those with buns
still in the oven...

356
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,440
Very nice, very good. Now it needs
to cool down so I can decorate it.

357
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,800
...it's now or never.

358
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,280
They are looking baked.

359
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,880
Oh, no, they're burnt.

360
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,520
They're burnt!

361
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,280
Oh, crap. Right.

362
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
Oh!

363
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,880
They're a bit hot.
Are you worried about your crack?

364
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,640
No, I'm going to cover it.

365
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,840
Better when it's covered,
the crack, isn't it?

366
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,480
He's going to tell me
they're overdone,

367
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,800
cos I know they're overdone.

368
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,560
And also the top bit didn't
go so well. C'est la vie.

369
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,920
Final touches.

370
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,880
So I'm going to pipe
some rum butter on.

371
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,280
I'm using a star tip nozzle,

372
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,760
so that it doesn't look like
a little poo.

373
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,080
Bakers, you have one minute left.

374
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,360
What?!

375
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,480
That's not long enough.

376
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,880
Really?

377
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,880
They're just going to have to
go on here warm. Oh, my!

378
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,960
That one burst.

379
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,400
Quite a few of them have.

380
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,240
I'm going to pipe some icing
on them.

381
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,400
I'm using this curd
just to stick the daisies on.

382
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,640
Oh, hot, oh, hot, oh, hot.

383
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,280
They turned out better than what
I practised.

384
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,840
They look more expensive.

385
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,400
Oh, I need to arrange like a corn
that is coming up from the field.

386
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,640
Oh, my God.

387
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,160
Trying to compete is impossible.
Those are absurd.

388
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,160
Bakers, your time is up.

389
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,600
And breathe.

390
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,560
Please step away from your bakes.

391
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,040
I'm quite proud of these wee things.

392
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,800
Well, they're a bit overbaked.

393
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,440
I'm happy with the bread,
to be fair, but they look shocking.

394
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,920
The bakers' pan dulces will now
face the judgment of Paul and Prue.

395
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,760
Hello, Janusz. Hello.

396
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,000
They look very even, nicely brown.

397
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,680
Quite like the craquelin on the top,
and the way it's been cut.

398
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,840
The roll is pretty equal colour
as well.

399
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,000
Let's see what it's like.

400
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,920
Now, this was done
with plain flour, wasn't it?

401
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,400
It was, yes.

402
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,680
I think you need more lime,

403
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,560
and the bun is quite dry.

404
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,680
The texture's all right.

405
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,760
I'd just like to have seen it
a little bit more open,

406
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,640
and that's because you used
plain flour.

407
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,560
But the problem is for me, it's just
not punching any flavours at all.

408
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,960
I like the look of them, though.

409
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,400
Well, you know what? I think
they look really interesting.

410
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,600
They look attractive, they make your
mouth water, I want to eat a bit.

411
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,360
Let's have a look inside.

412
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,480
I like the look of this.
It's got lots of filling.

413
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,760
Love the flavour.

414
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,960
It's underproved.
Hugely underproved.

415
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,720
It's so dense.
It's almost dough-like.

416
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,080
Do you know?
I think the flavour is fantastic.

417
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,560
It is a bit tight and stiff.

418
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,040
The overall look look awful.
Craquelin's not good.

419
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,480
Looks like you sat on them.

420
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,680
Oh, all right, just kill me, OK?

421
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,080
It's sort of split, hasn't it?

422
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,080
Yeah, I mean, the roll is OK.

423
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,680
It needed a bit more of a dome
on it.

424
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,000
But the colour looks nice.

425
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,200
The lemon in there's good.

426
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,440
The craquelin I think was too heavy.
Yeah. Too thick,

427
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,240
and then it's weighted it down
so that the bread couldn't bloom.

428
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,760
But it's created
quite a stretchy dough.

429
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,960
It's nicely made bread. Just the
craquelin is the problem. Yeah.

430
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Well, you're certainly showing off
your sugar craft skills.

431
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,440
I love the top.
That top is fantastic.

432
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,160
Craquelin's definitely too thick.

433
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,880
It's really dry because of it.

434
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,920
Very dense.

435
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,400
Not a huge amount of flavour either.

436
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,080
There's a bit of kick
in the craquelin.

437
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,840
If it's going to be as plain
as that, it needs a filling.

438
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,800
They're not totally even
in shape, are they? No.

439
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,920
They're not really Chelsea bun shape.

440
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,400
I don't think it would matter what
shape they were as long as

441
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,880
they were all the same.

442
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,760
Lovely flavour.

443
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,400
I think the orange
and the anise comes through.

444
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,360
They're just underproved.

445
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,600
It's quite dense,
but the taste is great.

446
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,760
The bread dough is a little heavy,
but the whole thing is delicious.

447
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,080
Thank you.

448
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,640
I think they look quite impressive.
They look quite nice.

449
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,000
They're glue.
They are cake-like.

450
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,800
Mm-hm.
Do you want a taste?

451
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,920
Sure.

452
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,840
The flavours are quite delicate,
you know,

453
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,080
the raspberry and the coconut.
I think it sort of works.

454
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,520
I just think it's too dense,
and that for me is not right.

455
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,800
It's not quite right. OK.

456
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,520
I think they look
absolutely beautiful.

457
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,480
They definitely look like corn.

458
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,920
They're clever.

459
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,160
Yeah, they do look pretty good.
What's inside it?

460
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,640
It's corn custard filling.

461
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,320
That looks really good.

462
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,080
I love the flavour.

463
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
It's quite dry,
but it's very interesting.

464
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,200
You added the filling
before it went in the oven...

465
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,720
Yes.
...so it couldn't grow.

466
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,040
Then you had a craquelin on the top
which prevents growth,

467
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,760
so it stays solid, so you end up
with... going back to dough.

468
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,160
Like the idea, though.

469
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,200
So I've made conchas.

470
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,680
The flavours I've used are cinnamon
and orange.

471
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,840
They look very even.
Yeah, I do like the look of them.

472
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,320
And very big.
Yeah, I like the size.

473
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,400
They could've done with
a little bit more of a dome.

474
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,560
You've got some,
so you've got a bit of height there.

475
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,760
The craquelin's sitting quite nicely
on it as well.

476
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,080
The craquelin's really good.

477
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,080
It's a little bit crisper,
so you get that contrast.

478
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,200
Yeah, it's good bread.
I think your flavour's nice.

479
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,080
It's really nice.
I like the look of them.

480
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,480
You've got a real instinct
for what goes with what,

481
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,680
and I think those are
all beautiful flavours.

482
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,680
They're overbaked. Well, you can
see by the colour underneath. Yeah.

483
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,360
Size-wise, I think they're OK.

484
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,160
I'd like to have seen more of
a dome. OK.

485
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,080
You've lost that because of the
filling. The design's a bit messy.

486
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,000
It's all over the place and that's
because it's cracked coming through,

487
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,680
and you've lost the definition.

488
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,640
Yeah. I didn't want it to be
a case of hunt the ganache.

489
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,320
But now are we going to get the
promised chilli? That's the thing.

490
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,800
Not immediately.

491
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,960
You do get the chilli.
And you're right, it comes later.

492
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,240
The chilli content
and the chocolate is perfect.

493
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,040
That's just the right amount.
OK. Good.

494
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,000
It's just messy for me.
It's all over the place.

495
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,200
It's not tidy enough. Yeah.
It's not accurate enough.

496
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,520
I agree. I think it tastes good,
textures are good.

497
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,160
Doesn't look too good. No.

498
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,640
I think they look great.
I like the look of them.

499
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,280
They do look like
little drunk fellas.

500
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,840
Could do with being
a little bit more open.

501
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,960
Another five, ten minutes proving.
Yeah. OK.

502
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,600
I really do like the flavour.
The dough is nearly there.

503
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,880
To be honest, this is one of
the best we've tasted.

504
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
It's all good.

505
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,840
Ten more minutes proving,
and you'd have had perfection.

506
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,040
Yeah, it went pretty well.

507
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,200
Almost got a handshake. Stingy git.

508
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,440
I was so happy about the chilli.

509
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,240
And I was sort of watching
their faces, and all of a sudden,

510
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,840
they were like, "Yes, the chilli
is now creeping up."

511
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,760
Do you know? If I'm just not bottom
two or three, then I'd be happy.

512
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,880
I don't want to say disastrous,
but borderline.

513
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,720
While the bakers practised
their Signatures,

514
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,000
they haven't a clue what
they'll be asked to make

515
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,520
in today's Mexican Technical.

516
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,680
Bakers, it's time for your
Technical Challenge,

517
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,240
which today has been set by...

518
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,520
...Paul Hollywood. Ring any bells?

519
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,400
Never heard of him.

520
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,000
So, er, Paul, any words of advice?

521
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,440
You've got to get your flavour
combinations right

522
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,880
and your textures.

523
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,240
As ever, the Technical Challenge
will be judged blind,

524
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,800
so we're going to have to ask
these two to vacate the tent.

525
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,320
Off you go.

526
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,160
They're going to a soft play area.

527
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,640
Oh, what, to go in the pit of balls?
Yeah, Paul in the balls. Yeah!

528
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,400
For your Technical Challenge,

529
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,440
Paul would like you to make
eight Mexican tacos.

530
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,800
Your tacos should be made from
yellow field corn

531
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,200
and then hand pressed.
On top of each should be steak,

532
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,800
spicy refried beans, guacamole,
and pico de gallo.

533
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,960
You have two hours.

534
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,920
On your marks.
Get set.

535
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,080
Bake.

536
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,840
Well, this is going to
be interesting.

537
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,760
Tacos - new one on me.

538
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,280
I've never made 'em from scratch before.

539
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,600
Oh, no.

540
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,280
This is my first time doing tacos.

541
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,560
I bet it's the same, like,
you make tortillas.

542
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,040
I never make tortillas either.

543
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,880
Paul, tacos for a Technical.

544
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,000
It's Mexican week, Prue.
It has to be tacos.

545
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,560
Tell me about the fillings, then.

546
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,280
You've got a pico de gallo,
which is basically a salsa,

547
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,840
a guacamole,
then you have the steak,

548
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,560
and a little bit of cheese,
and also refried beans.

549
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,960
I must say, it does look good.

550
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,240
And the big thing is
getting the taco right.

551
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,200
Thickness of the tortilla - is it
going to be too thick or too thin?

552
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,600
And then the actual stage
on the pan.

553
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,280
You only need less than a minute
on both sides.

554
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,520
If you do any more than that,
it will dry out,

555
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,440
and when you try and roll it up
into a taco, it will crack.

556
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,840
It's got to be pliable.

557
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,560
And they are very thin.

558
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,080
They are very thin,
and if it is thin, it will work.

559
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,440
One of the big things in Mexico
when you're having a taco

560
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,240
is it's lovely to have
a lot of filling on it,

561
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,680
but it has to be practical as well.

562
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,280
So you should be able to encase it
and then eat it. Yeah.

563
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,240
If it's too much,
it's going to go everywhere.

564
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,600
OK, Prue, choose your taco. OK.

565
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,240
Mm. Wow. The corn flavour
coming from the taco is perfect,

566
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,440
blended with all the ingredients
on the top.

567
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,920
Overall, it's a delicious eat.

568
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,320
I mean, for me,
this is Mexican cooking on a plate.

569
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,960
Can I have it for my lunch?

570
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,000
The instructions aren't really
that detailed.

571
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,920
For each of the elements, it just
says, "Make the pico de gallo.

572
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,120
"Make the refried beans.
Make the guacamole."

573
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,760
It's quite scant.

574
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,080
Have you made, er, tacos...?

575
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,240
No. No.

576
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,280
Hang on a minute, you don't know
what the question was going to be.

577
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,240
So the first bit is,
"For the tortillas,

578
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,520
"blend the drained corn until
you have a smooth thick paste.

579
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,000
"Tip the processed corn out onto
a work surface and add masa harina,

580
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,840
"then mix to form a dough."

581
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,920
Masa harina.
I think it's like cornflour.

582
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,720
I'm not really sure how this dough's
meant to look.

583
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,520
If it's corn, then I don't suppose
it needs a lot of kneading.

584
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,120
Think it's going to be sort of like
a thick bread like dough texture.

585
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,720
"Cover and leave to stand."

586
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,920
And let it rest. Don't touch it.
They want to be rested.

587
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,040
"Marinade the steak."

588
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,520
Nice steaks.

589
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,320
Would you eat that like that?
Never.

590
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,360
I'm not really a raw
bloody meat person.

591
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,200
No.
I cry when I eat a leaf.

592
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,880
So the ingredients tell you
what spices and herbs to use,

593
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,520
but they don't say how much.

594
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,000
Oh, my God, they don't give you
any teaspoonfuls or anything.

595
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,520
Ground cumin,
smoked paprika, dried oregano.

596
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:30,040
Like a mad professor, I am flinging
things into a bowl with gay abandon.

597
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,960
Ancho chilli powder.

598
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,440
So ancho chilli powder is dangerous,
so we will be going easy.

599
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,840
I just hope my, er,
chilli is not too hot.

600
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,560
Something missing.

601
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,400
I'm going to sneeze in a sec.

602
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,640
You can't really taste this.

603
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,280
Blah! It's burning my mouth.

604
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,120
Well, it's meant to be hot anyway.
It's meant to be Mexican, innit?

605
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,680
Beef marinated.

606
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,040
Excuse me.

607
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,120
What's pico de gallo?

608
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,760
"Picko de gallio."

609
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,560
Interesting, pico de gallo. This is
the first time I've heard them.

610
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,720
I think pico means small, maybe.

611
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,920
It's like a salsa,
just reading the ingredients.

612
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,920
White onion, very big white onion.

613
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,520
"Deseed and finely chop tomatoes."

614
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,080
Deseed a tomato.
How do you deseed a tomato?

615
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,560
Chilli went in,
coriander, juice, salt.

616
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,320
I could eat a tub of coriander
by itself. I think it's gorgeous.

617
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,800
I love coriander and cilantro.
I know people hate it.

618
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,920
Apparently there's a gene that
makes you taste coriander like soap.

619
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,440
It tastes like soap.

620
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,040
Everybody's got their own tastes.
I'm doing this to my taste,

621
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,600
but it might not be
to Paul's taste.

622
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,360
Spicy, soapy, salty, and sour. Great.

623
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,240
Hey, Noel, do you want to hear
my Mexican accent? Yes, please.

624
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,440
All right, here we go.

625
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,360
Ariba.
You are halfway through.

626
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,520
What do you reckon?
It's really good. Thank you.

627
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,760
So to make the refried beans,
the instructions said,

628
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,240
"Make the refried beans."

629
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,600
I make kidney beans at home
with coconut milk,

630
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,080
so same method without coconut.

631
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,360
So I think we just fry them
with everything that's here.

632
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,240
I'm going to fry onion with garlic.

633
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,800
I'm going to add chilli powder,
salt, black beans.

634
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,680
Let's go half. Don't go mad, Carole.

635
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,400
This is really, really hot. I don't
think it's supposed to be hot.

636
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,600
And then this one just straight up
won't turn on.

637
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,280
You look like you're sort of
typing out an essay.

638
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,560
What are you trying to do?
I'm trying to make it turn on.

639
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,800
Is this the future champion
of Bake Off?

640
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,400
Oh, my days,
everything's happening at once.

641
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,680
You're having a breakdown.

642
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,080
That's not even happening.
That's inside your head.

643
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,960
It's not that cooked,

644
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,440
so I'm just going to simmer
and it will get soft.

645
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,040
We'll let that thicken a bit.

646
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,120
I have honestly never made this, never.

647
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,360
I'm going to start making
my guacamole now.

648
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,280
"Step six, make guacamole."

649
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,480
Now how many avocados do we put
in there? Oh, God.

650
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,160
Chopped tomatoes are going in.
Red onions. Jalapenos.

651
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,640
Juice of lime.

652
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,920
I like to have a little bit
of chunk,

653
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,080
cos Paul said it's about flavour
and texture.

654
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,200
I, like, blitz the avocado
till it's smooth and creamy.

655
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,840
Oh, you're looking for smooth
and chunky, that's the best way.

656
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,240
This is perfect for me.

657
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,080
So my beans finished.

658
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,760
I think that's what refried beans
looks like.

659
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,240
Let me actually taste this.

660
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,360
It's the right amount of chilli,
in my opinion.

661
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,720
It tastes OK.

662
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,240
I might put some more salt.

663
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,800
Don't know if this is right.

664
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,520
Oh, spicy.

665
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,600
Not bad.

666
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,880
Noel, I absolutely insist that
you do this time call.

667
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,840
We've been down this road before.

668
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,360
No, no, I insist.

669
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,440
I've got your back here.
OK, off you go.

670
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,720
Promise?
Promise.

671
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,760
Bakers...

672
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,240
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

673
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,000
Oh, my God.

674
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,560
Here we go. "Make the tortillas."

675
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,760
"Divide the rest of the dough
into eight equal balls."

676
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,000
"Flatten using the lid
of a casserole dish."

677
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,960
No tortilla press.

678
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,640
Think we just kind of go...

679
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,280
Looks like what I'd imagine
you would get, doesn't it?

680
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,400
My tortilla dance.

681
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,760
I'm too small. I'm on tiptoes.

682
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,040
Slam!

683
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,320
I'm just going to get it
as flat as I can get it.

684
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,120
This is the hardest part.

685
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,120
You don't know how thick
or how thin it should be.

686
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,880
They don't seem to turn out
that big.

687
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,640
Just try and get it
a wee bit flatter.

688
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,840
They are small, but I guess
tacos are supposed to be small.

689
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,040
Ta-da! "Bitesize" I think is
the correct term.

690
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,000
What next? "Cook the tortillas."

691
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,360
Tortillas, traditionally, I think
are meant to be cooked

692
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,720
on a hot stone.
You just kind of go...

693
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,080
So I'm going in.

694
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,960
Boop.

695
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,120
I'm thinking two minutes
on each side.

696
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,240
One minute on each side.
Should be done.

697
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,160
Put it in a very high heat
so it puff. Puff, puff.

698
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,560
Oh, we have some puffing. Yes!

699
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,800
They're puffing now.
Is that meant to happen?

700
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,120
I don't want to overcook 'em.

701
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,920
Why don't you just
put that under there,

702
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,320
and I'll go, as if I leant on it, and...

703
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,440
You know like in
the Chuckle Brothers?

704
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,000
Shall we try?

705
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,720
No? I need them.
You need them, don't you?

706
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,120
I need these, yeah.

707
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
Two done.

708
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,120
I don't know how they're
meant to look exactly,

709
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,000
but do want some brown on there.

710
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,960
You don't want your tortilla
to be too dry.

711
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,120
Not bad.

712
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,640
They've started cracking.
That's a problem.

713
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,880
Oh, no, this one's burnt.
This one's burnt.

714
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,160
Ah! And it's not puffing up.

715
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,760
Do they look like a tortilla?
Haven't got a clue.

716
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,400
They're very small, though,
aren't they?

717
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,960
Last one. They look cooked.

718
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,800
There's so many things to go wrong.
Ugh!

719
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,280
OK, Matt, let's turn the tables
a little bit, yeah? OK.

720
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,240
Why don't you do a time call... OK.

721
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,360
...and I won't interrupt you
or anything? OK.

722
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,960
You just do it, yeah?
You sure? Yeah.

723
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,640
OK. Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

724
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,200
Weren't you supposed to interrupt
me? Yeah. Yeah.

725
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,160
That's all my tacos done.
Just need to make steak now.

726
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,960
The plan is to fry the steak.
Medium rare.

727
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,400
Straight in. Nice and sizzly.

728
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,800
That looks expensive meat, actually.

729
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Which is weird,
cos we found that in a skip.

730
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,040
I'm joking.

731
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,520
I don't know how to cook steak.

732
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,320
I would cook it, like,
about five minutes each side.

733
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,280
Couple of minutes on each side,
if I've got time.

734
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,280
Everyone's got an opinion on steak,

735
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,120
and everyone thinks
you've done it wrong.

736
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,880
I could go a bit longer, but I'm
just a bit scared to overcook it.

737
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,800
I'll give it another 30 seconds.

738
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,640
Yeah, it's a nice pink
in the middle.

739
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,800
That's still mooing.

740
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,880
It's all right.

741
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,760
Oh, Maxy, your steak's cooked perfectly.

742
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,760
My steak's going to be hot.

743
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,840
I wouldn't eat it.

744
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,320
SHE LAUGHS

745
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,600
How long do we have?

746
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,520
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

747
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,920
Do we? OK.

748
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,360
Just going to start assembling.

749
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,440
What goes first? Hmm. Bit of steak.

750
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,160
And then the fried beans.

751
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,320
Just don't know how much
of each thing to use.

752
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,760
I won't put that much in there.

753
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,240
Just a wee forkful of each.

754
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,920
Holy guacamole.

755
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,600
Where do you put the "glockymolo"?

756
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,920
Salsa?

757
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,840
My pico de gallo's
a bit spicy.

758
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,920
Bakers, you have one minute left.

759
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,840
Oh, my gosh.

760
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,520
This is going to be so tight.

761
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Oh, now I'm in panic mode.
Cheesy stuff, throw it on.

762
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,080
Don't forget the cheese.

763
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,440
I have one more to go.

764
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,040
These look quite stuffed.

765
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,920
I wish that we'd had, like,
quantities. Oh, well.

766
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,760
Just trying to make the board
look pretty. It's a bit fiddly.

767
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,040
It's the best way I can think
to use an avocado.

768
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,680
Well, that's, erm, small.

769
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,080
Bakers, your time is up.

770
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,680
Bring your tacos down to the table

771
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,760
and place them in front
of your photograph.

772
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,760
Wow.

773
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,080
I wish I could try one.

774
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,480
I go there,
and then thingy can go there.

775
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,480
Paul and Prue are looking for
eight thin tortillas

776
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,200
topped with perfectly marinated
steak, spicy refried beans,

777
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,840
pico de gallo,
and a tangy guacamole.

778
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,960
There's a bit of a difference in
thickness, isn't there, and size?

779
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,560
It's so tempting to put too much
filling, isn't it? Yes. It is.

780
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,520
Right, let's start over here.

781
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,280
These are actually quite neat.

782
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,880
They look very nice, don't they?

783
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,800
It's a nice fill, that one, as well.
It's just about right.

784
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,280
Have to have a big gob, you know.

785
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,520
I know.

786
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,400
Cos you really want to get it all in
at once, don't you?

787
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
Hmm.

788
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,680
That's pretty good, actually.
It's balanced well.

789
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,000
The heating is about right.

790
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,400
And I love the fact that the meat
is nice and rare. Yeah, and the...

791
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,800
There's a bit of colour on this.
There's no need for colour.

792
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,560
There is a bit of darkness
in some of these,

793
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,240
but the majority of them
are all right.

794
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,440
Yeah, I think it's lovely.

795
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,800
OK, moving on to number two.

796
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,280
These look a bit dry. See the crack?

797
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,680
They look a bit crisp.

798
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,560
It's been overcooked, or there isn't
enough water in there.

799
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,800
Let's taste it.

800
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,680
Mm, that is good.

801
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,800
The steak is spot on.
The filling's OK.

802
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,640
I would say there's slightly
too much onion

803
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,960
and slightly too much chilli, but...
Mm. ..Everything else is wonderful.

804
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,120
OK, moving on. Now, these...

805
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,280
That's a little too full, isn't it?

806
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,360
Yeah. For the size of them.

807
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,320
They're a little bit thick as well,
actually. They're very small.

808
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,760
I'm getting slightly over-seasoned.
Bit salty.

809
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,640
I'll tell you where there's too much
salt. It's actually in the taco.

810
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,240
They're a little bit dry.

811
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,360
You wouldn't expect them
to be that dry.

812
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,600
Moving on, you see the feathering
round the outside?

813
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,320
They should be beautifully round,
but they're all over the place.

814
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,920
This is quite a dry one as well.

815
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,400
That cow's still mooing.

816
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,800
I like the flavour.
Yeah, I like the flavour.

817
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,240
Right. These look quite pale,
don't they? Almost underdone.

818
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,040
It's also got too much filling,
I think.

819
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,720
I think there is.

820
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,840
Again, quite salty again, isn't it?

821
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,360
It's very well seasoned.
It... Even too much.

822
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,600
I think too much.

823
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,000
Now, these are too small.

824
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,640
That's ridiculously thick!

825
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,720
There isn't as much seasoning
in that one,

826
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,360
but the meat's cooked well.

827
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,120
Moving on...
They look quite thin.

828
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,040
I think they've been cooked
quite nicely.

829
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,560
And I quite like the fact that
that's... But that fits nicely.

830
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,360
Yeah, and there's not too much
in it. Yeah. So...

831
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,560
Taco's good. Meat, tick. Guac, tick.

832
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,160
And the pico's nice as well.
I think it works as a taco. Mm.

833
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,640
Oh, dear. Far too thick.
Far, far too thick.

834
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,720
Too much chilli.

835
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,200
It's too thick. The meat needs to
be cut up much smaller

836
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,320
on something so dainty and small.

837
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,920
OK, this is the right size.

838
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,240
Now, these here are cracked.
See them all cracked there?

839
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,520
Yeah.
They've overdone 'em.

840
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,720
The guacamole's very nice.
The beef's nice and rare.

841
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,440
The flavour's OK, but again,
the taco's overcooked.

842
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,840
Last one.

843
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,240
Now, these are quite little
delicate tortillas.

844
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,720
Yeah, and they're thin.

845
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,840
I think that's a good one.
The guacamole's excellent.

846
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,800
I really like that.
The tacos are nice.

847
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,720
I'm not getting too much chilli.
No. OK.

848
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,800
Prue and Paul will now rank
the tacos from worst to first.

849
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,320
In 10th place,
we have this one.

850
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,000
Carole, not very good.
Very thick, too small.

851
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,840
Ninth spot, we have this one.
Whose is this?

852
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,880
Rebs. Basically over-seasoned,
massively over-seasoned,

853
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,600
and you had too much filling
in there.

854
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,920
In eighth place, we've got this one.

855
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,000
James.
The tacos are just slightly small.

856
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,560
Janusz is seventh,

857
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,040
Abdul is sixth,

858
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,320
Dawn is fifth,

859
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,520
and Kevin is fourth.

860
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,960
So in third spot, we have this one.
Whose is this?

861
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,120
Sandro, actually,
these were pretty good.

862
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,200
Could've done with being
a little bit neater.

863
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,560
This is number two over here.

864
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,760
Syabira, these were really
delicious, except that they were

865
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,880
a little bit difficult to manage
because they were breaking up.

866
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,600
So in first spot, we have this one.

867
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,000
Beautifully filled,
taco was really good,

868
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,120
seasoning was very good as well.
Well done.

869
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,760
Thank you.

870
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,560
I feel over the moon, honestly,
I feel over the moon.

871
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,040
I didn't expect it.

872
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,200
Second for the taco. Yes!

873
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,200
I'm pretty chuffed with myself
for my performance today.

874
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,120
So I came in eighth
in the Technical,

875
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,320
which is better than I thought,
but worse than I would hope.

876
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,640
I'm a little bit disappointed
in the result.

877
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,200
The pressure is on for tomorrow now.

878
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,760
If I don't do well tomorrow,
I'll be packing my suitcase.

879
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,800
Only the Showstopper Challenge remains

880
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,880
before Paul and Prue decide
who will be leaving the tent

881
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,120
and who has scooped Star Baker.

882
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,280
Hello, bakers.
Welcome back to the tent.

883
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,120
Now, for your Mexican
Showstopper Challenge,

884
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,840
the judges would like you to create
your own take on the popular

885
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,280
tres leches cake.

886
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,400
Now, tres leches obviously refers to
the three milks

887
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,520
that are traditionally used to soak
the sponge once it's baked.

888
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,080
You can use any combination
of flavours you like,

889
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,640
but your cake must consist of
at least four layers

890
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,280
of milk-soaked sponge.

891
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,360
Your tres leches cake
need to be bold, delicious,

892
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,120
and inspired by Mexico.

893
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,600
You have four hours.

894
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,520
On your marks.
Get set.

895
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,960
Bake.

896
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,360
I love a tres leches.

897
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,280
My favourite thing about it is that
it's full of moisture.

898
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,080
A tres leches cake basically means
three milk cake.

899
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,760
Evaporated milk,
condensed milk, and double cream.

900
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,960
I never try tres leches
cake before.

901
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,240
Put all these milks together,
make a syrup of it,

902
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,160
make lots of holes in the cake,
and pour the syrup all over.

903
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,440
And that soaks in and allows the
cake to really moisten up.

904
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,360
What it mustn't do is to
so sog up the cake

905
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,240
that the milks are running
out of the bottom.

906
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,880
So it's going to have to be layers
of moist cake one on top of another.

907
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,440
This is tricky.

908
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,680
The difficulty we're all
going to face is the soak.

909
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,320
Because the cakes are so moist,
when they lift the cake,

910
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,720
it could fall apart.

911
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,320
If it's too soaked structurally,
it might break,

912
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,480
and if it's not enough soak,
then is it really tres leches?

913
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,200
It's a fine balance over there.

914
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,800
Obviously we want high decoration,
it's a Showstopper,

915
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,800
and they do have four hours
to complete it.

916
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,600
I mean, a Mexican cake above all
looks fantastic.

917
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,360
It's one of my favourite cakes.
It's beautiful.

918
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,240
Sandro, good morning. Good morning.
Good morning, Sandro.

919
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,440
Tell us about your tres leches cake.

920
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,960
It's a fiesta kind of cake.

921
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,760
So I'm going to have
a big moustache in the middle,

922
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,280
and at the bottom going around,
you have iced biscuits.

923
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,000
Enveloped in a decorative
white chocolate collar,

924
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,240
Sandro's cakes include a chilli
chocolate coffee sponge

925
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,120
with Irish cream soak,

926
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,640
and a spiced chocolate sponge
with coffee and cherry brandy soak.

927
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,960
That sounds amazing.

928
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,200
It did taste nice. Yeah.

929
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,720
It was very adult type.

930
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,280
Yeah, well, chocolate, coffee, chilli.

931
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,520
Yeah. It's got like, four, teaspoons
of chilli flakes, so...

932
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,840
Interesting. Thank you very much.
Thanks, Sandro.

933
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,560
I did get a bit of a face when I
said, "There's four teaspoons

934
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,440
"of chilli," so I'm hoping that's
not going to be overpowering.

935
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,680
Sandro's not the only baker
in the party mood.

936
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,360
Morning, Maxy.
Good morning.

937
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
Tell us all about your
tres leches cake.

938
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,680
Cake is called coco flower fiesta,

939
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,280
so I'm making a chocolate tres
leches cake

940
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,960
filled with strawberries and cream,

941
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,040
and the outside will be decorated
with flowers.

942
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,400
Maxy's chocolate sponge will have
a tres leches vanilla soak,

943
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,400
layers of strawberries,
Italian meringue buttercream,

944
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,880
and cinnamon vanilla cream.

945
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,320
Going to be so rich.
Very rich.

946
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,800
It's going to be SO rich!

947
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,480
Is it still nice and light, though?

948
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,640
Er, I hope so.

949
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,080
Well, good luck, Maxy.

950
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,760
Abdul is also opting
for a celebration,

951
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,600
one with a uniquely Mexican vibe.

952
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,440
The theme is Day Of The Dead,

953
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,960
so I'm making
white chocolate skulls.

954
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,320
Love Day Of The Dead.

955
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,240
Glad someone's doing
Day Of The Dead.

956
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,320
Abdul's cake will be soaked
in passion fruit and coconut

957
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,520
tres leches, have lime curd filling,

958
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,280
and be adorned with
white chocolate sugar skulls.

959
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,960
It's Day Of The Dead - do you want
me to get you some poison?

960
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,560
I think on the Day Of The Dead,
you actually honour the people

961
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,200
who have passed away,
rather than make more people.

962
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,240
Make them pass. Yes.

963
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,320
Oh, OK all right.
I think that's the concept, yeah.

964
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,920
Noted. Noted. Yeah.

965
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,480
The bakers may use
any sponge they choose...

966
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,280
Angel cake. It's a fatless cake.

967
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,480
I'm doing a whisked sponge.

968
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,480
...and Syabira's opted for
the unconventional.

969
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,080
I am making sweetcorn sponge.

970
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,960
Explain. It's a sponge that I
put a little bit of sweetcorn in.

971
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,720
Why would you want that in a cake?

972
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,640
I like the idea of it.

973
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,760
Well, it's very Mexican,
and it might work.

974
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Syabira's sweetcorn sponge will be
soaked with a sweetcorn tres leches,

975
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,280
filled with creamed corn

976
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,880
and cinnamon flavoured
cream cheese icing.

977
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,080
Certainly want to celebrate
the taste of sweetcorn,

978
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,760
which is actually quite difficult
to bring through considering

979
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,040
it's going to be fighting with
other flavours as well.

980
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,960
I love sweetcorn, by the way.

981
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,240
Don't look so stressed.
This sounds good.

982
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,600
Thanks, Syabira.
I hope it works.

983
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,160
You're off your maracas.

984
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,640
I tried to hit the brief, getting in
as much Mexican flavour as I can.

985
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,440
Going to bring good vibes,
good energy.

986
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,640
Going to go OK today.
I'm not going home.

987
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,200
After another set
of poor performances,

988
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,720
Rebs is determined
to deliver a winner.

989
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,720
So I am doing a tiramisu
tres leches wedding cake.

990
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,080
So it's a wedding cake
to symbolise the marriage

991
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,640
between an Italian classic
and Mexican flavours.

992
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,680
OK.
OK.

993
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,440
Swapping Italian masala wine
for Mexican,

994
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,360
Rebs' cake will get
a coffee tres leches soak

995
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,680
and a trio of fillings, including
a chilli chocolate ganache.

996
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,560
It's all about marketing,
you see, branding.

997
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,760
If I say, "It's a wedding cake,"
then it's allowed to be more simple.

998
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,960
The judges have asked for
a minimum of four layers of sponge.

999
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,200
I think it was quite mean,

1000
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,640
cos, like, tres leches sponge
is not for stacking.

1001
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,680
Despite this, Kevin is undertaking
a vast geometric construction.

1002
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,840
My tres leches sponge will be soaked
in coffee milk,

1003
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,160
and I'll be building it
in four square tins

1004
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,120
to make an Aztec pyramid temple.

1005
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,080
Mayan or Aztec?

1006
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,360
Well, there's a bit of overlap,
really, isn't there?

1007
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,560
Kevin's central American style pyramid

1008
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,080
will have a coffee tres leches soak,

1009
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,440
be filled with hazelnut
praline cream,

1010
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,680
and coated with a chocolate ganache
that comes with a kick.

1011
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,000
Got some chilli in the ganache.

1012
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,080
Hopefully not too much.

1013
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,920
I don't want the judges to feel like
they're eating electricity.

1014
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,000
I'd like you to take
their heads off.

1015
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,960
I would like to not go home.

1016
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,960
OK, well, let's meet in the middle.

1017
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,000
To make a four-tier cake
requires vast amounts

1018
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,000
of smooth well-mixed batter...

1019
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,680
I think the batter actually looks
quite good.

1020
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,520
Like, it looks quite light
and fluffy.

1021
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,280
...and multiple tins that somehow
need to be squeezed in the oven.

1022
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,440
I'm trying to get them all in
at the same time.

1023
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,880
There you go, sponge is going in.

1024
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,960
30 minutes in the oven,
and hopefully they will be baked.

1025
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,600
Bake beautifully.

1026
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,960
So these are going in now. Lovely.

1027
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,440
Just making the milk soak now.

1028
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,400
The bakers can now create

1029
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,080
what is the key to
a good tres leches cake.

1030
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,240
Whipping cream, evaporated milk, coconut.

1031
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,560
I'm using 300ml of double cream.

1032
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,880
Same for the evaporated milk
and condensed milk.

1033
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,840
I'm putting some
Mexican coffee liqueur.

1034
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,280
And now some tequila.

1035
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,160
Determined to celebrate
Mexican flavours...

1036
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,520
Chocolate, coffee, little bit of
chilli in it, orange, lime.

1037
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,640
...Carole's cake will include
more than a few.

1038
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,280
Bit of a mixture, really.

1039
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,280
Carole's chocolate cake will get
a coffee liqueur soak,

1040
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,560
lemon and orange buttercreams,
be surrounded by a chocolate collar,

1041
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,640
and come topped with chocolate
flowers and hazelnut caramel spikes.

1042
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,880
Are we playing into your strengths
here, Carole?

1043
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,600
I do like decorating cakes.

1044
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,600
So the idea of the collar
sounds good.

1045
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,720
Yeah. Hope you get it all finished
on time. Yeah.

1046
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,880
The coffee and chocolate combo
is proving popular.

1047
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,360
I've got coffee in here,

1048
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,160
and I've got a dark chocolate
feuilletine layer

1049
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,560
and that just gives it, a bit of
crunch in this very wet thing.

1050
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,000
Dawn's sponges will be soaked
with vanilla flavoured tres leches,

1051
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,840
filled with a coffee creme
mousseline, and topped with

1052
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,440
a bunch of choux buns
filled with an amaretto creme pat.

1053
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,800
So there's some booze in
the profiteroles if you want it.

1054
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,280
I've decided to celebrate,
er, fruits of Mexico.

1055
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,120
Rather than booze, Janusz
is choosing the healthy option.

1056
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,120
I'm going to use a tiny bit of
lemon, dragon fruit,

1057
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,800
passion fruit, guava,
and I've got mango in the freezer.

1058
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,120
I knew I'm missing one.

1059
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,280
His dragon fruit cake will have
a guava and coconut milk soak,

1060
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,760
mango cream and dragon fruit,
and passion fruit curd.

1061
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,240
I think your whole idea
of this cake sounds amazing.

1062
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,720
It's challenging for yourself,
which is good.

1063
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,480
I mean, you've been Star Baker
a couple of times now.

1064
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,240
Love the idea.
Thank you so much.

1065
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,320
Always something interesting
going on with you.

1066
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,760
Soak completed.

1067
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,160
In addition to their soak,

1068
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,760
the bakers must create fillings that
balance the sweet rich sponge...

1069
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,440
Coconut dacquoise.

1070
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,360
...and a number of them are risking
a powerful Mexican flavour.

1071
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,880
I've already put one teaspoon
of chilli powder

1072
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,640
and one teaspoon of
the chilli fakes.

1073
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,920
Need to add the chilli in.

1074
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,880
I don't want the judges
to be choking on it,

1075
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,360
but I don't want them to say,
"Oh, can't really get the" chilli.

1076
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,800
Some bird's eye chillies.

1077
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,000
Oh, flipping hell, that's strong.

1078
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,080
Also embracing chilli...

1079
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,720
Doesn't this look delightful?

1080
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,600
...after a poor showing in
the challenges so far,

1081
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,200
James aims to make up ground
with multiple elements.

1082
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,360
It's a chocolate chilli
and lime tres leches cake,

1083
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,280
and the top tier is going to be
a fraisier tart.

1084
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,120
And then to neaten up
around the outside,

1085
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,680
I have a white chocolate collar.

1086
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,200
Going all out, James' lemon
and lime sponges

1087
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,320
will have a vanilla
tres leches soak,

1088
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:22,080
dulce de leche lime curd,
and creme diplomat fillings.

1089
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,640
The cake will be coated in
chilli chocolate ganache

1090
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,080
and be topped with a strawberry
fraisier tart and cookies.

1091
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,600
James, you have got a lot to do.
It's a lot of work.

1092
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,320
There is quite a lot
for four hours.

1093
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,200
That's a huge task,
but if you pull it off...

1094
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,200
I think I need to this week.
It's not been my week so far.

1095
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,400
Bakers, you're halfway through.

1096
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,800
I reckon that's cooked.

1097
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,120
We're looking all right.

1098
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,920
With sponges out the oven...

1099
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,800
...getting the soak in is critical.

1100
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,520
As usual, I'm going to
cut the tops off.

1101
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,640
I'm the queen of cutting the tops
off from the cakes.

1102
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,960
Going to prick the tops of them
and get some lovely milk into them.

1103
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,880
To ensure each bite is decadently
moist needs liberal soaking.

1104
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,040
You need to get it wet enough
that it's, like, soaked,

1105
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,120
but not wet enough that
it's going to, like, ooze.

1106
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,480
But overdo it...

1107
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,320
That's a lot of soak gone in there.

1108
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,440
...and the sponges will be
impossible to assemble...

1109
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,360
What you don't want is it
to be really saturated,

1110
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,080
or the whole cake'll collapse.

1111
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,600
...while scrimping on the soak

1112
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,080
means the sponge will be dry
and unpleasant.

1113
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,120
I've used 500ml for my one.

1114
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,120
It was actually
more than enough now,

1115
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,880
because they are drinking
quite quickly.

1116
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,200
Trouble is, with an angel cake,
it's not brilliant at soaking in.

1117
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,240
I'm just going to pop it in
the fridge for a little while.

1118
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,880
As soaked sponges go in to set,

1119
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,040
the bakers turn their attention
to coating their cakes.

1120
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,280
Lime butter icing.

1121
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,000
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar. 392.

1122
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,920
It's 392, isn't it? You daft cow.

1123
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,440
And now I'm making
an Italian meringue buttercream.

1124
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,480
Just putting the custard into my
German buttercream.

1125
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,840
It's really delicious.
Not as sweet as normal buttercream.

1126
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,800
Oh, wait. Oh, that'll be burnt.

1127
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,200
My Italian buttercream meringue,
it looks a bit split,

1128
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,520
so I'm trying to whisk it
to see if it helps. We'll see.

1129
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,280
Just missed my, uh,
caramel burning quite severely.

1130
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,720
I saw it and I smelt it.

1131
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,880
As ever the judges are expecting
the cakes

1132
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,600
to not only be delicious
but visually spectacular.

1133
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,360
Going to melt down some chocolate
and that's going to be

1134
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,040
a medallion on top of the temple.

1135
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,880
It's a temple to chocolate,
made out of chocolate.

1136
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,400
They're tiny baby choux.

1137
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,960
Trouble is if they're too small,
you can't fill them very easily.

1138
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,160
My cake itself is called
Day of the Dead.

1139
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,160
I'm now melting my white
chocolate to make my skulls.

1140
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,640
It's over-rated being dead,
I'll tell you that much.

1141
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,160
I've been dead for 13 years now.

1142
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,920
Paul has to break me out
the cemetery before every show.

1143
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,800
Prue puts clothes on me.
Prue puts clothes on you?

1144
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,040
Prue dresses me like a dolly.

1145
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,360
I'm going to get my curd from
the fridge. All right.

1146
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,120
I won't be here when you come back.
I'll be back in the graveyard.

1147
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,680
All right. I love you.
I love you as well.

1148
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,280
OK, so let me get this straight,
Mexico IS a real place. Yeah.

1149
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,200
How would one get there?

1150
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,920
Oh, it's easy, you just go
like this.

1151
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,680
Well, that's all well and good
for him but I can't do that.

1152
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,160
Bakers, you have
one hour left.

1153
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,800
One...

1154
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,600
We are going to construct.

1155
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,240
It's now the bakers find out
if they have one

1156
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,240
of two very different problems.

1157
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,560
Oh, this is the stressful part.

1158
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,120
If their sponge is too wet,
it's at risk of collapse.

1159
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,800
Cake. Soaked the full way through.
Kind of what I, I hoped for.

1160
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,960
Too dry and it could fail to deliver

1161
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
the sumptuous tres leche
eating experience.

1162
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,320
I don't think it's soaked at all.

1163
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,440
And soak. Yeah.

1164
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,360
Ah, it's not centred! Ah!
Knew this would happen,

1165
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,600
but do you know what?
Go hard or go home.

1166
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,680
Oh! I just don't want it
to collapse.

1167
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,320
I doubt this is how the Aztecs
originally built it.

1168
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,040
Um, I think a lot more engineering
would've gone into it.

1169
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,920
The cake itself, it didn't soak
well. Oh, it's dry.

1170
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,160
Yeah, I'm going to cry.

1171
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,920
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right, OK?

1172
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,760
You're going to pull this off. Your
flavours are going to be amazing.

1173
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,960
Building a multi-layered cake
with soaked sponges is

1174
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,400
a construction conundrum.

1175
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,120
I'm using supporting dowels.

1176
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,640
I think it would be absolute folly
not to dowel and board it.

1177
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,880
Yeah, going to play it safe.

1178
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,560
Make good decisions, Kevin.
Make good choices.

1179
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,000
Oh, dear. Oh BLEEP.

1180
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,800
What's wrong?
I'm trying to deflower.

1181
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,520
I ain't going to get these off
in time.

1182
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,240
If you really concentrate,
you can slow time down.

1183
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,080
OK. All right. This is stressing you
out, this talk, isn't it?

1184
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,120
Oh, look at that.

1185
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,160
I feel like my presence is making
this much, much worse, isn't it?

1186
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,880
My chocolate cake's split at
the bottom

1187
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,480
and now it's leaking everywhere.

1188
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,120
I just don't understand why it's
turned out like this.

1189
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,280
I'm going to try and cover it up
with icing.

1190
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,000
It's very difficult to, like,
get it... Like it's,

1191
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,200
it's, it's not working out
that well.

1192
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,120
Why is it so bulged this side?
Oh, my goodness, I'm going to cry.

1193
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,320
Just got to get the cream on
and then I'll tidy it up.

1194
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,480
It's a mess. Not good.

1195
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,360
I'm so fricking stressed out
right now.

1196
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,000
I love a good drip
because it hides all

1197
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,280
the sides that are ugly.
You can hide everything.

1198
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,520
The cake is not right. The... Argh!

1199
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,560
OK. OK. Chill out.

1200
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,400
Oh, my goodness, this is so BLEEP.

1201
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,040
It's cracked!
This ain't even frickin' working.

1202
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,880
It's holding up well but,
uh, it's a mess.

1203
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,520
This is not how this was supposed
to go. I don't want to go home.

1204
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,920
Bakers...

1205
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,560
...you have... ...15...

1206
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,280
...minutes left.

1207
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,200
Pew! Pew!

1208
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,760
Need to get a wriggle on.

1209
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,440
Oh, uh, did not think this through.

1210
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,040
I mean, a wee bit of piping
will cover up the flaws.

1211
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,120
We're all in a bleeding rush.

1212
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,280
You can do one flick. Go on.
Swap? I'll spin it, yeah. Go on.

1213
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,120
I'm just trying to make it look half
presentable at least.

1214
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,400
Oh, urgh!

1215
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,200
There's not one bit of milk left in
the bottom of this cake.

1216
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,120
How long more do we have?

1217
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,960
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

1218
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,200
Oh, God!

1219
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,960
I just want something out now.

1220
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,200
Oh!

1221
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,400
Right, let's do the tache.

1222
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,720
And make it look like
a natural look.

1223
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,720
Bakers, your time is up.

1224
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:18,680
Please, step away from your
tres leche cakes.

1225
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,160
I'm stepping away.

1226
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,320
It's four hours' bake, you're not
going to make it perfect, will you?

1227
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,520
It's so messy.
I'm literally about to cry.

1228
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,920
BLEEP.

1229
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:40,080
The bakers' tres leches cakes
will now face the judgment of Paul

1230
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,680
and Prue.

1231
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:50,320
Your decoration is so accurate and
beautiful, and piping is so good.

1232
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,520
Thank you.
Let's have a look.

1233
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,400
I think the soak's a bit
dry on a couple of them.

1234
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,920
The top two seem to be wetter than
the bottom. I agree.

1235
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,760
Mm.

1236
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,320
It's such a surprise.
It tastes like sweetcorn.

1237
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,640
It does, yeah.

1238
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,480
I mean, we asked you to be
imaginative. Well, that is

1239
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,760
imaginative. It's not for me.

1240
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,840
My only quarrel is I think it would
have been better not

1241
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,640
to have the lumps of corn in the
cake, because it spoils the texture,

1242
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,600
but it's a really good,
original cake.

1243
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,000
Well done, Syabira. Thank you.
Thank you.

1244
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:38,000
I think overall you attempted too
much. None of it's neat enough.

1245
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,720
The Fraser cake needs to be much
neater than that, the collar

1246
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,240
has lost all its shine, the pipework
isn't particularly good.

1247
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,520
I have a few issues with this.

1248
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,840
It is a bit untidy but let's see
what it tastes like.

1249
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,680
It does look good.

1250
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,960
Mm!

1251
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,200
The cake layer is
absolutely delicious.

1252
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,680
I like the flavour of the
Fraser tart, the creaminess,

1253
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,160
the lightness, the sort of vanilla.

1254
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,880
The top sponge is
a little bit tough.

1255
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,080
Much drier than the bottom one.
The bottom layer is the chilli one?

1256
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,480
So I've got like a lime curd
and a creme pat in it.

1257
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,720
The sponge is good but it is
unevenly soaked.

1258
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,480
I like the lime curd and I like the
sponge, but it is messy.

1259
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,520
Thank you.

1260
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,360
Well, I must say, I love the idea.

1261
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,320
I think it's a little rough
and ready.

1262
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,080
Some of the milky syrup
is running out,

1263
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,040
which must mean it's quite
well soaked.

1264
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,640
Maybe oversoaked.

1265
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,600
I think the design is fantastic,

1266
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,200
and to make it a tres leches cake
is tricky.

1267
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,680
I think you pulled it off all right.
What's that in the bottom?

1268
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,280
Is that just where the milks
haven't soaked in?

1269
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,440
I reckon there's probably a few
parts where it's not soaked in.

1270
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,160
I love the flavour.
It's got a little bit of a kick.

1271
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,640
Quite a kick, it's strong chilli.

1272
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,120
It's quite pungent and the biggest
issue I have is the texture.

1273
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,960
I think you've got flour
lumps in there.

1274
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,040
That's a real pity
because flavour's good.

1275
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,320
We asked for vibrant colour
and we've got it,

1276
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,720
and I love the look of it.

1277
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,840
I think the cake is quite effective,
the colours are strong,

1278
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,520
I like the declaration on the top

1279
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,760
but let's see what it looks like inside.

1280
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,680
Ooh. Wow.

1281
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,760
The bit of cake I've just got
doesn't seem

1282
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,320
to have been soaked at all.

1283
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,280
Have you got chilli in there?
Yeah, in the ganache.

1284
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,880
Is it too strong?

1285
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,960
Yes! When I first put it in
my mouth I was going, what is that?

1286
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,720
What you've done is added a punch
and a punch and a punch and a punch

1287
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,520
and then destroyed
what it actually was.

1288
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,040
I think your criticism is
too strong.

1289
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,360
I think it's a really
well-made cake.

1290
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,240
I think you've done a good
job with the look,

1291
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,960
just thought your flavours
are just too much.

1292
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,880
I think it looks lovely. It's quite
cartoonlike but highly effective.

1293
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,160
The drips are perfect. I think
it's beautifully executed.

1294
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,320
It's as neat as a pin
and it's very modern looking.

1295
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,080
How about that for colour?

1296
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,480
The cake is quite dense. I think
the sponge is a little bit too dry.

1297
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,160
You could have got more
soak in there,

1298
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,360
but your saving grace is the guava
and the passion fruit.

1299
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,600
I would agree, I think
it looks absolutely wonderful,

1300
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,960
the flavour's fantastic.

1301
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,080
I just think that the cake is
a little too firm.

1302
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,440
I think the skulls work,
day of the dead celebration.

1303
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,280
It's a little bit wonky.

1304
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:51,440
I agree it's on the lean
but I think it's an attractive,

1305
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:55,760
unusual looking cake.
Very even layers.

1306
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,080
The soak has gone through
quite nicely on each.

1307
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,880
The passion fruit and the lime
work really nicely together.

1308
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,320
I think you've done a decent job.

1309
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,520
Sandro, I absolutely love the look
of it. It is a bit wonky.

1310
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,160
It is wonky on the top which
winds me up a little bit

1311
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,400
but I love the colours.
It looks very good.

1312
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,720
The bottom tier
is a chocolate coffee cake.

1313
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,960
The top is a sliced chocolate cake
with spiced chocolate ganache

1314
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,400
and cherry compote. It looks like
a black forest gateaux, actually.

1315
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,120
I know we are always asking
for good strong flavours

1316
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,360
but I think you've
overdone it a bit, Sandro.

1317
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,840
There's too much booze,
too much chilli, too much cherry.

1318
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,880
It's a bit milder, the bottom one,
so it works nicer.

1319
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,800
I think that bottom layer is
absolutely delicious.

1320
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,440
I think it's something
of a little triumph.

1321
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,120
So I have done a tres leches
wedding cake, a rustic wedding cake.

1322
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,480
It is rustic, you're right.

1323
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,200
You've got a bit of leakage down
there as well.

1324
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,400
That is very boozy.

1325
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:26,400
You've got chilli in that ganache?
Yeah. Wow!

1326
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:29,240
It's supposed to be mellowed
by the cream.

1327
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,640
Filling is too much!

1328
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,480
A little less tequila
and quite a lot less chilli.

1329
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,800
You're getting hit
with big, big flavours.

1330
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,120
If you'd held back on that,

1331
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,480
you would have had an all-round
nicer cake.

1332
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,800
I think the overall look is good.

1333
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,880
Your piping work, the way it all
cascades down looks great.

1334
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,920
Yes, I like it, I love the colours.
Cuts nice. Oh, that's interesting.

1335
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,120
I think the butter cream's
got a nice lightness to it

1336
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,640
to go with the richness of the cake.

1337
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,600
The chocolate flavour comes
through nicely,

1338
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,800
so between the two it's quite stark
but it works.

1339
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,840
I think you've done
a good job, Maxy.

1340
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,720
I think it looks simple and
effective, it's quite elegant,

1341
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,800
let's see what it looks like inside.

1342
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,200
Wow, that's soft.

1343
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,040
That's heaven.

1344
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,640
That flavour is heaven.

1345
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:46,080
I like the crunch,
I like the soft cake.

1346
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,920
That's good. The sponge is so soft,
coffee levels are perfect.

1347
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:57,760
Wow. It's really good.
Thank you very much.

1348
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,680
APPLAUSE

1349
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,520
I can't believe that.
Absolutely stunned.

1350
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,240
Everything they said was fair,

1351
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,560
clumps of flour in your cake batter
just isn't acceptable.

1352
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,600
She said it's a triumph.

1353
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,160
Triumph, that's a good word.

1354
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:20,160
If you were to put a bet on me
I think I'd give myself 7-1.

1355
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,440
My chances ain't very good.

1356
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,080
I think I'm definitely in
the firing line.

1357
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,160
They asked for Mexican and I feel
like it was more of a Mexican't.

1358
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,080
Well,
we didn't get the Mexican weather.

1359
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,520
It's been pretty cold again. But we
had some good Mexican Showstoppers.

1360
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,840
They looked beautiful, didn't
they? They look Mexican.

1361
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,400
There were lots of bright colours.

1362
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,200
There's two people actually that
pulled themselves up quite a bit,

1363
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,720
I think Abdul and Dawn.
Dawn smashed it.

1364
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,720
I think both of them
catapulted themselves up.

1365
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,720
What she was so clever about was she
wasn't overcomplicating anything.

1366
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,240
And then you look at the other
side of the coin, James, I mean,

1367
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,480
what was that about?

1368
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,560
He stretched himself too much,
that cake was not good,

1369
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,560
and the collar was dull, it was
matt. And it was really clumsy.

1370
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,840
Too many elements.

1371
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,000
Yeah, but I'd say exactly the same
about Carole.

1372
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,280
And coming into today,
Carole was near the bottom.

1373
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,320
For me, she still is.

1374
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,600
I mean, the other person that
was in trouble was Rebs

1375
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,560
and I think she still is in trouble.
Those cakes were far too strong.

1376
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,480
Everything was too strong.
We could get rid of two today.

1377
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,160
There is legitimate reason.

1378
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,680
To be honest
we had three pretty poor

1379
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,160
performances from Carole, Rebs
and James.

1380
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,560
Has Dawn done enough with the Showstopper

1381
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,720
to be a consideration for
Star Baker?

1382
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,320
Without a shadow of a doubt,
Dawn's pushed herself up.

1383
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,240
I don't think quite in line
with Star Baker. Right.

1384
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,480
I think Maxy is, I think Sandro is.
Yeah. And Janusz.

1385
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,280
I think you have to put Janusz in
in there as well. Janusz is there.

1386
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,840
Hello, bakers. Well done again
on that showstopper, it was amazing.

1387
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,760
Luckily this week I've got
the fabulous job of announcing

1388
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,720
which one of you has won Star Baker.

1389
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:07,120
And the person who's Star
Baker this week is...

1390
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,120
Maxy. Yeah!

1391
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:25,400
I have the less fun job of saying
who's leaving us

1392
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,440
and, yes,
this week it is two bakers.

1393
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:34,720
So the two bakers who are leaving us
this week are...

1394
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,120
James...

1395
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,480
...and Rebs.

1396
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:02,800
Honestly, devastated. This
means the world to me. Sorry, Rebs.

1397
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:06,360
It's hard in this tent.
It's only cake. Poor Rebs.

1398
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,040
Her flavours were just too strong
and too many of them.

1399
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,440
Bake Off's been a fabulous experience.

1400
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,600
It's just I didn't want it to be
cut this short.

1401
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,120
I'm gutted for James as well.
James is such a fabulous person.

1402
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,160
It's been fun though,
so I don't mind.

1403
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,320
I'm always sad to see any bakers go,
but particularly James.

1404
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,240
If I was to use a fun
metaphor, I think

1405
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,520
I was a plant that's
roots are outgrowing its pot.

1406
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,000
I'm going to really miss you, mate.

1407
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,360
James had a rotten week,

1408
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,040
and his Showstopper was a real disappointment.

1409
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,960
Oh, I think
I went wrong across the board!

1410
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,880
I think Maxi winning Star Baker for
the second time is well-deserved.

1411
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:44,040
She was the most consistent over
the three challenges.

1412
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,280
I'm dancing right now!
Just keep going, huh?

1413
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,840
This has really given me confidence.

1414
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,840
Honestly, I never thought I'd come
to the tent and get two Star Bakers.

1415
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,200
It's crazy. Next week, we're
halfway through,

1416
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,880
and I think we've got five bakers in
there that are all doing very well.

1417
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,320
There's another three of them
that have to step up now

1418
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,240
and show us what they really can do.

1419
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,160
There's only one way this is going
to go and it's,

1420
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,720
like, harder and harder.

1421
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,000
Next time...

1422
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,600
...the bakers tackle
demanding desserts.

1423
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:15,160
You know "desserts" backwards
is "stressed". And I am.

1424
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,120
From steam signature... Oh, my God.

1425
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,200
...that has our bakers hot under
the collar.

1426
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:25,240
Oh, what a disaster. A Technical...

1427
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,360
Have you seen the method, guys?

1428
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:32,560
...with no recipe. Come on! And
a magnificent mousse Showstopper...

1429
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,040
To be able to put that design
together with mousse is impressive.

1430
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:40,440
...that will serve one baker...
Oh! It's moved.

1431
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,960
...their just deserts.

1432
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,080
Mine looks like a car crash.

1433
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,240
Are you a Star Baker in the making?

1434
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:50,480
