1
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,640
Mm, nice baps.

2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,120
They're bagels actually.

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,440
Can you not look at me like that?
I'm your sister.

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,040
Oh, yeah, sorry.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,280
Ooh! I feel Darth Baker is close by.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,800
What do you think Prue-bacca?

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,440
Rarrrrrrrrrr.

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,120
Yeah, you could be right, yeah.

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,600
WHEEZING BREATHS

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,400
I shouldn't have taken the stairs.
I'm knackered.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,840
Too many lemon drizzles, mate.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,120
LIGHTSABER CRACKLES

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,640
HE WHIMPERS

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,520
SIZZLING

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,680
Oh, you just burnt my pie!

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,840
It's fine. It's a
little on the dark side.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,280
BEEPING

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,520
Oh, I think my fruit sponge
is ready.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,800
Anyone?

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,960
No, I think you'll be eating
that flan solo.

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,800
ALL: Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,240
Noel, you look like Billie Eilish's
grandmother.

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,680
You look about four.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,800
When I came in, I could see
the edges of the tent.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,800
It's almost here!
I am just a few steps away.

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,360
I feel as though I've fallen down
a rabbit hole

27
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,880
and the Mad Hatter's going to come
running round the corner.

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,240
I cannot wait to walk into
that tent,

29
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,520
feel what it's like
to be one of those people.

30
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,560
I've never wanted to be in
a tent so bad before.

31
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,080
From across Britain, thousands of
the best home bakers applied...

32
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,200
Good luck.

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,600
But just 12 have made it.

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,280
I've always wanted to apply

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,440
but I never had the courage
to actually do it.

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,720
This year, just thought I'd give it
a try, and I'm here.

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,640
I work in a supermarket behind
the checkouts.

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,200
This is the biggest thing
that I've ever done.

39
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,440
Things like this don't happen to me.

40
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,440
You just want to cry.

41
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Because you cannot believe
this is real.

42
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,680
Over the next ten weeks...
It is going in.

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,160
They'll face 30 brand-new
challenges...

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,240
Woohoo!

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,360
Designed to put every bit of their
baking ability to the test.

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,080
I've done baking for quite a while.

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,200
I feel maybe I'm, like,
sort of good at this.

48
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,680
We're about to find out how good,
aren't we? So maybe I'm terrible.

49
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,120
My partner said fake it
until you make it.

50
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,440
The stress is real.

51
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,200
And that's what I'm doing.

52
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,280
Everything they make will be judged
by Prue Leith...

53
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,360
It is utterly delicious.

54
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,360
And Paul Hollywood.

55
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,320
I'm intrigued to see if Paul's eyes
are as blue

56
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,320
as people say in real life,
like a White Walker or something.

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,040
INTERVIEWER: They're bluer.
Are they?

58
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look into your soul.

59
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,760
They'll start with astounding cakes...

60
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,120
Come on. Oh, my...

61
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,680
a batch of scrumptious
signature sandwiches...

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,120
Oh, my God. It's gone all crumbly.

63
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,440
Aah...

64
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,840
a classic American cake... Yeah.

65
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,800
That'll catch some red-handed...

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,400
I was going to high five you

67
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,040
but I've seen your palms. Good luck.

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,360
Right, can't stop, can't stop.

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,320
And a show-stopping home bake...

70
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,960
Ooh, boy.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,440
It's OK, it's OK.

72
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,920
It landed the right side up.

73
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Yes.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,840
That'll expose any
shaky foundations.

75
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm so worried.

76
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,200
You all right? Yeah.

77
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,600
Boo!

78
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,720
LAUGHTER

79
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,720
After two years away in Essex,
we've pitched our tent

80
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,120
back in the beautiful grounds
of Welford Park.

81
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,400
And our fresh crop
of bakers are about to face

82
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,320
three cake-based challenges

83
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,240
after which one of them will be
crowned Star Baker

84
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,800
and one will have to leave
the competition.

85
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,320
Hello, bakers, welcome to the tent.

86
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,880
And it's time for your first ever
Signature Challenge.

87
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,960
Today, the judges would love you
to make a batch

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,280
of 12 identical mini sandwich cakes.

89
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, you know,
like Battenburg in a panini,

90
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,200
Vicky sponge on sourdough,
tea loaf in a tuna melt.

91
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,800
I think that would be
a cake sandwich.

92
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,360
They're looking for sandwich cakes.

93
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,720
Oh, good, cos they sounded rank.
They did sound rank.

94
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,200
The shape and flavours are entirely
up to you

95
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,000
and you can use any sponge you like.

96
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,680
You have one hour.

97
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
What?

98
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,960
Sandwiched between two half-hours.
Ah!

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,400
You have two hours. You've got
two hours. On your marks...

100
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,840
Get set...

101
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,680
Bake! Whoo.

102
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,240
Right...

103
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,840
{\an8}Little bit stressed -
I'm not going to lie.

104
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,880
{\an8}I just hope that today, it'll go OK.

105
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,560
{\an8}Doesn't feel real yet.

106
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,880
{\an8}Two hours - it's not a long time
to make 12 sandwich cakes.

107
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,320
{\an8}I didn't feel great this morning.
Really nervous.

108
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,840
It's crazy, because you're just
making a cake

109
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,240
and it's something you do
all the time.

110
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,080
PRUE: Mini sandwich cakes.

111
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,080
This looks like quite
a simple challenge.

112
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,000
But what we're really looking for
is a bit of originality.

113
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,080
PAUL: They could choose
any sponge they want,

114
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,880
but we want it to be small,
packed with the flavour,

115
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,240
full of their personality.

116
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,320
It's the first time the bakers are
going to show us what they can bake.

117
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,880
So this is really important.

118
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,160
We want to see their skills.

119
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,520
They need to be
absolutely identical,

120
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,040
absolutely delicious,

121
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,360
the perfect sandwich cake
is what we want.

122
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,920
Morning, Rebs. Hello, Rebs. Morning.

123
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,440
Right, tell us all about
your mini sandwich cake.

124
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,400
I'm making hazelnut mocha latte
mini sandwich cakes

125
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,080
because I used to work as a barista

126
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,520
and it's the drink my now boyfriend

127
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,216
used to come and order all the time
when he was trying to chat me up.

128
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,200
So you're approaching this like
a barista? In a way, yeah.

129
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,400
These two are going to be
absolutely pumped.

130
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,520
The amount of coffee that's
going in it, hopefully.

131
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,680
Rebs, from County Antrim
in Northern Ireland

132
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,040
has been baking since she was three.
Come on.

133
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,760
Studying for a Masters in Business,

134
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,280
when she's not buried under books,

135
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,040
she's getting muddy with dogs Miley,
Ruby and troublesome Tiggy.

136
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,400
Oh, Tiggy.

137
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,720
To bring the hazelnut flavour
to her coffee cakes,

138
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,280
she'll add chopped nuts

139
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,000
to both her caramel filling
and highly caffeinated sponge.

140
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,760
Have you practised this? Yeah.

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,160
And what did your friends
think of it?

142
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,400
Everyone has different tastes,
I'll say that.

143
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
LAUGHTER

144
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,880
You can get friends anywhere, don't
worry about that. Yeah, exactly.

145
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,400
This is a massive whisk.

146
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,880
Rebs isn't the only baker
adding a kick to their cake.

147
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,976
Chilli powder is there -
not to bring in the chilli -

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,240
but helps bring in the flavours of
the chocolate even further.

149
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,680
A keen dancer, software engineer
Abdul likes to lindy hop

150
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,240
with girlfriend Christine.

151
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,480
Hello!

152
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,080
Born in Saudi Arabia
but now living in London,

153
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,880
he's not seen his family
for over three years.

154
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,240
Technical difficulties.

155
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,200
Containing raspberry jam
and mascarpone

156
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,760
between layers of chocolate
and hazelnut sponge,

157
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,920
Abdul's sandwich cakes are dedicated
to former friends.

158
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,640
I'm a huge lover of plants.

159
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,400
I have tons of them in my house.

160
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,120
I've killed a lot, unfortunately.

161
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,400
I'm trying to make these cakes
to pay tribute to those.

162
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,720
You're my favourite botanical
serial killer.

163
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,760
PRUE: You always hurt
the ones you love. Come on, Abdul.

164
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,960
Thank you.

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,800
I call this the bite-size of love.

166
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,440
Sandro's bakes also come from
the heart.

167
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,880
{\an8}When I first met my partner,
every time we saw each other,

168
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,680
{\an8}I always gave a white rose.

169
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,560
{\an8}So I'm making, like,
chocolate flowerpots.

170
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,440
When Sandro, a fitness fanatic from
East London, isn't hitting the gym,

171
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,200
he works as a full-time nanny.

172
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,480
♪ I am the champion... ♪

173
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,400
He'll fill his flowerpots with
a chocolate and orange sponge

174
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,200
and a rich red wine ganache

175
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,080
from which delicate sugar roses
will grow.

176
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,560
Are you a gym guy? Um...

177
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,240
I mean, you look like you are.
Twice a day. Once is not enough?

178
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,640
I'll do... No, cos I'll do, like,
kind of weights, isn't it?

179
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,040
And then I'll do cardio.
Same. Can you tell?

180
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,080
I do weights in a graveyard.
The old bones. Urgh. Oh, don't.

181
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,360
Yeah, forget cardio.
I haven't got a heart.

182
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,360
And it seems love is in the air.

183
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,680
{\an8}These are mini Persian love cakes.

184
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,360
{\an8}We've got a large Persian community
in our church

185
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,680
so it's a tribute to their faith
and their friendship.

186
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,640
Kevin lives in Lanarkshire,
Scotland, with his wife, Rachel,

187
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,080
and their dog, Judy.

188
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,560
A talented musician, he not only
plays the clarinet,

189
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,040
flute and saxophone professionally -
but he teaches, too.

190
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,320
Nice one.

191
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,680
Kevin's love cakes are full
of Persian flavour

192
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,320
with rose Swiss meringue buttercream

193
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,480
sandwiched between layers
of pistachio,

194
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,320
almond and cardamom sponge.

195
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,760
The sponge is going to have
blitzed pistachio nuts,

196
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
but I'm not
going to blitz them right down.

197
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,320
I still want there to be a bit of
texture and a bit of crunch.

198
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,200
I'm using 120g of pistachios.

199
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,920
Maisam's also chosen to go all-out
with her nutty sponge.

200
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,840
{\an8}I want to get as much flavour

201
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,320
{\an8}and texture in the cake
as possible.

202
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,560
Born in Libya,
this year's youngest baker,

203
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,840
18-year-old design student Maisam

204
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,920
lives in Manchester with her parents,

205
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,920
two brothers and younger
sister, Juri.

206
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,800
I'm going to copy your drawing.
What?!

207
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,320
To help balance the sweetness
of her pistachio-packed sponge,

208
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,840
Maisam will fill her sandwich cakes
with raspberry jam

209
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,920
and raspberry Swiss
meringue buttercream.

210
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,800
In the practice, it went really well

211
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,120
so I'm hoping that it'll turn out
well this time.

212
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,480
You're the baby here,
did you realise that?

213
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,960
Yes, I'm the youngest one,
so pressure is on.

214
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,520
Key to creating delicious
mini sandwich cakes...

215
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,240
Heavy on the coffee. Whoo!

216
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,560
The judges will expect beautifully
flavoured soft sponge.

217
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,000
It's the blue-eyed one
that scares me.

218
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,640
He's just super intense.

219
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,600
It's like he's looking through
my soul.

220
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,640
So disapproving.
He looks at you like, "Aah!"

221
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
Oh, I nearly forgot
to put my eggs in!

222
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, my goodness!
It's like something's missing here.

223
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,280
Swedish-born Maxy,

224
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,240
an architectural assistant
from South East London,

225
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,360
is passing on her passion for baking

226
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,440
to daughters Tara and Talia.

227
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,720
That's enough now.

228
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,640
She's giving her
Eton mess-inspired cakes

229
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,200
a tropical twist with mango
and passion fruit coulis

230
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,640
{\an8}and mascarpone between layers
of vanilla sponge.

231
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,840
You're from Sweden
but I can't hear the accent.

232
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,960
I've lived here for 21 years.
It's been a long time.

233
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,880
You speak Swedish as well?
I do speak Swedish, yeah.

234
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,160
Are you? I'm semi-bilingual.
Oh, are you? Hmm.

235
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,240
What languages do you speak?
Well, English.

236
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,200
English and...?

237
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,440
Well, no, I'm semi-bilingual.
Semi, oh, semi. Oh, yeah.

238
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,040
Next time I've got a joke,
I'll put it in writing

239
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,800
and send it to you in advance,
all right? Oh...!

240
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,440
Looks good, it is going in.

241
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,720
The quicker the sponges hit
the oven,

242
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,920
the longer they'll have to cool.

243
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,760
11 minutes at 180.

244
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,240
Is there a timer on this thing?

245
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,680
If the bakers attempt to cut

246
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,480
and fill their layers of sponge
while still warm,

247
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,440
they'll be left with
a crumbly, leaking mess.

248
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,680
Oh, crap. I forgot to switch it on!

249
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,880
It's all right, it's not done yet.

250
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,760
{\an8}I can tell by visual clues,
ie, it's not brown.

251
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,640
Will is a charity director
who lives in London with wife Alison

252
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,400
and their three children,
Max, Verity and Louie.

253
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,720
That's going well, Louie.
It's quite crumbly.

254
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,000
To cut through the sweetness of his
salty caramel swirled buttercream

255
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,000
and in a bid to stand out
from the crowd,

256
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,600
Will's cakes contain no less than
three different types of ginger.

257
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,640
Who do you think's good in here?
Who are you scared of?

258
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,960
Uh, everybody.

259
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,760
I feel like the first one, you're
just finding your feet, aren't you?

260
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,680
New equipment,
Paul leering down on you.

261
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,320
It's not usually what happens,
is it, when you're at home baking?

262
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,400
No, normally,
normally just stood at home.

263
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,200
You haven't got
a sort of tipsy posh woman

264
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,120
and a bronze man staring at you.

265
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,200
You don't know where I live,
do you?

266
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,760
All right, guys, I know you're
new here, so, basically,

267
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,440
the way things work in this tent,

268
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,760
if you want to know
how long you've got left,

269
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,080
you have to give us each a fiver. LAUGHTER

270
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,360
Oh, well, it was worth a try.
You've got an hour left.

271
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,000
An hour?! Is that good or bad?

272
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,160
It's bad for me.

273
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,040
I'm not feeling confident about
my meringues

274
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,960
cos these have to go in for an hour.

275
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,080
Oh, that's the timer for my cakes.

276
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh, they have risen very well.
More than I thought.

277
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,320
The difference between perfectly
baked moist sponge...

278
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,640
Oh, it's done.
And a dry, dense disaster...

279
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,920
Oh, my...

280
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,800
can be a matter of moments.

281
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,040
It should be cooked.
You get the absolute fear.

282
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,760
These are sticky toffee
pudding sponges.

283
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,720
Bit alarmed that one edge has sunk,

284
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,160
don't know how that happened,
but I think it's OK.

285
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,080
It's like the famous last words,
isn't it?

286
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,840
Originally from Glasgow,

287
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,360
James, a nuclear scientist, has been
baking since he was five years old.

288
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,080
It's a passion matched only by his
love of '80s horror films.

289
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,360
That's incredible.

290
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,800
He'll add warmth to his sticky
toffee apple sandwich cakes

291
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,200
with ginger in his apple jam
and nutmeg in his buttercream.

292
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,600
Explain the colour of
the kilt, then, is it family?

293
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,680
So it's actually the kilt I wore
for my graduation.

294
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,200
Pants or no pants?

295
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,320
Um, that's for you to find out,
isn't it?

296
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,440
PRUE: That's an invitation.

297
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,600
While their sponges cool...

298
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,040
I have a wee apple jam going.

299
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,480
The bakers turn their attention
to fillings.

300
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,920
This is hazelnut caramel.

301
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,520
But I'm a wee bit concerned,
cos it's a bit runny.

302
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,240
I probably put too much butter in.

303
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm making Italian
meringue buttercream.

304
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,640
The technically complicated version
of buttercream.

305
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,120
But Will's not the only one

306
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,680
trying to impress with his
ambitious icing.

307
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,120
Struggling to cut this butter.

308
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,040
The buttercream's flavoured
with rose.

309
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,560
I know that rose can be
a really overpowering flavour.

310
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,560
So it's just a whisper.

311
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,680
Woohoo!

312
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,800
While Will, Maisam and Kevin attempt
to sweeten up the judges...

313
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,240
Nice.

314
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,600
♪ Dozy doats and dozy doats
And liddle lamzy divey... ♪

315
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,200
Carole's gone sour.

316
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,760
Just making my lemon curd.

317
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't put that much sugar in
cos I want it nice and tart.

318
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,640
West Country born and bred,

319
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,360
Carole, a supermarket cashier,

320
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,760
lives in Dorset
with husband Michael.

321
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,880
A keen gardener,

322
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,680
she's affectionately
known as Compost Carole.

323
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,120
Get a nice bit of root.

324
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,720
As well as her curd filling,
she'll add lemon juice

325
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,840
to her buttercream

326
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,320
and zest to her
lemon and poppy seed sponge.

327
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,280
I'm a little bit of a classic baker,

328
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,880
your carrot cakes
and your lemon drizzles.

329
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,040
I'm not a big one for putting exotic
ingredients in, you know?

330
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,880
But somewhere exotic is exactly
where Dawn's heading.

331
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,560
I'm doing lime and tamarind
spring cake.

332
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,560
Tamarind - it's a slightly
earthy flavour,

333
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,960
but it's fruity at the same time

334
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,920
and this bake, it's
fairly traditional,

335
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,360
but it's got a bit of a twist.

336
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,200
Dawn, a former project manager
for Boris Johnson,

337
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,640
lives in Bedfordshire where she
entertains granddaughter Emmy

338
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,960
with her hand-modelled
sugar figurines.

339
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,160
Mr Froggington.
Do you like him? Yes!

340
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,480
To complement her tamarind jelly
filling, she'll add coconut

341
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,600
to her sponge and create
a coconut marzipan topping.

342
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,240
You worked for Boris Johnson?
Not directly.

343
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,000
Did you get to meet him? Yeah.

344
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,720
His hair was a bit like yours.
I know.

345
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,960
Wasn't it? Yeah.

346
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,600
And his face was a bit like mine.

347
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah, there you go -
we're like a hybrid.

348
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,600
How about that? Put us together
and you have Boris Johnson.

349
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,200
How about that? Yeah.

350
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,600
Dawn isn't the only baker bringing
a taste of the tropics.

351
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,960
I am making Malaysian cake

352
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,280
which is based on
the pandan flavouring.

353
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,880
It is very aromatic,
people call it Asian vanilla.

354
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,040
Malaysian-born Syabira
lives in London

355
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,520
where she works in
cardiovascular research.

356
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,800
Comms check.

357
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,960
After a hard day in the lab,

358
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,800
she likes to relax gaming online
with boyfriend Bradley.

359
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,400
It's, oh, a head shot.
Oh, I got head-shotted.

360
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,120
{\an8}Syabira will flavour her sponge
and coconut custard with pandan

361
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,960
{\an8}and add caramel
to both her mousse and decorations,

362
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,840
{\an8}traditional Malaysian sweets known
as onde-onde.

363
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm going to make a caramel bomb.

364
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,440
When you bite into it,
the caramel just bursts out.

365
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,360
Going to explode. You're going
to blow the judges' heads off.

366
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,040
I love this. Good luck. This
sounds amazing. Good luck, Syabira.

367
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,480
Thank you. Thank you.

368
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,320
Anyone who tries to bomb these two
is amazing in my book.

369
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,880
But Syabira's caramel bombs
aren't the only bake

370
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,480
that should probably come with
a safety warning.

371
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,120
I'm soaking my sponges
with Polish cherry liqueur.

372
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,440
What I'm making today will be

373
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,200
a Polish-inspired bake
which is wuzetka.

374
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,000
Janusz is a PA from Brighton

375
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,680
where he lives with boyfriend Simon
and sausage dog Nigel.

376
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,800
He learned many of his Polish
recipes from mum Elizia

377
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,720
who taught him and his sister
to bake.

378
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,800
Filled with pistachio cream
and cherries,

379
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,400
he'll top his boozy wuzetka

380
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,760
with a layer of
rich chocolate ganache.

381
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,760
It's like a Polish Black Forest.

382
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,640
PRUE: Is that cherries
soaked in booze?

383
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,920
Nice. Thinking of you.

384
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,720
Thank you.
You've done your homework.

385
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,800
I am glad to hear that.

386
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,440
NOEL: This sounds absolutely
delicious. This is my kind of bake.

387
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,520
PRUE AND NOEL: Good luck.

388
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,136
I want to do the time call. It's my
turn. No, it's my turn to do it.

389
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,120
Let me do the time call.
I'm doing the time call.

390
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,240
All right, fine,
you do the time call.

391
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,440
Thanks. Bakers, you have half
an hour left.

392
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Ooh.

393
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,880
The sponge is done,

394
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,520
but my Italian meringue's split

395
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,280
for reasons I don't understand
so I'm going to make it again.

396
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,160
But Italian meringue buttercream
takes half an hour,

397
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,680
so it's slightly worrying.

398
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,920
I'm about to start cutting out
the cakes.

399
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,640
No matter whether they've baked
large trays of sponge...

400
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,120
I'm just going to make
small circles.

401
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,600
Or individual portions,

402
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,400
the judges will expect every
slice of the bakers' sandwich cakes

403
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,240
to be uniform and neat.

404
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,680
The tops will be cut off.
They all will be even size.

405
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,200
Uh, ruler.

406
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,640
I mean, most people wouldn't care.

407
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,160
But the judges aren't most people.

408
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,600
The perfect slices...

409
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,520
It's very soft cake
so I need to be careful.

410
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,160
Require a cool sponge.

411
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,600
Oh, it's gone all crumbly.

412
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,640
I think I cut them whilst they were
still a bit warm.

413
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh...!

414
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,480
Now they're going to need plenty
of cherry vodka.

415
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,840
I've got my big guns here.

416
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,280
Drizzle some more pandan flavourings.

417
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,520
Oh, my God!

418
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,160
Hopefully, with the help of
buttercream, I'll manage to hide it.

419
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,040
But there's a flaw in
Maisam's plan.

420
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,320
The buttercream has curdled.

421
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,720
Yeah. It'll...
It'll take some time to fix it.

422
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,880
How long have we got left?

423
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,760
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

424
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,960
Ah.

425
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,520
15 minutes, oh, my gosh,
I'm going to start assembling.

426
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,720
We'll make it, we have to.

427
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,240
Ah, this caramel's starting to melt.

428
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,640
At home I wouldn't care if
the caramel was over the edge

429
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,800
and now you're like, "Aah!"

430
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,720
Now custard.

431
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,280
This is red wine ganache.
Proper strong.

432
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,920
Finally seeing some Swiss
meringue buttercream.

433
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,760
While Maisam's filling comes
together at last...

434
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,000
That was a nightmare.
A nightmare, pulled it off.

435
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,600
It's done it again.

436
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,000
For the second time...

437
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,240
BLEEP

438
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,680
Will's has split.

439
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,120
Agh. I need to make a buttercream.

440
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,040
How do I make a buttercream?
Butter, sugar.

441
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,240
Yeah. Yeah.

442
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Decoration time. Making bees.
Fiddly little buggers.

443
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,760
So I'm just making the caramel
for the wee candles.

444
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,160
You're a nuclear scientist,
is that right?

445
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,080
Yeah. This is a bit of a come-down
for you, isn't it? I mean...

446
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,160
Haven't you got more important
things to be doing?

447
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,280
Making cakes is vastly
more exciting.

448
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,320
These are cocoa nibs.
It's the soil.

449
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,680
Hello, petal. Hello, hello.
I was talking to the flower.

450
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,520
Oh. I thought you were talking
to me.

451
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,600
Oh.

452
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,160
Bakers, you have five minutes left.
Tight, tight, tight.

453
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,040
I've got to get going,
I've got to get going.

454
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,360
Got to decorate the top.
Add my fruits on.

455
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,680
Terrified that I won't
get this done on time.

456
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,960
It's looking rubbish.

457
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,880
Think, William.
Calm yourself down, mate.

458
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,840
I feel like
I shouldn't be this calm.

459
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,200
I just wonder what's gone wrong.

460
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,120
Argh! I'm just very carefully trying
to put the coconut topping on.

461
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,200
I kind of wish the buttercream
was a tiny bit better.

462
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,760
Oh, this is not good.

463
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,680
They're just sliding.
What a frigging nightmare.

464
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,120
Finishing touches.

465
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,640
Flavour-wise, should be good,

466
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,800
but look-wise,
100% not happy with it.

467
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,840
It's not perfect,

468
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,600
but I hope they will like it.
I don't know.

469
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,000
These look amazing. This is your
Persian business, right?

470
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,440
Yes. Have you been to Persia?
Uh, no. Maybe one day.

471
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,880
We'll go together. Yeah? Yeah.

472
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,920
Are you free on the 14th?
14th of what?

473
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,760
I've got to go,
I've got to do a time call. Goodbye.

474
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,480
OK. Bakers, you have
one minute left.

475
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,880
Argh!

476
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,560
Oh, my God.

477
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,560
60 seconds, kids. You can do this.

478
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,160
I'm going to try as many cactus
as possible.

479
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,400
A very rushed nutmeg job.

480
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,840
I'm just trying
to do whatever I can do right now.

481
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,360
Don't collapse!

482
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,920
Bakers... No!

483
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,000
Your time is up!

484
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,200
Oh!

485
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,720
Please step away from your mini
sandwich cakes.

486
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,480
Well done, well done. High ten.

487
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,200
That was a good high ten, as well.

488
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,440
There's Margaret, there's Minnie,
there's Maureen.

489
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,320
Carole, they're so cute. Yes!

490
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,000
Look at these.

491
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,560
Janusz, those are so neat.

492
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,800
{\an8}It's rubbish. Oh... Boo-hoo!

493
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,560
{\an8}For the very first time,
our 12 new bakers

494
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,880
{\an8}and their mini sandwich cakes
are about to face

495
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,040
{\an8}the judgment of Paul and Prue.

496
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,920
{\an8}Hello, Maxy. Hiya.

497
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,840
In your world,
mini is a curious thing.

498
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,920
That's huge!

499
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,680
Let's have a look at
these monsters.

500
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,360
You've got it all over your fingers.
I can't take him anywhere.

501
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,120
Do you know, I've got "mess" in
the title, so...

502
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,480
Yeah, exactly.

503
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,080
The cake's quite dry.
Is it dry?

504
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,840
Um, you probably could've done
with slightly less bake on that.

505
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,040
Yeah. However, there's nothing wrong

506
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
with passion fruit sponge
and a meringue.

507
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,120
The combination of flavours
is beautiful. Well done.

508
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,320
Yeah, well done. Thank you.
Thank you.

509
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,640
Well done. Thank you.

510
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,480
Oh, my goodness.

511
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,760
Well done.

512
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,120
{\an8}The pipework - that's just like
a blob. What is that?

513
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,320
Who knows, at this point?!

514
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,680
See what the taste is like.

515
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,400
Hmm, beautiful.

516
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,120
Absolutely sticky toffee pudding,
but better because it's got ginger.

517
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,080
So we've figured out you can bake.

518
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,200
But you need to concentrate on some
of the detail.

519
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,600
{\an8}I think they look great.
Love the decoration on the top.

520
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,760
So cute. And I love the colours.

521
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,920
They're absolutely classic flavours.
Nicely balanced.

522
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,520
Yeah, there's enough lemon in there

523
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,440
cos you're getting it through
the curd as well

524
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,840
which is nice and sharp. Yeah.

525
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,720
What's not to like? Thank you.

526
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,040
{\an8}They look very good.
Pretty consistent.

527
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,680
The rose is perfect. OK.

528
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,120
The cake itself is a bit heavy.

529
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,440
You've got too much in there,

530
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,680
which will pull all the moisture
from the cake.

531
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,440
Yeah. So it's very, very dry.

532
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,960
OK.

533
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,680
{\an8}They don't look wonderful,
do they? No.

534
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,000
They've fallen apart.
I cut it whilst it was still warm.

535
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,760
Oh. Started... Fatal.
Crumbling a bit.

536
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,520
The sponge is delicious
and the Swiss meringue is lovely.

537
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,760
Could've been sharper.

538
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,360
Could've had more raspberry
in there.

539
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,680
I don't think there's anything wrong
with the flavours.

540
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,240
It just looks a mess.

541
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,800
{\an8}They do look amazing.
I love the colour,

542
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,000
{\an8}I love the pot, I love the soil.
Ah, thanks.

543
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,440
Just hope inside tastes as good
as it looks.

544
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,160
I mean, that is really clever
to get all that in there.

545
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,720
The flavours are really punchy.

546
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,280
The red wine ganache works
beautifully well with the raspberry.

547
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,480
Oh. It's rich and indulgent.
Well done.

548
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,840
Thank you.

549
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,880
{\an8}At first glance, you think,
"Absolutely delightful."

550
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,320
If you look closely, there are
a few problems, aren't there?

551
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,560
They're a bit wibbly.

552
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,400
The tamarind works really well.

553
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,200
Coconut works beautifully well
with it.

554
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,040
Overall, it's a really nice cake.
And it's original.

555
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,480
Good. Well done. Thank you.
Yeah, nice one.

556
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,240
{\an8}Abdul, I think it looks
absolutely delicious.

557
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,680
Thank you. It's almost an illusion,
which I quite like.

558
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,360
It does look like a garden.

559
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,840
Hmm, it's very light.

560
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,600
Little kick of chilli,
you get a little acidity.

561
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,040
I think the raspberry in there
is a beautiful flavour.

562
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,600
I love the hazelnut as well. Yeah.
Thank you. I'm impressed.

563
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,560
Thank you, Abdul. Thank you, guys. Lovely.

564
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,120
Well done, that went well,
didn't it?

565
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,840
That went better than I thought,
actually! Well done. Thank you.

566
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,480
{\an8}They could be neater. Yes.

567
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,560
{\an8}Love the colours, though,
they're vibrant and in your face.

568
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,680
Hmm. Think the flavour's in there
that's coming from the pandan,

569
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,600
the caramel and
the coconut is delicious.

570
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,920
It's such an interesting thing

571
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,040
to do a set custard
on top of a cake.

572
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,920
Gooey and unctuous.
And not too sweet.

573
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,520
Yeah. OK, it's bomb time.

574
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,080
Um, can I nick a sugar bomb?
Yes, feel free.

575
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,880
It's amazing.

576
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,080
It's not too sweet, actually.
I was expecting it to be,

577
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,800
but you do get the burst of sugar.

578
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,200
Look at me, I'll have you two
out of a job here.

579
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,400
Thank you very much. Thank you.

580
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,640
I liked it.

581
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,640
I mean, that counts for nothing,
but I liked it.

582
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,640
{\an8}It looks like your caramel
was a bit runny.

583
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,720
{\an8}Did you mean the caramel
to run down the sides?

584
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,280
No, I spent ages trying to get
the caramel perfect

585
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,920
and then it went...

586
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,760
There's enough coffee in there
to keep you awake at night. Yeah!

587
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,080
Hmm.

588
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,560
The other flavours coming through

589
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,720
are not strong enough
to compete with it

590
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,200
and the ganache is too hard.

591
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,160
You're neat enough, I can see that.

592
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,080
Just be careful about your flavours.

593
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,720
{\an8}It's a bit... Yeah... messy.

594
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,320
My buttercream
didn't go to plan. Twice.

595
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,680
It's the curse of the tent.
The curse of the tent.

596
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,840
I feel the heart rate going now. Yeah.

597
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,400
Will, I think it's
a bit disappointing.

598
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,120
It's a bit bland.
There's ginger, but not enough.

599
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,880
There's a caramel undertone - but
it's got no hero in there... Yeah.

600
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,320
Which is what you need.

601
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,920
Besides that, brilliant.

602
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,040
Never mind, Will.

603
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,640
{\an8}That looks amazing.

604
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,560
{\an8}It's neat as a pin,
just has to taste good now.

605
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,600
Oh, it's lovely sponge.

606
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,360
Very light.

607
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,280
And boozy.

608
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,920
Yes. That's how I like them.

609
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,160
For me, that's perfect.
It is very boozy.

610
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,480
I think you've got too much booze.

611
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,600
That's the overwhelming flavour.

612
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,240
Texturally, it's perfect,
it really is.

613
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,280
He's got a problem here, hasn't he?
Cos I think the booze is perfect.

614
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,960
Well done.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

615
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,480
They're now stumbling back
to their... I know.

616
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,320
Out the tent.

617
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,080
I'm happy that it went well.

618
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,760
There was a lot of booze in my cake

619
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,040
because even when I'm eating it
I'm thinking, "Oh, that's strong."

620
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,560
They like it,
they like my onde-onde.

621
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,240
It is very nice when people
say your food is good.

622
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:19,120
It's interesting to have
a disaster in your first challenge.

623
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,440
Not my finest moment
I think it's fair to say.

624
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,760
Each week, the bakers will face
a mystery second challenge

625
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,160
veiled by gingham.

626
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,360
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

627
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,680
It's time for your first ever
Technical Challenge -

628
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,240
and your Technical Challenge today
has been set for you by baby Paul.

629
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,200
Aww. Sweet.
Paul, any words of advice?

630
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,960
It's a classic.
Concentrate on your sponge.

631
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,560
Well, as ever,
this task is judged blind

632
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,040
so we ask Paul and Prue
to leave the tent

633
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,480
where they are going to be
cryogenically frozen.

634
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,920
Wrap up warm, kids.

635
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,160
So, Paul would like you
to produce a red velvet cake.

636
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,240
Oh!

637
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,240
Your all-American layered cake

638
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,000
should make a big impression on both
the eyes and the palate.

639
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,600
I love impressions.
Matt's good at impressions. Mm.

640
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,480
In fact, he does an amazing Paul.
Go on do your Paul.

641
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,960
You're a good baker,
you're a good baker.

642
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You're a good baker, too. All right!

643
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,120
LAUGHTER

644
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,656
I mean, if you cover your eyes,
it's like he's back in the tent.

645
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,800
Uncanny.

646
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,000
Your classic cake

647
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,760
should consist of six tender, moist
crimson-red sponges

648
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,240
sandwiching a smooth, fluffy
cream-cheese icing.

649
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,760
Sprinkled with red crumbs
to give it that red-velvet finish.

650
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,160
You have two hours until we defrost
Paul and Prue.

651
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,320
On your marks...

652
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Get set.

653
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
Bake!

654
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,440
Obviously, my first challenge was
a disaster, so I'm stressed.

655
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,840
It's like anxiety!

656
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,480
In the Technical Challenge,
the bakers are all given

657
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,440
the same basic recipe.

658
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,600
So this is very sentimental.

659
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,160
This is the first cake I ever made.

660
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,080
I normally do a red velvet cake,
but that's the curse, innit?

661
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,200
You're like,
"Yeah, I know how to do that,"

662
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,560
and then, uh, this is the one day
you don't.

663
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,280
I've never made one before.

664
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,160
Paul, red velvet cake
for our first technical.

665
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,520
Why have you gone for that?

666
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,640
The advantage is
everybody'll know it.

667
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,480
It's quite a light chocolaty cake.

668
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,480
Hmm. With the use of vinegar
and buttermilk,

669
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,880
blended with bicarb,
there's your rising agent.

670
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,000
And, actually, there's the flavour.

671
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,240
It has a very distinctive tang
to it.

672
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,760
Obviously, there's colouring

673
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,040
to give it that beautiful vibrant
red inside.

674
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,200
Wow.

675
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,920
Now, we haven't told
the bakers how much food colouring.

676
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,040
Adding too much will make
the cake far too dark.

677
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,720
And the proportion of cream cheese

678
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,000
is much higher than you'd have
in most sponges.

679
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,800
Yeah. It's a big cake.

680
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,520
We want height, so the thickness of
cream cheese is critical.

681
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,600
It's lovely.

682
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,816
I can't wait to see what they're
going to turn out like.

683
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,520
What I'm not looking forward to
is trying 12 red velvet cakes.

684
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,600
You're going to have
to stretcher me out of there.

685
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,280
The first instruction is
"make the red velvet batter."

686
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,920
No hints as to how.

687
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,240
God. What do we do?

688
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,800
Luckily, I've got it all in here.

689
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,320
I'm mixing my butter and sugar.

690
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,120
It's creaming up -
that's what I want.

691
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,240
Now I'm going to add the eggs,
the buttermilk,

692
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,400
flour, cocoa and vinegar.

693
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,800
Why are you putting vinegar in it?
Like, what's that about?

694
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,920
Why would you ever put vinegar
in a cake?

695
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,120
It's a bit of a chemical reaction.
Think Diana Ross sang that.

696
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,120
Combining vinegar, buttermilk
and bicarbonate of soda

697
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,480
creates the bubbles crucial
to producing a light sponge...

698
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,520
I'll chuck in a bunch now.

699
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,320
But timing is everything.

700
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,120
You've got to add the bicarb
just before

701
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,680
you put it in the oven
cos it doesn't last very long.

702
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,720
I'm just going to wing it.
There's not really a method.

703
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,800
How red to make it is the question.

704
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,680
Crimson is the directive.

705
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,040
Crimson. What does crimson mean?
Does it mean, like, light red?

706
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,160
Hers is a bit redder
than yours - look.

707
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,760
You could add a bit more.
I mean, I don't ask me.

708
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,200
I've got no clue what I'm doing.
But then I'll blame you.

709
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,480
Paul won't care. You know that.
Right, come on, then, babies.

710
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,880
It just says "bake",
at your leisure.

711
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,520
However long you want.

712
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,200
Ah, sugar.

713
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,560
Those are being baked
for as long as it takes.

714
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,520
I think 25 minutes?

715
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,920
They're not very big, so I might
give them, like, 13 minutes

716
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,880
and then I'll see how
they're doing.

717
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,440
Dawn, what are you doing? Who knows?
Sort of clattering stuff.

718
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,240
It's an adventure.

719
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,600
I'm just flinging stuff.

720
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,560
You've made a red velvet
cake before.

721
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,720
I have, but not for about...
30 years. Whew!

722
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,800
When my kids were little.

723
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,080
You're going to have to go back
into the archives. Yeah.

724
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,720
Trouble is, I was probably under
the influence of alcohol.

725
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,840
NOEL LAUGHS

726
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,080
The red velvet cake.

727
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,840
It's very personal for me.

728
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,960
Before I left Malaysia, my friends,
we all sat down together,

729
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,040
the four of us,
having a very nice red velvet cake.

730
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,760
So I just made the last cake
that I had with my friends.

731
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,000
Without them, I will never discover
my hidden talent to bake.

732
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,640
Bakers, you are halfway through.
Whoa!

733
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,520
I don't want to put any pressure
on you guys,

734
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,640
but we're going to take
the best red velvet cake

735
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,440
and with the aid of
a sewing machine,

736
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,160
I'm going to turn it into skimpy
briefs for me and Matt.

737
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,440
HE CHUCKLES

738
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,000
I fail to see why that's funny.

739
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,800
Make the cream cheese frosting.

740
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,640
There's no recipe. Just making it.

741
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,120
Hmm. I'm just going to mix my cream
cheese and mascarpone together.

742
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,680
Then add the double cream
and then whip it.

743
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,200
It should be fluffy. Yeah.

744
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,520
But the bakers must whip
with caution. OK.

745
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,520
Overwhip, and their frosting
will become a runny mess.

746
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,120
How do you get this thick, man?
Because it's not going to settle.

747
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,040
Oh, boy. That is liquid.

748
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,560
It's got to be like this
where it can lift.

749
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,000
And it's made it gloss.

750
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,880
Yeah, this is, like, perfect,
cream cheese here.

751
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,440
Argh.

752
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,280
Take a little bit longer.

753
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,760
So it's a waiting game.

754
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,320
They're taking forever to bake.
They're taking so long.

755
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,160
Giving me anxiety just waiting.

756
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,320
Kevin, does it annoy you

757
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,520
that there's another
Scottish person here?

758
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,960
Cos it annoys me,
and I'm not even Scottish!

759
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,520
He is wearing a kilt and he kind of
out-Scottished me a bit.

760
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,000
He has out-scotched you, hasn't he?
Yeah, yeah.

761
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,600
Do you know him? I assume everyone
in Scotland knows each other.

762
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,240
We do come from the same county.
Do you?

763
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,960
We did actually have the same
saxophone and clarinet teacher.

764
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,080
There you go. Hi, Andy.

765
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,240
Hi, Andy, how are you doing?
Haven't they done well?

766
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,120
You've taught them so well,
they're baking cakes instead.

767
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,600
Oh, I don't know.

768
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,240
No. He ain't ready.

769
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,280
This cake isn't ready yet.

770
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,360
I'm worried if I open
the oven, they'll go...

771
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,560
Right, mine have to be done now.

772
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,040
Oh, someone's ready.

773
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,680
Oh, this is not good.
They've pure sunk.

774
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,080
Argh! Nightmare.

775
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,480
The cake just wasn't cooked
long enough.

776
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,720
The change of temperature from
the oven to the cold here.

777
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,400
I'm just going to have to go
with it.

778
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,120
Bakers, you have half an hour left!

779
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,480
Also, bakers, remember,

780
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,120
as hard as it is to make
a red velvet cake,

781
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,520
I've actually made
a red velvet coat.

782
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,920
Come on, then, babies.

783
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,280
My sponges are ready.

784
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,400
Smooth.

785
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,600
I'm very pleased.

786
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,960
Oh, yeah, I'm happy with that.
It's calmed down my nerves.

787
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,520
Maisam is slowly coming back.

788
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,760
That looks weird. I don't know
whether it's moist or undercooked.

789
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,960
Janusz, I was going to high five you

790
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,720
but I've seen your palms -
they're too red. Good luck.

791
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,480
"Slice each sponge in
half horizontally,

792
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,960
"remove the bowl of icing from
the fridge and put it together."

793
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,160
To achieve the height
the judges expect,

794
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,200
their frosting must be
the perfect consistency...

795
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,560
It's a bit liquidy, I think.

796
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,640
And generously applied.

797
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,440
I'm trying to make proper
even layers.

798
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,840
I just want to try to get
the height. Like, a proper big one.

799
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,040
"To decorate, neatly coat the cake."

800
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,920
I would rather do
something different.

801
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,360
I'm going for a semi-naked look,
definitely, for this one.

802
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,560
You know, you can go
for that distressed look.

803
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,440
"Sprinkle the leftover crumbs
around the bottom edge."

804
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,320
They're going to be fairly
scant crumbs.

805
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,560
"Pipe eight rosettes." Nearly there.

806
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,960
My icing is melting! Oh, man!
It'll be a blob, not a rosette.

807
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,680
Going mad with piping.
Try and just show off.

808
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,160
I want this presentation
to be, like...

809
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,960
you know, like, up there.

810
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,840
Bakers, you have one minute left.

811
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,920
Aah!

812
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,320
Crumbs, crumbs, crumbs! Ooh, blimey!

813
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,880
Please, please, please, please! Aah!

814
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,520
It is scary. Aah!

815
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,880
Focus.

816
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,320
Bakers, your time is up.

817
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,120
Ooh, this is not good.
It's not good. Breathe.

818
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,720
This is the height
that I want. Done!

819
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,960
Well, I can see that everyone

820
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,840
is going for a
completely different style.

821
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,800
You cannot tell at the moment
who has the right idea.

822
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,440
That distressed look is a decision
I may well regret.

823
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,960
{\an8}Oh! This is scaring me. Like,
Sandro's decoration's immaculate.

824
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,680
{\an8}It's really sunk.
Oh, I'm so annoyed.

825
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,880
{\an8}Bakers, please bring your

826
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,920
{\an8}velvet cakes down to the tablecloth,

827
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,680
{\an8}put them behind your photograph.

828
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,920
{\an8}The gingham altar of doom.

829
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,600
Oh, man! My icing is melting.
Oh! I don't know.

830
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,360
Do you know what
I'm really intrigued by?

831
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,760
The different heights.
Yeah, Syabira, yours is well tall.

832
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,360
Paul and Prue are expecting
12 tall red velvet cakes

833
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,440
coated in fluffy
cream cheese frosting

834
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,840
and decorated with
a sprinkling of crumbs.

835
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,680
They have no idea whose is whose.

836
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,000
Oh, God! OK, starting over here.

837
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,600
It is smooth,
but it's not that tall, is it?

838
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,440
Cuts nicely. Not much cream cheese
filling in there, is there?

839
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,600
Cream cheese should be almost equal
to the cake to keep that height.

840
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,640
Tastes good. It's soft
with a little bit of tartness.

841
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,920
Moving on to number two.
Piping's good.

842
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,600
But the crumb on the outside
is too thick.

843
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,720
The flavour's all right.
Certainly got the tang to it.

844
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,880
Right, over here.
This one's really attractive. Mm.

845
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,960
But I think the cake is... It's
a bit dense... slightly undercooked.

846
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,800
And I also think there's quite a lot
of red in this one. Yeah.

847
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,800
It's very red.
You asked for crimson.

848
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,920
It's the wrong shade of crimson,
Matt, all right? Back off.

849
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,680
LAUGHTER

850
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,440
OK, moving on.
Not much height to it.

851
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,080
No. Needs to be a bit higher.

852
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,640
And it's not very light.
It's solid.

853
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,440
That's a little bit claggy.
Feels slightly underdone.

854
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,240
Right. Now, this one's almost
a naked cake round the outside,

855
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,520
isn't it? Yes, it is.
Very little cream cheese.

856
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,040
But the sponge is nicely risen. Yeah.

857
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,720
The sponge is light and tangy.

858
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,880
So, we have this one.
It's quite original.

859
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,600
Decoration looks like a wedding hat.
I don't like that.

860
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,600
Cream cheese should have been put
in the layers.

861
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,880
It's probably lost quite a bit
of height through that.

862
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,160
The sponge is all right.

863
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,800
Mm. The sponge is all right.
It's just not what we wanted.

864
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,640
Right, this one over here.

865
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,440
It's lost its definition.
Rather flat rosettes.

866
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,360
But certainly got the tang to it.
Mm. Nice flavour.

867
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,640
OK, moving on.
Could be a bit straighter.

868
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,280
Yes, it's a bit on the lean.

869
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,040
But the sponge is all right.
You get that lightness. Mm.

870
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,480
This is a good cake.

871
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,760
This one's got much too much crumb
on the bottom. It has.

872
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,280
Decoration doesn't look great.

873
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,960
The sponge, it's actually
not that bad. I just think...

874
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,480
I'd like to have seen that
a little bit neater throughout.

875
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,680
Right, this one.

876
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Big layers of sponge.
The sponge is light.

877
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,720
But the rosettes sag
all over the place.

878
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,880
I do hope that's as good
on the inside

879
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,200
as it looks on the outside.

880
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,000
Height of the cake is good.
The definition is perfect.

881
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,560
This is what we were looking for
when it came to the crumb,

882
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,760
that light dusting.

883
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,960
It's got to be good inside.
This better be good inside.

884
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,240
Nice layers. There is
a lot of cream cheese there.

885
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,760
That is very nice. That's it.
Shall we go home now?

886
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,680
LAUGHTER

887
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,320
OK, moving on to this one.

888
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,880
A little bit too much on the crumb.
It's neat, though.

889
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,480
And I do like those sponges.
Mm. And got a nice zing.

890
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,800
Mm, absolutely.

891
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,480
NOEL: Paul and Prue will now rank

892
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,520
the red velvet cakes
from 12th to first place.

893
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,520
In 12th place, this one.

894
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,040
Who was that? James.

895
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,080
We didn't like the decoration much

896
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,880
and there's not quite enough cream
in the middle.

897
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,480
In 11th, we have Rebs.

898
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,360
Basically, very claggy.

899
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,760
In 10th place, this one.

900
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,080
Maxy. It was undercooked.

901
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,640
In ninth, we have this one.

902
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,360
Will, it's all over the place.
Fair enough.

903
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,040
Carole is eighth, Janusz seventh,

904
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,240
sixth - Abdul, Maisam fifth,

905
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,320
Kevin is fourth, and Dawn third.

906
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,120
We're getting close now.
In second place...

907
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,360
Who is this?

908
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,200
Sandro. Could be a tiny bit higher,
but it's a really good cake.

909
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,520
Thank you.
So, in first place, we have...

910
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,440
APPLAUSE

911
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,000
Syabira, that's fantastic.
Thank you.

912
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,080
My heart just melts.
SHE LAUGHS

913
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,120
Thank you so much. Nicely done.

914
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,920
Well done, Syabira.

915
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,920
If I'm upset, I'll cry.
If I'm happy, I'll cry!

916
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,880
I'm happy with second. Yeah.

917
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,400
Second is kind of first, innit?
HE LAUGHS

918
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,800
It wasn't the worst, but I know
I've got a lot to do tomorrow.

919
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,760
It was a disaster. Like,
I'm just lucky I wasn't 12th.

920
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,440
But there's still another bake.

921
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,840
I will pick myself back up

922
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,960
and make sure my cake's
flipping well-cooked this time.

923
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,720
{\an8}Just one challenge remains
before this year's

924
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,720
{\an8}first Star Baker is crowned

925
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,680
{\an8}and the first person
to leave the tent is revealed.

926
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,560
{\an8}So, what do we think
of these new bakers?

927
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
Overall, the standard's
been pretty good. Yeah.

928
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,120
But I think, a few people,
it got to them.

929
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,960
Rebs, Will is in trouble. Yeah.

930
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,760
Maisam. She had a tough signature,
didn't she? Yeah.

931
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,680
So, who's in line for Star Baker?
I think the likes of Abdul, Janusz.

932
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,960
You know who else? Sandro.
Sandro's amazing.

933
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,920
Sandro's technically tremendously
good. He's really calm, as well.

934
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,560
He's calming me down.
I'm not even in the competition.

935
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,040
And Syabira's incredible.

936
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,680
That Technical Challenge
was actually better than mine.

937
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,080
I mean, it's not that hard
to believe, is it? Unbelievable.

938
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,080
When's the last time you baked,
Paul? In the '70s? Last week.

939
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,440
What did you bake?
Blueberry muffins. Ooh, lovely.

940
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,200
Nice? Of course. As good
as Syabira's? I was like this.

941
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,520
"Well done."

942
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,680
THEY LAUGH

943
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,680
Hello, bakers. It's time for your
first ever Showstopper Challenge,

944
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,240
and today the judges would love you
to make a stunning 3D replica

945
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,520
of your own home
entirely out of cake.

946
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,720
Your Showstopper should look like
somewhere you have lived,

947
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,720
which has special meaning to you.

948
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,520
It needs to be so good

949
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,120
that Paul can live inside it
for a week.

950
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,320
He's basically having
his bathroom renovated.

951
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,440
He needs somewhere to crash. LAUGHTER

952
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,560
You have four hours.
On you marks... Get set... Bake!

953
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,200
Oh, it's so quiet in here. Concentration.

954
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,720
HE HUMS

955
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,640
Yesterday wasn't my day,
but today's going to be my day.

956
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,360
I want to just show them that I am
a better baker than claggy cake.

957
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,600
This is their first Showstopper
and it's a home bake -

958
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,040
a bake of their home.

959
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,840
It could be anything - a cottage,
a block of flats, a bungalow -

960
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,320
but I want detail. You know,
we want the pebbledashing,

961
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,040
we want the ivy
floating up the sides,

962
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,920
we want the window frames.
And, of course,

963
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,320
the most important thing
is that it's solid.

964
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,880
We don't want the roof blowing off.

965
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,880
We don't want
the walls falling down.

966
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,400
We want to see 12 fabulous homes
looking amazing

967
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,040
and tasting even better.

968
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,840
Morning, Dawn. Hello, Dawn.
Good morning. Morning. Good morning.

969
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,640
Tell us all about your home bake.

970
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,960
So, my home bake is my nan's house.
Did you live in it?

971
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,400
I was born in it, actually.
So was my mum.

972
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,240
It's a three-bed semi
and it's pebbledashed.

973
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,960
NOEL: Dawn will recreate
her nan's pebbledash from praline,

974
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,880
while, inside,
apricot puree and German buttercream

975
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,040
will be sandwiched between
layers of delicate genoise sponge.

976
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,640
So, it's 12 layers,
free-standing. Wow.

977
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,360
Interesting that
you're using genoise,

978
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,280
which is notoriously
quite a soft thing,

979
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,080
with 12 layers with heavy cake.

980
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,840
Yeah. Interesting. Good luck.
Thank you. Thank you.

981
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,600
Dawn's not the only baker
inspired by memories of their nan.

982
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,800
When we were younger,
we'd go there for Christmas.

983
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,920
There'd be, like, about 70 of us.

984
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,920
It was like
my best childhood memories.

985
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,080
Sandro will build
his grandparents' home

986
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,560
from strawberry sponge,

987
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,480
which he'll soak
in strawberry liqueur

988
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,120
for some extra Christmas spirit.

989
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,160
We used to leave, like,
our Christmas parties

990
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,560
with beanbags full of presents
when we were younger.

991
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,800
Now I can barely get socks.
HE LAUGHS

992
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,040
Just socks? Grandparents, if you're
listening to this... I know!

993
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,520
Presents get worse as you get older.
Yeah, they do get worse.

994
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,520
Socks! I can't afford socks -

995
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,920
is that what you're trying
to say to me?

996
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,200
And it seems
the festive cheer is spreading.

997
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,280
I'm using Polish ginger spices
and oranges in my chocolate cake

998
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,800
because what is the better time

999
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,560
to go and visit your mum
than Christmas?

1000
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,160
Janusz spent
many a happy Christmas in Poland,

1001
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,240
and it's his mum's flat
he'll recreate

1002
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,680
from rich chocolate sponge

1003
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,280
and spiced orange buttercream,

1004
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,440
colourfully decorated to bring
her garden balcony to life.

1005
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,520
It was a very sad block of flats,

1006
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,880
but I could always tell
where my mum is

1007
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,400
because it was the only balcony

1008
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,680
where you could
actually see flowers.

1009
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,000
So, this is the final cake mix.

1010
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,800
I couldn't actually get
a bowl big enough.

1011
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,880
I think it's a two-spoon job.

1012
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,680
Building a Showstopper this big...

1013
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,960
In total, there is 5kg of batter.
I mean, I'm making a house, right?

1014
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,560
Requires a sponge
that not only tastes great...

1015
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,160
I'm adding soy sauce
instead of salt.

1016
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,040
It makes a more rich, umami flavour.

1017
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,200
But is sturdy enough to support
the weight of their construction.

1018
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,200
Come on. This is a madeira cake,
which is a proper structural cake.

1019
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,040
I'm not particularly concerned
about the sponge.

1020
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,560
It's pretty stable.
It's a banana cake.

1021
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,800
It's my mum's recipe
that I've tweaked a little.

1022
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,840
With a roof and windows
built from biscuit,

1023
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,520
Kevin's childhood home will contain
fresh banana and maple buttercream

1024
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,440
between layers of his mum's
pecan-packed banana bread.

1025
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,080
I haven't chopped them too finely

1026
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,440
because I reckon that would actually
dry out the sponge,

1027
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,320
and I do like a bit of texture.

1028
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,840
I do like... Nice, big nuts.

1029
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,960
This is coffee and walnut.

1030
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,800
Who doesn't like coffee and walnut,

1031
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,400
unless you don't like coffee
or are allergic to nuts?

1032
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,960
I am making a replica
of my little bungalow.

1033
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,280
Carole will build
her beloved bungalow

1034
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,760
from another of
her favourite classic cake recipes,

1035
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,160
coffee and walnut.

1036
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,680
But instead of adding real coffee
to her buttercream

1037
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,360
and sponge, she's opted for
a retro replacement.

1038
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,000
It's chicory.

1039
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,080
It's when you couldn't get coffee,
I think.

1040
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,440
Maybe when the war was on.
I'm not sure.

1041
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,880
You can smell it, can't you?
That'll put hairs on your chest.

1042
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,320
OK, it's going in.

1043
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,960
With so much cake to bake...

1044
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,240
All done, and the sponges
are ready to go to the oven.

1045
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,160
The quicker their sponges
hit the heat... Off you go.

1046
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,480
The more time they'll have
to cool and cut them.

1047
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,280
I'm trying to make them
not too thick

1048
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,800
because then they cook quicker
and cool quicker.

1049
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,720
Any attempt to build their homes
from warm sponge

1050
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,440
will result in
a subsidence nightmare...

1051
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,520
I remembered to set the timer today.

1052
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,160
But Will's making life
doubly difficult for himself.

1053
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,600
I'm also making a chocolate cake.

1054
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,920
It's slightly drier, which I think
is good for the structure.

1055
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,160
After a disappointing first day,
Will's looking to impress

1056
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,560
by constructing his old
North London flat from two sponges -

1057
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,200
one chocolate and one orange -

1058
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,600
with architectural details
made from gingerbread.

1059
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,600
So, you've got gingerbread,
you've got sponge,

1060
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,960
you've got orange.

1061
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,840
A lot to do. Hopefully,
you get away with it in the time.

1062
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,720
Thank you, Will. I know! I know!

1063
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,240
Just a stone's throw away,
in South East London,

1064
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,160
is the flat where Maxy grew up.

1065
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,840
It's my mum's block
where I started baking.

1066
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,840
Flavours are inspired by
a family favourite,

1067
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,400
which is my mum's
apple and berry crumble.

1068
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,800
Maxy will spread her mum's famous
apple and berry compote,

1069
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,120
along with a crumble topping,
between layers of cinnamon sponge.

1070
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,720
Are you enjoying your time here?

1071
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,360
I am, but I just, you know,
get a bit stressed sometimes.

1072
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,120
Who are you scared of more -
Prue or Paul? Paul.

1073
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,080
He's got a tough exterior,
like a crusty roll.

1074
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,840
THEY LAUGH

1075
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,520
He's like a crusty bap,
but when you break him open,

1076
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,760
he's all soft inside. You see...

1077
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,080
And he's good, you know, with
a little bit of butter, toasted.

1078
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,000
So...

1079
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,400
This has gone weird,
hasn't it? This?

1080
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,840
No, this conversation.
The conversation!

1081
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,320
How are you looking, cakes?

1082
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,240
Just want to double-check
if it's cooked.

1083
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,200
Yeah. Shouldn't be too dry.

1084
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,440
So, I'm going to take
my small sponges out of the oven.

1085
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,520
They seem to be all ready.
Oh, I hope it's cooked. God!

1086
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,680
I don't want to overbake it.

1087
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,520
I just want it to be perfect.

1088
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,240
So, I'm going to let the sponges
cool for as long as I can.

1089
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,200
Oh, no! My oven wasn't on.
Oh, flipping hell!

1090
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,560
My oven wasn't on
for the past 40 minutes.

1091
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,120
If Abdul can bake
his sponges in time,

1092
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,600
he'll build his grandparents' home
in Pakistan

1093
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,200
with mango and saffron jam

1094
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,560
sandwiched between layers
of masala chai spiced sponge.

1095
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,000
Cooling time
and everything is now challenging

1096
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,640
because I've lost about 40 minutes.

1097
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,520
But keep going.
Keep going and trying, right?

1098
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,600
Syabira's also hoping
to tempt the judges with a cuppa.

1099
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,120
Milk tea is something we drink
all the time in Malaysia.

1100
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,280
And in a bid for top spot...

1101
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,720
Cushty.

1102
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,960
Her cake contains not just one
but two types of tea.

1103
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,360
Milk tea is the main flavour
that I want to bring in,

1104
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,560
and matcha complements milk tea.

1105
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,640
Filled with
strawberry and cinnamon jam

1106
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,960
and matcha buttercream,

1107
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,480
Syabira's milk tea sponges

1108
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,920
will form the childhood home

1109
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,200
and tropical garden

1110
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,960
she loved to play in growing up.

1111
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,960
Can't imagine where you live.
So, I live...

1112
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,640
Somewhere fantastical.

1113
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,640
No. In a shoe? A golden shoe?
I live in a village,

1114
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,520
a very small little house
with a coconut tree around it.

1115
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,120
Wow. So, we usually tried
to climb the coconut

1116
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,680
because we thought, if a monkey
could do it, we also could do it.

1117
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:15,080
THEY LAUGH
Yes, I can tell this is going to be

1118
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,160
my favourite chat
of the day already.

1119
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,000
In theory, this is done.

1120
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,680
As Will's final sponge
exits the oven...

1121
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,240
There we go. Ooh, boy!

1122
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,880
Closely followed by Abdul's...

1123
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,520
It's OK. It's OK.
It landed the right side up.

1124
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,360
Yes! Today is not my day, is it?

1125
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,800
Cold, cold, cold, cold.

1126
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,400
The rest of the bakers
are ready to begin building...

1127
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,280
They're cool enough
to start stacking.

1128
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,400
And, of course, the soak.

1129
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,240
I'm going to be
fairly generous with this.

1130
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,400
I want it to be perfection.

1131
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,480
This is strawberries and cream liqueur.

1132
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,120
I'm going to add all of it.
Grown-up cake.

1133
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,960
But Sandro's grown-up cake
won't be drinking alone.

1134
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,880
Plenty of coconut rum.

1135
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,840
Wow! That was hot.

1136
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,640
During lockdown, because obviously
we couldn't go anywhere,

1137
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,360
me and my parents, we just had,
like, a cocktail night,

1138
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,920
so this is one of the ones
that went down a treat,

1139
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,200
was a pina colada.

1140
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,600
Rebs plans to bring party vibes
to her house

1141
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,120
with flambeed pineapple rings
and rum buttercream

1142
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,440
sandwiched between layers
of a rum-soaked coconut sponge.

1143
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,960
It's really important
for me to get the sponge right today

1144
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,320
because I didn't cook
my sponge properly yesterday.

1145
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,320
Oh, my goodness! You're joking!

1146
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,240
My cake's not fully done.

1147
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,400
But Reb's party...
They're not fully cooked.

1148
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,440
Might be off.

1149
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,800
Erm, I don't know
what I'm going to do.

1150
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,920
Erm, I just need a minute to myself.

1151
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,160
I feel like I'm going to be sick.

1152
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,440
{\an8}You know it was your turn
to do the time call

1153
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,920
and then I just spoke over you?

1154
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,880
It was really out of order,
so I won't ever do that again.

1155
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,960
So, go on, you do the time call.
Really? Yeah.

1156
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,400
This is your time call, though.
No, no, no. This one's yours.

1157
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,600
You're giving me your time call?
I am. I love you.

1158
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,520
Bakers, you are halfway through!

1159
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,120
Sorry, I forgot. I forgot!

1160
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,360
I would like to be
carving cakes by now,

1161
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,560
but I've still got
gingerbread to make.

1162
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,720
I think I'm going
to struggle with time.

1163
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,920
And Will's not
the only one struggling.

1164
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,600
My sponge, they've just not really
fully cooked. I don't know why.

1165
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,440
But Rebs has a cunning plan
to get back on track.

1166
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,880
This one's OK.

1167
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,800
I'm just going to take a ring
of cake from here and put it in.

1168
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,520
Look, you'd never know. It's fine.
It's fine. I'm not going to panic.

1169
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,320
Why would I panic?
Panicking's for losers.

1170
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,680
Constructing now,
so we're layering up.

1171
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,480
This is going in now, my crumble.

1172
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,960
Everyone's just bashing stuff.

1173
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,840
Yeah, this wasn't even
part of the recipe.

1174
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,680
Who are you imagining that is -
Paul or Prue?

1175
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,560
Well, what one is it
the same colour as?

1176
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,600
It's Paul, isn't it? What is that?
It's butterscotch lattice.

1177
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,920
That's what he takes
to the tanning salon

1178
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,920
and goes,
"I want to look like this."

1179
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,000
Carole, look at this colour... Oh!
Without any food colouring.

1180
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,240
This is my childhood house
back home in Libya.

1181
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,600
Taking inspiration from
her favourite lemon tree growing up,

1182
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,400
Maisam will fill her lemon sponge
with blueberry jam

1183
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,880
and add colourful decoration

1184
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,280
to give the house
the finish Paul and Prue expect.

1185
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,520
But if I just speed up a little bit,

1186
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,920
then I can give them
that finesse that they want.

1187
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,440
Oh, no!
LAUGHTER

1188
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,520
Small explosion.

1189
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,240
James, too, has been inspired
by a childhood memory.

1190
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,840
My dad used to have a cottage
up in Loch Fyne.

1191
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,560
It's the first place
I remember getting terrified.

1192
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,800
We watched Dracula,
and while we were watching it,

1193
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,360
my dad wandered by
with an axe outside of the door.

1194
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,160
It was like a 4D experience.

1195
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,480
James's frightfully tasty cottage
will contain orange curd

1196
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,240
and orange blossom buttercream

1197
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,560
spread between six thick layers
of orange and cardamom sponge.

1198
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,600
It's oozing a tiny bit,
but surprisingly OK

1199
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,360
cos it is quite a lot
of weight on top.

1200
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,320
But we'll find out, I guess.

1201
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,840
Bakers, you have 30 minutes.

1202
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,080
Oh, BLEEP!

1203
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,480
Definitely behind.

1204
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,200
While Will and Abdul are still
constructing their homes...

1205
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,680
My plan is just to assemble this

1206
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,840
and then as much I can decor,
I'll try.

1207
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,280
For the rest of the bakers,

1208
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,400
it's a nail-biting race
to the finish.

1209
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,960
I'm trying to be neat.

1210
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,200
I was over-generous
with the fillings

1211
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,440
so I've skipped a layer.

1212
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,080
The only person
that will notice is Paul.

1213
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,680
I'm sure he'll count them all.

1214
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,480
This is sugar fondant.

1215
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,840
If only it was this easy
to brick a house.

1216
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,600
Roof under construction.

1217
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,600
My dad was a roofer, as well. Irony!

1218
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,680
What can I smell?

1219
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,760
Yeah, I smell burning.

1220
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,880
It's not me, is it?
HE GASPS

1221
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,160
A little bit overdone. Oh!

1222
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,960
I love a bit of pebbledashing. Pebbledash.

1223
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,160
I used to get told off
when I was a little girl cos...

1224
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,520
Picking the stones off? Yes.

1225
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,520
I feel like this is going to tap
into Paul's childhood, as well.

1226
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,800
I'm not sure Prue
will identify with pebbledash.

1227
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,176
She won't. She won't have a clue.
She won't know what it is.

1228
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,880
If you haven't got a maze around
your house, she won't understand.

1229
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,160
Or a moat! Got a gate.

1230
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,320
The brickwork around the cottage,

1231
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,520
I wanted to show the sort of
higgledy-piggledyness of it.

1232
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,360
Time is the limiting factor
right now.

1233
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,280
I'm going to have to leave out
a lot of things, I think.

1234
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,960
What are you going to do with that?

1235
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,400
I'll probably eat it later.
Will you? Yeah.

1236
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,520
And what are you going to do
with these?

1237
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,760
One of the main issues
is the misuse of disused tissues.

1238
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,040
Embarrassing!

1239
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,080
Bakers, you have five minutes left!

1240
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,440
The stress is real. Come on!

1241
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,840
I have to give Christmas now.
The more detail, the better.

1242
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,240
Nearly there.

1243
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,360
I'm piping clouds
out of Italian meringue.

1244
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,880
What is happening here?

1245
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,640
Agh, it looks terrible!

1246
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,320
Maxy, you're not on your own.
HE SIGHS

1247
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,360
Going to need another couple
of windows on it.

1248
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,720
My hands are shaking!

1249
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,840
Right, I can't stop, I can't stop.

1250
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,960
Wow! It's not what you think it is.
No. What is it?

1251
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,360
Coconut tree. Right.
So, I'm making the trunk...

1252
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,520
Oh, right. OK, yeah.

1253
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,600
I'm trying to use this barfi
to make sheep.

1254
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,160
I can't watch you do that. Sorry,
it brings back too many memories.

1255
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,400
SHE LAUGHS
I hope it's a good one.

1256
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,800
Bakers, you have one minute left!
Argh!

1257
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,200
This buttercream has split.

1258
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,840
They don't even look like squares.

1259
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,680
This is better
than the red velvet cake.

1260
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,240
It's a step in the right direction.
Just some shimmer.

1261
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,600
Bakers, your time is up!

1262
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,800
Please step away from your bakes.
I feel so mean.

1263
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,920
What kind of Showstopper is this?!

1264
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,720
It's not as I pictured it.

1265
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,720
That is so, so good.
It looks incredible.

1266
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,040
{\an8}It's not as neat as I'd like,

1267
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,600
{\an8}but it looks like my house,
which is a bonus.

1268
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,240
{\an8}I just don't want to go home.

1269
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,560
It's time to judge
the show stopping home bakes.

1270
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,480
Rebs, would you like to
bring your Showstopper up, please?

1271
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,280
It's heavy.

1272
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,640
One wee thing I need to get.

1273
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,880
I don't know if you've ever been
to Northern Ireland

1274
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,120
but it's constantly raining.

1275
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,560
You have to have a
bit of coconut rum rain.

1276
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,400
I like the idea of coconut rum rain. Nice.

1277
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,720
It does remind me of a very rural
cottage. It's very good.

1278
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,880
PRUE: The detail is lovely.

1279
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,080
PAUL: This is basically a pina
colada cake, isn't it?

1280
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,720
Yeah. Coconut and vanilla sponge,
pineapple curd,

1281
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,760
and flambeed pineapple slices
with coconut and rum butter cream.

1282
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,440
I love the flavour.

1283
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,920
PAUL: The pineapple comes through,
coconut comes through.

1284
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,040
It is over-baked, the sponge.
Not by much.

1285
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:55,680
Overall, A, it looks great, B, the
flavours came through beautifully.

1286
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,880
Well done.
Do you want me to take it away? Yes.

1287
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,440
Thank you. Quit while you're ahead.

1288
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,840
Thank you so much.

1289
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,400
Oh, I'm going to take your
tablecloth with me... Well done.

1290
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,240
Thank you. I'm going to cry.

1291
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,080
PRUE: What are the windows?

1292
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,240
Sugar cookie filled with butterscotch.

1293
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,600
Did you mean to burn them?

1294
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,000
I didn't mean to.

1295
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,200
The banana cake itself is delicious.

1296
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,280
My only thing is,
cut your pecans up more.

1297
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,680
They're too big.

1298
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,280
PRUE: It's a really good cake.
Well done.

1299
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,040
PRUE: It's beautifully neat.

1300
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,240
The piping is beautiful.
Look at that.

1301
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,400
PAUL: I love the pots
all around the outside.

1302
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,640
It's coffee and walnut
with coffee buttercream.

1303
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,040
It's quite powerful, that coffee.
It had a good glug.

1304
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:59,240
It's really powerful. I've never had
a coffee cake that strong before.

1305
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,840
The coffee is actually burning.
It's fascinating. Wow.

1306
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,160
You've blown Paul's mind!

1307
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,520
PRUE: Lots of skills
showing off here.

1308
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,480
You're obviously
very good at piping.

1309
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,600
Thank you.

1310
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,320
PAUL: So much buttercream!

1311
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,840
It's very claggy.

1312
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,480
PRUE: Especially that middle layer
which is really compressed.

1313
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,040
PAUL: I think it's the weight.

1314
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,080
There's so much
buttercream on there.

1315
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,880
The sponge just can't hold it.
It glues your mouth together,

1316
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,240
which at the moment might be a good
thing for you.

1317
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,240
But the flavours, fantastic.

1318
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,920
PRUE: You obviously ran out of time.

1319
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,680
The piping is a bit clumsy.
PAUL: Let's have a look.

1320
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,720
PRUE: Oh, wow.

1321
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,920
PAUL: I've never had
a crumble in a cake before.

1322
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,040
I think you've done
a really good job.

1323
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,800
The crumble with a compote is
fantastic. It works really well.

1324
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,480
PRUE: Well done.

1325
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,240
Thank you. I was so worried.

1326
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,880
Are you all right? Yes.

1327
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,280
PAUL: Boo!

1328
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,200
LAUGHTER

1329
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,280
PAUL: You've lost a lot
of the detail on the house. Yes.

1330
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,360
Did you run out of time?

1331
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,040
Unfortunately my oven wasn't hot
which meant my cakes were delayed.

1332
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:27,240
That basically pushed everything.
My sponge is masala chai.

1333
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,720
In between I have
mascarpone frosting and mango jam.

1334
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,160
The chai is delicious,
carries really well inside the cake.

1335
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,160
The bake is good as well.

1336
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,200
It is absolutely delicious.

1337
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,720
But I would have liked more mango.

1338
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,040
OK. I'd like to have seen more
detail. I think inside tastes great.

1339
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,240
PRUE: It looks absently charming.

1340
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,480
I love it. I like the pebble dash.

1341
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,400
It's gone a bit wonky, but I'm
thinking the house was wonky.

1342
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,440
Subsidence, terrible subsidence.

1343
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,440
PAUL: Wow.
PRUE: Look at that.

1344
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:07,200
It's genoise sponge with apricot,
praline and vanilla jam

1345
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,720
and buttercream inside.

1346
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:11,000
PRUE: How many layers?
It was supposed to be 12.

1347
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,321
I'm going to be really honest
and admit that there are 11.

1348
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,560
PRUE: It's really brave
to make genoise.

1349
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,640
It's so airy that it could get
squashed easily.

1350
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,440
But it hasn't squashed at all.

1351
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,360
PAUL: That is a fantastic cake.

1352
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,640
You've get texture coming from the
praline, the apricot is lovely

1353
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,560
and it's got a bit of tartness to
that, as well, which really works.

1354
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,880
The sponge is well baked.
Buttercream works well.

1355
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,320
PRUE: Well done.

1356
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,040
PRUE: I like the look of it.
I think it's charming.

1357
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,800
PAUL: The detail in there is lovely.

1358
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,880
This has a lot of interesting
flavours in this.

1359
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,520
It is milk tea sponge

1360
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:49,480
with strawberry jam
and matcha buttercream.

1361
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,960
PAUL: Cook's nice.

1362
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,920
I think your textures are beautiful.

1363
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,320
The baking element is perfect.
The sponges are delicious.

1364
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:04,320
My issue is,
there is no hero flavour.

1365
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,200
There are so many little things
going on in there,

1366
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,000
there's matcha, there's strawberry.

1367
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,040
The tea flavour is not
strong enough.

1368
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,520
Oh, my God.

1369
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,920
I recognise that block now!

1370
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,960
Really?
Yeah, we live near each other!

1371
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,400
That's brilliant.

1372
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,280
You've over-baked every one. Agh!

1373
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,600
I think the chocolate could have
been a bit more punchy.

1374
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,880
I love the orange.

1375
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,160
But it comes down
to the bake for me.

1376
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,680
PRUE: It's not perfectly decorated,
is it?

1377
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,440
It's a little bit clumsy.

1378
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,120
PAUL: Let's have a look, shall we?

1379
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,880
It's lemon, which is inspired
by the lemon trees in that house.

1380
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,760
It's quite dense.

1381
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,440
That doesn't take away the fact
that I actually love the flavour.

1382
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,080
PRUE: It is just a bit puddingy.

1383
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,360
If I had that in a bowl
with custard I'd be in heaven.

1384
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,960
But this is supposed to be cake!

1385
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,880
Yeah! I like the flavours.
Texture is all wrong.

1386
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,600
Bit simple on the decoration.

1387
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,760
Yes.

1388
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,760
PAUL: The decorations
look quite sweet

1389
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,840
but I expected that to be a lot more
detailed than it is.

1390
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,600
It's just a little bit simplistic.

1391
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,240
What you don't know is
his grandparents

1392
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,320
actually lived in a cake.

1393
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,960
So it's actually very accurate.

1394
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,920
Wow. Look at that.

1395
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,280
PRUE: There's lots
of strawberries and cream.

1396
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,960
Doesn't bowl me over, that.

1397
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,040
There's too much alcohol in there.

1398
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,920
Too much alcohol?

1399
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,440
PRUE: I thought I'd never hear me
say this, but he's right.

1400
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,880
Sponge is lovely and soft.

1401
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:50,240
But somehow if you put booze in a
filling, it's modified by the cake,

1402
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,240
but if it's in the cake
it's everywhere.

1403
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,240
I love it for the colour
and the vibrancy.

1404
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,320
PAUL: The decoration
and the pipework,

1405
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,640
you've done an amazing job.

1406
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,480
This looks beautiful,
this area here.

1407
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,000
I can see coming home to your mum's
flat must have been really good.

1408
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,080
It is chocolate cake.
It contains soy sauce.

1409
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,480
PRUE: For the umami, presumably.
That is correct.

1410
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,880
Inside, Christmas-inspired
buttercream.

1411
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,720
It is utterly delicious.

1412
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,960
Just the right amount of spice.

1413
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Very chocolaty.

1414
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,680
PAUL: The textures in the bakes all
the way through are delicious.

1415
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,760
PRUE: I can't fault it.
It's excellent. Thank you.

1416
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,960
Well done. It's a work of art.

1417
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,000
Janusz, well done!

1418
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,560
Yeah, that's amazing feedback.

1419
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,240
If I was named Star Baker,
that, in my heart,

1420
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,160
would actually be like winning
the competition for me.

1421
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,680
Because cake is my favourite.

1422
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,920
They said the cake looked lovely but
it doesn't have a punchy flavour.

1423
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,040
Yes, it's fair, I know
I made a boo-boo that way.

1424
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,680
Could have been worse.

1425
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,160
I still feel like I'm languishing
a little bit along the bottom.

1426
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,160
I am in danger. To be honest,

1427
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,440
I don't know whether I've done
enough to stay.

1428
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,080
I'm very happy. It went as well
as it possibly could have done.

1429
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:22,040
I just hope it's enough
to be not bottom any more.

1430
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,640
Prue and Paul have made
their decision.

1431
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,760
It's going to be OK.

1432
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,200
It is going to be OK. I hope so.

1433
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:38,520
I've got the great job this
week of announcing the Star Baker.

1434
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:42,920
And this week's Star Baker is...

1435
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,800
Janusz.

1436
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,920
APPLAUSE

1437
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,520
Well, if it was up to me,
I'd keep you all here

1438
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,040
and send one of the judges home.

1439
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:07,600
Sadly it isn't up to me and we do
have to say goodbye to one of you.

1440
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:11,480
Which feels very early. But the
person who is leaving us is...

1441
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Will.

1442
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,400
ALL: Aw!

1443
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,440
Well, guys, you go
and all knock it out of the park.

1444
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,760
Honestly, Will, you should
just feel proud of yourself.

1445
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,960
PAUL: Well done, Will.
Thank you.

1446
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,080
APPLAUSE Well done.

1447
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:39,520
You know, somebody's
got to go first, and...

1448
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,840
Obviously I'm disappointed
but I'm proud to have made it.

1449
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,600
Yeah, I'm all right.
I knew it was going to happen.

1450
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,160
I'm going to miss our conversations!

1451
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,320
You know, there's obviously
a lovely bunch of people I've met.

1452
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,360
I've got an experience that I can
definitely talk about and share.

1453
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,160
Yeah, I'm proud of that.

1454
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,640
PAUL: Bit better next week, please.

1455
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,240
I need to be a lot neater.
You do. A lot neater.

1456
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,920
Oh... I'm still here!

1457
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:06,000
I literally... I can't believe it.

1458
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,640
I was constantly hearing my name.

1459
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,520
Next week I really want to
impress the judges

1460
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,800
and also make myself proud as well.

1461
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,880
PAUL: Well done, Janusz.
You absolute rock star.

1462
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:22,120
Winning Star Baker on the cake week
means everything to me.

1463
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,320
Congratulations. Thank you.

1464
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,360
Are you crying?!

1465
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,600
I've cried so many times.

1466
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:32,200
Is he crying? Oh, babe! Babe!

1467
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,320
I think my boyfriend will be
really proud.

1468
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:37,800
He will say, "You can make cake
and I told you you can make cake."

1469
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,600
Aw! Well done. Well done.

1470
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,120
First Star Baker. Thank you.

1471
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,360
Hey, hun-bun.

1472
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,800
I just wanted to tell you that I
win Star Caker in the bake week.

1473
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,120
No! I win... No.

1474
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,960
LAUGHTER

1475
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,640
Next time...

1476
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,120
Goodbye... it's biscuit week.

1477
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,160
Say a little prayer.

1478
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,240
A Signature illusion... What could go
wrong with the macarons?

1479
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,280
Everything could go wrong
with the macarons.

1480
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:10,760
A classical Technical...
I don't know what that is.

1481
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,480
That creates a buzz in the tent...

1482
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,000
Scottish fly biscuits,
that's what my mum called them.

1483
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,240
Where's your gob?

1484
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,400
And the bakers face-off...

1485
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,240
as they make show stopping masks.

1486
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,400
GASPS

1487
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,040
Oh, I might cry. I might cry.

1488
