1
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,613
Mm, nice baps.

2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,093
They're bagels actually.

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,413
Can you not look at me like that?
I'm your sister.

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,013
Oh, yeah, sorry.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,253
Ooh! I feel Darth Baker is close by.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,773
What do you think Prue-bacca?

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,413
Rarrrrrrrrrr.

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,093
Yeah, you could be right, yeah.

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,600
WHEEZING BREATHS

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,373
I shouldn't have taken the stairs.
I'm knackered.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,813
Too many lemon drizzles, mate.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,120
LIGHTSABER CRACKLES

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,613
HE WHIMPERS

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,493
SIZZLING

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,653
Oh, you just burnt my pie!

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,813
It's fine. It's a
little on the dark side.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,253
BEEPING

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,493
Oh, I think my fruit sponge
is ready.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,773
Anyone?

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,960
No, I think you'll be eating
that flan solo.

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,773
ALL: Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,213
Noel, you look like Billie Eilish's
grandmother.

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,680
You look about four.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,800
When I came in, I could see
the edges of the tent.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,773
It's almost here!
I am just a few steps away.

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,333
I feel as though I've fallen down
a rabbit hole

27
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,880
and the Mad Hatter's going to come
running round the corner.

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,213
I cannot wait to walk into
that tent,

29
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,493
feel what it's like
to be one of those people.

30
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,560
I've never wanted to be in
a tent so bad before.

31
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,053
From across Britain, thousands of
the best home bakers applied...

32
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,173
Good luck.

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,573
..but just 12 have made it.

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,253
I've always wanted to apply

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,413
but I never had the courage
to actually do it.

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,693
This year, just thought I'd give it
a try, and I'm here.

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,613
I work in a supermarket behind
the checkouts.

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,173
This is the biggest thing
that I've ever done.

39
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,413
Things like this don't happen to me.

40
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,413
You just want to cry.

41
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,453
Because you cannot believe
this is real.

42
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,653
Over the next ten weeks...
It is going in.

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,133
..they'll face 30 brand-new
challenges...

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,213
Woohoo!

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,333
..designed to put every bit of their
baking ability to the test.

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,053
I've done baking for quite a while.

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,173
I feel maybe I'm, like,
sort of good at this.

48
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,653
We're about to find out how good,
aren't we? So maybe I'm terrible.

49
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,093
My partner said fake it
until you make it.

50
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,413
The stress is real.

51
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,200
And that's what I'm doing.

52
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,253
Everything they make will be judged
by Prue Leith...

53
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,333
It is utterly delicious.

54
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,333
..and Paul Hollywood.

55
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,293
I'm intrigued to see if Paul's eyes
are as blue

56
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,293
as people say in real life,
like a White Walker or something.

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,013
INTERVIEWER: They're bluer.
Are they?

58
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look into your soul.

59
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,733
They'll start with astounding
cakes...

60
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,093
Come on. Oh, my...

61
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,653
..a batch of scrumptious
signature sandwiches...

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,093
Oh, my God. It's gone all crumbly.

63
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,413
Aah...

64
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,813
..a classic American cake...
Yeah.

65
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,773
..that'll catch some red-handed...

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,373
I was going to high five you

67
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,013
but I've seen your palms. Good luck.

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,333
Right, can't stop, can't stop.

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,293
..and a show-stopping home bake...

70
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,933
Ooh, boy.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,413
It's OK, it's OK.

72
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,893
It landed the right side up.

73
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,933
Yes.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,813
..that'll expose any
shaky foundations.

75
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,973
I'm so worried.

76
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,173
You all right? Yeah.

77
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,573
Boo!

78
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,720
LAUGHTER

79
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,693
After two years away in Essex,
we've pitched our tent

80
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,093
back in the beautiful grounds
of Welford Park.

81
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,373
And our fresh crop
of bakers are about to face

82
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,293
three cake-based challenges

83
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,213
after which one of them will be
crowned Star Baker

84
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,773
and one will have to leave
the competition.

85
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,293
Hello, bakers, welcome to the tent.

86
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,853
And it's time for your first ever
Signature Challenge.

87
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,933
Today, the judges would love you
to make a batch

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,253
of 12 identical mini sandwich cakes.

89
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,973
Yeah, you know,
like Battenburg in a panini,

90
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,173
Vicky sponge on sourdough,
tea loaf in a tuna melt.

91
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,773
I think that would be
a cake sandwich.

92
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,333
They're looking for sandwich cakes.

93
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,693
Oh, good, cos they sounded rank.
They did sound rank.

94
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,173
The shape and flavours are entirely
up to you

95
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,973
and you can use any sponge you like.

96
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,653
You have one hour.

97
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,693
What?

98
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,933
Sandwiched between two half-hours.
Ah!

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,373
You have two hours. You've got
two hours. On your marks...

100
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,813
Get set...

101
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,653
Bake! Whoo.

102
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,213
Right...

103
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,813
Little bit stressed -
I'm not going to lie.

104
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,853
I just hope that today, it'll go OK.

105
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,533
Doesn't feel real yet.

106
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,853
Two hours - it's not a long time
to make 12 sandwich cakes.

107
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,293
I didn't feel great this morning.
Really nervous.

108
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,813
It's crazy, because you're just
making a cake

109
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,213
and it's something you do
all the time.

110
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,053
PRUE: Mini sandwich cakes.

111
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,053
This looks like quite
a simple challenge.

112
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,973
But what we're really looking for
is a bit of originality.

113
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,053
PAUL: They could choose
any sponge they want,

114
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,853
but we want it to be small,
packed with the flavour,

115
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,213
full of their personality.

116
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,293
It's the first time the bakers are
going to show us what they can bake.

117
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,853
So this is really important.

118
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,133
We want to see their skills.

119
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,493
They need to be
absolutely identical,

120
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,013
absolutely delicious,

121
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,360
the perfect sandwich cake
is what we want.

122
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,893
Morning, Rebs. Hello, Rebs. Morning.

123
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,413
Right, tell us all about
your mini sandwich cake.

124
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,373
I'm making hazelnut mocha latte
mini sandwich cakes

125
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,053
because I used to work as a barista

126
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,493
and it's the drink my now boyfriend

127
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,173
used to come and order all the time
when he was trying to chat me up.

128
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,173
So you're approaching this like
a barista? In a way, yeah.

129
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,373
These two are going to be
absolutely pumped.

130
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,493
The amount of coffee that's
going in it, hopefully.

131
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,653
Rebs, from County Antrim
in Northern Ireland

132
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,013
has been baking since she was three.
Come on.

133
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,733
Studying for a Masters in Business,

134
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,253
when she's not buried under books,

135
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,013
she's getting muddy with dogs Miley,
Ruby and troublesome Tiggy.

136
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,373
Oh, Tiggy.

137
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,693
To bring the hazelnut flavour
to her coffee cakes,

138
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,253
she'll add chopped nuts

139
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,973
to both her caramel filling
and highly caffeinated sponge.

140
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,733
Have you practised this? Yeah.

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,133
And what did your friends
think of it?

142
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,373
Everyone has different tastes,
I'll say that.

143
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,413
LAUGHTER

144
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,853
You can get friends anywhere, don't
worry about that. Yeah, exactly.

145
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,373
This is a massive whisk.

146
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,853
Rebs isn't the only baker
adding a kick to their cake.

147
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,933
Chilli powder is there -
not to bring in the chilli -

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,213
but helps bring in the flavours of
the chocolate even further.

149
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,653
A keen dancer, software engineer
Abdul likes to lindy hop

150
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,213
with girlfriend Christine.

151
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,453
Hello!

152
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,053
Born in Saudi Arabia
but now living in London,

153
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,853
he's not seen his family
for over three years.

154
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,213
Technical difficulties.

155
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,173
Containing raspberry jam
and mascarpone

156
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,733
between layers of chocolate
and hazelnut sponge,

157
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,893
Abdul's sandwich cakes are dedicated
to former friends.

158
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,613
I'm a huge lover of plants.

159
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,373
I have tons of them in my house.

160
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,093
I've killed a lot, unfortunately.

161
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,373
I'm trying to make these cakes
to pay tribute to those.

162
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,693
You're my favourite botanical
serial killer.

163
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,733
PRUE: You always hurt
the ones you love. Come on, Abdul.

164
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,933
Thank you.

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,773
I call this the bite-size of love.

166
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,413
Sandro's bakes also come from
the heart.

167
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,853
When I first met my partner,
every time we saw each other,

168
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,653
I always gave a white rose.

169
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,533
So I'm making, like,
chocolate flowerpots.

170
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,413
When Sandro, a fitness fanatic from
East London, isn't hitting the gym,

171
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,173
he works as a full-time nanny.

172
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,453
# I am the champion... #

173
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,373
He'll fill his flowerpots with
a chocolate and orange sponge

174
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,173
and a rich red wine ganache

175
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,053
from which delicate sugar roses
will grow.

176
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,533
Are you a gym guy? Um...

177
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,213
I mean, you look like you are.
Twice a day. Once is not enough?

178
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,613
I'll do... No, cos I'll do, like,
kind of weights, isn't it?

179
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,040
And then I'll do cardio.
Same. Can you tell?

180
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,053
I do weights in a graveyard.
The old bones. Urgh. Oh, don't.

181
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,360
Yeah, forget cardio.
I haven't got a heart.

182
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,333
And it seems love is in the air.

183
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,653
These are mini Persian love cakes.

184
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,333
We've got a large Persian community
in our church

185
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,653
so it's a tribute to their faith
and their friendship.

186
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,613
Kevin lives in Lanarkshire,
Scotland, with his wife, Rachel,

187
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,053
and their dog, Judy.

188
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,533
A talented musician, he not only
plays the clarinet,

189
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,013
flute and saxophone professionally -
but he teaches, too.

190
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,293
Nice one.

191
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,653
Kevin's love cakes are full
of Persian flavour

192
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,293
with rose Swiss meringue buttercream

193
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,453
sandwiched between layers
of pistachio,

194
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,293
almond and cardamom sponge.

195
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,733
The sponge is going to have
blitzed pistachio nuts,

196
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,773
but I'm not
going to blitz them right down.

197
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,320
I still want there to be a bit of
texture and a bit of crunch.

198
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,173
I'm using 120g of pistachios.

199
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,893
Maisam's also chosen to go all-out
with her nutty sponge.

200
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,813
I want to get as much flavour

201
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,293
and texture in the cake
as possible.

202
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,533
Born in Libya,
this year's youngest baker,

203
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,813
18-year-old design student Maisam

204
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,893
lives in Manchester with her
parents,

205
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,893
two brothers and younger
sister, Juri.

206
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,773
I'm going to copy your drawing.
What?!

207
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,293
To help balance the sweetness
of her pistachio-packed sponge,

208
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,813
Maisam will fill her sandwich cakes
with raspberry jam

209
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,893
and raspberry Swiss
meringue buttercream.

210
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,773
In the practice, it went really well

211
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,093
so I'm hoping that it'll turn out
well this time.

212
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,453
You're the baby here,
did you realise that?

213
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,933
Yes, I'm the youngest one,
so pressure is on.

214
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,493
Key to creating delicious
mini sandwich cakes...

215
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,213
Heavy on the coffee. Whoo!

216
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,533
..the judges will expect beautifully
flavoured soft sponge.

217
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,973
It's the blue-eyed one
that scares me.

218
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,613
He's just super intense.

219
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,573
It's like he's looking through
my soul.

220
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,613
So disapproving.
He looks at you like, "Aah!"

221
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,133
Oh, I nearly forgot
to put my eggs in!

222
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,973
Oh, my goodness!
It's like something's missing here.

223
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,253
Swedish-born Maxy,

224
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,213
an architectural assistant
from South East London,

225
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,333
is passing on her passion for baking

226
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,413
to daughters Tara and Talia.

227
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,693
That's enough now.

228
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,613
She's giving her
Eton mess-inspired cakes

229
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,173
a tropical twist with mango
and passion fruit coulis

230
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,613
and mascarpone between layers
of vanilla sponge.

231
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,813
You're from Sweden
but I can't hear the accent.

232
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,933
I've lived here for 21 years.
It's been a long time.

233
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,853
You speak Swedish as well?
I do speak Swedish, yeah.

234
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,133
Are you? I'm semi-bilingual.
Oh, are you? Hmm.

235
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,213
What languages do you speak?
Well, English.

236
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,173
English and...?

237
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,413
Well, no, I'm semi-bilingual.
Semi, oh, semi. Oh, yeah.

238
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,013
Next time I've got a joke,
I'll put it in writing

239
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,773
and send it to you in advance,
all right? Oh...!

240
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,413
Looks good, it is going in.

241
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,693
The quicker the sponges hit
the oven,

242
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,893
the longer they'll have to cool.

243
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,733
11 minutes at 180.

244
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,213
Is there a timer on this thing?

245
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,653
If the bakers attempt to cut

246
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,453
and fill their layers of sponge
while still warm,

247
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,413
they'll be left with
a crumbly, leaking mess.

248
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,653
Oh, crap. I forgot to switch it on!

249
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,853
It's all right, it's not done yet.

250
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,760
I can tell by visual clues,
ie, it's not brown.

251
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,613
Will is a charity director
who lives in London with wife Alison

252
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,373
and their three children,
Max, Verity and Louie.

253
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,693
That's going well, Louie.
It's quite crumbly.

254
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,973
To cut through the sweetness of his
salty caramel swirled buttercream

255
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,973
and in a bid to stand out
from the crowd,

256
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,573
Will's cakes contain no less than
three different types of ginger.

257
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,613
Who do you think's good in here?
Who are you scared of?

258
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,933
Uh, everybody.

259
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,733
I feel like the first one, you're
just finding your feet, aren't you?

260
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,653
New equipment,
Paul leering down on you.

261
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,293
It's not usually what happens,
is it, when you're at home baking?

262
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,373
No, normally,
normally just stood at home.

263
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,173
You haven't got
a sort of tipsy posh woman

264
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,093
and a bronze man staring at you.

265
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,200
You don't know where I live,
do you?

266
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,733
All right, guys, I know you're
new here, so, basically,

267
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,413
the way things work in this tent,

268
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,733
if you want to know
how long you've got left,

269
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,053
you have to give us each a fiver.
LAUGHTER.

270
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,333
Oh, well, it was worth a try.
You've got an hour left.

271
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,973
An hour?! Is that good or bad?

272
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,133
It's bad for me.

273
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,013
I'm not feeling confident about
my meringues

274
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,933
cos these have to go in for an hour.

275
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,053
Oh, that's the timer for my cakes.

276
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,973
Oh, they have risen very well.
More than I thought.

277
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,293
The difference between perfectly
baked moist sponge...

278
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,613
Oh, it's done.
..and a dry, dense disaster...

279
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,893
Oh, my...

280
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,773
..can be a matter of moments.

281
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,013
It should be cooked.
You get the absolute fear.

282
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,733
These are sticky toffee
pudding sponges.

283
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,693
Bit alarmed that one edge has sunk,

284
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,133
don't know how that happened,
but I think it's OK.

285
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,053
It's like the famous last words,
isn't it?

286
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,813
Originally from Glasgow,

287
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,333
James, a nuclear scientist, has been
baking since he was five years old.

288
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,053
It's a passion matched only by his
love of '80s horror films.

289
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,333
That's incredible.

290
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,773
He'll add warmth to his sticky
toffee apple sandwich cakes

291
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,173
with ginger in his apple jam
and nutmeg in his buttercream.

292
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,573
Explain the colour of
the kilt, then, is it family?

293
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,653
So it's actually the kilt I wore
for my graduation.

294
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,173
Pants or no pants?

295
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,320
Um, that's for you to find out,
isn't it?

296
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,413
PRUE: That's an invitation.

297
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,573
While their sponges cool...

298
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,013
I have a wee apple jam going.

299
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,453
..the bakers turn their attention
to fillings.

300
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,893
This is hazelnut caramel.

301
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,493
But I'm a wee bit concerned,
cos it's a bit runny.

302
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,213
I probably put too much butter in.

303
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,973
I'm making Italian
meringue buttercream.

304
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,613
The technically complicated version
of buttercream.

305
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,093
But Will's not the only one

306
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,653
trying to impress with his
ambitious icing.

307
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,093
Struggling to cut this butter.

308
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,013
The buttercream's flavoured
with rose.

309
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,533
I know that rose can be
a really overpowering flavour.

310
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,533
So it's just a whisper.

311
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,653
Woohoo!

312
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,773
While Will, Maisam and Kevin attempt
to sweeten up the judges...

313
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,213
Nice.

314
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,573
# Dozy doats and dozy doats
And liddle lamzy divey... #

315
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,173
..Carole's gone sour.

316
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,733
Just making my lemon curd.

317
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,973
I don't put that much sugar in
cos I want it nice and tart.

318
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,613
West Country born and bred,

319
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,333
Carole, a supermarket cashier,

320
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,733
lives in Dorset
with husband Michael.

321
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,853
A keen gardener,

322
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,653
she's affectionately
known as Compost Carole.

323
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,093
Get a nice bit of root.

324
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,693
As well as her curd filling,
she'll add lemon juice

325
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,813
to her buttercream

326
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,293
and zest to her
lemon and poppy seed sponge.

327
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,253
I'm a little bit of a classic baker,

328
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,853
your carrot cakes
and your lemon drizzles.

329
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,013
I'm not a big one for putting exotic
ingredients in, you know?

330
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,853
But somewhere exotic is exactly
where Dawn's heading.

331
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,533
I'm doing lime and tamarind
spring cake.

332
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,533
Tamarind - it's a slightly
earthy flavour,

333
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,933
but it's fruity at the same time

334
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,893
and this bake, it's
fairly traditional,

335
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,333
but it's got a bit of a twist.

336
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,173
Dawn, a former project manager
for Boris Johnson,

337
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,613
lives in Bedfordshire where she
entertains granddaughter Emmy

338
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,933
with her hand-modelled
sugar figurines.

339
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,133
Mr Froggington.
Do you like him? Yes!

340
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,453
To complement her tamarind jelly
filling, she'll add coconut

341
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,573
to her sponge and create
a coconut marzipan topping.

342
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,213
You worked for Boris Johnson?
Not directly.

343
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,973
Did you get to meet him? Yeah.

344
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,693
His hair was a bit like yours.
I know.

345
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,933
Wasn't it? Yeah.

346
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,573
And his face was a bit like mine.

347
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,973
Yeah, there you go -
we're like a hybrid.

348
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,573
How about that? Put us together
and you have Boris Johnson.

349
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,173
How about that? Yeah.

350
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,573
Dawn isn't the only baker bringing
a taste of the tropics.

351
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,933
I am making Malaysian cake

352
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,253
which is based on
the pandan flavouring.

353
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,853
It is very aromatic,
people call it Asian vanilla.

354
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,013
Malaysian-born Syabira
lives in London

355
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,493
where she works in
cardiovascular research.

356
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,773
Comms check.

357
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,933
After a hard day in the lab,

358
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,773
she likes to relax gaming online
with boyfriend Bradley.

359
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,373
It's, oh, a head shot.
Oh, I got head-shotted.

360
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,093
Syabira will flavour her sponge
and coconut custard with pandan

361
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,933
and add caramel
to both her mousse and decorations,

362
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,813
traditional Malaysian sweets known
as onde-onde.

363
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,973
I'm going to make a caramel bomb.

364
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,413
When you bite into it,
the caramel just bursts out.

365
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,333
Going to explode. You're going
to blow the judges' heads off.

366
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,013
I love this. Good luck. This
sounds amazing. Good luck, Syabira.

367
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,453
Thank you. Thank you.

368
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,293
Anyone who tries to bomb these two
is amazing in my book.

369
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,853
But Syabira's caramel bombs
aren't the only bake

370
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,453
that should probably come with
a safety warning.

371
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,093
I'm soaking my sponges
with Polish cherry liqueur.

372
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,413
What I'm making today will be

373
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,173
a Polish-inspired bake
which is wuzetka.

374
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,973
Janusz is a PA from Brighton

375
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,653
where he lives with boyfriend Simon
and sausage dog Nigel.

376
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,773
He learned many of his Polish
recipes from mum Elizia

377
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,720
who taught him and his sister
to bake.

378
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,773
Filled with pistachio cream
and cherries,

379
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,373
he'll top his boozy wuzetka

380
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,733
with a layer of
rich chocolate ganache.

381
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,733
It's like a Polish Black Forest.

382
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,613
PRUE: Is that cherries
soaked in booze?

383
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,893
Nice. Thinking of you.

384
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,693
Thank you.
You've done your homework.

385
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,773
I am glad to hear that.

386
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,413
NOEL: This sounds absolutely
delicious. This is my kind of bake.

387
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,493
PRUE AND NOEL: Good luck.

388
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,093
I want to do the time call. It's my
turn. No, it's my turn to do it.

389
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,093
Let me do the time call.
I'm doing the time call.

390
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,213
All right, fine,
you do the time call.

391
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,413
Thanks. Bakers, you have half
an hour left.

392
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,453
Ooh.

393
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,853
The sponge is done,

394
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,493
but my Italian meringue's split

395
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,253
for reasons I don't understand
so I'm going to make it again.

396
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,133
But Italian meringue buttercream
takes half an hour,

397
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,653
so it's slightly worrying.

398
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,893
I'm about to start cutting out
the cakes.

399
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,613
No matter whether they've baked
large trays of sponge...

400
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,093
I'm just going to make
small circles.

401
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,573
..or individual portions,

402
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,373
the judges will expect every
slice of the bakers' sandwich cakes

403
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,213
to be uniform and neat.

404
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,653
The tops will be cut off.
They all will be even size.

405
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,173
Uh, ruler.

406
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,613
I mean, most people wouldn't care.

407
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,160
But the judges aren't most people.

408
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,573
The perfect slices...

409
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,493
It's very soft cake
so I need to be careful.

410
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,133
..require a cool sponge.

411
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,573
Oh, it's gone all crumbly.

412
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,640
I think I cut them whilst they were
still a bit warm.

413
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,973
Oh...!

414
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,453
Now they're going to need plenty
of cherry vodka.

415
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,813
I've got my big guns here.

416
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,253
Drizzle some more pandan
flavourings.

417
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,493
Oh, my God!

418
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,133
Hopefully, with the help of
buttercream, I'll manage to hide it.

419
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,013
But there's a flaw in
Maisam's plan.

420
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,293
The buttercream has curdled.

421
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,720
Yeah. It'll...
It'll take some time to fix it.

422
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,853
How long have we got left?

423
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,733
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

424
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,933
Ah.

425
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,493
15 minutes, oh, my gosh,
I'm going to start assembling.

426
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,693
We'll make it, we have to.

427
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,213
Ah, this caramel's starting to melt.

428
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,613
At home I wouldn't care if
the caramel was over the edge

429
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,773
and now you're like, "Aah!"

430
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,693
Now custard.

431
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,253
This is red wine ganache.
Proper strong.

432
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,920
Finally seeing some Swiss
meringue buttercream.

433
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,733
While Maisam's filling comes
together at last...

434
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,973
That was a nightmare.
A nightmare, pulled it off.

435
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,573
It's done it again.

436
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,973
..for the second time...

437
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,213
BLEEP

438
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,653
..Will's has split.

439
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,093
Agh. I need to make a buttercream.

440
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,013
How do I make a buttercream?
Butter, sugar.

441
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,240
Yeah. Yeah.

442
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,293
Decoration time. Making bees.
Fiddly little buggers.

443
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,733
So I'm just making the caramel
for the wee candles.

444
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,133
You're a nuclear scientist,
is that right?

445
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,053
Yeah. This is a bit of a come-down
for you, isn't it? I mean...

446
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,133
Haven't you got more important
things to be doing?

447
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,253
Making cakes is vastly
more exciting.

448
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,320
These are cocoa nibs.
It's the soil.

449
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,653
Hello, petal. Hello, hello.
I was talking to the flower.

450
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,493
Oh. I thought you were talking
to me.

451
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,573
Oh.

452
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,133
Bakers, you have five minutes left.
Tight, tight, tight.

453
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,013
I've got to get going,
I've got to get going.

454
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,333
Got to decorate the top.
Add my fruits on.

455
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,653
Terrified that I won't
get this done on time.

456
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,933
It's looking rubbish.

457
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,853
Think, William.
Calm yourself down, mate.

458
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,813
I feel like
I shouldn't be this calm.

459
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,173
I just wonder what's gone wrong.

460
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,093
Argh! I'm just very carefully trying
to put the coconut topping on.

461
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,173
I kind of wish the buttercream
was a tiny bit better.

462
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,733
Oh, this is not good.

463
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,653
They're just sliding.
What a frigging nightmare.

464
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,093
Finishing touches.

465
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,613
Flavour-wise, should be good,

466
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,773
but look-wise,
100% not happy with it.

467
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,813
It's not perfect,

468
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,573
but I hope they will like it.
I don't know.

469
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,973
These look amazing. This is your
Persian business, right?

470
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,413
Yes. Have you been to Persia?
Uh, no. Maybe one day.

471
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,853
We'll go together. Yeah? Yeah.

472
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,893
Are you free on the 14th?
14th of what?

473
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,733
I've got to go,
I've got to do a time call. Goodbye.

474
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,453
OK. Bakers, you have
one minute left.

475
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,853
Argh!

476
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,533
Oh, my God.

477
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,533
60 seconds, kids. You can do this.

478
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,133
I'm going to try as many cactus
as possible.

479
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,373
A very rushed nutmeg job.

480
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,840
I'm just trying
to do whatever I can do right now.

481
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,360
Don't collapse!

482
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,893
Bakers... No!

483
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,973
Your time is up!

484
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,173
Oh!

485
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,693
Please step away from your mini
sandwich cakes.

486
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,453
Well done, well done. High ten.

487
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,173
That was a good high ten, as well.

488
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,413
There's Margaret, there's Minnie,
there's Maureen.

489
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,293
Carole, they're so cute. Yes!

490
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,973
Look at these.

491
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,533
Janusz, those are so neat.

492
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,800
It's rubbish. Oh... Boo-hoo!

493
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,533
For the very first time,
our 12 new bakers

494
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,853
and their mini sandwich cakes
are about to face

495
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,013
the judgment of Paul and Prue.

496
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,893
Hello, Maxy. Hiya.

497
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,813
In your world,
mini is a curious thing.

498
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,920
That's huge!

499
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,653
Let's have a look at
these monsters.

500
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,333
You've got it all over your fingers.
I can't take him anywhere.

501
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,093
Do you know, I've got "mess" in
the title, so...

502
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,480
Yeah, exactly.

503
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,053
The cake's quite dry.
Is it dry?

504
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,813
Um, you probably could've done
with slightly less bake on that.

505
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,013
Yeah. However, there's nothing wrong

506
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,053
with passion fruit sponge
and a meringue.

507
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,093
The combination of flavours
is beautiful. Well done.

508
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,293
Yeah, well done. Thank you.
Thank you.

509
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,613
Well done. Thank you.

510
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,453
Oh, my goodness.

511
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,760
Well done.

512
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,093
The pipework - that's just like
a blob. What is that?

513
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,293
Who knows, at this point?!

514
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,680
See what the taste is like.

515
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,373
Hmm, beautiful.

516
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,093
Absolutely sticky toffee pudding,
but better because it's got ginger.

517
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,053
So we've figured out you can bake.

518
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,200
But you need to concentrate on some
of the detail.

519
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,573
I think they look great.
Love the decoration on the top.

520
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,760
So cute. And I love the colours.

521
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,893
They're absolutely classic flavours.
Nicely balanced.

522
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,493
Yeah, there's enough lemon in there

523
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,413
cos you're getting it through
the curd as well

524
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,813
which is nice and sharp. Yeah.

525
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,720
What's not to like? Thank you.

526
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,040
They look very good.
Pretty consistent.

527
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,653
The rose is perfect. OK.

528
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,093
The cake itself is a bit heavy.

529
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,413
You've got too much in there,

530
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,653
which will pull all the moisture
from the cake.

531
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,413
Yeah. So it's very, very dry.

532
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,960
OK.

533
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,653
They don't look wonderful,
do they? No.

534
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,973
They've fallen apart.
I cut it whilst it was still warm.

535
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,760
Oh. Started... Fatal.
..crumbling a bit.

536
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,493
The sponge is delicious
and the Swiss meringue is lovely.

537
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,733
Could've been sharper.

538
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,333
Could've had more raspberry
in there.

539
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,653
I don't think there's anything wrong
with the flavours.

540
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,240
It just looks a mess.

541
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,773
They do look amazing.
I love the colour,

542
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,973
I love the pot, I love the soil.
Ah, thanks.

543
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,413
Just hope inside tastes as good
as it looks.

544
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,160
I mean, that is really clever
to get all that in there.

545
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,693
The flavours are really punchy.

546
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,253
The red wine ganache works
beautifully well with the raspberry.

547
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,453
Oh. It's rich and indulgent.
Well done.

548
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,840
Thank you.

549
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,853
At first glance, you think,
"Absolutely delightful."

550
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,293
If you look closely, there are
a few problems, aren't there?

551
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,560
They're a bit wibbly.

552
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,373
The tamarind works really well.

553
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,173
Coconut works beautifully well
with it.

554
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,013
Overall, it's a really nice cake.
And it's original.

555
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,480
Good. Well done. Thank you.
Yeah, nice one.

556
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,213
Abdul, I think it looks
absolutely delicious.

557
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,653
Thank you. It's almost an illusion,
which I quite like.

558
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,360
It does look like a garden.

559
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,813
Hmm, it's very light.

560
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,573
Little kick of chilli,
you get a little acidity.

561
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,013
I think the raspberry in there
is a beautiful flavour.

562
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,573
I love the hazelnut as well. Yeah.
Thank you. I'm impressed.

563
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,533
Thank you, Abdul. Thank you, guys.
Lovely.

564
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,093
Well done, that went well,
didn't it?

565
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,840
That went better than I thought,
actually! Well done. Thank you.

566
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,453
They could be neater. Yes.

567
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,560
Love the colours, though,
they're vibrant and in your face.

568
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,653
Hmm. Think the flavour's in there
that's coming from the pandan,

569
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,573
the caramel and
the coconut is delicious.

570
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,893
It's such an interesting thing

571
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,013
to do a set custard
on top of a cake.

572
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,893
Gooey and unctuous.
And not too sweet.

573
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,493
Yeah. OK, it's bomb time.

574
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,053
Um, can I nick a sugar bomb?
Yes, feel free.

575
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,853
It's amazing.

576
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,053
It's not too sweet, actually.
I was expecting it to be,

577
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,773
but you do get the burst of sugar.

578
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,173
Look at me, I'll have you two
out of a job here.

579
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,373
Thank you very much. Thank you.

580
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,613
I liked it.

581
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,640
I mean, that counts for nothing,
but I liked it.

582
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,613
It looks like your caramel
was a bit runny.

583
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,693
Did you mean the caramel
to run down the sides?

584
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,253
No, I spent ages trying to get
the caramel perfect

585
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,920
and then it went...

586
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,760
There's enough coffee in there
to keep you awake at night. Yeah!

587
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,053
Hmm.

588
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,533
The other flavours coming through

589
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,693
are not strong enough
to compete with it

590
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,173
and the ganache is too hard.

591
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,133
You're neat enough, I can see that.

592
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,080
Just be careful about your flavours.

593
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,693
It's a bit... Yeah... messy.

594
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,293
My buttercream
didn't go to plan. Twice.

595
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,653
It's the curse of the tent.
The curse of the tent.

596
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,840
I feel the heart rate going now.
Yeah.

597
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,400
Will, I think it's
a bit disappointing.

598
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,093
It's a bit bland.
There's ginger, but not enough.

599
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,853
There's a caramel undertone - but
it's got no hero in there... Yeah.

600
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,293
..which is what you need.

601
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,920
Besides that, brilliant.

602
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,040
Never mind, Will.

603
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,613
That looks amazing.

604
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,560
It's neat as a pin,
just has to taste good now.

605
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,573
Oh, it's lovely sponge.

606
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,360
Very light.

607
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,253
And boozy.

608
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,893
Yes. That's how I like them.

609
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,133
For me, that's perfect.
It is very boozy.

610
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,453
I think you've got too much booze.

611
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,573
That's the overwhelming flavour.

612
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,213
Texturally, it's perfect,
it really is.

613
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,280
He's got a problem here, hasn't he?
Cos I think the booze is perfect.

614
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,933
Well done.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

615
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,453
They're now stumbling back
to their... I know.

616
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,293
Out the tent.

617
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,053
I'm happy that it went well.

618
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,733
There was a lot of booze in my cake

619
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,013
because even when I'm eating it
I'm thinking, "Oh, that's strong."

620
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,533
They like it,
they like my onde-onde.

621
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,213
It is very nice when people
say your food is good.

622
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:19,093
It's interesting to have
a disaster in your first challenge.

623
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,440
Not my finest moment
I think it's fair to say.

624
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,733
Each week, the bakers will face
a mystery second challenge

625
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,133
veiled by gingham.

626
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,333
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

627
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,653
It's time for your first ever
Technical Challenge -

628
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,213
and your Technical Challenge today
has been set for you by baby Paul.

629
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,173
Aww. Sweet.
Paul, any words of advice?

630
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,933
It's a classic.
Concentrate on your sponge.

631
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,533
Well, as ever,
this task is judged blind

632
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,013
so we ask Paul and Prue
to leave the tent

633
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,453
where they are going to be
cryogenically frozen.

634
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,920
Wrap up warm, kids.

635
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,133
So, Paul would like you
to produce a red velvet cake.

636
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,213
Oh!

637
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,213
Your all-American layered cake

638
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,973
should make a big impression on both
the eyes and the palate.

639
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,573
I love impressions.
Matt's good at impressions. Mm.

640
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,453
In fact, he does an amazing Paul.
Go on do your Paul.

641
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,933
You're a good baker,
you're a good baker.

642
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,973
You're a good baker, too. All right!

643
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,093
LAUGHTER

644
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,613
I mean, if you cover your eyes,
it's like he's back in the tent.

645
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,773
Uncanny.

646
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,973
Your classic cake

647
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,733
should consist of six tender, moist
crimson-red sponges

648
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,213
sandwiching a smooth, fluffy
cream-cheese icing.

649
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,733
Sprinkled with red crumbs
to give it that red-velvet finish.

650
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,133
You have two hours until we defrost
Paul and Prue.

651
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,293
On your marks...

652
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,333
Get set.

653
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
Bake!

654
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,413
Obviously, my first challenge was
a disaster, so I'm stressed.

655
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,813
It's like anxiety!

656
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,453
In the Technical Challenge,
the bakers are all given

657
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,413
the same basic recipe.

658
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,573
So this is very sentimental.

659
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,133
This is the first cake I ever made.

660
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,053
I normally do a red velvet cake,
but that's the curse, innit?

661
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,173
You're like,
"Yeah, I know how to do that,"

662
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,533
and then, uh, this is the one day
you don't.

663
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,280
I've never made one before.

664
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,133
Paul, red velvet cake
for our first technical.

665
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,493
Why have you gone for that?

666
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,613
The advantage is
everybody'll know it.

667
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,453
It's quite a light chocolaty cake.

668
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,453
Hmm. With the use of vinegar
and buttermilk,

669
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,853
blended with bicarb,
there's your rising agent.

670
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,973
And, actually, there's the flavour.

671
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,213
It has a very distinctive tang
to it.

672
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,733
Obviously, there's colouring

673
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,013
to give it that beautiful vibrant
red inside.

674
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,173
Wow.

675
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,893
Now, we haven't told
the bakers how much food colouring.

676
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,013
Adding too much will make
the cake far too dark.

677
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,693
And the proportion of cream cheese

678
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,973
is much higher than you'd have
in most sponges.

679
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,773
Yeah. It's a big cake.

680
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,493
We want height, so the thickness of
cream cheese is critical.

681
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,573
It's lovely.

682
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,773
I can't wait to see what they're
going to turn out like.

683
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,493
What I'm not looking forward to
is trying 12 red velvet cakes.

684
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,573
You're going to have
to stretcher me out of there.

685
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,253
The first instruction is
"make the red velvet batter."

686
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,893
No hints as to how.

687
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,213
God. What do we do?

688
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,773
Luckily, I've got it all in here.

689
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,293
I'm mixing my butter and sugar.

690
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,093
It's creaming up -
that's what I want.

691
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,213
Now I'm going to add the eggs,
the buttermilk,

692
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,373
flour, cocoa and vinegar.

693
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,773
Why are you putting vinegar in it?
Like, what's that about?

694
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,893
Why would you ever put vinegar
in a cake?

695
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,093
It's a bit of a chemical reaction.
Think Diana Ross sang that.

696
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,093
Combining vinegar, buttermilk
and bicarbonate of soda

697
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,453
creates the bubbles crucial
to producing a light sponge...

698
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,493
I'll chuck in a bunch now.

699
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,293
..but timing is everything.

700
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,093
You've got to add the bicarb
just before

701
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,653
you put it in the oven
cos it doesn't last very long.

702
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,693
I'm just going to wing it.
There's not really a method.

703
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,773
How red to make it is the question.

704
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,653
Crimson is the directive.

705
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,013
Crimson. What does crimson mean?
Does it mean, like, light red?

706
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,133
Hers is a bit redder
than yours - look.

707
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,733
You could add a bit more.
I mean, I don't ask me.

708
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,173
I've got no clue what I'm doing.
But then I'll blame you.

709
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,453
Paul won't care. You know that.
Right, come on, then, babies.

710
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,853
It just says "bake",
at your leisure.

711
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,493
However long you want.

712
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,173
Ah, sugar.

713
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,533
Those are being baked
for as long as it takes.

714
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,493
I think 25 minutes?

715
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,893
They're not very big, so I might
give them, like, 13 minutes

716
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,853
and then I'll see how
they're doing.

717
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,413
Dawn, what are you doing? Who knows?
Sort of clattering stuff.

718
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,213
It's an adventure.

719
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,573
I'm just flinging stuff.

720
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,533
You've made a red velvet
cake before.

721
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,693
I have, but not for about...
30 years. Whew!

722
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,773
When my kids were little.

723
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,053
You're going to have to go back
into the archives. Yeah.

724
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,693
Trouble is, I was probably under
the influence of alcohol.

725
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,813
NOEL LAUGHS

726
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,053
The red velvet cake.

727
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,813
It's very personal for me.

728
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,933
Before I left Malaysia, my friends,
we all sat down together,

729
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,013
the four of us,
having a very nice red velvet cake.

730
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,733
So I just made the last cake
that I had with my friends.

731
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,000
Without them, I will never discover
my hidden talent to bake.

732
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,613
Bakers, you are halfway through.
Whoa!

733
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,493
I don't want to put any pressure
on you guys,

734
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,613
but we're going to take
the best red velvet cake

735
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,413
and with the aid of
a sewing machine,

736
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,133
I'm going to turn it into skimpy
briefs for me and Matt.

737
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,413
HE CHUCKLES

738
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,973
I fail to see why that's funny.

739
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,773
Make the cream cheese frosting.

740
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,613
There's no recipe. Just making it.

741
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,093
Hmm. I'm just going to mix my cream
cheese and mascarpone together.

742
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,653
Then add the double cream
and then whip it.

743
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,173
It should be fluffy. Yeah.

744
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,493
But the bakers must whip
with caution. OK.

745
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,493
Overwhip, and their frosting
will become a runny mess.

746
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,093
How do you get this thick, man?
Because it's not going to settle.

747
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,013
Oh, boy. That is liquid.

748
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,533
It's got to be like this
where it can lift.

749
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,973
And it's made it gloss.

750
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,853
Yeah, this is, like, perfect,
cream cheese here.

751
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,413
Argh.

752
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,253
Take a little bit longer.

753
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,733
So it's a waiting game.

754
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,293
They're taking forever to bake.
They're taking so long.

755
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,133
Giving me anxiety just waiting.

756
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,293
Kevin, does it annoy you

757
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,493
that there's another
Scottish person here?

758
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,933
Cos it annoys me,
and I'm not even Scottish!

759
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,493
He is wearing a kilt and he kind of
out-Scottished me a bit.

760
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,973
He has out-scotched you, hasn't he?
Yeah, yeah.

761
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,573
Do you know him? I assume everyone
in Scotland knows each other.

762
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,213
We do come from the same county.
Do you?

763
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,933
We did actually have the same
saxophone and clarinet teacher.

764
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,053
There you go. Hi, Andy.

765
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,213
Hi, Andy, how are you doing?
Haven't they done well?

766
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,120
You've taught them so well,
they're baking cakes instead.

767
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,573
Oh, I don't know.

768
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,240
No. He ain't ready.

769
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,253
This cake isn't ready yet.

770
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,360
I'm worried if I open
the oven, they'll go...

771
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,533
Right, mine have to be done now.

772
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,040
Oh, someone's ready.

773
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,653
Oh, this is not good.
They've pure sunk.

774
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,053
Argh! Nightmare.

775
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,453
The cake just wasn't cooked
long enough.

776
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,693
The change of temperature from
the oven to the cold here.

777
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,373
I'm just going to have to go
with it.

778
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,093
Bakers, you have half an hour left!

779
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,453
Also, bakers, remember,

780
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,093
as hard as it is to make
a red velvet cake,

781
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,493
I've actually made
a red velvet coat.

782
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,893
Come on, then, babies.

783
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,253
My sponges are ready.

784
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,373
Smooth.

785
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,600
I'm very pleased.

786
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,933
Oh, yeah, I'm happy with that.
It's calmed down my nerves.

787
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,520
Maisam is slowly coming back.

788
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,733
That looks weird. I don't know
whether it's moist or undercooked.

789
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,933
Janusz, I was going to high five you

790
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,693
but I've seen your palms -
they're too red. Good luck.

791
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,453
"Slice each sponge in
half horizontally,

792
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,933
"remove the bowl of icing from
the fridge and put it together."

793
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,133
To achieve the height
the judges expect,

794
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,173
their frosting must be
the perfect consistency...

795
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,533
It's a bit liquidy, I think.

796
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,613
..and generously applied.

797
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,413
I'm trying to make proper
even layers.

798
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,813
I just want to try to get
the height. Like, a proper big one.

799
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,013
"To decorate, neatly coat the cake."

800
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,893
I would rather do
something different.

801
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,333
I'm going for a semi-naked look,
definitely, for this one.

802
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,533
You know, you can go
for that distressed look.

803
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,413
"Sprinkle the leftover crumbs
around the bottom edge."

804
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,293
They're going to be fairly
scant crumbs.

805
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,533
"Pipe eight rosettes." Nearly there.

806
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,960
My icing is melting! Oh, man!
It'll be a blob, not a rosette.

807
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,653
Going mad with piping.
Try and just show off.

808
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,133
I want this presentation
to be, like...

809
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,933
..you know, like, up there.

810
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,813
Bakers, you have one minute left.

811
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,893
Aah!

812
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,293
Crumbs, crumbs, crumbs! Ooh, blimey!

813
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,853
Please, please, please, please! Aah!

814
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,493
It is scary. Aah!

815
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,853
Focus.

816
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,293
Bakers, your time is up.

817
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,093
Ooh, this is not good.
It's not good. Breathe.

818
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,693
This is the height
that I want. Done!

819
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,933
Well, I can see that everyone

820
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,813
is going for a
completely different style.

821
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,773
You cannot tell at the moment
who has the right idea.

822
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,413
That distressed look is a decision
I may well regret.

823
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,933
Oh! This is scaring me. Like,
Sandro's decoration's immaculate.

824
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,680
It's really sunk.
Oh, I'm so annoyed.

825
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,853
Bakers, please bring your

826
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,893
velvet cakes down to the tablecloth,

827
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,653
put them behind your photograph.

828
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,893
The gingham altar of doom.

829
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,600
Oh, man! My icing is melting.
Oh! I don't know.

830
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,333
Do you know what
I'm really intrigued by?

831
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,733
The different heights.
Yeah, Syabira, yours is well tall.

832
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,333
Paul and Prue are expecting
12 tall red velvet cakes

833
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,413
coated in fluffy
cream cheese frosting

834
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,840
and decorated with
a sprinkling of crumbs.

835
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,653
They have no idea whose is whose.

836
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,000
Oh, God! OK, starting over here.

837
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,600
It is smooth,
but it's not that tall, is it?

838
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,413
Cuts nicely. Not much cream cheese
filling in there, is there?

839
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,600
Cream cheese should be almost equal
to the cake to keep that height.

840
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,613
Tastes good. It's soft
with a little bit of tartness.

841
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,893
Moving on to number two.
Piping's good.

842
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,600
But the crumb on the outside
is too thick.

843
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,693
The flavour's all right.
Certainly got the tang to it.

844
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,880
Right, over here.
This one's really attractive. Mm.

845
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,933
But I think the cake is... It's
a bit dense... slightly undercooked.

846
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,773
And I also think there's quite a lot
of red in this one. Yeah.

847
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,800
It's very red.
You asked for crimson.

848
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,893
It's the wrong shade of crimson,
Matt, all right? Back off.

849
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,653
LAUGHTER

850
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,413
OK, moving on.
Not much height to it.

851
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,080
No. Needs to be a bit higher.

852
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,640
And it's not very light.
It's solid.

853
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,413
That's a little bit claggy.
Feels slightly underdone.

854
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,213
Right. Now, this one's almost
a naked cake round the outside,

855
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,493
isn't it? Yes, it is.
Very little cream cheese.

856
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,040
But the sponge is nicely risen.
Yeah.

857
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,693
The sponge is light and tangy.

858
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,853
So, we have this one.
It's quite original.

859
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,573
Decoration looks like a wedding hat.
I don't like that.

860
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,573
Cream cheese should have been put
in the layers.

861
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,853
It's probably lost quite a bit
of height through that.

862
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,133
The sponge is all right.

863
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,773
Mm. The sponge is all right.
It's just not what we wanted.

864
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,613
Right, this one over here.

865
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,440
It's lost its definition.
Rather flat rosettes.

866
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,333
But certainly got the tang to it.
Mm. Nice flavour.

867
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,613
OK, moving on.
Could be a bit straighter.

868
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,253
Yes, it's a bit on the lean.

869
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,013
But the sponge is all right.
You get that lightness. Mm.

870
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,453
This is a good cake.

871
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,733
This one's got much too much crumb
on the bottom. It has.

872
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,280
Decoration doesn't look great.

873
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,933
The sponge, it's actually
not that bad. I just think...

874
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,453
I'd like to have seen that
a little bit neater throughout.

875
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,653
Right, this one.

876
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Big layers of sponge.
The sponge is light.

877
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,693
But the rosettes sag
all over the place.

878
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,853
I do hope that's as good
on the inside

879
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,173
as it looks on the outside.

880
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,973
Height of the cake is good.
The definition is perfect.

881
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,533
This is what we were looking for
when it came to the crumb,

882
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,733
that light dusting.

883
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,960
It's got to be good inside.
This better be good inside.

884
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,240
Nice layers. There is
a lot of cream cheese there.

885
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,733
That is very nice. That's it.
Shall we go home now?

886
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,680
LAUGHTER

887
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,293
OK, moving on to this one.

888
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,880
A little bit too much on the crumb.
It's neat, though.

889
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,453
And I do like those sponges.
Mm. And got a nice zing.

890
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,773
Mm, absolutely.

891
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,453
NOEL: Paul and Prue will now rank

892
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,493
the red velvet cakes
from 12th to first place.

893
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,493
In 12th place, this one.

894
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,013
Who was that? James.

895
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,053
We didn't like the decoration much

896
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,853
and there's not quite enough cream
in the middle.

897
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,453
In 11th, we have Rebs.

898
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,333
Basically, very claggy.

899
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,733
In 10th place, this one.

900
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,053
Maxy. It was undercooked.

901
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,613
In ninth, we have this one.

902
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,333
Will, it's all over the place.
Fair enough.

903
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,013
Carole is eighth, Janusz seventh,

904
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,213
sixth - Abdul, Maisam fifth,

905
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,293
Kevin is fourth, and Dawn third.

906
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,120
We're getting close now.
In second place...

907
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,360
Who is this?

908
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,173
Sandro. Could be a tiny bit higher,
but it's a really good cake.

909
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,493
Thank you.
So, in first place, we have...

910
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,413
APPLAUSE

911
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,000
Syabira, that's fantastic.
Thank you.

912
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,053
My heart just melts.
SHE LAUGHS.

913
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,093
Thank you so much. Nicely done.

914
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,920
Well done, Syabira.

915
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,893
If I'm upset, I'll cry.
If I'm happy, I'll cry!

916
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,853
I'm happy with second. Yeah.

917
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,373
Second is kind of first, innit?
HE LAUGHS.

918
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,773
It wasn't the worst, but I know
I've got a lot to do tomorrow.

919
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,733
It was a disaster. Like,
I'm just lucky I wasn't 12th.

920
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,413
But there's still another bake.

921
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,813
I will pick myself back up

922
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,960
and make sure my cake's
flipping well-cooked this time.

923
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,693
Just one challenge remains
before this year's

924
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,693
first Star Baker is crowned

925
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,653
and the first person
to leave the tent is revealed.

926
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,533
So, what do we think
of these new bakers?

927
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,573
Overall, the standard's
been pretty good. Yeah.

928
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,093
But I think, a few people,
it got to them.

929
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,933
Rebs, Will is in trouble. Yeah.

930
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,733
Maisam. She had a tough signature,
didn't she? Yeah.

931
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,653
So, who's in line for Star Baker?
I think the likes of Abdul, Janusz.

932
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,933
You know who else? Sandro.
Sandro's amazing.

933
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,893
Sandro's technically tremendously
good. He's really calm, as well.

934
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,533
He's calming me down.
I'm not even in the competition.

935
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,013
And Syabira's incredible.

936
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,653
That Technical Challenge
was actually better than mine.

937
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,053
I mean, it's not that hard
to believe, is it? Unbelievable.

938
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,053
When's the last time you baked,
Paul? In the '70s? Last week.

939
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,413
What did you bake?
Blueberry muffins. Ooh, lovely.

940
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,173
Nice? Of course. As good
as Syabira's? I was like this.

941
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,493
"Well done."

942
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,680
THEY LAUGH

943
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,653
Hello, bakers. It's time for your
first ever Showstopper Challenge,

944
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,213
and today the judges would love you
to make a stunning 3D replica

945
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,493
of your own home
entirely out of cake.

946
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,693
Your Showstopper should look like
somewhere you have lived,

947
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,693
which has special meaning to you.

948
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,493
It needs to be so good

949
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,093
that Paul can live inside it
for a week.

950
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,293
He's basically having
his bathroom renovated.

951
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,413
He needs somewhere to crash.
LAUGHTER.

952
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,560
You have four hours.
On you marks... Get set... Bake!

953
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,173
Oh, it's so quiet in here.
Concentration.

954
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,693
HE HUMS

955
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,613
Yesterday wasn't my day,
but today's going to be my day.

956
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,360
I want to just show them that I am
a better baker than claggy cake.

957
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,573
This is their first Showstopper
and it's a home bake -

958
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,013
a bake of their home.

959
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,813
It could be anything - a cottage,
a block of flats, a bungalow -

960
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,293
but I want detail. You know,
we want the pebbledashing,

961
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,013
we want the ivy
floating up the sides,

962
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,893
we want the window frames.
And, of course,

963
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,293
the most important thing
is that it's solid.

964
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,853
We don't want the roof blowing off.

965
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,853
We don't want
the walls falling down.

966
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,373
We want to see 12 fabulous homes
looking amazing

967
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,040
and tasting even better.

968
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,813
Morning, Dawn. Hello, Dawn.
Good morning. Morning. Good morning.

969
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,613
Tell us all about your home bake.

970
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,933
So, my home bake is my nan's house.
Did you live in it?

971
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,373
I was born in it, actually.
So was my mum.

972
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,213
It's a three-bed semi
and it's pebbledashed.

973
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,933
NOEL: Dawn will recreate
her nan's pebbledash from praline,

974
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,853
while, inside,
apricot puree and German buttercream

975
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,013
will be sandwiched between
layers of delicate genoise sponge.

976
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,613
So, it's 12 layers,
free-standing. Wow.

977
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,333
Interesting that
you're using genoise,

978
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,253
which is notoriously
quite a soft thing,

979
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,053
with 12 layers with heavy cake.

980
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,813
Yeah. Interesting. Good luck.
Thank you. Thank you.

981
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,573
Dawn's not the only baker
inspired by memories of their nan.

982
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,773
When we were younger,
we'd go there for Christmas.

983
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,893
There'd be, like, about 70 of us.

984
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,893
It was like
my best childhood memories.

985
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,053
Sandro will build
his grandparents' home

986
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,533
from strawberry sponge,

987
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,453
which he'll soak
in strawberry liqueur

988
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,093
for some extra Christmas spirit.

989
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,133
We used to leave, like,
our Christmas parties

990
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,533
with beanbags full of presents
when we were younger.

991
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,773
Now I can barely get socks.
HE LAUGHS.

992
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,013
Just socks? Grandparents, if you're
listening to this... I know!

993
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,493
Presents get worse as you get older.
Yeah, they do get worse.

994
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,493
Socks! I can't afford socks -

995
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,893
is that what you're trying
to say to me?

996
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,173
And it seems
the festive cheer is spreading.

997
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,253
I'm using Polish ginger spices
and oranges in my chocolate cake

998
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,773
because what is the better time

999
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,533
to go and visit your mum
than Christmas?

1000
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,133
Janusz spent
many a happy Christmas in Poland,

1001
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,213
and it's his mum's flat
he'll recreate

1002
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,653
from rich chocolate sponge

1003
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,253
and spiced orange buttercream,

1004
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,413
colourfully decorated to bring
her garden balcony to life.

1005
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,493
It was a very sad block of flats,

1006
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,853
but I could always tell
where my mum is

1007
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,373
because it was the only balcony

1008
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,653
where you could
actually see flowers.

1009
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,973
So, this is the final cake mix.

1010
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,773
I couldn't actually get
a bowl big enough.

1011
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,853
I think it's a two-spoon job.

1012
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,653
Building a Showstopper this big...

1013
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,933
In total, there is 5kg of batter.
I mean, I'm making a house, right?

1014
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,533
..requires a sponge
that not only tastes great...

1015
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,133
I'm adding soy sauce
instead of salt.

1016
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,013
It makes a more rich, umami flavour.

1017
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,173
..but is sturdy enough to support
the weight of their construction.

1018
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,173
Come on. This is a madeira cake,
which is a proper structural cake.

1019
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,013
I'm not particularly concerned
about the sponge.

1020
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,533
It's pretty stable.
It's a banana cake.

1021
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,773
It's my mum's recipe
that I've tweaked a little.

1022
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,813
With a roof and windows
built from biscuit,

1023
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,493
Kevin's childhood home will contain
fresh banana and maple buttercream

1024
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,413
between layers of his mum's
pecan-packed banana bread.

1025
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,053
I haven't chopped them too finely

1026
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,413
because I reckon that would actually
dry out the sponge,

1027
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,293
and I do like a bit of texture.

1028
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,813
I do like... Nice, big nuts.

1029
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,933
This is coffee and walnut.

1030
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,773
Who doesn't like coffee and walnut,

1031
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,373
unless you don't like coffee
or are allergic to nuts?

1032
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,933
I am making a replica
of my little bungalow.

1033
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,253
Carole will build
her beloved bungalow

1034
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,733
from another of
her favourite classic cake recipes,

1035
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,133
coffee and walnut.

1036
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,653
But instead of adding real coffee
to her buttercream

1037
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,333
and sponge, she's opted for
a retro replacement.

1038
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,973
It's chicory.

1039
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,053
It's when you couldn't get coffee,
I think.

1040
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,413
Maybe when the war was on.
I'm not sure.

1041
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,853
You can smell it, can't you?
That'll put hairs on your chest.

1042
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,293
OK, it's going in.

1043
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,933
With so much cake to bake...

1044
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,213
All done, and the sponges
are ready to go to the oven.

1045
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,133
..the quicker their sponges
hit the heat... Off you go.

1046
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,453
..the more time they'll have
to cool and cut them.

1047
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,253
I'm trying to make them
not too thick

1048
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,773
because then they cook quicker
and cool quicker.

1049
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,693
Any attempt to build their homes
from warm sponge

1050
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,413
will result in
a subsidence nightmare...

1051
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,493
I remembered to set the timer today.

1052
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,133
..but Will's making life
doubly difficult for himself.

1053
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,573
I'm also making a chocolate cake.

1054
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,893
It's slightly drier, which I think
is good for the structure.

1055
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,133
After a disappointing first day,
Will's looking to impress

1056
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,533
by constructing his old
North London flat from two sponges -

1057
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,173
one chocolate and one orange -

1058
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,573
with architectural details
made from gingerbread.

1059
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,573
So, you've got gingerbread,
you've got sponge,

1060
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,933
you've got orange.

1061
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,813
A lot to do. Hopefully,
you get away with it in the time.

1062
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,693
Thank you, Will. I know! I know!

1063
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,213
Just a stone's throw away,
in South East London,

1064
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,133
is the flat where Maxy grew up.

1065
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,813
It's my mum's block
where I started baking.

1066
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,813
Flavours are inspired by
a family favourite,

1067
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,373
which is my mum's
apple and berry crumble.

1068
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,773
Maxy will spread her mum's famous
apple and berry compote,

1069
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,093
along with a crumble topping,
between layers of cinnamon sponge.

1070
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,693
Are you enjoying your time here?

1071
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,333
I am, but I just, you know,
get a bit stressed sometimes.

1072
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,093
Who are you scared of more -
Prue or Paul? Paul.

1073
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,053
He's got a tough exterior,
like a crusty roll.

1074
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,813
THEY LAUGH

1075
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,493
He's like a crusty bap,
but when you break him open,

1076
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,733
he's all soft inside. You see...

1077
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,053
And he's good, you know, with
a little bit of butter, toasted.

1078
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,973
So...

1079
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,373
This has gone weird,
hasn't it? This?

1080
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,813
No, this conversation.
The conversation!

1081
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,293
How are you looking, cakes?

1082
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,240
Just want to double-check
if it's cooked.

1083
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,173
Yeah. Shouldn't be too dry.

1084
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,413
So, I'm going to take
my small sponges out of the oven.

1085
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,493
They seem to be all ready.
Oh, I hope it's cooked. God!

1086
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,653
I don't want to overbake it.

1087
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,493
I just want it to be perfect.

1088
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,240
So, I'm going to let the sponges
cool for as long as I can.

1089
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,200
Oh, no! My oven wasn't on.
Oh, flipping hell!

1090
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,560
My oven wasn't on
for the past 40 minutes.

1091
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,093
If Abdul can bake
his sponges in time,

1092
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,573
he'll build his grandparents' home
in Pakistan

1093
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,173
with mango and saffron jam

1094
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,533
sandwiched between layers
of masala chai spiced sponge.

1095
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,973
Cooling time
and everything is now challenging

1096
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,613
because I've lost about 40 minutes.

1097
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,493
But keep going.
Keep going and trying, right?

1098
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,573
Syabira's also hoping
to tempt the judges with a cuppa.

1099
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,093
Milk tea is something we drink
all the time in Malaysia.

1100
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,253
And in a bid for top spot...

1101
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,693
Cushty.

1102
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,933
..her cake contains not just one
but two types of tea.

1103
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,333
Milk tea is the main flavour
that I want to bring in,

1104
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,533
and matcha complements milk tea.

1105
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,613
Filled with
strawberry and cinnamon jam

1106
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,933
and matcha buttercream,

1107
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,453
Syabira's milk tea sponges

1108
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,893
will form the childhood home

1109
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,173
and tropical garden

1110
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,933
she loved to play in growing up.

1111
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,933
Can't imagine where you live.
So, I live...

1112
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,613
Somewhere fantastical.

1113
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,613
No. In a shoe? A golden shoe?
I live in a village,

1114
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,493
a very small little house
with a coconut tree around it.

1115
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,093
Wow. So, we usually tried
to climb the coconut

1116
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,653
because we thought, if a monkey
could do it, we also could do it.

1117
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:15,053
THEY LAUGH
Yes, I can tell this is going to be

1118
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,133
my favourite chat
of the day already.

1119
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,973
In theory, this is done.

1120
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,653
As Will's final sponge
exits the oven...

1121
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,213
There we go. Ooh, boy!

1122
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,853
..closely followed by Abdul's...

1123
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,493
It's OK. It's OK.
It landed the right side up.

1124
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,333
Yes! Today is not my day, is it?

1125
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,773
Cold, cold, cold, cold.

1126
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,373
..the rest of the bakers
are ready to begin building...

1127
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,253
They're cool enough
to start stacking.

1128
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,373
And, of course, the soak.

1129
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,213
I'm going to be
fairly generous with this.

1130
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,373
I want it to be perfection.

1131
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,453
This is strawberries and cream
liqueur.

1132
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,093
I'm going to add all of it.
Grown-up cake.

1133
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,933
..but Sandro's grown-up cake
won't be drinking alone.

1134
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,853
Plenty of coconut rum.

1135
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,813
Wow! That was hot.

1136
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,613
During lockdown, because obviously
we couldn't go anywhere,

1137
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,333
me and my parents, we just had,
like, a cocktail night,

1138
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,893
so this is one of the ones
that went down a treat,

1139
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,173
was a pina colada.

1140
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,573
Rebs plans to bring party vibes
to her house

1141
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,093
with flambeed pineapple rings
and rum buttercream

1142
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,413
sandwiched between layers
of a rum-soaked coconut sponge.

1143
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,933
It's really important
for me to get the sponge right today

1144
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,320
because I didn't cook
my sponge properly yesterday.

1145
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,320
Oh, my goodness! You're joking!

1146
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,240
My cake's not fully done.

1147
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,373
But Reb's party...
They're not fully cooked.

1148
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,413
..might be off.

1149
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,773
Erm, I don't know
what I'm going to do.

1150
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,920
Erm, I just need a minute to myself.

1151
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,160
I feel like I'm going to be sick.

1152
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,413
You know it was your turn
to do the time call

1153
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,893
and then I just spoke over you?

1154
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,853
It was really out of order,
so I won't ever do that again.

1155
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,933
So, go on, you do the time call.
Really? Yeah.

1156
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,373
This is your time call, though.
No, no, no. This one's yours.

1157
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,573
You're giving me your time call?
I am. I love you.

1158
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,493
Bakers, you are halfway through!

1159
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,093
Sorry, I forgot. I forgot!

1160
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,333
I would like to be
carving cakes by now,

1161
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,533
but I've still got
gingerbread to make.

1162
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,693
I think I'm going
to struggle with time.

1163
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,893
And Will's not
the only one struggling.

1164
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,573
My sponge, they've just not really
fully cooked. I don't know why.

1165
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,413
But Rebs has a cunning plan
to get back on track.

1166
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,853
This one's OK.

1167
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,800
I'm just going to take a ring
of cake from here and put it in.

1168
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,493
Look, you'd never know. It's fine.
It's fine. I'm not going to panic.

1169
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,320
Why would I panic?
Panicking's for losers.

1170
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,653
Constructing now,
so we're layering up.

1171
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,453
This is going in now, my crumble.

1172
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,933
Everyone's just bashing stuff.

1173
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,813
Yeah, this wasn't even
part of the recipe.

1174
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,653
Who are you imagining that is -
Paul or Prue?

1175
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,533
Well, what one is it
the same colour as?

1176
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,573
It's Paul, isn't it? What is that?
It's butterscotch lattice.

1177
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,893
That's what he takes
to the tanning salon

1178
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,893
and goes,
"I want to look like this."

1179
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,973
Carole, look at this colour... Oh!
..without any food colouring.

1180
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,213
This is my childhood house
back home in Libya.

1181
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,573
Taking inspiration from
her favourite lemon tree growing up,

1182
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,373
Maisam will fill her lemon sponge
with blueberry jam

1183
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,853
and add colourful decoration

1184
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,253
to give the house
the finish Paul and Prue expect.

1185
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,493
But if I just speed up a little bit,

1186
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,893
then I can give them
that finesse that they want.

1187
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,413
Oh, no!
LAUGHTER.

1188
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,493
Small explosion.

1189
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,213
James, too, has been inspired
by a childhood memory.

1190
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,813
My dad used to have a cottage
up in Loch Fyne.

1191
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,533
It's the first place
I remember getting terrified.

1192
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,773
We watched Dracula,
and while we were watching it,

1193
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,333
my dad wandered by
with an axe outside of the door.

1194
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,133
It was like a 4D experience.

1195
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,453
James's frightfully tasty cottage
will contain orange curd

1196
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,213
and orange blossom buttercream

1197
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,533
spread between six thick layers
of orange and cardamom sponge.

1198
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,573
It's oozing a tiny bit,
but surprisingly OK

1199
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,333
cos it is quite a lot
of weight on top.

1200
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,293
But we'll find out, I guess.

1201
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,813
Bakers, you have 30 minutes.

1202
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,053
Oh, BLEEP!

1203
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,453
Definitely behind.

1204
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,173
While Will and Abdul are still
constructing their homes...

1205
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,653
My plan is just to assemble this

1206
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,813
and then as much I can decor,
I'll try.

1207
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,253
..for the rest of the bakers,

1208
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,373
it's a nail-biting race
to the finish.

1209
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,933
I'm trying to be neat.

1210
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,173
I was over-generous
with the fillings

1211
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,413
so I've skipped a layer.

1212
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,053
The only person
that will notice is Paul.

1213
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,653
I'm sure he'll count them all.

1214
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,453
This is sugar fondant.

1215
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,813
If only it was this easy
to brick a house.

1216
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,600
Roof under construction.

1217
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,573
My dad was a roofer, as well. Irony!

1218
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,653
What can I smell?

1219
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,733
Yeah, I smell burning.

1220
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,880
It's not me, is it?
HE GASPS.

1221
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,133
A little bit overdone. Oh!

1222
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,933
I love a bit of pebbledashing.
Pebbledash.

1223
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,133
I used to get told off
when I was a little girl cos...

1224
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,493
Picking the stones off? Yes.

1225
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,493
I feel like this is going to tap
into Paul's childhood, as well.

1226
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,773
I'm not sure Prue
will identify with pebbledash.

1227
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,133
She won't. She won't have a clue.
She won't know what it is.

1228
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,853
If you haven't got a maze around
your house, she won't understand.

1229
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,133
Or a moat! Got a gate.

1230
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,293
The brickwork around the cottage,

1231
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,493
I wanted to show the sort of
higgledy-piggledyness of it.

1232
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,333
Time is the limiting factor
right now.

1233
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,253
I'm going to have to leave out
a lot of things, I think.

1234
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,933
What are you going to do with that?

1235
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,373
I'll probably eat it later.
Will you? Yeah.

1236
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,493
And what are you going to do
with these?

1237
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,733
One of the main issues
is the misuse of disused tissues.

1238
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,040
Embarrassing!

1239
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,080
Bakers, you have five minutes left!

1240
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,413
The stress is real. Come on!

1241
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,840
I have to give Christmas now.
The more detail, the better.

1242
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,240
Nearly there.

1243
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,333
I'm piping clouds
out of Italian meringue.

1244
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,853
What is happening here?

1245
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,613
Agh, it looks terrible!

1246
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,293
Maxy, you're not on your own.
HE SIGHS.

1247
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,333
Going to need another couple
of windows on it.

1248
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,720
My hands are shaking!

1249
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,813
Right, I can't stop, I can't stop.

1250
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,933
Wow! It's not what you think it is.
No. What is it?

1251
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,333
Coconut tree. Right.
So, I'm making the trunk...

1252
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,493
Oh, right. OK, yeah.

1253
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,600
I'm trying to use this barfi
to make sheep.

1254
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,133
I can't watch you do that. Sorry,
it brings back too many memories.

1255
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,373
SHE LAUGHS
I hope it's a good one.

1256
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,800
Bakers, you have one minute left!
Argh!

1257
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,200
This buttercream has split.

1258
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,813
They don't even look like squares.

1259
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,653
This is better
than the red velvet cake.

1260
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,240
It's a step in the right direction.
Just some shimmer.

1261
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,600
Bakers, your time is up!

1262
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,773
Please step away from your bakes.
I feel so mean.

1263
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,893
What kind of Showstopper is this?!

1264
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,693
It's not as I pictured it.

1265
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,693
That is so, so good.
It looks incredible.

1266
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,013
It's not as neat as I'd like,

1267
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,573
but it looks like my house,
which is a bonus.

1268
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,240
I just don't want to go home.

1269
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,533
It's time to judge
the show stopping home bakes.

1270
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,453
Rebs, would you like to
bring your Showstopper up, please?

1271
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,280
It's heavy.

1272
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,613
One wee thing I need to get.

1273
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,853
I don't know if you've ever been
to Northern Ireland

1274
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,093
but it's constantly raining.

1275
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,533
You have to have a
bit of coconut rum rain.

1276
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,373
I like the idea of coconut rum rain.
Nice.

1277
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,693
It does remind me of a very rural
cottage. It's very good.

1278
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,853
PRUE: The detail is lovely.

1279
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,053
PAUL: This is basically a pina
colada cake, isn't it?

1280
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,693
Yeah. Coconut and vanilla sponge,
pineapple curd,

1281
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,760
and flambeed pineapple slices
with coconut and rum butter cream.

1282
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,413
I love the flavour.

1283
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,893
PAUL: The pineapple comes through,
coconut comes through.

1284
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,013
It is over-baked, the sponge.
Not by much.

1285
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:55,653
Overall, A, it looks great, B, the
flavours came through beautifully.

1286
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,853
Well done.
Do you want me to take it away? Yes.

1287
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,413
Thank you. Quit while you're ahead.

1288
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,813
Thank you so much.

1289
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,373
Oh, I'm going to take your
tablecloth with me... Well done.

1290
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,240
Thank you. I'm going to cry.

1291
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,053
PRUE: What are the windows?

1292
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,213
Sugar cookie filled with
butterscotch.

1293
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,573
Did you mean to burn them?

1294
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,000
I didn't mean to.

1295
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,173
The banana cake itself is delicious.

1296
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,253
My only thing is,
cut your pecans up more.

1297
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,653
They're too big.

1298
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,280
PRUE: It's a really good cake.
Well done.

1299
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,013
PRUE: It's beautifully neat.

1300
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,213
The piping is beautiful.
Look at that.

1301
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,373
PAUL: I love the pots
all around the outside.

1302
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,640
It's coffee and walnut
with coffee buttercream.

1303
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,040
It's quite powerful, that coffee.
It had a good glug.

1304
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:59,213
It's really powerful. I've never had
a coffee cake that strong before.

1305
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,813
The coffee is actually burning.
It's fascinating. Wow.

1306
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,160
You've blown Paul's mind!

1307
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,493
PRUE: Lots of skills
showing off here.

1308
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,453
You're obviously
very good at piping.

1309
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,573
Thank you.

1310
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,320
PAUL: So much buttercream!

1311
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,813
It's very claggy.

1312
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,453
PRUE: Especially that middle layer
which is really compressed.

1313
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,013
PAUL: I think it's the weight.

1314
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,053
There's so much
buttercream on there.

1315
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,853
The sponge just can't hold it.
It glues your mouth together,

1316
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,213
which at the moment might be a good
thing for you.

1317
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,240
But the flavours, fantastic.

1318
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,893
PRUE: You obviously ran out of time.

1319
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,653
The piping is a bit clumsy.
PAUL: Let's have a look.

1320
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,693
PRUE: Oh, wow.

1321
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,920
PAUL: I've never had
a crumble in a cake before.

1322
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,040
I think you've done
a really good job.

1323
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,773
The crumble with a compote is
fantastic. It works really well.

1324
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,453
PRUE: Well done.

1325
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,213
Thank you. I was so worried.

1326
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,853
Are you all right? Yes.

1327
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,253
PAUL: Boo!

1328
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,200
LAUGHTER

1329
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,253
PAUL: You've lost a lot
of the detail on the house. Yes.

1330
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,333
Did you run out of time?

1331
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,013
Unfortunately my oven wasn't hot
which meant my cakes were delayed.

1332
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:27,213
That basically pushed everything.
My sponge is masala chai.

1333
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,720
In between I have
mascarpone frosting and mango jam.

1334
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,133
The chai is delicious,
carries really well inside the cake.

1335
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,133
The bake is good as well.

1336
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,173
It is absolutely delicious.

1337
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,693
But I would have liked more mango.

1338
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,040
OK. I'd like to have seen more
detail. I think inside tastes great.

1339
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,213
PRUE: It looks absently charming.

1340
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,453
I love it. I like the pebble dash.

1341
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,373
It's gone a bit wonky, but I'm
thinking the house was wonky.

1342
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,440
Subsidence, terrible subsidence.

1343
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,413
PAUL: Wow.
PRUE: Look at that.

1344
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:07,173
It's genoise sponge with apricot,
praline and vanilla jam

1345
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,693
and buttercream inside.

1346
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,973
PRUE: How many layers?
It was supposed to be 12.

1347
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,293
I'm going to be really honest
and admit that there are 11.

1348
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,533
PRUE: It's really brave
to make genoise.

1349
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,613
It's so airy that it could get
squashed easily.

1350
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,440
But it hasn't squashed at all.

1351
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,333
PAUL: That is a fantastic cake.

1352
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,613
You've get texture coming from the
praline, the apricot is lovely

1353
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,533
and it's got a bit of tartness to
that, as well, which really works.

1354
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,853
The sponge is well baked.
Buttercream works well.

1355
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,320
PRUE: Well done.

1356
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,013
PRUE: I like the look of it.
I think it's charming.

1357
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,773
PAUL: The detail in there is lovely.

1358
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,853
This has a lot of interesting
flavours in this.

1359
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,493
It is milk tea sponge

1360
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:49,453
with strawberry jam
and matcha buttercream.

1361
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,960
PAUL: Cook's nice.

1362
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,893
I think your textures are beautiful.

1363
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,293
The baking element is perfect.
The sponges are delicious.

1364
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:04,293
My issue is,
there is no hero flavour.

1365
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,173
There are so many little things
going on in there,

1366
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,973
there's matcha, there's strawberry.

1367
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,040
The tea flavour is not
strong enough.

1368
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,493
Oh, my God.

1369
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,893
I recognise that block now!

1370
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,933
Really?
Yeah, we live near each other!

1371
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,400
That's brilliant.

1372
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,280
You've over-baked every one. Agh!

1373
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,573
I think the chocolate could have
been a bit more punchy.

1374
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,853
I love the orange.

1375
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,160
But it comes down
to the bake for me.

1376
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,653
PRUE: It's not perfectly decorated,
is it?

1377
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,413
It's a little bit clumsy.

1378
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,093
PAUL: Let's have a look, shall we?

1379
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,880
It's lemon, which is inspired
by the lemon trees in that house.

1380
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,760
It's quite dense.

1381
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,413
That doesn't take away the fact
that I actually love the flavour.

1382
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,053
PRUE: It is just a bit puddingy.

1383
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,333
If I had that in a bowl
with custard I'd be in heaven.

1384
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,933
But this is supposed to be cake!

1385
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,853
Yeah! I like the flavours.
Texture is all wrong.

1386
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,573
Bit simple on the decoration.

1387
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,760
Yes.

1388
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,733
PAUL: The decorations
look quite sweet

1389
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,813
but I expected that to be a lot more
detailed than it is.

1390
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,573
It's just a little bit simplistic.

1391
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,213
What you don't know is
his grandparents

1392
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,293
actually lived in a cake.

1393
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,960
So it's actually very accurate.

1394
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,893
Wow. Look at that.

1395
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,280
PRUE: There's lots
of strawberries and cream.

1396
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,933
Doesn't bowl me over, that.

1397
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,013
There's too much alcohol in there.

1398
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,893
Too much alcohol?

1399
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,413
PRUE: I thought I'd never hear me
say this, but he's right.

1400
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,853
Sponge is lovely and soft.

1401
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:50,213
But somehow if you put booze in a
filling, it's modified by the cake,

1402
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,240
but if it's in the cake
it's everywhere.

1403
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,213
I love it for the colour
and the vibrancy.

1404
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,293
PAUL: The decoration
and the pipework,

1405
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,613
you've done an amazing job.

1406
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,453
This looks beautiful,
this area here.

1407
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,973
I can see coming home to your mum's
flat must have been really good.

1408
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,053
It is chocolate cake.
It contains soy sauce.

1409
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,453
PRUE: For the umami, presumably.
That is correct.

1410
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,880
Inside, Christmas-inspired
buttercream.

1411
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,720
It is utterly delicious.

1412
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,933
Just the right amount of spice.

1413
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,973
Very chocolaty.

1414
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,653
PAUL: The textures in the bakes all
the way through are delicious.

1415
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,733
PRUE: I can't fault it.
It's excellent. Thank you.

1416
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,960
Well done. It's a work of art.

1417
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,973
Janusz, well done!

1418
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,560
Yeah, that's amazing feedback.

1419
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,213
If I was named Star Baker,
that, in my heart,

1420
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,133
would actually be like winning
the competition for me.

1421
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,680
Because cake is my favourite.

1422
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,893
They said the cake looked lovely but
it doesn't have a punchy flavour.

1423
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,040
Yes, it's fair, I know
I made a boo-boo that way.

1424
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,653
Could have been worse.

1425
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,133
I still feel like I'm languishing
a little bit along the bottom.

1426
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,133
I am in danger. To be honest,

1427
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,413
I don't know whether I've done
enough to stay.

1428
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,053
I'm very happy. It went as well
as it possibly could have done.

1429
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:22,040
I just hope it's enough
to be not bottom any more.

1430
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,613
Prue and Paul have made
their decision.

1431
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,733
It's going to be OK.

1432
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,200
It is going to be OK. I hope so.

1433
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:38,493
I've got the great job this
week of announcing the Star Baker.

1434
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:42,920
And this week's Star Baker is...

1435
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,773
..Janusz.

1436
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,920
APPLAUSE

1437
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,493
Well, if it was up to me,
I'd keep you all here

1438
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,013
and send one of the judges home.

1439
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:07,573
Sadly it isn't up to me and we do
have to say goodbye to one of you.

1440
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:11,480
Which feels very early. But the
person who is leaving us is...

1441
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
..Will.

1442
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,373
ALL: Aw!

1443
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,413
Well, guys, you go
and all knock it out of the park.

1444
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,733
Honestly, Will, you should
just feel proud of yourself.

1445
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,933
PAUL: Well done, Will.
Thank you.

1446
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,053
APPLAUSE
Well done.

1447
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:39,493
You know, somebody's
got to go first, and...

1448
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,813
Obviously I'm disappointed
but I'm proud to have made it.

1449
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,573
Yeah, I'm all right.
I knew it was going to happen.

1450
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,133
I'm going to miss our conversations!

1451
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,293
You know, there's obviously
a lovely bunch of people I've met.

1452
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,333
I've got an experience that I can
definitely talk about and share.

1453
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,133
Yeah, I'm proud of that.

1454
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,613
PAUL: Bit better next week, please.

1455
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,213
I need to be a lot neater.
You do. A lot neater.

1456
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,893
Oh... I'm still here!

1457
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:05,973
I literally... I can't believe it.

1458
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,613
I was constantly hearing my name.

1459
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,493
Next week I really want to
impress the judges

1460
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,773
and also make myself proud as well.

1461
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,880
PAUL: Well done, Janusz.
You absolute rock star.

1462
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:22,093
Winning Star Baker on the cake week
means everything to me.

1463
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,293
Congratulations. Thank you.

1464
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,360
Are you crying?!

1465
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,573
I've cried so many times.

1466
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:32,173
Is he crying? Oh, babe! Babe!

1467
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,293
I think my boyfriend will be
really proud.

1468
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:37,773
He will say, "You can make cake
and I told you you can make cake."

1469
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,573
Aw! Well done. Well done.

1470
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,093
First Star Baker. Thank you.

1471
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,333
Hey, hun-bun.

1472
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,800
I just wanted to tell you that I
win Star Caker in the bake week.

1473
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,093
No! I win... No.

1474
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,960
LAUGHTER

1475
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,613
Next time...

1476
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,093
Goodbye... it's biscuit week.

1477
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,133
Say a little prayer.

1478
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,213
A Signature illusion... What could go
wrong with the macarons?

1479
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,253
Everything could go wrong
with the macarons.

1480
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:10,733
..a classical Technical...
I don't know what that is.

1481
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,453
..that creates a buzz in the tent...

1482
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,973
Scottish fly biscuits,
that's what my mum called them.

1483
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,213
Where's your gob?

1484
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,373
..and the bakers face-off...

1485
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,213
..as they make show stopping masks.

1486
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,400
GASPS

1487
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,040
Oh, I might cry. I might cry.

1488
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:48,040
