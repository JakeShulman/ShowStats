1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,493
Hey, Matt. I mean,
it's Biscuit Week,

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,133
but I'm pretty sure that's a cake.
No, it's a biscuit. It's a cake.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,013
It's a biscuit!
Definitely a cake.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,133
MATT SIGHS
Paul, can you settle this argument?

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,733
Is that a cake or a biscuit?

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,213
It's a dog.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,333
Oh.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,800
ALL: Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,653
Last time, 12 new bakers
entered the tent...

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,813
Good luck.

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,533
..determined to conquer Cake Week.

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,773
Ooh!

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,373
While Janusz raised the roof...

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,093
It is utterly delicious.

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,373
..to become our first Star Baker,
Maisam struggled...

16
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,933
Oh, my God. I'm trying to be neat.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,133
..but Will's layer cake condo...

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,253
Definitely behind.

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,853
..failed its final inspection.

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,853
You've overbaked every one.
Oh!

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,773
..and he became the first baker
to leave the tent.

22
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,533
Well, guys, you go and
all knock it out of the park.

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,653
This time...

24
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,853
Oh, flip!

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,973
..it's Biscuit Week...

26
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,133
Oh, I don't know what to do.

27
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,093
..with an illusion macaron
Signature...

28
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,253
I'm a risk taker.

29
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,573
What can go wrong?

30
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,173
Oh, Paul Hollywood,
that's what can go wrong.

31
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,693
..a Technical Challenge...

32
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,733
No clue.

33
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,133
..that ruffles a few feathers...

34
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,413
Oh, man, mine are breaking.

35
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,093
Right now,
I think I'm messing this up.

36
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,173
..and a 3D biscuit mask
Showstopper.

37
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,533
Keep it together, lassie.

38
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,693
Who will be the belle of
the masquerade ball...

39
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,813
I'm shaking.

40
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,573
..and whose mask will slip?

41
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,053
LOUD GASP

42
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,320
Oh, I might cry. I might cry.

43
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,453
I don't think being a Star Baker
last week

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,333
gives you anything this week.

45
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,813
Because anything can happen, so,

46
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,320
yeah, Biscuit Week, here I come!

47
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,613
Good luck, everybody.

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,893
I think I was near the bottom
last week, so I'm feeling

49
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,453
a bit apprehensive.
I feel like there's more to prove.

50
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,853
And biscuits aren't really my thing.

51
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,133
Biscuits?

52
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,093
Oh, I like to eat them.
Not really make them.

53
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,653
Who makes biscuits nowadays?

54
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,280
You would usually get it
from the supermarket.

55
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,813
Good morning, bakers.

56
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,573
Welcome back to the tent
for Biscuit Week.

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,293
Now, for your Signature Challenge,
these guys would like you

58
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,013
to make a batch of 18
identical decorative macarons.

59
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,493
Yeah, that's macaron
the yummy biscuit,

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,053
not Macron the president of France.

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,813
Now, they can be any flavour
you like.

62
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,253
They must be filled,
but here's the twist -

63
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,493
the decoration must
make them look like

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,933
something other than a macaron.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,813
For instance,
the president of France.

66
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,133
Exactly. You have two hours.

67
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,680
On your marks. Get set. Bake!

68
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,453
Here we go.

69
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,333
Macarons aren't really my thing,
but it should be fun.

70
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,253
What could go wrong with a macaron?

71
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,173
Everything. Everything could
go wrong with a macaron.

72
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,613
They can explode.
They can underbake.

73
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,333
They might stick to the mat.

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,733
There are 87 things that could
go wrong with them.

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,933
For me, the perfect macaron
is very light,

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,453
perfectly shaped,

77
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,493
outside smooth and shiny
and crisp as anything,

78
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,093
and inside deliciously chewy.

79
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,653
But we're not asking the bakers
for any old macaron.

80
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,613
They have to be shaped or decorated
to look like something else.

81
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,253
We want to see colourful,
we want to see vibrant

82
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,693
and we want to see a little bit
of personality coming out.

83
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,413
Right, chuck all that in there.

84
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,293
The best way to approach
this challenge is simplicity.

85
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,853
They've only got two hours.

86
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,333
Produce something that
packs a punch and looks amazing.

87
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,493
Don't try and overdo it
at this stage.

88
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,013
Morning, Carole.

89
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,253
Morning.
Hello, Carole.

90
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,533
So Carole,
tell us about your macaron.

91
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,613
I've decided to make little burgers.

92
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,733
Burgers?
Little bite-size burgers.

93
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,653
You have got the best accent
in the world to say "burgers."

94
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,133
Yeah. Yeah, burgers.

95
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,013
Just reminds me of nice summer
evenings with friends and family.

96
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,093
Home-made burgers with
a proper cider.

97
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,613
LAUGHTER

98
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,973
Proper job.

99
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,453
MATT: When she's not entertaining
guests in the garden,

100
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,693
compost Carole can be found in the
greenhouse tending to her plants.

101
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,213
I love the smell of a greenhouse.

102
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,173
Topped with sesame seeds,

103
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,613
Carole's macaron buns
will be filled with

104
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,213
a chocolate orange buttercream,

105
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,933
chocolate lettuce,
and fondant tomatoes.

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,373
But her burgers have competition.

107
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,453
Sandro's making burgers.
He's got chips with his.

108
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,733
Why didn't I think of that?

109
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,693
I eat quite healthily
majority of the time,

110
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,533
but my burger order is ridiculous,

111
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,693
so I'll get normally
a triple cheeseburger.

112
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,093
and I'll also get, like, a full
chicken burger as well with it,

113
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,413
and nuggets.

114
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,653
But working out
for two hours every day

115
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,293
means Sandro can go large
on his cheat days.

116
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,293
What's this? 5,000 calories?

117
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,613
Do it.

118
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,813
Served with fondant chips,
Sandro's take on macaron burgers

119
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,653
will be filled with a passion fruit
and rum salted caramel

120
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,893
and chocolate ganache ketchup.

121
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,773
I'm feeling confident
in my flavours.

122
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,253
I'm sure they're going to like it.

123
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,133
And I'm trying to beat the
flavour king Janusz right here,

124
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,533
so he's my flavour competition here,
so...

125
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,933
Sorry.

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,133
..let's see.

127
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,893
So what I'm making today,
it will be watermelon macarons.

128
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,333
So they're going to look like
tiny little watermelons.

129
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,933
My inspiration for this bake
is Brighton beach,

130
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,293
because what's better to have cold
watermelons on the beach

131
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,880
on a hot sunny day?

132
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,213
And when the Brighton skies
are a little more cloudy,

133
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,093
Janusz likes to spend time putting
balls with boyfriend Simon.

134
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,933
LOUD GASP

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,453
Hole in one!

136
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,453
Crammed with a bright red watermelon
and lemon curd

137
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,613
and a watermelon buttercream,
he's using spinach powder

138
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,440
to colour his macaron shells
a distinctive green.

139
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,333
And as well it gives flavour,

140
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,973
because watermelon has this
sort of plant-y flavour to it,

141
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,573
and I think spinach powder
recreates this.

142
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,893
Also hoping for a bit of plant power
is Maxy.

143
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,893
I am making daisies.

144
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,253
I can see that you've got
daisies on your jumper today.

145
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,093
That's right.

146
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,653
Why daisies?
Is this to do with your daughters?

147
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,773
Yes. They were both born in April

148
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,533
so I thought daisies, April flowers.

149
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,933
Maxy's little daisies Tyra
and Talia are at home

150
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,253
with dad Tyshak, who Maxy met 15
years ago when they worked together

151
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,853
in a local supermarket.

152
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,173
Both Tyra and Talia's
favourite flavours

153
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,973
will feature in Maxy's macarons -

154
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,560
raspberry mascarpone cream
and salted caramel.

155
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,213
How old are your little girls?

156
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,653
Four and five.
Four and five?

157
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,053
Yeah.
Wow.

158
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,013
So although is really difficult,
this is basically a holiday for you.

159
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,373
I do miss them.
Like, I wake up, and I'm like...

160
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,053
I know.
.. "Where are my kids?"

161
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,453
That's how they get you.

162
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,093
Knackered as you are,
you still miss them.

163
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,333
I do, yeah.

164
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,653
Well, good luck. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

165
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,293
Look forward to these.
Thank you.

166
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,653
Maxy's macarons aren't
the only ones being flavoured

167
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,293
with a family favourite.

168
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,773
The fillings are inspired by
my mum's favourite flavours.

169
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,333
And I want to make her proud,

170
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,733
so I don't want these macarons
to let me down.

171
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,373
Mum Afaf has instilled in Maisam

172
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,600
a love of traditional
Libyan flavours.

173
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,253
There?

174
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,733
Maisam will be bringing a taste of
her mum's favourite baklava

175
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,493
into the tent today with her orange
blossom-infused crushed walnuts

176
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,493
and mascarpone cream which will fill
her macarons that will be shaped

177
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,133
and decorated to look like
cute carrots.

178
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,333
They're carrot shaped. Why?

179
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,933
To be honest,
I was thinking about macarons,

180
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,373
the first thing that came into
my mind was carrots. Just the...

181
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,253
Really?
Yeah.

182
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,133
Macarons reminded you of carrots?

183
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,053
Yeah.
With which they have no relation?

184
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,693
Well, good luck with your...
Strange macarons.

185
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,533
Your strange macarons.
I look forward to trying them.

186
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,013
Oh, thank you, Matt.

187
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,813
No matter what shape
their macarons,

188
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,493
getting the consistency
of their mixture right is crucial.

189
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,293
This is where it could
all go wrong.

190
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,813
Undermix, and their macarons
could explode in the oven.

191
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,253
Just trying to remember what
it's supposed to look like.

192
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,253
It should fall like, erm,
sort of like that.

193
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,213
Yeah, I'm happy with
the batter now.

194
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,693
Overmix, and they risk
knocking out the air,

195
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,053
resulting in flat shapeless
macarons.

196
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,453
All the batter is now done,
and now it's time for piping.

197
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,093
If piping perfectly round macarons
wasn't tricky enough...

198
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,293
Whoa!

199
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,053
I've not got no nipples.

200
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,653
I just hope they rise now.

201
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,853
..those with more elaborate
designs...

202
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,853
They're basically ice cream-shaped
macarons.

203
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,373
Do they look ice cream enough?

204
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,013
..face an even bigger challenge.

205
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,173
Ah!

206
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,973
I'm a bit worried about how
the petals are going to turn out.

207
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,293
Hopefully they don't spread too much
in the oven.

208
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,653
But when it comes
to complex piping...

209
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,973
So this is, like,
a wee design I came up with.

210
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,893
..James is upping the ante.

211
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,853
Those are based on racoons,

212
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,373
cos I have a wee baking racoon
tattoo. Um...

213
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,613
Did you just say you have
a wee racoon baking tattoo?

214
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,253
I'll show you.

215
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,733
Oh, my goodness, it's not so wee!

216
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,533
Currently living in Cumbria,

217
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,413
James often dreams up his best
baking ideas

218
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,733
while strolling along the seafront.

219
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,373
His intricately-piped macarons
will be filled

220
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,173
with raspberry whipped cream
and a mango curd filling.

221
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,893
It's so ambitious.

222
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,893
Well, I think I've really
over-estimated my abilities here.

223
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,480
If you've practised, it'll be fine.

224
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,973
OK, well, good luck. Thank you.

225
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,093
It's about time someone
fused raccoons and baking,

226
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,973
and you're the man to do it.
Here we are.

227
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,413
Good luck.
Cheers, appreciate it.

228
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,893
But James' raccoons aren't the only
furry friends in the tent today.

229
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,653
So my macarons are based on
my cat, Branston.

230
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,693
I got him when I was eight.

231
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,173
He's really important to me.
He's like my baby.

232
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,893
When she's not doting on
15-year-old Branston,

233
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,720
Rebs like to relax
by playing the tin whistle.

234
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,520
My hands smell like cat food.

235
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,413
Filled with chocolate ganache
and raspberry coulis, her cat-shaped

236
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,293
macarons will hopefully immortalise
her beloved feline friend.

237
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,133
I don't think... I didn't mix
them... I didn't mix it enough.

238
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,333
I don't know if I should just
take it all back

239
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,173
and mix it a bit more.
Argh, I don't know what to do!

240
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,853
Janusz, I don't know if I should
just scrape it back in

241
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,293
and keep mixing. Do you think
they are not mixed enough?

242
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,893
Like, they're just too thick.

243
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,173
Yeah, they are very thick.

244
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,053
Very thick.
Right, I'm just going to go for it.

245
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,013
I was scared of making them too thin
and then I've made them too thick.

246
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,133
Put it back in and remix and hope
I've not lost too much mixture.

247
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,053
While Rebs is feeling the heat...

248
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,253
Argh!

249
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,653
..Kevin is keeping his cool.

250
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,613
So I'm making
ice cream cone macarons.

251
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,253
My wife and I like to take the dog
a trip up to Loch Lomond,

252
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,773
visit somewhere like Luss
and get an ice cream.

253
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,973
Kevin and his wife Rachel
might enjoy a cornet,

254
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,053
but dog Judy has
much simpler tastes.

255
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,440
Where's your stick?

256
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,813
Kevin will fill his cone-shaped
macarons with a peppermint ganache,

257
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,853
a nod to his favourite ice cream
flavour, mint choc chip.

258
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,813
Oh, I like a mint choc chip.

259
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,333
Yeah.
Yeah!

260
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,453
So hopefully it doesn't turn out
like toothpaste.

261
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,173
Well, that is the risk, isn't it?
Yeah.

262
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,453
You've got to get it good,

263
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,613
because you're not
the only person doing ice creams.

264
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,573
I know,
Abdul's doing ice creams as well.

265
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,373
I love ice cream.
That's my favourite dessert,

266
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,173
and as a child growing up,
I used to even have breakfast

267
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,653
with ice cream.

268
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,813
But as an adult, Abdul has swapped
his ice cream breakfast

269
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,533
for a run around the block.

270
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,173
He's filling his
ice cream cornet macarons

271
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,893
with a chocolate, coffee,
and caramel mix ganache.

272
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,413
But they're pink.

273
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,893
Yes. You weren't tempted to do
a sort of strawberry flavour?

274
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,933
Oh, no, because when you think
of ice cream,

275
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,120
the first colour I think of is pink.
Yeah. You?

276
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,173
Pink, definitely.

277
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,853
OK! Thank you.

278
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,280
WHISPERS: Vanilla, really.

279
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,133
Bakers, you have
an amount of time remaining.

280
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,733
That was helpful.
Oh, you're welcome.

281
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,333
Bakers, you are halfway through.

282
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,333
I'm going in.

283
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,933
Macarons bake in
a matter of minutes...

284
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,093
And boom.

285
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,173
..going from underbaked and gooey...

286
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,413
Goodbye.

287
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,293
..to tough and chewy
in the flick of a whisk.

288
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,173
I'm going to give them 18 minutes,
and that's it.

289
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,133
It says to bake it for 18 minutes,
so I'm going for 20,

290
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,053
cos everything changes in here.
Time is not real here.

291
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,293
Any delay in getting the macarons
into the oven

292
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,773
means less time to cool
and decorate.

293
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,173
Still not in?

294
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,573
I can't get them in the oven now
because they're not, erm,

295
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,013
they're not ready.

296
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,213
Oh, my days,
I really need to hurry up.

297
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,333
As Rebs races to catch up,

298
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,013
the other bakers turn their
attention to fillings.

299
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,013
So this is for the mango curd.

300
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,333
And because it's got quite a high
water content, I'm going to use

301
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,533
a wee bit of mango extract
to try and boost it up a little.

302
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,493
Yeah, so this is dark chocolate.

303
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,253
I wanted something bitter
to go in the middle,

304
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,373
so I'm not putting any sugar
in my ganache.

305
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,653
I'm just letting the peppermint
lift it.

306
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,693
So I'm just beating together the
softened butter and mascarpone.

307
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,493
Get that into a creamy consistency,

308
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,693
and then I can do my crunchy walnut
and orange blossom.

309
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,373
I'm extruding sugar paste
to make the string

310
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,733
for my yoyos, because my piping
isn't good enough to... pipe it.

311
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,333
A big kid at heart, Dawn loves
to visit the local petting zoo

312
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,013
with daughter Belinda.

313
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,933
Ah! Just spat at me.

314
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,853
Who did the spitting?

315
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,893
You should be ashamed of yourself!

316
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,893
Dawn's multicoloured yoyo macarons
will be filled with

317
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,653
a mascarpone cream packed full
of sharp strawberry flavour.

318
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,053
This is freeze-dried
strawberry powder.

319
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,173
We're not measuring.
We're just throwing it in.

320
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,213
Dawn might be using sharpness
to combat her macarons' sweetness...

321
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,493
I don't want to get told there's not
enough strawberry, do I?

322
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,813
..but Syabira is taking
a different tack.

323
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,613
What on earth is going on here?

324
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,293
I am actually trying
to make some savoury macaron.

325
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,653
My favourite food is chicken satay.

326
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,253
When I was in Malaysia,
we usually had it all the time.

327
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,653
And why not put a chicken
satay in a macaron?

328
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,453
LAUGHTER

329
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,333
Flavour fanatic Syabira only uses
the very best ingredients,

330
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,133
each one having to pass rigorous
taste tests with boyfriend Bradley.

331
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,773
I don't usually go for crunchy,
but this is really good.

332
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,613
We love this one.

333
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,013
Love it.

334
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,053
Shaped like enormous peanuts, her
savoury macarons will be filled

335
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,893
with a tofu satay sauce.

336
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,333
Tofu.

337
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,853
It doesn't taste of anything,

338
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,093
and she's going to make it
taste wonderful. CHICKEN satay.

339
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,253
It's chicken satay
in a bracket (no chicken).

340
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,613
PRUE LAUGHS

341
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,573
I think you're bonkers
in the best possible way.

342
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,373
I feel like this is so original.

343
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,573
Thank you very much.
Wow. Good luck.

344
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,440
Good luck, Syabira.
Thank you.

345
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,253
MATT: Bakers you have,
half an hour left.

346
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,053
Yeah. Dawn's finished.
Drink that in.

347
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,720
This is ridiculous.

348
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,213
OK, they're in. Right, icing time.

349
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,893
As Rebs' macarons
finally hit the heat...

350
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,413
They're done. Ah!

351
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,893
..everyone else's are
starting to cool.

352
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,653
I thought I wouldn't be one of these
people that would, like,

353
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,773
be fanning stuff, but here we are.

354
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,133
They're a little bit flat,
but least they didn't explode

355
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,213
on the top.
I'm really happy about that.

356
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,133
They're carrot shaped,
they're orange,

357
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,333
they're ticking some of the boxes,
but my filling's not looking good.

358
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,933
It just sort of curdled.

359
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,613
I think I overmixed it,
so I need to restart that.

360
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,053
Do you know what? Just as a tip
for the future, Paul hates tofu.

361
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,533
Ah, that's... He's got, like,
a real thing against tofu.

362
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,093
Really?
Yeah.

363
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,773
I'm a risk taker.

364
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,853
Are you?
Yeah.

365
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,293
A risk taker.
I'm a risk taker too. This is...

366
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,413
It's fun, isn't it?
Yeah!

367
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,973
Right, burger time. Not too much.

368
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,813
The perfect amount of filling is
when you sandwich it together,

369
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,480
you don't want it to kind of go
splurting out all over the place.

370
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,173
So this'll be the sort of
cream border that will hold

371
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,253
the mango curd.

372
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,733
I think it's good.
But if Paul's not happy with it,

373
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,840
next time, I'll make him
a chicken satay, send it to him.

374
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,213
The filling's definitely
a lot better than the first one.

375
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,253
The first one was too runny,
so want to get moving,

376
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,533
get those filled,
and then, if I have enough time,

377
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,413
I'm going to decorate.

378
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,880
Bakers,
you have 15 minutes remaining.

379
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,253
They were way neater in practice,
and I was way quicker in practice.

380
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,693
I'm so far behind.

381
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,413
I mean, all in all, not great.

382
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,173
Just popping chocolate lettuce on.

383
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,293
And little fondant tomato
and cheese.

384
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,973
Watermelon lemon curd
and watermelon buttercream.

385
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,373
What you doing there?

386
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,613
I'm just adding some sprinkles.
Don't overegg it.

387
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,813
They look a bit like eggs as well,
but in a good way,

388
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,253
in a good way. Egg daisies.
Egg daisies!

389
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,773
No, they don't.
They're things of beauty,

390
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,053
and they're dedicated
to your two beautiful children,

391
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,573
what can go wrong?
Yes, they are.

392
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,293
Oh, Paul Hollywood,
that's what can go wrong.

393
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,533
Spanner in the works.

394
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,893
I need to fill them.

395
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,613
I really need to fill them.

396
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,360
Bakers, you have one minute left.

397
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,813
Janusz, can you help me?

398
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,253
Decoration's not happening.

399
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,533
As long as they get macarons
that taste good,

400
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,613
not doing anything extra today.

401
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,733
Can you pipe that in
the middle of this? This.

402
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,773
This?
Yeah, yeah.

403
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,693
Oh! String broke.

404
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,493
OK, start putting them together,

405
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,040
because you're going to have
nothing to present. Yeah. OK.

406
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,280
Faces on. Faces on.

407
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,373
Bakers, your time is up.

408
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,213
Stressful.

409
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,213
AMERICAN ACCENT: Please step away
from your macarons.

410
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,880
Where'd you get the mango from?
Are they yours? James.

411
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,080
HE SIGHS

412
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,680
They look horrific.

413
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,160
The illusion macarons now face
the judgment of Paul and Prue.

414
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,613
Overall, I think the design
is pretty good. It's a black cat.

415
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,733
You can see that.

416
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,733
The interior looks a mess.
Yeah.

417
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,173
The actual face is beautiful.

418
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,013
The piping is perfect, so it's just
the middle that doesn't look good.

419
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,733
Yeah. So the flavour is
a chocolate macaron

420
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,933
with a chocolate ganache
and a raspberry coulis.

421
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,173
I actually quite like them.
I like the flavour.

422
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,333
I just think they're a mess.

423
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,253
It's just that you didn't have time.

424
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,613
Yeah.
But you know that.

425
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,360
Yes, thank you.
Thank you, Rebs. Thanks.

426
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,573
I would've liked them
a tiny bit more domed.

427
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,493
OK. Especially if they're supposed
to look like a burger.

428
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,973
I think they could've been
a little bit darker with the bun.

429
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,533
Mm. They're chocolate and orange.

430
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,453
Some green chocolate
for the lettuce,

431
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,573
and little bits of fondant
for the cheese and tomato.

432
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,413
What orange did you use in it?

433
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,693
Erm, essence.

434
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,733
Hmm. Did you use any zest as well?

435
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,613
No.
You should've done.

436
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,853
Yeah? I actually quite like the idea
of the chocolate and the orange,

437
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,973
but for me,
it's that artificial flavour.

438
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,280
OK.
Mistake.

439
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,813
I think they look great.
I like the sesame seed on the top.

440
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,373
I love the fact it looks like
a burger's hanging over the edge.

441
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,933
Are these fondant, these bits of...?

442
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,253
Yes, they are. So, yeah, I got
passion fruit and lemon macarons,

443
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,893
there's a passion fruit
salted caramel in the middle

444
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,853
with a little bit of rum.

445
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,813
Flavour is absolutely fantastic.

446
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,853
OK. Not too much rum.
Just the right amount.

447
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,093
Thank God.
No, I think you've done a good job.

448
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,613
Well done.
Thank you, thank you.

449
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,920
MATT: Well done.

450
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,453
I think they look great.

451
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,413
You've got a lovely dome on these,
and feet.

452
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,693
So I've decided to make
spinach-flavoured shells,

453
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,173
with just tiny bit of lemon.

454
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,973
And inside, you've got watermelon
curd and watermelon buttercream.

455
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,613
It's quite dry on the outside.

456
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,213
It should be much more delicate
than that, the skin.

457
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,133
It's a shame, because the shape,
the look, the flavour, I love.

458
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,733
I just thought you'd dried it out
a little bit too much on the top.

459
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,560
I did, and I agree with you
completely. Good. Oh, thanks!

460
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,093
You can see what they are.
Yeah.

461
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,653
I think they're quite clever.

462
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,960
So they are filled with a raspberry
double cream and a mango curd.

463
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,213
I think your flavours are delicious.
It's nice and light. It's not heavy.

464
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,333
The macaron is so thin, so it melts,

465
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,133
just leaving the beautiful flavours
inside.

466
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,573
But the fruit gives it a bit of
acidity which takes away from

467
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,093
the extreme sweetness. The balance
of flavours is beautiful.

468
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,533
Imagination's fantastic.

469
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,053
I think you've achieved it
really well. Thank you.

470
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,493
Yeah, I think you've done better
than you thought you would.

471
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,080
Well done.
Cheers, thank you.

472
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,853
They look perfect little macaron.

473
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,853
Nice feet on the bottom,
crisp outside. Neat as a pin.

474
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,213
Yeah, very good.

475
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,040
They've got a strawberry mascarpone
cream filling.

476
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,853
You're looking at me very anxiously.
I am.

477
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,853
Well, I love the flavour.

478
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,893
Oh, good.
Mm.

479
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,533
Perhaps a just... Mm.
Yeah, go on.

480
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,973
No!
Go on.

481
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,240
Well done.

482
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,613
Oh, my goodness.

483
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,933
The macaron is perfect,
absolutely perfect.

484
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,013
The idea of putting the string
round as the fondant...

485
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,173
It's just the interior, it just
lifts you up,

486
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,813
cos sometimes the inside of
macarons can be quite heavy.

487
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,973
Yeah.
And dense.

488
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,933
It's also a really clever idea.
Mm. It's effective. Well done.

489
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,080
It's amazing, thank you.
Thanks. Thanks so much.

490
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,173
I would've thought it was a balloon,

491
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,453
you know, a hot-air balloon,
rather than an ice cream.

492
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,093
It needs to be much, much darker.
You don't get white cones.

493
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,133
The pink on the top looks all right,
but it's all down to the taste.

494
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,240
Inside we have a caramel coffee
chocolate ganache.

495
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,173
Absolutely delicious
if you like coffee.

496
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,653
Chocolate's sort of been lost
a little bit in the coffee,

497
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,613
and the salted caramel,
you can't really taste either

498
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,653
which is a shame.

499
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,640
But it is delicious all the same.
Mm.

500
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,413
I mean, you could sort
of see what it is.

501
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,853
It probably needed a slightly
stronger colour... Yeah.

502
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,973
..just so it looked
more like a cone itself.

503
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,413
Yeah. So it's a dark chocolate
ganache with peppermint.

504
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,800
Peppermint.

505
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,693
It doesn't taste like toothpaste...

506
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,693
OK.
..you'll be pleased to hear,

507
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,453
but I still think the mint's
a bit strong.

508
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,453
I mean, the textures are all right,

509
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,613
it's just I question the flavours
a little bit.

510
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,320
Yeah. OK.

511
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,373
I mean, there is an effort there
to make a carrot shape.

512
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,013
I would like to have seen
maybe some pipe work

513
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,373
on the top to really define
the sort of wrinkles in the carrot.

514
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,533
Mm-hm.

515
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,533
The filling is a mascarpone
cheese cream,

516
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,373
crushed walnut with orange blossom
and cinnamon.

517
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,213
The textures are spot on.

518
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,293
For me, the orange blossom
is just slightly too strong.

519
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,493
Too strong.
And I'd just like to see

520
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,293
a little bit more definition
on the carrot.

521
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,080
I agree that the look of it
isn't perfect. Yes.

522
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,093
Nice height to the macaron.
You can see the feet there as well.

523
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,813
Yeah, you've done really well.

524
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,613
It's peanut satay macaron,

525
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,053
and when you bite into it,
you should taste the bits of tofu

526
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,840
with the ginger inside as well.

527
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,493
That is very surprising, isn't it?

528
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,653
Initially, you get that sweet kick,

529
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,293
then you get all the spices,
and I love that flavour.

530
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,253
And then it goes back
to sweet again,

531
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,973
which is a shame, cos you don't want
to be left with the sweet.

532
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,253
You want to be left with
a little bit of savoury. Mm.

533
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,093
I think the satay is fantastic.
It really is beautiful. OK.

534
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,600
Thank you.
Thank you.

535
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,333
First of all, I think they look
great. They're very neat.

536
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,053
Very delicate.
They've got little feet.

537
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,213
They HAVE got little feet.

538
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,493
Nice and smooth, nice shine to them
as well. Thank you.

539
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,933
The flavours are raspberry and
mascarpone cream and salted caramel.

540
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,213
That is delicious.
Got a little bit of acidity,

541
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,440
which is lovely. I love it.
Mm. Thank you.

542
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,453
Thanks. That's delicious.
It's really light, isn't it?

543
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,253
Light. Summery.
Melts in your mouth.

544
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,133
And the whole thing is so delicate.

545
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,453
And that saltiness
that comes through as well.

546
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,173
Really well done, Maxy. Thank you
so much. Thank you. Thank you.

547
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,773
Going to cry.

548
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,213
I was so worried, cos, like,
I hate macarons so much.

549
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,613
But it worked! And they loved it.

550
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,840
I'm so happy. I don't want to cry.

551
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,533
Two handshakes.

552
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,333
That was crazy.
That was absolutely insane.

553
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,493
I think my family are just
going to go mad.

554
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,213
They're going to be so excited.

555
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,773
The comments were just as
I expected in terms of decoration.

556
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,693
Just an extra ten minutes would've
just made those macarons super.

557
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,853
Oh, I definitely think
I'm dead set last, 100%.

558
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,653
I really need to step it up.

559
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,453
I'm not confident about
the Technical bake.

560
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,893
What could it possibly be?

561
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,333
If it's, like, shortbread,
it's easy peasy.

562
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,720
I doubt it'll be that.

563
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,053
The bakers could practise
their macaron,

564
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,733
but they have no idea what
they'll be asked to make next.

565
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,293
Well, bakers, it's time
for your Technical Challenge,

566
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,160
which today has been set by
footballing legend Wayne Prue-ny.

567
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,733
Wayne, any words of advice?

568
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,613
This is an absolute classic.

569
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,813
Don't get creative,

570
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,613
just stick to the recipe
and don't dare disappoint.

571
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,253
As ever, the Technical Challenge
will be judged blind,

572
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,453
so we're going to have to ask
these two to go and play outside.

573
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,533
Can you hold hands, please,
when you're crossing the road?

574
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,973
For this week's Technical Challenge,

575
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,773
Prue would like you to make
12 garibaldi biscuits.

576
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,853
Otherwise known as squashed fly
biscuits, on account of

577
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,813
the dried fruit looking
a little bit like squashed flies.

578
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,293
Now, you can use actual
squashed flies in your recipe,

579
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,333
but I will say in advance how sorry
we are to see you leave

580
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,893
this early in the competition.

581
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,413
You have one hour and 45 minutes.

582
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,440
On your marks. Get set. Flies.

583
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,693
Squashed fly biscuits.
That's what my mum's called them.

584
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,253
I think I've had them,
but I've never made them.

585
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,453
I'm well chuffed. I know what it is.

586
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,853
I was up till 2.00am
reading about biscuits.

587
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,533
So I've never heard of it
or eaten it before,

588
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,573
so this is the first time
I'm hearing it.

589
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,480
No clue. I'm literally just baking.

590
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,413
So, Prue, garibaldi biscuits.
Interesting Technical Challenge.

591
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,613
Well, yes, I mean they sound
simple, but they're quite tricky.

592
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,533
So where do you think they could
go wrong?

593
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,253
You need to roll the dough
really thin.

594
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,373
You want the crisp biscuit,

595
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,053
but slightly bendy soft middle,
and a thin line of fruit.

596
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,453
Now, you've got the addition
of chocolate here.

597
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,373
Chocolate is not
classically garibaldi,

598
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,573
but I always like to see how skilful
they are at feathering.

599
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,853
As soon as you pick it up,
there's stability there.

600
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,933
It's a little bit soft
under the finger,

601
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,800
you know you've got something
that's quite solid.

602
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,573
Mm.
Mm.

603
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,453
It's a lovely flavoursome biscuit.

604
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,053
I think it's absolutely delicious.

605
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,493
But I am sure we're probably going
to get 11 different types

606
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,693
of garibaldi biscuit.

607
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,213
Well, I'm hoping to see 11
pretty well like that.

608
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,520
Fat chance.

609
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,013
So the first step is chop and soak
the fruit in the orange juice.

610
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,773
So I'm trying to get them, like,
fly size.

611
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,333
So I'm not going to chop the
currants cos they're already tiny.

612
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,693
It doesn't say for how long,

613
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,333
so I guess I'll soak them
until I do my dough.

614
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,333
"Make the dough and chill."
Very helpful.

615
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,933
She give us a few clues,
like the butter's in small cubes,

616
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,093
which means that you make your
wee breadcrumbs.

617
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,293
My Signature didn't go
as I expected it.

618
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,013
I'm not in a good position.

619
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,413
Stressed!

620
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,133
Then I'll add sugar,
then I'll add the egg.

621
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,133
Did you get a handshake?
I got a handshake, Noel.

622
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,453
Have you washed it yet?

623
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,973
Course I have. Have you? Yeah.
What, washed off the Hollywood?

624
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,333
I washed off the Hollywood.
Never wash off the Hollywood!

625
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,573
Well, er, I might...
You let it seal up like a resin...

626
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,853
Is that what you do?
..then you peel it off like a glove.

627
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,133
Nice and soft I don't know
if it's too soft. Who knows?

628
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,253
Going to put it in the fridge now.

629
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,653
I'm starting to sort of visualise
what they look like.

630
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,093
Should be a layer of biscuit,
layer of fruit,

631
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,613
and then layer of biscuit.

632
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,533
This looks wrong.

633
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,133
Oh, flip's sake!

634
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,653
I just realised. I didn't read it.
I put the fruit in here!

635
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,413
Hi, how are you? Not great.
How was the handshake?

636
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,533
It was amazing, but right now
I think I'm messing this up.

637
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,093
What do you think about this?
I don't know what that is.

638
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,200
I think he might
take his handshake back.

639
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,613
He does do it occasionally.

640
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,173
Oh, no.

641
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,093
OK, I'm going to have to
start again here.

642
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,533
Drain and dry the fruit.

643
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,213
Do need that to be quite dry.

644
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,653
It's going to look good
for my arms, this.

645
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,333
What biscuits do you like?
Ginger nut.

646
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,693
Ginger nuts? I'm boring.

647
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,893
But like a 30p pack of, you know,
ginger nuts, that'll do me. Yeah.

648
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,493
Do you like pink wafer? I do
actually quite like pink wafer.

649
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,773
Yeah, they're nice. Custard cream?
Yeah. Yeah.

650
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,493
Is there any biscuits
you don't like?

651
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,013
The garibaldi.

652
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,533
Forget it!

653
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,213
Do you know, this is actually
a lesson to learn.

654
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,333
I should pay attention
to the recipe.

655
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,733
I feel so silly.

656
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,253
I'm going to try to catch up
with everyone if I can.

657
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,133
Matt, do you wanna do
the time call, or shall I?

658
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,133
Noel, I'm Matt. That's Dave Plate.

659
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,653
All right,
I always get you two mixed up.

660
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,733
I'll do it. Bakers,
you are halfway through.

661
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,573
So, "Cut the dough in half

662
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,453
and roll out each piece
in a rectangle."

663
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,173
Looking at the sizes,
you've got to roll it quite thin.

664
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,653
I think that's good.
It's quite thin.

665
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,893
"Sprinkle evenly with the fruit."

666
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,453
Question is,
do they want all of the fruit?

667
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,453
Like, that's a fly graveyard.
Like, that's too many flies.

668
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,893
I don't know about you,
but when I've got a cup of tea

669
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,493
and I want a biscuit I always
imagine, "Mm, fly graveyards!"

670
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,573
Lay the second rectangle
of pastry on top.

671
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,733
Yeah, so that means it's just
basically dough, fruit, then dough.

672
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,573
Now I'm just going to
cut this into 12.

673
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,333
I'm going to mark it.

674
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,653
Now I've got to work it out now.
Is this maths now?

675
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,933
This is maths now which
I was never, ever good at.

676
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,813
Well, I don't feel I should stick
around for you doing maths. No.

677
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,933
If the rectangle's
nine centimetres wide

678
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,893
and there were 12 of them, then
3.5 centimetres times 12, 35...

679
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,813
I'm just going to do it roughly,
literally eyeball this thing.

680
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,133
I'm not sure this is maths,
what you're doing.

681
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,973
This is really... If maths
was more like this at school,

682
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,373
I probably would've liked it.
I know.

683
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,893
Sort of poking stuff
with a knife and mumbling.

684
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,653
I'm just going to cut them into 12.
Oh, no!

685
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,173
Wait, how many have you made?
I've made 24. Why?

686
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,533
It's what happens when you
don't know what you're doing.

687
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,213
Just going to freeze them together
and put them really close.

688
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,653
I would've left it in the fridge a
bit longer, but I need to catch up.

689
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,293
Right they're going in.
Oi, one, two, three.

690
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,133
Putting them in now. Ca-caw!

691
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,453
Here we go. OK, bake well.
Don't disappoint me guys.

692
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,693
Say a little prayer.

693
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,093
I also don't know how long
they're meant to take to bake.

694
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,013
Going to do ten minutes to start
with and see what happens.

695
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,373
I'm going to do 15 minutes.

696
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,773
I'm putting about 12 minutes,

697
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,133
because again I'm not
so sure what I'm looking for.

698
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,053
Once they kind of look like
biscuits, I'll just take them out.

699
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,413
I'll try to remember
how it looks like,

700
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,293
and then I will know
how long to bake it.

701
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,373
Oh! Hmm. I think I remember.

702
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,653
It's quite pale.

703
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,280
Hmm. I think I get it.

704
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,453
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

705
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,853
And I have no legs left.

706
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,933
I told you I was heavier
than I look. No, it's fine.

707
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,173
You weren't heavy at all.
I'm made of strontium.

708
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,693
I'm just going to go straight in.

709
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,493
I should've been going at this speed
from the start. Oh, my goodness.

710
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,653
The colour's looking nice.
Looking golden.

711
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,893
I think they're ready,
though, this is the thing.

712
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,493
Don't know if they're ready or not.

713
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,053
Don't think they're
meant to be golden brown,

714
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,373
I think they're meant
to be like a light toasted brown.

715
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,693
Yeah.

716
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,773
I'm probably going to bake
another five minutes,

717
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,773
and I know they don't need to be too
dark, but I want them to be golden.

718
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,533
They are looking... OK-ish.

719
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,373
I don't know if this will
eventually cool down

720
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,213
to be a much more tougher one
or would just stay like that.

721
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,693
Like soggy, because
that's not what I really want.

722
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,813
They stuck together really nicely.
They're not breaking.

723
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,880
So I'm quite happy that actually
I could save the situation.

724
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,213
Oh, these might be
too dark. Oh, dear.

725
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,840
They're brown enough.

726
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
Oy.

727
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,813
Bakers, you have
ten minutes remaining.

728
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,973
"Dip each side of
the biscuit into the chocolate."

729
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,013
I have never seen them
with chocolate on.

730
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,053
I have only ever had
garibaldi biscuits in a packet.

731
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,253
I'm just going to go for it.

732
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,613
Ugh. I'm not dipping.
I'll just drizzle.

733
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,373
They're just too fiddly to dip.

734
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,013
Oh, man, mine are breaking.

735
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,813
"Create feather decoration
using the white chocolate."

736
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,493
I'm piping my white chocolate
onto the dark chocolate,

737
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,853
and then I'll run
a cocktail stick through it.

738
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,853
It said feathering, I was like,
"What is feathering? What is that?"

739
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,853
I've got to make feathers
out of chocolate?

740
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,053
Trying to draw a feather that will
be going on top of the biscuit.

741
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,133
I am creating a feather decoration.

742
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,453
Prue said don't get creative,
just follow the instruction.

743
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,293
Bakers, you have one minute left.

744
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,573
It's an absolute mess, man,
like, oh, OK so bad.

745
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,653
I might actually do
the wrong feather.

746
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,333
It seems like everybody do
slightly differently with me.

747
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,373
Don't know if this is
going to set on time. Ah.

748
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,760
This is not happening.
It's the wrong feather.

749
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,333
Bakers, your time is up.

750
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,373
Please bring your garibaldis
down to the gingham table

751
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,693
and place them behind
your photographs.

752
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,933
Or if you're not proud
of what you've done,

753
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,613
behind someone else's photo.

754
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,280
Oh, wow. Actual feathers.

755
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,720
Who's done a whole feather?
That looks amazing.

756
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,813
OK, bakers, it's time
to invite the judges back in.

757
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,253
Hello, bakers.

758
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,773
Prue and Paul are expecting 12 crisp
golden-brown garibaldi biscuits

759
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,293
packed with dried fruit

760
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,013
and exquisitely decorated
with feathered chocolate.

761
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,360
Oh, that's wonderful,
look at that feathers. Wonderful.

762
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,653
Start with number one.
Nice feathering.

763
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,120
But the actual biscuit looks...
not too bad, it's nice and thin.

764
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,253
The biscuit's a little too soft. Mm.

765
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,293
And the chocolate's a bit too thick.
But I must say it tastes good.

766
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,973
The flavour's OK though, yeah.
Just a little bit soft.

767
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,093
Moving on to this one.
Very nice feathering. Mm.

768
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,613
You can actually see
the currants coming through. Yeah.

769
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,960
I quite like that.

770
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,453
Very soft again.
I think that's a lot to do with

771
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,573
not drying the fruit out properly.

772
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,053
So it's soaking in. Mm.

773
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,253
Then it's been absorbed
into the biscuit itself.

774
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,293
It's a bit puddingy,
but it is delicious. Mm.

775
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,573
Moving on to this next one.

776
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,333
We've actually got
a feather on the top.

777
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,733
That's quite original and witty.

778
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,413
It's ridiculous, that's what it is.

779
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,573
That's genius, Paul.

780
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,973
It's not what we asked for, though.

781
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,053
They're thin and it has stayed
in the middle. It's a bit soft.

782
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,693
Right, this one is...

783
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,933
They're very uneven, the biscuits.
That one is a bit peculiar.

784
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,853
Yeah. Tastes good.

785
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,013
Nice, crisp pastry, though.

786
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,813
These are a bit thick
with the chocolate.

787
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,453
But the feathering's good.
The feathering's nice.

788
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,013
Nice and crisp. Mm.

789
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,693
It's a good biscuit, that.

790
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,973
These look quite thick.
They're not the right size.

791
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,613
They're not flat and rectangular.

792
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,213
No. They're buttery,
the dough is lovely and buttery.

793
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,693
You could've got more out of them
if you'd rolled it flat.

794
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,973
Rolled them out thinner.
These are fingers.

795
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,333
A lot of chocolate on there.

796
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,213
But they look as if
they're properly baked.

797
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,253
Mm. They are crispy.

798
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,213
Taste is good, just they're
the wrong shape and too thick.

799
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,813
Moving on to... This is not good.
..this mess.

800
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,613
Wow. There's more chocolate

801
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,453
on the plate
than there is on the biscuits.

802
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,733
What is that? It's going to
taste lovely, I promise you.

803
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,813
It needed longer in the oven.
I think that's one of the problems.

804
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,453
I think that's ONE of the problems.

805
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,493
I think the feather is the other one
and the chocolate is the other.

806
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,013
It needed longer
in the oven as well.

807
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,293
Right, look at these.

808
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,213
Chocolate's all over the place.
And the wrong shape.

809
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,453
Nice and crisp, but they are
a little overbaked. Bit rustic.

810
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,053
Very thick, aren't they?

811
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,373
Nicely baked.

812
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,853
This is more the shape.
It's like they've made, uh, two.

813
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,293
They're doubles.

814
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,693
Do you think I've got too much?
Going to join them together.

815
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,413
I think, yeah.

816
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,733
They taste all right.
It's nice and thin.

817
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,333
Looks a bit messy,
but the bake is right. Mm.

818
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,653
Paul and Prue will now rank
the garibaldis from worst to best.

819
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,213
In 11th place we have this one.

820
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,613
Abdul. It looks a mess.

821
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,573
In tenth spot we have this one. Ah.

822
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,453
I genuinely thought it's a feather.

823
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,973
It's fine.
They're very good feathers,

824
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,093
but we'd just like to see it
in the chocolate.

825
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,733
And the biscuit was a bit soft.

826
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,133
And in ninth place
we have this one.

827
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,213
Dawn, you overbaked them.

828
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,573
Kevin takes eighth place,
Maisam seventh, Janusz is sixth,

829
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,933
Maxy fifth and Carole comes fourth.

830
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,853
In third place we have this one.

831
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,293
Oh, sorry it's me.

832
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,213
Sandro, the only problem was
the little bit too much chocolate.

833
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,213
In second we have this one.
Whose is this?

834
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,293
James, feathering was really good

835
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,413
and it just needed couple more
minutes in the oven.

836
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,600
And this one is first place. Rebs.

837
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,973
The feathering is perfect.

838
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,800
The bake is good. Lovely. Thank you.

839
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,973
I don't know how that happened.

840
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,813
I really don't know
how that happened.

841
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,173
Yes. I did feel really bad though
cos I could hear both Syabira

842
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,893
and Abdul talking about feathers.

843
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,013
I just really wanted
to like show them like

844
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,333
what feathering is,
cos they would've done so well.

845
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,693
Oh, man, it looked like
a kid made it. Oh.

846
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,213
Behind me. It's behind me.

847
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,893
Disaster, I would say.

848
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,253
I need to make a statement
with my show stopper

849
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,333
so I'm staying
rather than leaving tomorrow.

850
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,080
But I think it's very funny.

851
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,973
Just the show stopper remains
before Paul

852
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,973
and Prue decide who
will be leaving the tent

853
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,573
and who will be crowned star baker.

854
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,533
For your show stopper challenge,

855
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,893
Paul and Prue would
like you each to make

856
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,373
a beautifully crafted
3D biscuit mask.

857
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,533
You can use any style of biscuit.

858
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,813
It has to taste
fantastic, obviously.

859
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,093
but the most important thing
is that it has

860
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,493
to stand upright on a stand
at the end of the challenge.

861
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,093
You have four hours.

862
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,773
On your masks...

863
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,400
Get set... Bake!

864
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,853
I am a bit nervous.

865
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,053
Definitely feel like
I'm not in a good position,

866
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,013
so that definitely
puts me under pressure.

867
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,253
I love TV and I love TV dramas.

868
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,853
You know it's going to be
a good episode when they whip out

869
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,373
the masquerade ball, there's going
to be something drama happens.

870
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,693
Of course we are asking
for extravagance and ostentation

871
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,493
and show-stoppery madness
with this bake,

872
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,653
but as ever,
the things that really matter

873
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,053
are the flavour and the texture.

874
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,133
This is quite a tricky challenge.

875
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,493
I think choosing your biscuit
is very, very important.

876
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,973
We want the masks
to be able to stand up.

877
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,253
Most of the bakers
will probably go with

878
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,773
a ginger biscuit
or indeed a sugar biscuit.

879
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,613
The sugar in a biscuit gives it
snap, but rigidity as well.

880
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,533
Butter will make it
soft like a cookie

881
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,533
and it will fall apart.
Obviously we want a 3D mask.

882
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,453
But it's up to them
what they produce.

883
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,253
Are they going to
fill that time properly

884
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,293
with lots of flavours
and lots of colour,

885
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,533
or is it going to be quite simple
and they're going to play it safe?

886
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,933
Hi, Dawn. Hello.
Hello, Dawn. Hello.

887
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,493
Right, Dawn, tell us
all about your mask.

888
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,133
It's a bit kind of baroque.

889
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,253
But with a bit of sort
of steampunk kind of...

890
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,973
Steam punk and baroque.

891
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,493
Yeah, mixed. Wow.

892
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,053
Dawn's ambitious gingerbread mask
will be decorated

893
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,333
with lemon shortbread cogs
and wheels,

894
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,213
intricate royal icing piping

895
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,253
and a flamboyant crown made from
purple Vietnamese rice paper.

896
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,813
I mean, you're not going to eat

897
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,493
the rice paper sails cos
they'll be really chewy. I will.

898
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,200
Oh. Good luck.

899
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,013
Hello, Abdul, how are you?
Hello, I'm good.

900
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,573
You came last in the technical.
I was shocked. Yes.

901
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,213
Were you shocked?

902
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,813
I was absolutely shocked, man.

903
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,133
What mask are you doing?

904
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,693
So I'm doing a mask based
on my parrot that I used

905
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,613
to have growing up. A parrot?

906
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,173
Yeah, it was an African Senegal.

907
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,973
We called him Motu,
which means, er... Chubby.

908
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,093
OK. Er, because... Chubby parrot.

909
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,213
Yeah, chubby parrot because, uh,
he had like a... Fat feathers. Yes!

910
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,613
Abdul's chubby parrot
will be made up of

911
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,053
a gingerbread base

912
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,333
decorated with over 90
individual biscuit feathers

913
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,573
in his favourite
Middle Eastern flavours.

914
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,893
90 biscuits?

915
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,973
Abdul, I hope you haven't bitten off
more than you can chew.

916
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,613
Well, you see, I'm trying to
give it my best so hopefully,

917
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,933
hopefully the taste is good.

918
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,973
Good luck. Thank you so much.

919
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,573
90? Wow. 90 biscuits.

920
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,973
That's exactly the green
my parrot had.

921
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,773
I think he had like a double
personality disorder or something.

922
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,653
Because he would be adorable
at one point

923
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,973
and then all of
a sudden he would just bite you.

924
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,293
But Abdul's parrot

925
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,853
isn't the only mask
with a split personality.

926
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,333
My mask today
is about two face, one soul,

927
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,853
so I believe everybody have
a dark side and a good side.

928
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,133
Are these the two sides
of your character, Syabira?

929
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,973
Yes. Or the two sides of the judges?

930
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,160
I believe you all are very lovely.

931
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,613
Syabira's lemon and jasmine
gingerbread mask will be adorned

932
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,093
with dozens of chocolate
sandwich biscuits on one side,

933
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,653
and the other side decorated
with heart-shaped orange,

934
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,093
rose and pistachio
shortbread biscuits

935
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,653
and a crown of pistachio
and rose macaron.

936
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,533
You're doing a lot
of work here, Syabira.

937
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,373
You're making over
100 biscuits, aren't you?

938
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,733
Abdul, you've got competition.

939
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,493
While Syabira and Abdul have adopted
the more is more approach...

940
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,853
I can do this.

941
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,773
..Maisam is planning
on keeping things simple.

942
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,853
So, I've made the, er,

943
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,333
gingerbread dough which is
the main structure of the mask.

944
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,893
I'm basically going to treat this
like a blank canvas

945
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,533
and just paint over it.

946
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,133
Maisam's gingerbread mask
will be highly decorated,

947
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,053
with royal icing,

948
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,413
isomalt shards and
a couple of decorative coconut

949
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,973
and lemon shortbread biscuits.

950
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,653
So, just two kinds of biscuits?

951
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,893
Two kinds of biscuits. yes.

952
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,973
And lots of decoration.

953
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,493
And lots of decoration.
I really wanna do well, I wanna...

954
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,613
I wanna step it up
and show my artistic side.

955
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,493
I hope it turns out like that.

956
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,413
OK.
Good luck. Thank you. Thank you.

957
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,533
Maisam isn't the only baker
channelling their inner artist.

958
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,453
I'm making today
a cubism-inspired mask.

959
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,293
It's something completely abstract.

960
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,973
I'm going for an abstract mask,
so it's not...

961
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,933
It's based on my face...
It's not my face.

962
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,373
Janusz's face will be made up of

963
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,933
a spiced Polish biscuit base
with a matcha

964
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,533
and vanilla shortbread nose

965
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,493
and two strawberry sugar biscuits,

966
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,853
decorated with brightly
coloured fondant

967
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,093
to bring his cubist-inspired
mask to life.

968
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,013
Did you go to art school?

969
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,933
Unfortunately, I didn't.

970
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,493
I've got my eye on some
of your art. Oh, have you?

971
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,413
Yeah.
I'll do you some.

972
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,253
Thank you.
Oh, I want one.

973
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,373
Just moved into a new flat
so I want something weirder.

974
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,533
Oh, really.
Like something cool.

975
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,693
All right, it's a deal.
Everyone comes and be like...

976
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,253
You two, as you're
my two favourites -

977
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,373
don't say that out loud cos
people'll get jealous.

978
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,040
Everyone...!

979
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,973
Janusz may have taken his
inspiration from

980
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,493
the art galleries of Paris,

981
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,253
but Maxy's muse is
a little closer to home.

982
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,053
I'm really into carnival
and soca music

983
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,893
and stuff so I thought I'd make
a mask that ties in with that.

984
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,173
I was going to make an African
mask but I chose to do this

985
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,493
because... nice and colourful.

986
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,613
With its multicoloured
tuile feathers,

987
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,813
Maxy's highly embellished
coconut and lime biscuit mask

988
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,973
wouldn't look out of place amongst

989
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,413
the flamboyant costumes
of Notting Hill Carnival.

990
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,093
I've always been quite drunk when
I've been at carnival.

991
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,253
Really? Yeah, so it's just
a blur of colours to me.

992
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,053
And noise. Just like...
Oh, wow!

993
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,573
Maxy isn't the only baker bringing
carnival vibes into the tent today.

994
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,213
I'm doing like a carnival mask.
Erm...

995
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,973
And I'm trying to make the mask
a bit like,

996
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,933
like feminine masculine type mask.
A bit like me.

997
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,693
Fighting the gender
stereotypes here.

998
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,653
With a sturdy gingerbread base,

999
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,733
Sandro's carnival mask will
feature shards of strawberry

1000
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,933
and elderflower sugar biscuits,
sculptural isomalt,

1001
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,533
dozens of white chocolate roses
and ornate gold piping.

1002
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,973
If you can achieve that
delicacy it will be amazing.

1003
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,933
I definitely will.
I mean that's the aim,

1004
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,133
cos I'm quite keen on detail.

1005
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,813
So I really wanna prove
that I can actually do it.

1006
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,373
Whilst the devil is in the detail
for Sandro,

1007
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,573
Rebs has more structural
issues in mind.

1008
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,053
It's hard cos you want it
to be thin so it's nice

1009
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,253
to eat but not too thin that
it breaks.

1010
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,653
Rebs is going for
a Venetian-style mask

1011
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,293
with whisky snap decorations

1012
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,293
and an intricate royal icing.

1013
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,773
To ensure it fits snugly on its

1014
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,133
stand she's shaping her gingerbread
base with an unconventional mould.

1015
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,093
So, my mould's actually, er,

1016
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,773
my dog's old water bottle that
I took a hammer to.

1017
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,933
I'll get her a new one after
this maybe.

1018
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,493
Using a face-shaped mould should
enable the bakers

1019
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,133
to achieve the three dimensional

1020
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,813
masks that the judges
are expecting.

1021
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,773
my mum used to watch these plastic
surgery programmes like all the kind

1022
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,253
of reconstructive surgery

1023
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,453
and it kind of reminds me
of that a little bit.

1024
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,973
It's not going to be macabre.

1025
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,533
Well, I say that - I suppose
it is a little bit.

1026
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,173
But it's not without its risks.

1027
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,013
Worried about it breaking.
That's my worry.

1028
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,653
Overwork the dough at this stage

1029
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,453
and the biscuits could be tough
to eat.

1030
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,733
Right, where's your gob?

1031
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,693
But if they're not moulded enough,

1032
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,973
the masks could lose
their shape in the oven.

1033
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,413
Bye-bye little face, be good.

1034
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,813
But if making a mask

1035
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,013
out of gingerbread wasn't
nerve-racking enough...

1036
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,213
I just hope he doesn't crack.

1037
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,573
All that effort.

1038
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,333
..James is attempting
to construct his mask from

1039
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,893
the most notoriously
brittle biscuit of all.

1040
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,533
So, I'm using a brandy snap.

1041
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,893
I'm expecting a little bit
of breakage.

1042
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,173
They are so fragile.

1043
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,493
Wait and see how they
hold together!

1044
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,453
Inspired by a creature from one

1045
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,973
of his favourite horror movies,

1046
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,013
James' brandysnap mask will
need to bear

1047
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,653
the weight of coffee buttercream,

1048
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,373
chocolate eyes and spiced
fortune cookies.

1049
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,933
Not going to lie -
if I was going to make

1050
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,053
Pan's Labyrinth-y
horror creature...

1051
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,453
Yeah.
..not sure I'd use brandysnaps.

1052
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,480
Feel like if Prue blinks,
the whole thing will, like...

1053
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,853
Me and my daughter are
addicted to musicals.

1054
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,413
One of my favourite ones was
The Phantom Of The Opera.

1055
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,613
And one of my favourite songs
in that is Masquerade.

1056
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,333
You know, when they're coming down
the set...

1057
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,853
# Masquerade, do-dee, do-do-dee-doo

1058
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,573
# Masquerade... #

1059
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,893
Carole's musical-inspired mask upon
a mask will be topped with

1060
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,533
a crown of orange zest
tuile feathers

1061
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,493
and highly decorated with
a fondant mask and brooch

1062
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,253
and dozens of mini macarons that

1063
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,093
will frame her
painted gingerbread face.

1064
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,213
You seem to have lard on your bench.

1065
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,653
Did you put lard into
the gingerbread?

1066
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,333
Yeah.
Really?

1067
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,093
Have you got butter
in there as well? No.

1068
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,693
Just lard?
Yeah.

1069
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,653
It's gonna be quite heavy,
so where's the...

1070
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,213
How's that going to be standing up?

1071
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,013
It's... I've got a, erm...

1072
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,373
..plate stand.

1073
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,613
And it just leans against it.
Yeah.

1074
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,973
OK. Good luck. Thank you.

1075
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,533
Good luck.

1076
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,533
So far, so...
He is cracking a bit

1077
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,053
but we can cover that over,
don't worry.

1078
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:31,253
The bakers must judge when their
biscuits are baked to perfection.

1079
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,493
Three more minutes.

1080
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,253
Don't wanna overbake it.

1081
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,733
I don't wanna underbake it either.

1082
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,373
Overdone and they'll be hard
and unpleasant to eat.

1083
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,773
He's starting to go brown now.
There - think he's cooked.

1084
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,613
Underdone, and they could
collapse once assembled.

1085
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,613
Just keep it together, lassie.

1086
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,413
So, it's kind of really fragile.

1087
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,653
When it cools it will get
a long stronger.

1088
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,653
But for Rebs...
It doesn't look great, does it?

1089
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,560
..disaster has already struck in
the oven.

1090
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,333
It's broken.

1091
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm going to have to do it again -
I don't have time to.

1092
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,493
Oh, my days.

1093
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,840
This isn't good, this isn't good.

1094
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,333
Through way half you are bakers!

1095
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,213
Sorry, he's on reverse setting.

1096
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,733
Bakers, you are halfway through!

1097
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,253
That's better.

1098
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,973
A broken mask means Rebs is
falling behind.

1099
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,773
So, I'm starting my biscuit mask
from scratch.

1100
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,013
Just hope second time works.

1101
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,693
For the other bakers...

1102
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,333
Right, next!

1103
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,213
..time to move on to
their decorative biscuits.

1104
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,413
The butterflies, not 100% how
I wanted them to be, but...

1105
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,493
..with the royal icing, it'll work.

1106
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,333
So, this matcha biscuit will be
for the nose of the mask.

1107
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,013
So, my nose is the 3D element.

1108
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,533
That is my orange rose
pistachio biscuits

1109
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,373
and then after that I'll reduce

1110
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,973
the oven temperature
and do my macaron.

1111
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,533
The bake on the macaron shells were
good in the first challenge.

1112
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,853
It was just the decoration that
I didn't finish.

1113
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,013
I want to redeem myself
a wee bit after

1114
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,413
the first challenge.
It wasn't a great first challenge.

1115
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,893
Kevin's macarons will form

1116
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,293
barnacles on the face of

1117
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,253
his mythical siren mask, complete

1118
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,173
with gingerbread starfish,

1119
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,653
brandysnap seaweed

1120
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,213
and an isomalt crown.

1121
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,093
Look at that. Peppermint visage!

1122
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,493
Who is she?

1123
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,013
She is a siren.

1124
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,733
So, these mythical
creatures from the sea.

1125
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,053
Who lure you in onto the rocks.

1126
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,840
Yeah.
Sirens onto the rocks.

1127
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,973
It's a beautiful story that you've
brought into the Bake Off tent!

1128
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,733
Yeah. One for the kids.

1129
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,973
This, this is basically what you
wanna do, innit?

1130
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,413
Yeah.
Lure Paul in with your bakes.

1131
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,733
# Ah! #

1132
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,613
And then smash him on the rocks.

1133
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,013
Smash him on the rocks!

1134
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,893
As Rebs' remade mask finally hits
the oven...

1135
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,373
I'm a bit behind.

1136
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,773
But I'm not going to let it panic
me because there's no point.

1137
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,733
..the other bakers...
Stay.

1138
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,173
..are ready to start bringing
theirs to life with decoration.

1139
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,693
So, I'm just kind of starting
to get some of the piping on.

1140
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,973
Bakers...!

1141
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,613
Are you coming in?

1142
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,213
Are you...? Oh.

1143
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,853
Bakers, you have one hour left.

1144
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,053
So, what I'm doing now
I'm just covering it with

1145
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,653
a very thin layer of buttercream

1146
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,840
because that's where
fondant's going to go.

1147
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,733
I think this part is, is
so therapeutic, so relaxing.

1148
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,800
I feel like I'm doing such
a messy job.

1149
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,293
It looks terrible right now

1150
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,880
but it should look like
a mask once I cut it.

1151
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,653
I love this stuff.

1152
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,413
It's Vietnamese rice paper.
Wow.

1153
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,933
It's what they wrap kind
of spring rolls in

1154
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,453
but it's not cooked,
obviously, it's just...

1155
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,533
But Paul said he's going
to eat it as is.

1156
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,773
Yeah, he says he's going to eat it.
I hope he doesn't.

1157
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,093
Paul can eat anything.

1158
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,293
I saw him eat a spanner once.
Oh, dear.

1159
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,973
He's like a tiger shark.

1160
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,053
She looks really messy right now

1161
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,093
but she's going to look gorgeous,
I promise you.

1162
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,613
Oh, this is so stressful.

1163
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,253
This is not,
not an exciting task. Oh!

1164
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,253
This is the finished design

1165
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,040
and I'm just adding in
the finishing touches.

1166
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,653
Yeah!

1167
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,773
There is a side of me that's, like,
why you've finished this

1168
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,493
so early, you could
do something else?

1169
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,453
But then, er, when I look at my
design I think I'm happy with it

1170
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,453
but I don't know what
the other bakers have made.

1171
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,360
So, it could still be
a lot better than mine.

1172
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:31,333
Bakers, you have 400,619
grains of sand left.

1173
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,560
Or... half an hour.

1174
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,000
Right - brooches and paintwork.

1175
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,080
Let's make it pretty.

1176
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,093
So, what else is there left to do,
you seem to be pretty much...?

1177
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,813
For the first time
ever I'm ahead of time.

1178
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,253
Yeah. So what are you going
to do with the extra time?

1179
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,733
Will you go to the shops maybe?
Maybe, yeah. Maybe Google.

1180
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,133
What would you buy?

1181
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,173
Google some masks.
Some masks? Yeah.

1182
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,453
Well, it's a bit late for that.
You've already made it.

1183
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,333
I really would like
to be further ahead

1184
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,453
but I've got to pipe all
the decorations on.

1185
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:06,253
There is a moment when the mask is
the worst thing that's ever existed,

1186
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,493
and you just have
to push through it.

1187
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,333
You have a little
bit of time left...

1188
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,533
Yes... to apply the
remainder of your 90 biscuits.

1189
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,373
Yes. It's a delicate
time this, isn't it?

1190
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,973
It is, yes, I have,
what, 20 minutes left?

1191
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,613
Yeah, and you need a steady hand.

1192
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,253
Oh, boy.

1193
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,720
I'm shaking. Oh!

1194
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,213
I'm doing five different colours
of buttercream

1195
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,853
to add some texture to the hair.

1196
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,493
Oh! There's something
inside the fortune cookies.

1197
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,773
There is.

1198
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,973
I have wee horror movie cliches
that I've been sticking in.

1199
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,453
Wow. I can't wait to see
it all when it's finished.

1200
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,493
Me, neither. Be the first time!

1201
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,373
What, you didn't do it in practice?

1202
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,813
First one was awful,

1203
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,773
second one it fell
immediately I finished it.

1204
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,880
Third time lucky. Yeah, exactly.
Here we go, here we go!

1205
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,733
Bakers, you have ten
minutes remaining.

1206
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,853
OK.

1207
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,133
It's not perfect
but it could be worse.

1208
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,693
I'll be happy once it
is upright on the model

1209
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,693
and doesn't break.

1210
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,400
It's a big if.

1211
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,973
The judges are expecting
the delicate masks

1212
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,240
to be presented standing upright.

1213
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,933
Stay.
Please stay together.

1214
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,693
Only now will

1215
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,093
the bakers find out if their
biscuits are robust enough

1216
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,573
to hold their own weight.

1217
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,333
Oh, you're kidding.
OK, I can do it,

1218
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,133
I can do it.
Just broken all the seaweed off.

1219
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,840
So I'm desperately quickly melting
some isomalt to stick it back on.

1220
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,400
Got a macaron that's loose.

1221
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,360
That's it.

1222
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,213
It's on.

1223
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,693
Anybody want any help?
Are you finished?

1224
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,653
You finished?
Yeah.

1225
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,040
I think I'm OK at
the minute, thank you.

1226
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,173
SHE GASPS

1227
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,013
Oh, it's fallen.

1228
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,773
Oh, no!

1229
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,853
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

1230
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,493
Oh, no this one has cracked.
This one has cracked? Yes.

1231
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,880
Whose?
Carole.

1232
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,493
Is she crying?

1233
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,093
Oh, mate.

1234
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,933
Oh, not Carole.

1235
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,453
Oh, I might cry. I might cry.

1236
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,333
Carole, do you need some help?

1237
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,653
Well, you can't mend that.

1238
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,293
Is she all right?

1239
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,213
Don't worry about it. You can do it.
It just collapsed.

1240
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,733
Carole, don't panic.

1241
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,533
Yeah, how can you mend it?

1242
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,133
You can't.
I was so pleased with it.

1243
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,133
I know.
Really pleased.

1244
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,733
But it's still beautiful
and it still looks amazing.

1245
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:55,333
What you don't wanna do now is
panic. Have a minute to just calm.

1246
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,573
I think it's OK. I,
I don't think it'll go anywhere.

1247
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,373
Oh, no!

1248
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,013
One just snapped off.

1249
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,933
These biscuits keep breaking on me.

1250
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,440
This is so fragile.

1251
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,973
Oh, my word, why is
my hand shaking so much?

1252
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,533
Oh, would you stop shaking!

1253
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,773
Oh, my days, what do I do,
what do I do, what do I do?

1254
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,613
Oh!

1255
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,933
Keep on breaking the edges.

1256
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,093
Bit terrified about it sort
of falling apart before

1257
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,813
the judges get to see it.

1258
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,520
I'm going to need someone's help
here, please, sorry. OK.

1259
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,320
Wow. It's amazing.
It's a functioning mask.

1260
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,213
I don't want it to be too tight or
too loose.

1261
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,893
OK, I'm going to try
if that hides that,

1262
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,133
if you let go gently.

1263
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,973
If you let go gently and see...

1264
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,013
It's OK, it's OK.
Yeah. Don't touch.

1265
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,760
Bakers, you're time is up.

1266
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,440
Please step away from your masks.

1267
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,253
Oh, yours looks like
a piece of art.

1268
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,173
It's a LGBT mask.

1269
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,613
Oh, you are representing!
Yeah, that's what I mean.

1270
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,560
Don't worry, you've got this,
you've got this.

1271
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,973
My little baby.
I don't wanna see you cry.

1272
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,813
No - Mummy crying.

1273
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,933
THEY LAUGH
Yeah, this time it's you!

1274
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,880
Mummy crying.

1275
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:21,773
It's judgment time for
the bakers' biscuit masks.

1276
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,640
Syabira, would you like to bring
up your showstopper?

1277
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,453
Well, that's impressive.

1278
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,973
The detail you've managed to get

1279
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,813
and the texture that you've managed
to achieve, it's very clever.

1280
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,613
I think it's astonishing.

1281
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:44,653
On the left side is orange
rose pistache biscuits.

1282
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,933
And on the right side is
the chocolate sandwich biscuit.

1283
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,133
The chocolate cookies are delicious.

1284
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,333
Proper chocolate, rich, indulgent.

1285
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,653
Very nice shortbread.

1286
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,373
There's always a danger with
rose that it tastes artificial.

1287
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,333
Anyway, it's lovely.

1288
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,893
The mask biscuit, it's not
particularly strong in lemon.

1289
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,773
But having said that, I think

1290
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,813
all your other biscuits are
amazing, and what a design.

1291
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,880
Excellent, Syabira, well done.
Thank you so much.

1292
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,613
It is exceptionally pretty, and you
can wear it, can you?

1293
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,053
You can, yeah.

1294
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,560
I'd like to see you wear it,
Paul, I really would.

1295
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,893
Aha!
These are what?

1296
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,653
Strawberry
and elderflower sugar biscuits,

1297
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,213
covered in white chocolate.

1298
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,893
It's absolutely delicious.

1299
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,213
That's a really fresh
kick of strawberry.

1300
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,680
With the white chocolate, it works
really well. Exceptional job.

1301
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,280
It is a real horror story!

1302
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,253
I think you've done an amazing
job. The detail in it is incredible.

1303
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,853
It's a brandy snap base.

1304
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,933
There's fortune cookies on the top
that each have a horror movie

1305
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,733
cliche in them.

1306
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,093
"Ask for directions."
From the cannibal movies, yeah.

1307
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,880
And it's a Italian meringue
buttercream with coffee through it.

1308
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,013
Delicious. Brandy snap is good.
They're really crispy.

1309
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,213
I think overall, you've done
a fantastic job to create that.

1310
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,533
Lots of thought, lots of different
techniques, quite effective,

1311
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,920
well done.

1312
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,133
It has brandy snap
seaweed on one side,

1313
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,560
macaron barnacles on the other,
and gingerbread starfish.

1314
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,613
Not much of a macaron.
Nice flavour, but over-baked, yeah.

1315
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,613
Brandy snap is good. This is
a sugared biscuit? Flavoured with...

1316
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,533
With pepper.
..Sichuan pepper.

1317
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,893
I've never had that before,
I really like that.

1318
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,440
I think you pulled it off.
The whole thing is a joy.

1319
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,013
To have achieved that much accuracy

1320
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,973
and delicacy without piping
is quite amazing.

1321
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,093
It's a 3D mosaic, isn't it?
Mm.

1322
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,453
This is the tahini.

1323
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,613
Yes.
Texture is wonderful, very short.

1324
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:56,853
I find the tahini flavour
so unusual, but I think it works.

1325
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,133
And this one?
This is sumac.

1326
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,093
That's a great biscuit as well.
Mm.

1327
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,693
There's a lovely zing to it.

1328
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,093
Abdul, you have
done an exceptional job.

1329
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,560
Tastes great.

1330
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,653
I must say, I think
it looks totally amazing,

1331
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,613
it's like a little
burst of happiness.

1332
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,613
I think the design is very good.

1333
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,773
I love the amount of detail you've
managed to get out of it as well.

1334
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,733
But what do the biscuits taste like?

1335
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:27,653
It's a lemon, lime
and coconut sugar biscuit...

1336
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,573
..decorated with petals.

1337
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,013
These are very good.
They're really beautiful.

1338
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,120
What about these biscuits?
Florentines?

1339
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,653
Really nice.
Florentines are good as well.

1340
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:43,533
Overall, fantastic design, great
flavours, and well thought through.

1341
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,973
And very good texture, which
is the difficult thing. Mm.

1342
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,133
Thank you. Thanks.

1343
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,880
Well done, Maxy. Thank you.

1344
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,613
I think the steampunk bit
is absolutely wonderful,

1345
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,133
the definition of the little
cogs and everything is terrific.

1346
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,093
I just would have quite liked to
be able to see out of the mask.

1347
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,973
You needed to cut the eyes out.
I can do that for you.

1348
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,720
Yeah, go ahead!

1349
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,733
Not getting much
lemon from the biscuits,

1350
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,133
but I like the taste of
your ginger biscuit. Right.

1351
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,613
It's got a beautiful
blend of ginger and spices.

1352
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,013
I agree, I think the
gingerbread is delicious.

1353
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,333
I think you've done a
really good job. Yeah, well done.

1354
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,760
Thanks.

1355
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,733
Clever. Well, it's certainly
the most perfect example of Cubism.

1356
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,693
Yeah, try this one.
This is a Polish spiced biscuit.

1357
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,733
That's Christmas right there.
I love that.

1358
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,413
Punches you between the eyes
with the flavour.

1359
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,680
You very much.
Thank you.

1360
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,373
We had a little bit of a problem
right at the end.

1361
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,733
It's a shame.

1362
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,000
I mean, I can see the detail that's
gone into it. Now, your recipe...

1363
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,213
The amount of lard that's gone
in there, it's not stable enough.

1364
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,653
You can see how soft it is, I've
not put much pressure on that.

1365
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,293
If you'd baked it a little bit
longer, it may have helped.

1366
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,293
But you know what,
the piping is beautiful -

1367
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,973
and what are these made of?

1368
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:06,333
So, you've got almond macarons
and orange zest twirls.

1369
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,773
Oh, they're lovely.

1370
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,653
The macarons are delicious as well.
Mm.

1371
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,253
Really get the almond in there.

1372
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,973
It's a shame,
because it is beautiful,

1373
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,693
and I love the taste of those
and those.

1374
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,280
Beautiful.

1375
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,373
I think it's very charming.

1376
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,493
It's perhaps a little small..

1377
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,933
Yeah.

1378
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,773
I think you could have done more.

1379
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,253
And it is small.

1380
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,253
Tell me the flavour of the biscuit?

1381
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,520
So, it's like a mixed spice biscuit.

1382
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:37,373
I think the spices are too
hot for a ginger biscuit.

1383
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,013
It's quite soft.

1384
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,093
In fact it's very soft, it's more
cookie-like than it is biscuit-like.

1385
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,973
I think you could
be a fascinator designer.

1386
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,853
Or a... milliner.

1387
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,293
Mm. Thank you.

1388
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,280
Thank you, Rebs.

1389
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,653
It's pretty, I like the colours,
it's vibrant.

1390
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,013
Remind us of the biscuit again?

1391
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,493
It's gingerbread.
Quite thick. Mm.

1392
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,333
But I think it's baked OK.

1393
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,293
I love the butterfly biscuit.

1394
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,213
It's a nice design,
it's simple but effective.

1395
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:09,173
I think in an ideal world I'd have
liked you to do just a little

1396
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,733
bit more.

1397
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,920
Thank you.
Thank you.

1398
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,413
I don't know, I wouldn't say
I'm in a safe position.

1399
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,813
I could have done a lot more
with the time that I had.

1400
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:25,333
But I definitely done something
that I'm proud of.

1401
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:29,093
If I do go through,
it will be by the skin of my teeth.

1402
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,493
You know, I did
have a good day yesterday,

1403
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,360
but is it enough to keep me in?

1404
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,053
Don't know.

1405
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,253
I definitely do
focus on the negatives more than

1406
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,373
the positives, but I don't think
that there were that many positives

1407
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,760
to focus on, so just hope that my
technical kind of helps me a bit.

1408
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,493
It's decision time for
Prue and Paul.

1409
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,333
Who will be crowned Star Baker

1410
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,893
and whose time in the tent
has come to an end?

1411
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,613
Well, those masks were pretty
impressive, weren't they? Amazing.

1412
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,533
You know, this lot are really
imaginative.

1413
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:08,613
I thought James's bake was very
inventive, wasn't it? Oh, amazing.

1414
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:11,493
I mean, really clever, and I
thought his flavours were great.

1415
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,933
I mean, he could get Star Baker.
Yeah, I think he's in line

1416
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,613
for Star Baker,
I think Maxy is in line.

1417
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,933
Has Syabira done enough
to go up there?

1418
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,173
Possibly, but
she struggled in the technical.

1419
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,133
So, Carole is obviously in trouble.

1420
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,973
She chose the wrong recipe
for that mask, it was too thick,

1421
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,693
it was underbaked, too much lard,
it just collapsed.

1422
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,573
I think Maisam is in trouble.

1423
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:33,253
I mean, her mask was OK,
I can't really go past that.

1424
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,053
Compared to the others,
she wasn't up there.

1425
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,653
I think it looked really good and I
thought Rebs' looked really good,

1426
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,853
but when you looked around the room
and you saw, you know,

1427
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,373
shape-wise, what Maxy had
done, what Abdul had done,

1428
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,813
then you realise that in this show
you do have to go the extra mile.

1429
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,173
I think precisely for that reason,
I think

1430
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,653
you've got to put Rebs, Maisam
and Carole...

1431
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,053
Yeah, exactly.
..right down the bottom.

1432
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,520
And I think it's one of those
three that will be leaving.

1433
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,933
It's not easy to pick a
Star Baker this week,

1434
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,453
because everybody did a great job.

1435
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,853
But we have to pick one of you.

1436
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,560
So, the Star Baker this week is...

1437
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,093
..Maxy.

1438
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,600
APPLAUSE

1439
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:23,933
Oh!

1440
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,573
That leaves me with the horrible
job of announcing the person

1441
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,733
who's leaving us, which
is extra horrible

1442
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,773
because I feel like we've got to
know you all so well, so quickly.

1443
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,560
But the person who is leaving
us... is...

1444
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,000
..Maisam.

1445
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,920
I'm sorry.

1446
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:58,813
I think I'm definitely proud,
because obviously I'm only 18.

1447
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,133
So, at this age, I've definitely
done something to be proud of,

1448
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,333
and this is definitely not
the end of my baking journey.

1449
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,453
It's where it starts.

1450
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,893
You got on the Great British
Bake Off. At 18 years old.

1451
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,613
Not a lot of people do that.
Certainly not at your age.

1452
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,133
18 years old.

1453
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,093
I'm happy that I'm still here,

1454
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,533
obviously, but I'm
so sad for Maisam.

1455
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,533
Like, it's just so sad
that she's going so early.

1456
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:26,693
Next week, don't make any more
mistakes. No, I won't.

1457
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,280
Oh, that was an emotional ride,
that one.

1458
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,413
Yeah, I really do need to
pull my socks up now,

1459
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,253
I've had a second chance,
so I need to take it in both hands.

1460
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,053
I can't believe I got Star Baker.

1461
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,853
I didn't think I'd get
onto the show,

1462
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,293
let alone get a handshake
and become Star Baker.

1463
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,080
So, I'm really happy.

1464
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,493
It's definitely given me
a confidence boost.

1465
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:51,213
So, yeah, I'm really happy.
I'm looking forward to next week.

1466
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,560
Next time...

1467
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,093
Oh, my God!
..the bakers are on Paul's patch.

1468
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,573
Trying to get them in the proving
drawer before he gets over here.

1469
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,533
..in Bread Week.
Panic!

1470
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,973
They must impress
with perfect pizzas...

1471
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,013
Oh, forgot my mozzarella.

1472
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,013
..a classic French patisserie...

1473
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,613
I'm just getting rid of
all of the feelings I've got.

1474
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,133
..and recreate
a Swedish celebration cake.

1475
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,053
This is tomorrow's world.
What's happening?

1476
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,333
Who will be partying?
I was born in Sweden.

1477
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,733
So, you know what you're doing.

1478
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,773
Don't really, but you
know, I've got an idea.

1479
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,373
And who will end up with that
sinking feeling?

1480
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,733
Doesn't feel very light and fluffy.

1481
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,000
This is uncharted territory.

1482
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,360
