1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,040
In the beginning...
Nerves, man, nerves.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,240
...there were 12.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,400
You know "desserts" backwards
is "stressed"? And I am.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,440
Oo-hoo!

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,960
Keep it together, lassie.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,520
Wow.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,800
What can go wrong?

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,600
Oh, Paul Hollywood.
That's what can go wrong.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,840
Still not in?

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,320
I can't get them in the oven now
because they're not ready.

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,320
Now three remain.

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,600
The winner...

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,400
Do you want it? I do, actually. Do
you want it bad?

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,680
I do want it bad. Wait,
what we talking about, actually?

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,760
...of the Great British Bake Off...

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,760
They want sculpture,
I'm giving you a sculpture.

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,400
...2022...

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,320
This is the calm before
the storm, basically.

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,000
...is...

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,560
Any one of the bakers could win.
At this point I cannot call it.

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,760
Just three challenges stand between
the finalists

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,160
and the coveted Bake Off crown.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,200
Group hug, group hug.
All right, guys. Let's do this.

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,120
Oh. Good luck, guys.

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,080
Good luck.

26
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,640
Throughout the competition,

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,760
Sandro's highly decorative bakes
impressed the judges.

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,560
Sandro, it is absolutely astonishing.

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,960
It is exceptionally pretty.

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,800
And he became the first
of our finalists to win Star Baker.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,440
I think I can win it.
I have to stay focused.

32
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,680
Our second finalist, Abdul, has
consistently performed well.

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,000
That is one of the best mirror
glazes I've ever seen.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680
It's just beautiful.

35
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,760
That's a great biscuit as well. Hmm.

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,520
Abdul, you have done
an exceptional job.

37
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,520
But it wasn't until
the semifinal...

38
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,320
Look at the ambition of this.

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,960
...that he unleashed his
full potential...

40
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,840
I think it looks
absolutely magnificent.

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,240
...and was finally
awarded Star Baker.

42
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,720
Well done, mate.

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,480
I'm really lucky to be here in
the tent with these guys

44
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,240
and I just cannot wait for
the day to get started.

45
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,800
Syabira made her mark

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,200
in the tent with her
unconventional flavours.

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,840
Why not put a chicken satay in
a macaron? I'm a risk taker.

48
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,400
And although the gamble didn't
always pay off...

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,520
It tastes like sweetcorn.
It's not for me.

50
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,320
...her unique baking style...

51
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,400
It is so unusual.

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,600
...earned her a
Hollywood handshake...

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,920
Oh, thank you.

54
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,760
...and three Star Bakers.

55
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,680
Woo-woo-woo.

56
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,840
This is not going to be an easy final.

57
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,160
Hopefully we're going to give
the judges a very, very hard time

58
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,960
to decide who's
going to be the winner.

59
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,760
Good morning, bakers.

60
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,040
Congratulations, this is the final

61
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,280
so I wish you all lots of luck.

62
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,280
Now, unfortunately, Noely-Pops
isn't feeling very well

63
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,040
so he's not here today.

64
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,240
Hopefully he'll be feeling better
later on and will join us.

65
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,160
Now, for your final
signature challenge

66
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,080
the judges would like you to make
a summer picnic,

67
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,840
using seasonal ingredients
from across the UK.

68
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,200
Your picnic should consist of six
beautifully decorated mini cakes,

69
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,080
six individual vegetarian pies

70
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,200
and six finger sandwiches made from
a classic white loaf.

71
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,080
You have three hours.

72
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,240
On your marks, get set, bake!

73
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,840
With two loaves and 18 individual
bakes to tackle, this is

74
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,440
the most challenging signature ever
seen in the Bake Off final.

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,600
It is a very big challenge
I would say. Um, it's crazy.

76
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,720
I don't even do
things already in time.

77
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,520
Like, why are they doing this to me?

78
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,640
I am ready for it.

79
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,320
My energy level is, like,
get things done quick.

80
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,760
And time isn't the
only restriction.

81
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,480
The theme for this final
is one that I really,

82
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,720
really approve of, which is we're
celebrating our planet.

83
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,960
And so for our signature challenge
we want the bakers

84
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,800
to really think about how they're

85
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,600
going to pack flavour by
getting seasonal,

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,000
sustainably-grown
British ingredients.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,640
The lemons are grown in Devon.
Who knew Devon grew lemons?

88
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,560
The bakers needed
to have practised this.

89
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,160
Not so much with the baking itself,
but actually the timing.

90
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,120
Initially they need to get
the bread going

91
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,280
because they're going to use one of
the loaves

92
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,920
actually to make the sandwiches.

93
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,920
And also we're asking them
for six cakes.

94
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,440
Inside I'm going, like,
"Ahhh! Panic!

95
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,400
Right what's next? It's the pastry.

96
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,640
Making the pie will take
a little bit of time as well

97
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,960
so they have to be across several
different disciplines

98
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,320
at the same time.

99
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,160
Boil eggs, make pickles,
Swiss roll.

100
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,400
It's gonna be a great challenge.
What's not to like about having

101
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,720
a picnic near the Bake Off tent?
It's awesome.

102
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,960
Morning, Syabira. Morning.
Hello, Syabira.

103
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Welcome to the final.
Thank you.

104
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,560
Tell us all about your
summer picnic.

105
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,600
I am making no porky pie.

106
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,200
A what? No porky pie.
No pork pie? Yeah.

107
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,680
Oh, right, OK.

108
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,920
So the meat is actually aubergine

109
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,800
and a little bit of mushroom

110
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,800
to give like the umami
taste of the pork. Ooh, nice.

111
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,960
Syabira's pork-free pies will also
contain a quail's egg

112
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,720
and a layer of piccalilli.

113
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,040
These will accompanied by
heart-shaped finger sandwiches,

114
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,520
packed with a broad bean coriander
paste and salsa verde.

115
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,720
For dessert, elderflower-infused
Swiss rolls

116
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,280
filled with strawberry jam
and a rosemary cream.

117
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,480
Do you know what they call aubergine
in America?

118
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,240
What? Eggplant. Eggplant
- Eggplant.

119
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,720
Do you want some
eggplant in your burger?

120
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,200
That's a great American accent.

121
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,800
I want french
fries with a hamburger, please.

122
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,080
With seasonality at
the heart of this challenge,

123
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,200
the bakers have opted for
an array of vegetarian ingredients.

124
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,720
I'm just going in to roast
the cauliflower.

125
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,960
And, in a bid to drastically reduce
his food miles,

126
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,200
Abdul has found a British equivalent
to a Greek favourite.

127
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,000
For my pies, typically I put in feta.

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,280
This fettle cheese has
a crumbly texture,

129
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,840
it's not as
the Greek feta cheese

130
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,200
but it comes fairly close to it.

131
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,000
Made in Yorkshire, Abdul's fettle
cheese will bring

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,240
a subtle sharpness to his leek,
onion, rocket and mint pies.

133
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,760
For his sandwiches, he'll mix
grated vegetables

134
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,280
with cream cheese and dill.

135
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,960
And for his cakes, a
classic mini Swiss roll,

136
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,160
filled with a cherry and
tarragon jam.

137
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,960
You've been the sleeper
of this show, haven't you?

138
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,440
Because it wasn't until the semifinal

139
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,360
that you became
Star Baker, even.

140
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,720
Yes, that is very true. Yeah. Yes.

141
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,240
You know Maxy, Janusz they were
collecting those Star Bakers.

142
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Yes. And they're not here right now.

143
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,280
Yeah, which is sad but,
yes, that is true.

144
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,400
You're not sad!
Look at that smile on your face.

145
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,000
No, no, it's sad.

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,760
Redefining sad, live on
the British Bake Off.

147
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,080
Sad!

148
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,920
No, no, it's sad in a way, like...
No, not sad.

149
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,640
Sad in the way of like
you're happy? No.

150
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,360
Morning, Sandro. Morning.

151
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,440
Welcome to the final.
Thank you.

152
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,360
So, Sandro we
need to know about your picnic.

153
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,520
So I'm doing garlic cheesy
cauliflower pies.

154
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,200
Nice. What kind of pastry?

155
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,040
Shortcrust pastry.
Done the right way.

156
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,800
This week it's all about redemption
for me

157
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,840
so everything I've sort
of done wrong throughout

158
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,440
the weeks, I want to do
right. OK.

159
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,600
Sandro's hoping to prove he can
achieve perfect pastry

160
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,840
with his cauliflower cheese pies.

161
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,840
These will be accompanied by egg
and watercress sandwiches,

162
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,560
lemon and elderflower cakes

163
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,800
and, in true Sandro style, he will
also be attempting to make

164
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,520
six fruit tarts
and six blueberry jam biscuits.

165
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,120
You mean there are extras?

166
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,760
Maybe there is.

167
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,120
You just do what you're meant to do.
Exactly. And do it perfectly.

168
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,240
Do it in the time and don't
make mistakes. Yeah.

169
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
Right. Good man. Thank you, Sandro.

170
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,640
Thank you.

171
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,680
Bakers, you halfway through.

172
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,360
Yee-ha!

173
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,720
Right, bread.

174
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,800
As the batch baking marathon begins
in earnest...

175
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,720
All right, bake beautifully, OK?

176
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,520
They're going to bake
for about 25 minutes.

177
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,000
...the bakers have
a small window in which to prepare

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,240
the next items on their
towering to-do lists.

179
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,960
The outside of the Swiss roll's
going to have

180
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,160
a printing of strawberry.
It will look cute.

181
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,680
Today there's a lot happening

182
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,880
and I need to make sure I
know where I am.

183
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,520
So this is why I made a timing chart

184
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,320
about exactly what I'm
doing at what time

185
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,880
and what things need to be done.

186
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,120
But Sandro...
All right, let's get this mix in.

187
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,320
...has two extra bakes to factor in.

188
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,800
So this is the butter for
the biscuits.

189
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,280
That I don't really need,
but I wanna do it.

190
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,480
Oh, my God this guy, man. This guy.

191
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,440
If you ask him to do three things,
he's going to do nine things.

192
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,720
How you feeling, Sandro?
Do you want it?

193
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,560
I do want it, actually.
Do you want it bad?

194
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,760
I do want it bad.

195
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,960
Wait what are we
talking about, actually?

196
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,600
Uh, winning the Bake Off.

197
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,200
Yes, that's what I thought, yeah. Good.

198
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,840
Sandro's journey to the Bake Off
tent started when his mum moved him

199
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,560
and his siblings from war-torn
Angola to start a new life

200
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,240
in the east end of London.

201
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,840
Based on where I come from
and, like, where I live

202
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,240
and stuff, I just... That was one of
my doubts in thinking of applying.

203
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,920
I thought this will never really
happen to a boy like me.

204
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,840
Like, do you know what I mean,
from the ends?

205
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,200
But it's bigger than me.
Do you know what I mean?

206
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,840
Being able to get here, it shows
other young boys

207
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,600
and young girls from the same
background that they can also do it.

208
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,200
And his family know just how hard
he's been working

209
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,880
to achieve his goal.

210
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,520
Sandro deserves this

211
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,680
I mean this is something that he's
been dreaming about

212
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,560
for so many years.

213
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,520
He's worked so hard.

214
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,400
There's not been one week that he
hasn't baked every single day.

215
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,720
I want someone like him to win,
I think he's going to inspire

216
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,280
so many young men like him,
you know, in London.

217
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,800
You know, young boy from East
London. So I'm so proud of him.

218
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,640
But no-one could be prouder than
mum Sandra,

219
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,840
who raised Sandro
and his siblings on her own.

220
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,480
I think he's the winner.
He can win, he can win.

221
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,320
I love you so much.

222
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,760
You are very special for me
and you're always going to be.

223
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,120
I'm very proud.

224
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,160
I'm very proud of him. Yes.

225
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,240
Family's buzzing,
they're super excited.

226
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,480
They can't wait
to come tomorrow.

227
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,920
No, they really stress me though

228
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Cos I rely on them too much.

229
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,920
While much of Sandro's time is spent
with his family,

230
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,400
life for Abdul
is very different.

231
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,960
So my family is all around
the world.

232
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,120
My parents they live in Pakistan.

233
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,440
And my elder sister, she lives in
San Diego.

234
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,800
My dad is, like, you know, super
proud and super excited.

235
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,000
This is the first time that any
of our family members

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,960
is doing
something like this.

237
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,200
One family member in particular is
especially proud.

238
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,600
My younger sister, she was actually
who introduced me to Bake Off.

239
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,080
So she is ecstatic. Like, she is
just out of her mind

240
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,520
and she would've loved
to be here to support me.

241
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,000
But she is supporting from there
and so are my parents.

242
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,040
We're so proud of you
and I really hope that you enjoy

243
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,720
and don't stress too much.
And take care.

244
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,400
And we will celebrate, man. Yes.

245
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,360
We will all celebrate.
It's a proud moment.

246
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,840
Aww!

247
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,760
Yeah, exactly.
Inshallah you will win.

248
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,000
But he has a close support network
here in the UK...

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,640
Abdul!
To winning the Bake Off!

250
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,120
To winning the Bake Off.

251
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,680
...which has grown even bigger since
meeting the other 11 bakers.

252
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,120
For the past 12 weeks we
have been together,

253
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,240
with each other, supporting
each other, helping each other.

254
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,680
It doesn't feel... It's like a
family. You know, we are here,

255
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,280
we are trying to give our best
and that's all that matters to us.

256
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,760
Abdul, what's your first language?

257
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,640
My first language is Urdu.

258
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,080
OK, so we have one hour left.

259
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,960
And Abdul is going to inform
the other bakers in Urdu.

260
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,520
Off you go.

261
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,760
Bakers!

262
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,040
What?

263
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,400
We have one hour left, by the way.
Bread needs to come out.

264
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,440
Let me check the bread, let
me check the bread.

265
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,720
Panic. These are done.

266
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,000
As the bread makes way for
the sponges...

267
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,480
They're going to go for about ten
to 12 minutes.

268
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,400
I'm going to put a timer
for ten minutes.

269
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,560
So I have ten minutes exactly
to work on the pie.

270
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,600
I can do this.

271
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,240
...for the perfect pie

272
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,000
the bakers must judge the
thickness of the pastry.

273
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,920
It's about three
millimetre thickness.

274
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,160
Too thin and the pies
could collapse.

275
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,440
It will have to do.

276
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,480
But too thick and
the pastry won't cook through.

277
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,400
I don't want this liquid
to come out at all.

278
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,680
So when they eat it it's like,
"Ooh, this is really filling!

279
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,560
"It's quite meaty,
although there's no meat.

280
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,560
"It's got a lot of cream,
it's a lot of cheese, well done."

281
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,960
So when you've been at home on
days off, have you been cooking

282
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,280
for your partner or have you
just been practising?

283
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,960
I've been practising
and I didn't cook for him

284
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,240
and he say he miss my curry.

285
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,760
Oh. But, sorry, mate.

286
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,800
Passive aggressive.
Yeah, sorry, mate.

287
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,520
Sorry, mate, not this time.
Sorry, mate, yeah I'm on TV.

288
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,640
Is that all right with you?

289
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,440
He's very proud.

290
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,360
Syabira met boyfriend Bradley
two years ago

291
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,960
when she caught his eye on
a dating app.

292
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,280
Her profile pic was her with
a big cake

293
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,640
and some crazy pictures of
hugging a tree.

294
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,560
I thought, this girl looks fun.

295
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,640
Being a part of
the Great British Bake Off

296
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,760
means a huge amount to Syabira.

297
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,360
I've always said that
I will support her dreams.

298
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,800
And she said it's her dream to enter
so I said, "Let's do it."

299
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,720
She wasn't very confident that she
would have the skills to do it.

300
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,800
But I knew, deep down inside,
she had this passion

301
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,120
and it's been unleashed.

302
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,160
What does it mean for me to be here?

303
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,040
It means... Have you ever got
something, like you dream of,

304
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,280
but you don't think you'll get it
and eventually you get it?

305
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,320
It's like a lottery jackpot.

306
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,840
But you have to work really hard
for that.

307
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,400
I am absolutely so proud of her
for getting this far.

308
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,040
I'm the proudest boyfie ever.

309
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,280
I've never been the top person
in any kind of competition

310
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,960
or any classes that
I've attended

311
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,320
so maybe baking is my hidden talent

312
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,280
that I never discovered
until recently.

313
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,000
So Bradley said to me, "You're
already a winner to be in the final.

314
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,800
"Just go and smash it."

315
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,400
Is that a little egg on the floor?

316
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah, I just laid them.

317
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,400
She's a woman of many talents.

318
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,240
Cake is done.

319
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,080
As the cakes come out,

320
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,920
the pies can now join
the picnic production line.

321
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,560
OK, it's going in.

322
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,400
Time is very short for this one.
We have to make a lot of things.

323
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,160
I need to assemble my cake
and I need to do the sandwich.

324
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,280
Haven't done the
broad beans just yet.

325
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,480
But for Sandro there are still tarts
and biscuits to contend with.

326
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm all right, I'm all right,
I'm not even panicking.

327
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,960
I'm going to make every single
thing I said I'm going to make.

328
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,560
Bakers you have half an hour left
before the judges crush your dreams.

329
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,760
With their white loaves cooled...

330
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,640
Please be baked all
the way through.

331
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,800
...The bakers need to
thinly slice them

332
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,520
to create six elegant
finger sandwiches.

333
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,920
Oh, my God, cutting this thing is
harder than I thought.

334
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,680
So this is the egg cress.
Would you like a taste?

335
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,960
No, uh, it's not. You're not egg
and cress fan guy?

336
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Not an egg and cress guy no.

337
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,200
I have the eating age of
a nine-year-old.

338
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,280
Oh, right.

339
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,240
I like nuggets.

340
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,800
This is salsa verde.

341
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,560
This is basically a very random
sandwich, I would say.

342
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,840
I'm going back to my old story
of panicking at the very end

343
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,560
so I will start doing that in about
another ten minutes.

344
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,360
Going in is my biscuits that
I don't need.

345
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,480
So I'm assembling the
Swiss rolls now.

346
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,320
So this is the rosemary cream.

347
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,600
Rosemary goes well
with elderflower and strawberry.

348
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,120
So this is a cream
cheese filling.

349
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,280
You have five minutes left.

350
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,720
I'm going to do it.

351
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,720
And my pies need to come out.

352
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,160
I'm not sure if these are going to
be baked properly.

353
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,880
It's not perfect.
Some of them are a bit wonky.

354
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,240
They're looking good.

355
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,440
Going to start rushing now.

356
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,600
Bakers, you have one minute left.

357
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,520
Just get 'em done.

358
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,560
Rosemary cream.

359
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,280
Blueberry jam.

360
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,440
Bakers, your time is up.
Ah!

361
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,880
Please step away from your bakes.

362
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,440
Dude, again. You have a feast
man. How do you do this, man?

363
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,720
Well done, everyone. Oh, my God.

364
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,000
It's the final signature.

365
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,560
The last signature is done.

366
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,000
Oh! Ka-pow!

367
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,280
Yeah. We don't have to worry about a
signature ever again in our life!

368
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,240
It's judgement time for the bakers'
final signature challenge.

369
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,720
Hello, Abdul. Hello.
Hi, Abdul.

370
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,120
I think, overall, it looks
quite nice.

371
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,400
The Swiss rolls have lost
a little bit of colour.

372
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,640
The sandwiches, a little bit
irregular in size.

373
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,600
They're a bit thick as well. Yes.
Thinner would've been better.

374
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,200
The finger sandwiches are
grated beetroot, carrot.

375
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,440
And the cream cheese is
filled with dill and chive.

376
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,800
I like the dill.

377
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,640
It's just the right amount
of cream cheese.

378
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,320
The beetroot and carrot are nice
and crunchy

379
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,240
and the cream cheese works well
with the very nice soft sandwich.

380
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,160
So far, so good.
Now we need the pie.

381
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,640
This is leek, onion,
with Yorkshire fettle.

382
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,520
And there's also mint in there.

383
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,240
The herb content in there has got
a nice kick to it. It's delicious.

384
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,800
And I must say, your pastry
is lovely.

385
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,000
Right let's have
a look at your Swiss roll.

386
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,680
The cherries work really well
with it.

387
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,360
Not getting much tarragon though
kicking in. OK.

388
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,160
But, overall, I think you've done a
decent job.

389
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,680
Your flavours are all good.
Flavours are all excellent.

390
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,880
Thank you.

391
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,600
I must say it does absolutely look
very cornucopia overflowing.

392
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,360
Well, let's try your sandwiches.
These massive sandwiches.

393
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,360
Come on, turn it into a elegant
finger sandwich, Mr Hollywood.

394
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,240
There you go.

395
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,680
Mm, heaven.

396
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,080
Ah, good.

397
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,040
You can't go wrong with egg
and cress.

398
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,560
And you've put a bit of mustard in
there, haven't you? I did, yeah.

399
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,120
Hmm, gives it just a little kick.
It's really nice.

400
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,440
My pies are cauliflower
cheese pies.

401
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,160
Does look pretty undercooked, the
pastry? Very undercooked, yeah.

402
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,800
Flavour of the cauliflower cheese is
absolutely delicious.

403
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,640
But the pastry's not quite cooked.

404
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,200
Let's have a look at your
massive cake.

405
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,720
So I made lemon
and elderflower sponges

406
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,480
with a mixed berry compote inside.

407
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,720
It's got a cream cheese filling.

408
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,920
Great flavours. The fruit filling,
it's got that tartness still.

409
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,720
And it works beautifully with
the lemon.

410
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,480
And the cream cheese,
which is beautiful.

411
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,800
I just think it's a little
bit too big. Too big, yeah.

412
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,640
I won't try your tart
because that's an extra bit

413
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,400
but it looks very nice.
Thank you.

414
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,240
Want a cheers for your last
signature judgment from me?

415
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,200
Cheers. I'll tell you what you've
probably made a mistake.

416
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,080
Cos you're just putting me in a very
good mood for judging Syabira.

417
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,880
Right, give us it back.

418
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,720
It reminds me a lot of
the hotel business

419
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,760
because in the hotel business
everything has to be the same size

420
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,800
and they look very similar.

421
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,880
OK, let's check your sandwiches.

422
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,040
It is broad bean coriander paste
with salsa verde.

423
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,520
He's going to say he's never had
those flavours before in a sandwich.

424
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,960
He's right. It's unusual,
it's really delicious.

425
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,040
It's got exactly the right texture.

426
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,280
Pies are very neat, quite robust.

427
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,600
Isn't that beautiful?

428
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,080
Well done,
the egg is bang in the middle.

429
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,440
I think it could've done with
a little more salt in it.

430
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,680
But the pastry is delicious.

431
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,120
OK. Swiss roll.

432
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,320
Very nice, I like that little bit
of decoration.

433
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,560
Explain what this is again.

434
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,560
This is elderflower sponge
with strawberry and rosemary cream.

435
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,840
It's very interesting.

436
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,960
I think the rosemary
slightly overpowers.

437
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,480
I think Prue's right but the sponge
is beautifully baked.

438
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,960
It's soft, it melts in the mouth

439
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,840
and it goes really well with
the filling.

440
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,080
Well done, Syabira. Thank you.
Thank you.

441
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,360
Prue always said my flavours
are unusual.

442
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,840
I've heard that every week.

443
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,280
Which is fine, I think they mean it
in a very good way.

444
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,880
It mostly went to plan.

445
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,720
They didn't taste all the elements

446
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,720
but I'm feeling, like, super relieved.

447
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,440
I'm ready for the technical.

448
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,080
Yeah, with technical for
the finale, it's tough to say.

449
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,600
I just hope there are
some instructions.

450
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,920
As ever, the bakers have no idea
what they are about to face.

451
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,280
Bakers it's time for your final
technical challenge,

452
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,480
which today has
been set by Paul Hollywood.

453
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,920
Paul, any words of advice?

454
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,840
You only get one shot at this.
Try not to mess it up.

455
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,280
Thank you very much, Paul.

456
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,640
Now, Paul is very emotional

457
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,640
because obviously
the show is coming to an end

458
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,400
so he's written a little
song that he'd like to sing for you.

459
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,280
Over to you, Paul.

460
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,880
Oh. It was really good.

461
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,080
He'll... I'm sure he'll sing it
later. He's just a bit shy.

462
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,400
As ever, we ask both judges to
leave the tent.

463
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,640
Paul's already gone so,
Prue, if you'd like to hop it.

464
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,880
For your technical challenge
the judges would like you

465
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,600
to make a summer pudding bombe.

466
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,040
Your bombe should consist of
an elderflower and berry jelly,

467
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,920
creamy meringue and raspberry
filling, all encased

468
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
in a raspberry-soaked bread.

469
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,680
And you have just two hours.

470
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,240
On your marks, get set, bake.

471
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,760
I've never made anything
like this at all.

472
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,480
I'd never heard of, like,
a summer pudding bombe before.

473
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,720
Ha, no instructions as always.

474
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,760
I have no idea.

475
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,600
Paul, this is the most beautiful
thing. It's a bombe, is it?

476
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,480
Well, essentially it's
a summer pudding.

477
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,880
So as you cut into this you get
the bread

478
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,320
that's been soaked on the outside
with the raspberry syrup.

479
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,280
Inside you have
a mousse-like mixture

480
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,680
and right in the heart of it is
an elderflower

481
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,960
and strawberry jelly.
Now this is the killer thing.

482
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,560
The loaf they made this morning,
they're going to use that loaf

483
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,000
to make this. Now, where can they go
wrong on this?

484
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,360
Plenty of places. Rectangular strips
going all the way around is

485
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,200
the only way you can seal in
the mousse inside.

486
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,280
If you do it in any other shape
you're going to create holes

487
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,680
and it's going to pour out.

488
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,240
And, also, they're being asked
to use vegetable gelatine.

489
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,000
With vegetable gelatine you have
to boil it to get it to work.

490
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
If they just throw it into hot water
it will not work,

491
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,760
and it will not set.

492
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,840
If this doesn't set, it will just
sink like a splodge.

493
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,840
That is heaven in a spoon.

494
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,040
I can't stop eating this,
but we have only three to try.

495
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,520
And are they going to set?
That's the question.

496
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,520
So, I'm going to start with
the sugar syrup.

497
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,760
50g caster sugar.
Fresh raspberries.

498
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,280
I'm going to bring it to a boil

499
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,800
and make sure all
the raspberries have been crushed.

500
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,840
Then I'm going to sieve it.
Do you like raspberry?

501
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,480
Yeah, I like raspberry. Where is it
on the list of berries for you?

502
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,040
Top, like, two. Top two?

503
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,120
Well, I only know a
few berries. I know strawberries.

504
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,040
Yeah. I know raspberries. Yeah.

505
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,400
Um... You know Chuck Berry.

506
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,840
Chuck Berry? Don't know him.

507
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,640
Nick Berry.
Don't know Nick Berry.

508
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,000
He was in EastEnders. No, I don't
know who that is. Before your time.

509
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,640
So, the next part is
the jelly centre itself.

510
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,320
And just 100ml of syrup,
100 gram of strawberries.

511
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,120
Where's the gelatine?

512
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,200
Vegetarian gelatine powder.

513
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,680
Unlike its alternative,

514
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,680
vegetarian gelatine needs
a high heat to work.

515
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,960
Shouldn't this be bloomed?

516
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,520
Typically with gelatine powder you
need to bloom it.

517
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,280
Vegetarian gelatine activates at
a higher temperature.

518
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,560
It needs to be boiled
to make sure it's able to set.

519
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,200
There's no other way.

520
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,040
I'm going to bloom it in here.

521
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,200
Mix it in, let it sit there.

522
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,960
I'm just following the instructions

523
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,680
because, when I don't, things
go wrong.

524
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,360
It's gonna be frozen until
it's set.

525
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,320
So this has to go into the freezer.

526
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,080
Right what's next?

527
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,320
Mini meringue kisses.

528
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,680
It's probably just
a normal French meringue.

529
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,200
80 gram of icing sugar.

530
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,960
I want to get stiff peaks, because
you need to pipe them,

531
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,200
it needs to be kisses
so it needs to have a...

532
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,160
Mini kisses, they said.
So I guess it has to be very small.

533
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,560
There's a lot of love on this tray.

534
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,880
Kisses, kisses, kisses, kisses.

535
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,080
And now they're going to bake until
they become crispy on the outside.

536
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,560
But they need to remain
a bit chewy on the inside.

537
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,800
So 120 degree.

538
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,640
No way. No way?

539
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,320
You're halfway through
the challenge! No way?

540
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,320
Small white loaf,
thinly sliced into 12.

541
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,720
I know that bread.

542
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,320
There you go.

543
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,760
Hello, old friend,
you look familiar.

544
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,120
Luckily I baked it well.

545
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm going to do circles all around.

546
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,480
I think that's what's best to do.

547
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,760
I don't want them to see what I'm
doing, it's getting competitive.

548
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,760
Are you using this slice? No, I'm
not. You wanna taste it and see?

549
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,040
Well, I just wanted to do what Paul
Hollywood does with bread.

550
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,960
It's underproved,
but it's overproved.

551
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,240
Yeah, that's a good eat.

552
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,360
All of this dessert has to be encased

553
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,000
in your raspberry syrup
soaked bread.

554
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,840
Right I'm going to start soaking
my bread.

555
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,600
I don't have enough juice
to soak this.

556
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,160
I'm not sure if this has
to be this wet.

557
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,520
Just light soaking, because if it's
very highly soaked

558
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,920
it's going to
break apart.

559
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,520
And the syrup is finished.
How is that possible?

560
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,880
Maybe I just put too much in
these ones.

561
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,320
I'm just going to spread 'em.
There you go.

562
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,160
Come along chaps,
you've got half an hour left.

563
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,520
So stop all this horse play,
and get baking.

564
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,880
Pate a bombe.

565
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,520
I actually don't know,
what is pate a bombe?

566
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,400
100g of caster sugar.

567
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Two teaspoons of gelatine powder
and two large egg yolks.

568
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,960
I think this might be
the trifle custard.

569
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,120
But it's just in a posh way of
saying you're making pate a bombe.

570
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,200
I'm basically going to take
the sugar syrup

571
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,000
and then pour it over
the egg yolks.

572
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,200
I'm mixing the pate a bombe with
the whipping cream.

573
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,480
Here's the pate le bombe.

574
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,160
It is actually quite liquidy.

575
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,160
Right that's done.

576
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,440
Mini meringue kisses. 20.

577
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,200
Two, four...

578
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,400
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, ten.

579
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,960
18, 20.

580
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,520
Going to give myself some kisses.

581
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,520
Considering there's less than half
an hour left in this technical,

582
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,000
this is a very calm tent.

583
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,360
The problem is,

584
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,840
it won't be calm when we
flip over our pudding bombes.

585
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,160
Right, OK.

586
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,680
This is the calm before
the storm, basically.

587
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,680
The jelly is not firm at all.

588
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,920
OK. Let's fill this up now.

589
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,000
To create the perfectly set centre,
the judges have requested...

590
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,680
Just pop it in there.

591
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,840
...chilling time is essential.

592
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,280
Too little, and there'll be no way
their finished dessert

593
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,920
will hold its shape.

594
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,280
I'm going to put it in the freezer,

595
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,960
so then it sets as quick
as possible.

596
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,760
My jelly should've set by now.

597
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,400
If not I'm just
going to pour it into there,

598
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,920
seal it and then pop it in
the freezer.

599
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,360
It's set.

600
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,240
It's gonna get messy.

601
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,040
Almost.

602
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,640
Almost not there.

603
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,360
Wow. It's just going to be syrup
inside of it.

604
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,200
It's not going to be a jelly.

605
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,640
Haven't really got time to make it again,

606
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,760
or anything, cos it needs time
for it to set.

607
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,480
Bakers, you have 15 minutes

608
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:31,920
until the summer pudding bombe
disposal experts arrive.

609
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,320
I don't know how mine didn't set.

610
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,600
Right, now I need to think about
the top.

611
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,200
I'm going to pray to Beyonce in
a minute.

612
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,360
How do people decorate this?

613
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Says decorate with elderflower,
glazed strawberries,

614
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,400
raspberries and redcurrant.
How's it all going?

615
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,600
Well, my gelatine didn't set.
It didn't?

616
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,040
No it didn't.
Oh. Why not?

617
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,360
Well, I don't know.
It's all about science, innit?

618
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,760
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

619
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,000
Please don't annoy me.

620
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,560
Don't annoy me.

621
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,440
Oh, yes.

622
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,840
The pate bombe didn't set.

623
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,320
It hasn't set.

624
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,040
That is a proper disaster.

625
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,360
Oh, it's a disaster.

626
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,720
I'm not happy.

627
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,160
How many minutes do we have left?

628
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,160
Bakers, you have one minute left.

629
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,000
It's all glaze, even though
I don't know what I'm glazing.

630
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,200
Perfect. Finesse, that is.

631
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,520
That is what they're looking for.

632
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,200
Peekaboo.

633
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,080
Anyone want any help?

634
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,920
No?

635
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,680
You sure you don't want help,
Syabira?

636
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,880
I mean, clearly I'm a pro.

637
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,080
Bakers, your time is up.

638
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,240
Please bring your summer pudding
bombes to the front

639
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,480
and place them on the table
behind your photograph.

640
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,720
Paul and Prue are expecting

641
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,440
perfectly-set
summer pudding bombes

642
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,200
with a jelly centre within
a smooth pate a bombe filling,

643
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,560
surrounded by syrup-soaked bread.

644
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,920
But they don't know whose is whose.

645
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,440
I think you didn't
understand that you have

646
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,120
to boil vegetarian gelatine.

647
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,320
Did you boil it?
Yeah.

648
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,040
I think ultimately it comes down
to timing. Yeah.

649
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,040
So let's start over here, shall we?

650
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,520
Decoration's all right.
There is a sort of shape.

651
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,680
Not quite a bomb. No. But at least
it looks intentional.

652
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,640
But what's it look like inside?

653
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,120
Jelly is set.

654
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,240
Pate a bombe mixture
has started to set

655
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,200
but it needed another half
hour maybe. Half an hour.

656
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,320
But there is crispy meringue in
there as well.

657
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,240
And the bread is a little bit pale. Hmm.

658
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,080
Moving on to our
second delight.

659
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,680
Yeah, this is an issue.
Nothing seems to have set.

660
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,520
And the bread's the wrong shape.

661
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
I can't take a slice
of that Prue

662
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,440
I'll tell you what this baker has
done right, though.

663
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,520
He or she has boiled down
the syrup

664
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,760
so that you get
a real glaze on the fruit.

665
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,320
Yeah. They can have that.

666
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,280
Moving on to the next one. Again, it
has burst

667
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,680
but there is something there.

668
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,160
It's a mess, though.
There's a bit of jelly.

669
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,520
And the jelly is set.

670
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,640
Obviously the big thing is
the pate a bombe mixture's

671
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,840
just not set,
it's still liquid.

672
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,360
The flavour's all right,
though. Interesting.

673
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,840
The judges will now rank the bakers'
summer pudding bombes

674
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,840
from last to first.

675
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,920
OK, in third spot we have,
surprise-surprise, this one.

676
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,640
Whose is this? Obviously
setting times were all out.

677
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,360
However, Prue did love
the glaze on the top.

678
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,480
Thank you!
So well done.

679
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,600
In second place...

680
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,320
...we have this one. Syabira.

681
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,480
Well, you know it didn't quite set.

682
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,680
You had a timing issue
but it tasted delicious.

683
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,400
Which means... Abdul.
Abdul!

684
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,760
Oh, don't clap.
No, no, no, no, no.

685
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,920
It's the first time for me
to come first, so...

686
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,560
The basics were there.

687
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,640
You needed to soak the syrup
a little bit more but,

688
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,640
having said that, you were
the one that got close

689
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,240
to setting both elements.

690
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,280
But it did taste very good.
Well done.

691
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,120
So that's my first technical win.

692
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,760
And it's the finale, so, got it.

693
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,600
When you put it down you can see
the pudding starts sinking down,

694
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,320
you know it didn't set.

695
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,120
It's fine. Abdul did well.
At least he got his half set.

696
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,400
It's good that Abdul gets to end
the journey with

697
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,520
a technical win.
So I think it's fair.

698
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,000
But my glaze was good.

699
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,960
My glaze was really good.

700
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,640
Just one challenge remains in
the Great British Bake Off 2022.

701
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,320
Good luck everyone.

702
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,200
Group hug.

703
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,240
Welcome back, Noel. Hello.

704
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,160
Nice to see you. We missed you.

705
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,720
Aw, I missed you guys.

706
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,360
So the signatures were pretty good
weren't they?

707
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,600
You were quite impressed.

708
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,200
It was one of the longest signature
challenges we've had, actually.

709
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,480
What was it? Well, basically they
had to do sandwiches using

710
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,640
the bread that they make,
so they make their own bread.

711
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,960
Amazing. Cakes and little
pies as well. Wow.

712
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,640
Vegetarian pies. And actually they
all did really well.

713
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,320
But it was a game of two halves,
wasn't it? It certainly was.

714
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,760
The bombes were quite tricky as a
technical challenge.

715
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,440
They all had a problem
with setting.

716
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,600
So I've been away, what you're
trying to tell me is...

717
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,320
I don't think I've ever said
this before

718
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,680
but it's all down to
the Show Stopper.

719
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,640
Yikes. I know. It's exciting.

720
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,760
I don't care who wins,
I just love them all.

721
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,640
Good morning, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

722
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,840
And, Noel, welcome back to the tent.

723
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,520
Ah, thank you, Matthew-Pops.
I couldn't miss this.

724
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,920
Couldn't miss the final.

725
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,520
Now, for your Show Stopper challenge
the judges would love you to make

726
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,280
a large edible sculpture

727
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,080
and the theme is
our beautiful planet.

728
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,400
Now, your edible sculptures must
have a large cake base

729
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,760
and show off at least three
additional baking skills.

730
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,400
Now, remember this is your very last
chance to impress the judges.

731
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,520
So please make it spectacular.

732
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,000
We love you all.

733
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,040
We wish you all luck.
You have four and a half hours.

734
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
On your marks... Get set...

735
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,760
For the very last time, bake!

736
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,120
Last ever bake.

737
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,360
I am going to move at
the speed of lightning right now.

738
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,440
Ah, stress. It's the final,
isn't it?

739
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,840
Unbelievably.

740
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,920
It's going to be all right
I've come this far.

741
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,000
Just got to believe in myself and,
uh, just pull it off.

742
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,480
Well, you won't be surprised
to find that our final Show Stopper

743
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,400
challenge is really difficult.

744
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,040
Well, it should be, it's the final.

745
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,560
We want them to make
an edible sculpture.

746
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,600
I want to see lots of
flavour, colour, imagination.

747
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,560
And something representing
our planet.

748
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,560
You know, it could be
the planet itself,

749
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,360
it could be the sea,
it could be the Earth,

750
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,360
could be volcanoes,
could be anything they wish.

751
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,560
Four and a half hours will go really
quickly for the bakers,

752
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,680
so initially get all the bakes done
and then start to assemble

753
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,000
and allow plenty of time
to make it look incredible.

754
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,600
If they've practised, they
should be fine.

755
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,600
If they haven't practised,
they're going to be found out.

756
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,800
Good morning, Sandro.
Hello, Sandro.

757
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,200
Good morning. Good morning.

758
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,200
Right, Sandro tell us all about your
final Show Stopper.

759
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,680
So, for my final Show Stopper
I'm actually making the world.

760
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,240
Didn't you try the world before?

761
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,960
I didn't try it,
I achieved the world before.

762
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
And it didn't take you seven days.

763
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,080
Exactly. Bit faster than god.

764
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,840
Today Sandro will have just four
and a half hours

765
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,360
to create his sculpture,
which will take us from

766
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,880
the bottom of the seas to
the planets above.

767
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,800
A three layer lemon and plum cake
will form his ocean-themed base.

768
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,560
Suspended overhead, white chocolate
and raspberry profiterole clouds,

769
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,240
lemon biscuit sun and stars,
and blueberry cake pop planets.

770
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,120
Have you practised this?
I have practised this.

771
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,600
I dare ask.
I have practised this.

772
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,800
Yeah, you've said this
before Sandro.

773
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,640
You haven't practised this at all,
have you? No, I have practised this.

774
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,480
So, time-wise, do you think
you'll be all right?

775
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,440
I'll be just fine.
If we go away? If we go?

776
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,240
If you go away.

777
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,040
Good luck, Sandro.
Thank you very much.

778
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,400
While Sandro's going big...
I've got a lot of things to do.

779
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,760
...Abdul is concentrating on
the planet's smaller inhabitants.

780
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,280
I am making a cake that
celebrates bees.

781
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:34,160
So there's going to be honey in
the sponge as well as in the...

782
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,800
There's going to be honey syrup
as well.

783
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,400
Abdul's honey-soaked ode
to our planet's most important

784
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,760
pollinators will also include
hedgerow heroes like blackberry jam,

785
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,400
raspberry filled profiteroles
and an elderflower and almond

786
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,600
biscuit beehive. Complete
with bee-shaped macarons.

787
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,200
You're always reading.
You're always checking out the text.

788
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,920
Those are my timing charts.

789
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,200
You've got a timing chart.
God, I love you.

790
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,440
There's something going on in all
of those

791
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,520
little strange,
scribbly equations.

792
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,320
Yes. Those are not equations,
but numbers.

793
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,160
One second, I'll come back,
one second.

794
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,280
Not equations, but numbers.

795
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,720
There lies genius or madness.

796
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,680
As their cakes will form not only

797
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,240
the foundation of their sculptures,

798
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,720
but also the centrepiece of
their Show Stoppers, it's crucial

799
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,640
the finalists get these baked before
moving on to their other elements.

800
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,880
This is a Genoise sponge.
It's very light,

801
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,920
it's very soft sponge,
very indulgent to bite into.

802
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,520
But bakes on this scale are tough
to manage.

803
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,080
These are massive cakes.
These are like 12 inch.

804
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,360
I've never made 12 inch cakes
and I was like, "Oh, man."

805
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,880
They need so much, like, batter.

806
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,760
If the temperature or timings
are off

807
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,360
the bake won't be even
and the cake will be ruined.

808
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,160
Ten to 12 minutes

809
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,520
and then I'll check them again
to make sure it's baked.

810
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,200
But whilst most rely on timers...

811
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,840
15 minutes.

812
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,280
...Sandro's going with his gut.

813
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,560
Lemon curd.

814
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,480
They're going to go in until
they're golden brown.

815
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,440
I don't time nothing at all,
it's just all by eye.

816
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,000
You'll just never bake again.

817
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,760
No, I am. I am. I love my baking.

818
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,320
But I don't think I'll be buying any
more of Paul's books though.

819
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,400
You know him now,
you can 'em for free.

820
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,520
No, he made me buy his new one.
What, did he?

821
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,560
Yeah. He didn't. He did.

822
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,320
He made you buy it?

823
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,000
Yeah. That's outrageous!

824
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,320
No, but I want to support him,
though, that's the main thing.

825
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,520
Oh, yeah he needs a lot of support. Yeah.

826
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,120
Good morning, Syabira. Hi.

827
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,080
We want to know all about how you're
celebrating our planet.

828
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,360
I am making orangutan cake, holding
forest on the top. Orangutan?

829
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,880
Yes, it's orangutan cake, holding
a forest on the top.

830
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,120
It's like, this is my home,
preserve it.

831
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,000
Syabira's orangutan will be formed
with Genoise sponge,

832
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,240
flavoured with black pepper,
sandwiched with blackberry jam

833
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,640
and covered in a chocolate
and hazelnut buttercream fur.

834
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,360
His head will be made up of
layers of tarragon shortbread,

835
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,000
above which he will hold up
a forest of inverted meringue kisses

836
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,840
and strawberry and rhubarb
custard tarts.

837
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,960
It's your last challenge with us.
Are you a little bit nervous though

838
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,000
or are you just chilled out
and relaxed now?

839
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,200
A little bit nervous cos
I never practised it fully before

840
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,480
so erm... let's hope
my decision is right.

841
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,640
I think we should leave her
to get on with it. Yeah.

842
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,400
No, good luck, Syabira. Good luck,
Syabira. Thank you so much.

843
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,360
There's a lot to do, good luck.
Thank you.

844
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,800
With the bases of their sculptures
in the oven...

845
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,760
Right, come on. Um...
what is next, what is next?

846
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,760
...the bakers now have a dizzying
array of other elements to tackle.

847
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,040
This is the tarragon biscuit
for the head of the orangutan.

848
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,120
Wow, there's some big plums.

849
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,800
I'm making a plum compote.

850
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,640
Why don't you call Paul a plum?
I wouldn't dare, not today.

851
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,840
Hollywood, you plum!

852
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,560
I'll wait until after the results.

853
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,040
Let's see if he deserves
to be called a plum or not.

854
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,160
So we've got our final showstopppers.

855
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,800
I think, starting with Syabira,
some great flavours going on.

856
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,960
Tarragon - not a common ingredient
people put in a biscuit

857
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,840
but to have a vanilla,
it's too plain.

858
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,360
If this was week one or two

859
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,840
I wouldn't believe that
these flavours could work. Yeah.

860
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,720
But I've learnt to trust Syabira.

861
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,000
Abdul's ideas are fantastic.
He's got honey that's going to be

862
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,880
quite an overwhelming flavour
on this.

863
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,920
But the thing I think's
so good about Abdul is

864
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,280
he does really classic flavours
but somehow they're never boring.

865
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,400
But then you look at Sandro
who's been a bit haphazard.

866
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,640
They're not baked yet.
I think I had the heat too high up

867
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,400
so it's browned a bit too much.

868
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,240
I can't do nothing about it.
It has to bake.

869
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,880
And I want him to finish today.
I'm sure he will.

870
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,600
It's not that he doesn't have
the skills,

871
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,800
it's just that he's always
in a rush at the end. Yeah.

872
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,880
I'm happy with the sponges.

873
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,240
I think it's going to make for
a fascinating challenge now

874
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,040
when you look at the three of them together.

875
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,040
Well, I'm just dreading them
being impossible to judge

876
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,160
and we'll end up
having to toss a coin.

877
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,880
Bakers, you are halfway through.

878
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,800
I'm going to start the profiteroles.

879
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,640
Then I can start my fillings...
bread rolls, biscuits.

880
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,080
These are thick craquelin

881
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,080
so I think they will not allow
the choux pastry to rise

882
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,680
but at least I have quite a few
other ones so it should be OK.

883
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,560
The choux will be the clouds

884
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,040
which will be raspberry
and white chocolate.

885
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,840
This meringue,
it's for the forest.

886
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,840
It's going to be piped upside-down.

887
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,920
OK.

888
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,520
I can proper smell burning now.

889
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,120
It's so hard to bake a cake
this big.

890
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,680
Come on, baby, are you baked?

891
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,080
I don't know if you're baked, mate.

892
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,280
The smallest mistake
at this point...

893
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,680
It should be OK.

894
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,320
...could jeopardise their chance
to be crowned this year's winner.

895
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,920
Doesn't look good.

896
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,760
It's a bit wonky.

897
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
I'm stressed.

898
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,040
OK.

899
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
My choux - they're not good.

900
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,000
The craquelin was too thick so it's
just caused them to flatten out.

901
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,800
But let's see
how much I can pull back.

902
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,240
But with so many other bakes
queueing for the oven...

903
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,200
Ooh! My bread! I forgot about that.

904
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,880
HE WHISTLES

905
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,520
...and sculptures to assemble...

906
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,560
Don't you burn!
I don't have time for that.

907
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,800
...there is no time...

908
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,600
Rhubarb custard, go quickly.

909
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,600
...to remake any
less-than-perfect elements.

910
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,840
All right, here we go.
Simple American buttercream.

911
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,640
Sandro already assembling.

912
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,240
I have to start getting assembled
because it's getting...

913
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,440
Yeah, it's getting close.

914
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,520
Bakers, you have one hour left...

915
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,040
Oops.

916
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,400
...in which to impress the judges and
win this competition. No pressure!

917
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,800
So this is the honey syrup. So I'm
going to glaze my sponges with this.

918
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,320
Jam on top, followed by
the Italian meringue buttercream.

919
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,680
It's harder to assemble
than I thought.

920
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,080
I've got to move fast with this.

921
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,840
Now, hazelnut chocolate buttercream.
This is the orangutan skin.

922
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,560
Here it goes.

923
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:52,280
Uh... Please don't... cause
like a massive destruction.

924
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,480
It's good enough.

925
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,720
I might leave the planets out.

926
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,080
I'm running out of time.
I'd rather focus on something...

927
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,480
I'd rather focus on what I've got.

928
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,040
So this is basically orangutan face.

929
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,160
I'm just going to glue them
with chocolate.

930
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,240
Cos they want sculpture,
I'm giving you a sculpture.

931
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,760
Oh, shoot!

932
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,640
They're overcooked.

933
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,800
So the macarons are going to be
like biscuits now.

934
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,240
Ah, man.

935
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,720
Bakers, you have half-an-hour left.

936
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,400
Right, I need a tip. Oof.

937
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,360
OK. Needs a tip.
Apparently he needs a tip.

938
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,040
I'm just going
to fill the choux buns,

939
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,160
attach them as quick as possible.

940
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,920
UTENSILS RATTLE NOISILY

941
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,400
Everything in that drawer but a tip.

942
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,880
Let's hope this didn't break.

943
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,240
Oh! This looks good, you know!
It does? It doesn't.

944
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,800
But it's fine, I'm going to put
some clouds on my profiteroles.

945
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,880
Where are they?

946
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,680
Oh, my God look at Abdul's.
Will that balance?

947
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,360
I'm going to try a risky thing.

948
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,600
How could I make them gravel?

949
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,240
Could've done them smaller.
Could've done them smaller.

950
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,480
This is hilarious! Ugly.

951
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,800
You're hilarious.
That is proper ugly.

952
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
I don't know, I sort of love it.

953
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,400
I'm going to halve them,
then ice them.

954
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,000
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

955
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,240
This is so stressful.

956
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,640
Just not enough time
but just keep pushing.

957
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,320
Orangutan feet.

958
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,680
Pure white chocolate.
Let's see if this works.

959
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,520
Oh!

960
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,680
A bee macaron.
How much time is left?

961
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,360
Bakers, you have one minute left.

962
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,680
Ugh!

963
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,440
That's gravel guys, yeah?

964
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,280
I screw up this thing.

965
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,880
Anything you need to get
on your cake, get it on now.

966
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,160
Can feel myself shaking a bit now.

967
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,280
I don't know if
there's much else I can do.

968
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,680
That looks like a crazy orangutan.

969
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,560
Bakers! Your time... is up.

970
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,600
Congratulations!
You have completed the Bake Off.

971
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,720
That looks so cute!

972
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,680
You're getting a call
from Attenborough.

973
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,480
After two years of
Covid restrictions,

974
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,200
we can finally welcome friends
and family back to Welford Park

975
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,880
along with some familiar faces.

976
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,920
What's it like to be back?
It's the final!

977
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,400
The atmosphere is absolutely buzzing

978
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,680
and everyone's just so excited
to sort of see each other again.

979
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,000
It feels amazing to be back.

980
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,160
Who are you rooting for? Uh-oh!
I knew that question was coming!

981
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,640
I think purely because from
the beginning I predicted that

982
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,080
he would be in the final -
I think Sandro.

983
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,480
From the very get-go, he has just
got everything nailed down.

984
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,160
He's so consistent, so talented.

985
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,120
I know who's going to win,
and it's going to be Syabira.

986
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,760
I think it might be Syabira.

987
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,320
Abdul's really refined
his technique.

988
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,640
I can absolutely see him
winning it as well.

989
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,200
I'd like anyone to win,
to be honest.

990
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,960
Either three, they deserve it.

991
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,880
The finalists and their
showstoppers now face the judgment

992
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,760
of Paul and Prue
for the very last time.

993
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,960
Sandro, would you like to bring up
your final showstopper, please?

994
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,640
It's a bit messy.

995
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,000
I like the colour, I like the shape,
it looks quite nice.

996
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,320
I'm not sure about these boulders
sitting on the side.

997
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,680
OK. Well, let's have a look.

998
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,920
So, I've got the sweetbread
with lemon curd and cream.

999
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,560
Well, cream and lemon,
it's very nice

1000
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,400
but the bread is a little chewy.

1001
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,240
You need a little bit longer
proving. OK.

1002
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,840
Let's see what this sponge is like.

1003
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,920
My cake is a lemon sponge
with a plum compote.

1004
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,120
Great flavour. It's burnt.

1005
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,400
Couple of minutes,
five minutes perhaps over.

1006
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,640
Flavour's amazing, though.

1007
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,560
I mean, I would really enjoy
eating a great slab of that.

1008
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,440
Yeah, with a nice cup of tea. Mm.

1009
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,800
Now...?

1010
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,120
Profiteroles are
raspberry-cream-filled

1011
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,640
and the biscuits are
all lemon-flavoured.

1012
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,600
It's weird because
it's not oversweet

1013
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,480
because the interior is
fruity but not sweet.

1014
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,200
But that's really clever because
you've got the white chocolate

1015
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,800
on top which is... Yeah.
...very sweet.

1016
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,960
But you can't put chocolate on like
that. You need to spin it. OK.

1017
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,240
It actually looks far more
delicate and pretty.

1018
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,040
The biscuit itself is overbaked
but nevertheless...

1019
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,720
Good flavour.
...flavour's nice, yeah.

1020
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,800
I think you struggled
on a few things today

1021
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,800
but you've managed to do
quite a lot in the time.

1022
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,760
And I loved your cake.

1023
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,360
Well done.
Thanks, guys.

1024
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,560
Finally... done. Yeah.

1025
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,960
Done.

1026
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,440
Syabira, would you like to bring up
your final showstopper, please?

1027
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,520
Do you need a hand?

1028
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,120
Oh, it's wobbling a bit.

1029
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,400
You're good, you're good. OK.

1030
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,720
Yeah.

1031
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,120
Mm! Very nice.

1032
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,640
The orangutan is clever.

1033
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,240
I think you could've done
a little bit more work on the face.

1034
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,800
Yes, it's a rather strange construction.

1035
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,880
Yeah, I mean you can see
what's happening here.

1036
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,960
I love the colours,
I think that's fantastic.

1037
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,080
OK, let's start with the sponge.

1038
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,680
So, that's black pepper
and blackberry jam.

1039
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,520
And hazelnut chocolate buttercream.

1040
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,400
I definitely think
there's too much buttercream.

1041
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,440
Oh, I quite like it.
It tastes delicious.

1042
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,600
It actually works beautifully
with the blackberry in the sponge.

1043
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,000
Right, shall we have a go
at the second layer? OK.

1044
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,800
Supposed to be tarragon shortbread.

1045
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,840
What's the filling inside?
It's blackberry buttercream.

1046
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,200
That is lovely shortbread.

1047
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,680
It's really buttery and very crisp.

1048
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,880
You told us about the tarragon but
it isn't there, you can't taste it.

1049
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,520
No. And frankly, I'm glad
because it's really delicious.

1050
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,240
Thank you. OK.

1051
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,440
You have gooseberry meringue

1052
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,600
and tart with rhubarb
and strawberry cream.

1053
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,840
It's not the neatest thing
I've seen

1054
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,840
but it tastes fantastic nevertheless.

1055
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,520
Your flavours are superb.

1056
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,200
I expect it, however,
to be a little bit neater.

1057
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,560
Well done, Syabira.
There we go.

1058
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,720
Done it, done it.
Good luck.

1059
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,320
Abdul, would you like
to bring up your showstopper?

1060
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,120
I quite like the colours.
So, from a distance, you go,

1061
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,320
"That's quite attractive,
I like the yellow on that."

1062
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,440
Then you get closer.

1063
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,240
We'll start at the bottom
with the cake.

1064
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,200
The sponge is a honey sponge,

1065
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,600
in between each is blackberry jam,
some strawberries

1066
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,520
and Italian meringue buttercream.

1067
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,800
Wow, you've got honey... Yes.

1068
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,600
...ploughed all the way through
that. It's not unpleasant either.

1069
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,480
I like that but I think it's
just a little bit too sweet. Mm.

1070
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,840
Abdul, if you thought about it,

1071
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,600
you could've made them
a little bit more bee-shaped.

1072
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,680
Definitely. So...
This is the fattest bee!

1073
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,360
They taste beautiful. They're
slightly chewy on the inside,

1074
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,520
a little crisp on the out...

1075
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,240
It's just you've got no dome
so you just needed more time to rest

1076
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,120
and a bit more height to that.

1077
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,280
I think that the choux buns
are the worst thing. Yeah.

1078
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,320
I tried to fill some of them at
least but they were just flat.

1079
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,880
That's a proper failure.
Yes, that's... I agree.

1080
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,840
And let's have a look at
your biscuit.

1081
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,560
Now we've done these before
on Bake Off.

1082
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,640
So we know exactly what
we're dealing with here.

1083
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,440
Yeah, I think that's a triumph.

1084
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,000
That's lovely. It's chewy, crispy on
the outside. How it should be.

1085
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,120
That's really good.

1086
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,040
I think you've had a few hiccups
with the macarons and the choux.

1087
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,600
I do like the cake, though, however,

1088
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,440
I think you've got a nice flavour
in there.

1089
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,800
Honey is certainly
the overriding flavour.

1090
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,880
Thank you very much.
- Well done.

1091
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,880
Woop-woop!

1092
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,360
I wish it would've gone much better.

1093
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,080
But regardless of the outcome,
there's going to be a party.

1094
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,600
There's my friends over there.

1095
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,680
I'm just going to celebrate
and enjoy this.

1096
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,200
I'm very, very happy to be in the
final and I'm very proud of it.

1097
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,840
If I'm not a winner, I'm still happy
for whoever that wins this one.

1098
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,640
They all deserve it.

1099
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,840
I don't know.

1100
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,960
I'm keeping my hopes up.

1101
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:46,040
But I feel like the person least
likely to get it would be me.

1102
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,680
Yeah.

1103
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,480
As our three finalists
rejoin their friends and family,

1104
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,520
Paul and Prue must decide
who will be crowned

1105
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,760
the winner of
The Great British Bake Off 2022.

1106
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,360
I'm done! She laughs.

1107
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,720
You have just eaten quite
a lot of sweet things there. Indeed.

1108
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,000
But it is the final.

1109
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,680
You do ask for lots
of different bakes,

1110
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,520
and you got lots of different bakes.

1111
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,800
We were asking quite a lot
in the sense of the cake

1112
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,520
and then three other baked elements,

1113
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,200
and I think time caught up with them
very, very quickly.

1114
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,160
However, I thought
most of the flavours were,

1115
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,880
as always with these three, perfect.
I mean, really, really good.

1116
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,760
Abdul's been the most consistent
in the Bake Off this year.

1117
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,800
Incredible flavours.
Very focused on what he wants to do.

1118
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,320
Went a bit wayward today.

1119
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,680
But is that enough to take the prize
away from him? I don't know.

1120
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,320
Syabira...

1121
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,880
she did mess up
on the tarts on the top,

1122
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,640
they could have been much neater.

1123
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,640
I thought her flavours were spot-on.
And as always, quite unusual. Yeah.

1124
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,600
Sandro overbaked his
but the flavours were amazing.

1125
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,200
I agree with Paul.

1126
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,680
The sponge was a little overbaked

1127
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,160
but that was such a pleasure to eat. Yeah.

1128
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,880
Ultimately, you know,
Prue and I are going to have a chat

1129
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,600
and go through some of the bakes
we've seen today and previously,

1130
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,960
and I'm sure we're going to come up
with a worthy winner.

1131
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,920
You say you're going to have a chat.
Why not just give it to them all?

1132
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,360
Yeah. Or not to any of them!

1133
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,240
You have it! You take it!
I'll take it.

1134
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,480
Have you ever want Bake Off, Paul?
No.

1135
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,840
I'm a winner just by being here!
You really are.

1136
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,560
Thank you for coming, everybody.

1137
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,560
It really has been
an amazing Bake Off this year,

1138
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:34,960
and I'm going to pass you over now
to Matthew who has the announcement.

1139
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,640
Yes, I do.

1140
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,800
I'd like to invite
the three finalists

1141
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,600
to come and join us up here.

1142
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,400
I won't keep you waiting.

1143
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,120
I am delighted to say that

1144
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:04,960
the winner of The Great
British Bake Off 2022 is...

1145
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,600
...Syabira!

1146
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,800
Well done, well done.

1147
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,840
There you go! Congratulations.

1148
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,760
I'm so thrilled for you.
You're a genius. Thank you!

1149
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,800
I can't believe it. It's...
Honestly it hasn't sinked down.

1150
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,840
Aren't you a clever bunny.

1151
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,040
It's unbelievable.

1152
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,600
Thank you so much.

1153
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,080
This is the biggest achievement
in my life.

1154
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:51,440
All the hard work, all of the trial
and error, it's all worth it.

1155
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,920
I'm very, very proud.

1156
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,280
Syabira can be a bit of
a risk-taker with her flavours

1157
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,880
and it's worked.

1158
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,200
Some of the flavours that she did,
I've never had in the tent before,

1159
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,640
and unlikely to ever have again.
She is an incredible baker.

1160
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:10,440
And Noel. Never, ever been a baker
like you. So original.

1161
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:16,040
She's creative, she's careful,
she practises like anything.

1162
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:20,200
And she's imaginative.
I mean, she just has the lot.

1163
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,680
She's a very skilful baker.

1164
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,640
Well done, yeah.

1165
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,680
Thank you so much. Well done, girl.

1166
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,000
I'm so proud of Syabira.
She deserved it.

1167
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,880
She is that queen of flavours.
She fully deserves this.

1168
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,000
I'm so happy for her.
I'm happy I've got this far.

1169
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,080
I'm blessed, I'm grateful.

1170
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,000
Yeah, it's been an amazing
experience. It's been a dream.

1171
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,880
You guys made my dream come true.

1172
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,840
For me,
this is a massive achievement.

1173
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,560
I'm so happy,
I'm so proud of myself.

1174
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,040
And I'm happy that Syabira
got it as well

1175
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,640
because I could see in her
how hard she has worked for this.

1176
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,520
I mean, we all have but it's just
for her, this meant like so much,

1177
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,840
and I'm just so happy for her.

1178
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,560
You did it!

1179
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,760
Who would have thought!

1180
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,520
I think that I'm coming out as
a new person after this competition.

1181
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,040
I became more confident,
and I trust my instinct.

1182
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,160
You've won
The Great British Bake Off.

1183
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,800
It's been a while
there's no woman winner

1184
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,680
so, there you go, all good,
I'm here. Get one for all of you.

1185
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,320
We can do anything we want

1186
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,440
as long as we have all of our heart
and work for it.

1187
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,920
We are taking our hot chocolate
very seriously and...

1188
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:25,520
Erm, stop - dark chocolate.
What did I say? Hot chocolate.

1189
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,120
Blooper!

1190
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,560
Are you a Star Baker in the making?

1191
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,960
