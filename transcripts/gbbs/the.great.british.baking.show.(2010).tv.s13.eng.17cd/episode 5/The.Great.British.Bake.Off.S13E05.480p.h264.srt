1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,815
Dessert week. I love a dessert.
What's your favourite dessert?

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,175
My favourite dessert
would have to be syllabub.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,535
Oh, I love syllabub.
You know who invented syllabub?

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,975
Was it Syllabub Geldof?
It was Syllabub Marley.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,255
Oh. Oh, boys.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,575
Do stop being so syllabub.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,895
Welcome to the
Great British Syllabub!

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,015
Prue nailed that.
Yeah. You're a real Prue-fessional.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,775
Last time...

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,335
We travel led to Mexico.

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,055
While Maxy marked her second
Star Baker...

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,975
Maxy. Yeah!

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,495
...Carole courted chaos.
Oh, dear. Oh, look at that.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,855
But in the end, it was double
disappointment.

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,215
You got chilli in there?
Yeah.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,895
For Rebs.
Filling is too much!

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,455
And James.

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,255
Oh, I think I went wrong
across the board.

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,655
This week...
Ew, that's terrible.

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,415
...we indulge in desserts.

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,815
You know desserts
backwards is stressed.

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,015
And I am.

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,415
With a steamy signature.

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,655
Right, come on.

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,455
A timeless technical.

26
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,055
This is where experience
in baking comes in.

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,375
And a spectacular Show Stopper.

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,695
That is one of the best
mirror glazes I've ever seen.

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,135
But who will get their just
deserts?

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,535
Oh! It's moved!

31
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,855
Halfway through pudding week,
exciting week.

32
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,655
I'm ready to see what everyone's
going to put in their puddings.

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,215
Now it's only eight bakers left.

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,575
I think the judges are going
to be more critical.

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,895
I think they've got faith
in me, which is nice.

36
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,655
I've got a handshake.

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,335
I've got two Star Bakers.

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,255
Hopefully be up there again.

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,575
Just try to do everything
on time and have a finished product.

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,535
That's all!

41
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,815
Hello, bakers, welcome back
to the tent.

42
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,975
It's dessert week and for your
signature challenge,

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,615
these two scallywags would love
you to make eight

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,095
individuals tea med puddings.

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,015
Good idea. I always steam a
pudding before I wear it to get

46
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,535
the creases out.

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,655
They can be any style or flavour
you like, but must be steamed

48
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,975
to perfection.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,735
They must also taste incredi-bubble
and should be served

50
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,095
with an accompaniment
of your choice.

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,095
You have two hours.
On your marks...

52
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,415
...get set...
Bake!

53
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,415
I do feel the pressure.
Honestly, there's a lot to do.

54
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,135
This is my steamer.

55
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,535
Some people are getting
their big steamers out.

56
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,015
Humongous.

57
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,535
A lot Asian house
like steamed pudding.

58
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,335
Steamed pudding. It's a classic.

59
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,695
A Christmas pudding,
it's a steamed pudding.

60
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,015
So we are known in the UK
for producing some

61
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,415
of the best steamed puddings.

62
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,495
I'd love to see a really good
old-fashioned treacle sponge,

63
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,855
but I'd also like to see
sponges I've never

64
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,215
had before with completely different
flavours or fruit inside.

65
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,055
Giving it that Sandro flair.

66
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,655
Let's forget about school dinners
with the steamed sponge.

67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,335
The beauty of steam puddings
is the moisture.

68
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,015
So the last thing we want to see
in a steam pudding is a dry sponge.

69
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,215
The bakers must get good timing
for their steaming right.

70
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,815
They're not going to be able
to test them halfway through.

71
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,215
<i>And they don't want when they open
them up to find that they We raw.</i>

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,975
Morning, Mum. Er, Dawn!
Oh, yes, thank you.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,295
You do remind me a little bit
of my mum.

74
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,855
I'm not that much older than you.

75
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,855
No, I'm just saying you remind me
a little bit of my mum.

76
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,855
Dawn, tell us about your steam
pudding.

77
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,255
Well, I'm having caramel,
orange and apple.

78
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,015
They're very traditional.

79
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,095
Dawn's traditional steamed puddings
feature an orange sponge

80
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,055
and caramelised apples.

81
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,975
They'll be decorated with candied
peel and served with creme anglaise.

82
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,495
Absolutely lovely.
I love orange and apple.

83
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,815
You can't go wrong.
Good luck, Mum!

84
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,975
Ha-ha-ha!

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,375
I've met his mum.
Paul's mum is very cool, actually.

86
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,255
Is she?
Yeah, I'm really cool.

87
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,175
There you go, you see?
You relax, Dawn.

88
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,655
I remind him of his great gran.
I never said that.

89
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,615
I said great, great, great...

90
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,335
...great grandmother.
That's really unkind.

91
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,135
Dawn might fancy oranges
and apples, but Sandro

92
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,095
has his own apple flavour combo.

93
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,495
I am making apple and cherry crumble
puddings with a bit of booze

94
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,655
because it wouldn't be me
without it.

95
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,295
He's using his apples to make
apple and cherry

96
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,215
crumble steamed puddings.

97
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,535
He hopes the boozy drizzle
pleases Prue and the glitzy

98
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,855
decoration impresses Paul.

99
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,815
I would love to get a handshake.
Can you trick him into a handshake?

100
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,735
Yeah.
Something in your hand.

101
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,735
Let me get it for you.
Where? Here?

102
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,935
Ah!
There you go.

103
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,255
That's a good idea, isn't it?

104
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,415
Sandro might be going for glory,
but for Carole...

105
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,575
Oh, I've burnt 'em.
Flippin' 'ell.

106
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,975
...Dessert Week might
already be going up in smoke.

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,495
Morning, Carole.
Morning. Morning, Carole.

108
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,175
Oh, I might have to start again.

109
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,815
You burnt your plums?
I burnt me plums, yeah.

110
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,695
Not a good start.

111
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,375
If Carole does manage to prepare
her plums to perfection, her steamed

112
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,135
puddings will feature
a plum compote,

113
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,575
caramelised plums and cream.

114
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,415
What cream?
Chinchilli. Chinchilli!

115
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,815
Chinchilli. Chantilly!

116
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,775
No, no, no. Keep it chinchilli.
I've got my own words.

117
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,415
I want to see good things
from you this week, Carole.

118
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,455
No mess-ups.
No, I know.

119
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,895
I've just messed up. That's
your messing up for the clay.

120
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,935
From now on, perfection. Yeah. OK.

121
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,455
I've creamed my butter and sugar
together.

122
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,335
I need to make it fluffier.

123
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,695
Light, airy.

124
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,615
Most of the bakers are
aiming for a light

125
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,975
and fluffy steamed sponge.

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,255
It's better lighter.

127
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,735
It's just nice.

128
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,015
But a soft texture isn't for Kevin.

129
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,295
He's decided to go off-piste.

130
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,975
This is dense.

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,975
We're looking for the texture
of a fruit cake, really.

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,975
So I feel like this recipe

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,415
is difficult to
compare with everyone else's

134
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,775
because everyone
else is doing a sponge.

135
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,415
Kevin's paying homage to
his Scottish heritage with clootie

136
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,375
dumplings, a hearty fruit dessert
typically boiled, not steamed.

137
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,735
In a nod to the clootie
dumplings' ancient roots,

138
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,135
they'll be minimally decorated
and hand-moulded in a cloth.

139
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,575
This whole recipe is just exploring
my heritage a bit.

140
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,055
I hope to start a bit of a revival
of the humble clootie clumpling.

141
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,455
Kevin might be sticking
to tradition, but true to form,

142
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,295
Syabira is trailblazing
something completely new.

143
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,055
The pudding is watermelon flavour.

144
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,015
It's going to do exactly
like a watermelon.

145
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,495
It's actually quite unique I think.

146
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,815
Her novel watermelon
puddings will crack open

147
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,415
in the steam to reveal the internal
colours and seeds.

148
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,735
They'll be
paired with taro ice cream,

149
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,735
a sweet tasting Asian vegetable,

150
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,935
which should complement the equally
subtle watermelon flavour.

151
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,415
Watermelon,
not the strongest flavour.

152
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,175
Are you using an extract?

153
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,375
I'm using watermelon
essence in my steam pudding

154
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,855
to give a bit more boost
of the taste.

155
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,415
So I hope it's right.

156
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,735
Well, it's certainly original.

157
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,615
I've never had taro ice cream.
It sounds amazing.

158
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,975
Thank you.
Good luck. Thank you.

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,975
OK. Sorted out the plums.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,535
Once the batter is added to
the moulds...

161
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,495
All right. Come on, man.

162
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,215
...steaming can commence.

163
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,215
This steamer will crack
the pudding open

164
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,575
to reveal
what's inside of the watermelon.

165
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,855
Whether they're using a fancy
steamer, a simple saucepan,

166
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,415
or steaming in the oven...

167
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,015
Oh, it's getting hot in here.

168
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,295
...the bakers must ensure the water
is boiling hot.

169
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,215
This will create the steam - so,
without boiling hot water,

170
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,815
there's no steaming going on.

171
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,455
But while most are feeling the heat,
Carole's hot water tap is looking

172
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,775
a little lukewarm.

173
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,095
So just put water in there.

174
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,015
Usually I'd do it in the kettle.

175
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,255
And that isn't really boiling.

176
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,055
Right...

177
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,295
I just hope it's enough.

178
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,455
Bakers, you are halfway through.

179
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,055
Oh, I wanted to do that.
I know, but you've gone a bit shy,

180
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,335
haven't you? Yeah.

181
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,015
With puddings steaming...

182
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,335
They're going in for 55 minutes.

183
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,655
...the bakers crack
on with their accompaniments.

184
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,415
It's a coconut base.

185
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,775
It has a lot of sugar in it.

186
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,335
Sorry.

187
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,935
So I've decided to make
a pina colada flavoured pudding.

188
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,535
So it's going to be a coconut creme
anglaise decorated with an umbrella.

189
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,895
Janusz's pina colada puddings
feature coconut sponges, caramelised

190
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,095
pineapples and pipettes
of coconut rum.

191
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,535
Whenever me and Paul are out
drinking, he always buys me...

192
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,855
...a pina colada.
We always have a pina colada.

193
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,295
I'm going to save one for you.

194
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,135
If Paul buys us a pina colada,
we know it's going to get messy.

195
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,015
I've had a pina colada on most
continents, actually.

196
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,655
Everybody loves a pina colada.

197
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,015
Look forward to this one.
Thank you. Thank you.

198
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,215
If you pull this off, it's going to
be like a Wham! Video in here.

199
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,615
Whilejanusz has chosen a cocktail,
Maxy has nabbed some nuts.

200
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,935
I'm making candied
pecans to go on top.

201
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,295
Thought it would be nice to have

202
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,775
something different, and I've never
actually made them.

203
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,095
I'm just hoping for the best,
really.

204
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,455
Her candied pecans will top

205
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,735
date-laden sticky toffee puddings.

206
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,655
She hopes her elaborate decoration

207
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,975
will earn her Star Baker

208
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,735
for the third time.

209
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,655
Maxy, you must be thinking,

210
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,455
"I can just keep going
in this competition."

211
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,695
Well, I hope so.

212
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,015
And you've got two Star Bakers
and a handshake.

213
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,535
Yeah. You can retire now.

214
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,255
I know, honestly.
You've already won.

215
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,935
Abdul is hot on Maxy's heels
with his own intricate topping.

216
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,895
I'm trying to really up
my decorative skills.

217
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,815
We have figs, white chocolate,
some rose petals and pistachios,

218
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,495
all quite common in the Middle East.

219
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,895
Abdul is making a fig and date
steamed pudding.

220
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,735
Not only is he topping with
chocolate dipped figs, he's also

221
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,775
making mini isomalt sugar
decorations.

222
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,095
Just making some isomalt now.

223
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,175
Everything is under control,
which is weird.

224
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,655
I mean, the steam
pudding's almost done, actually.

225
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,975
But Carole's concerned her
puddings are far from done.

226
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,415
How's it all going?
Not too good. Not the best.

227
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,455
Don't think my water in my
steam bath was hot enough.

228
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,615
You know desserts backwards
is stressed. And I am.

229
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,295
Oh, clear.

230
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,655
Will you often do that?
Yeah, like a horse.

231
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,135
I can't do it now.
Blah, blah, blah, blah!

232
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,255
OK. I used to be shy.

233
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,975
You've got to break through
that barrier.

234
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,255
We've talked about this.

235
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,255
We've been in training
for nine months now.

236
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,975
Go. This is your moment.

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,855
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes!

238
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,335
I think you pretty much
got over that shyness.

239
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,615
Whatever happens,
they're coming out.

240
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,975
Right, finally.

241
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,055
You know what's so scary, though?

242
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,255
Once you take them out
and you turn it over,

243
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,895
there's no going back.

244
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,215
Most of the puddings have been
steaming under tin foil.

245
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,255
The bakers will only know
if they're cooked

246
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,255
when they're removed
from the moulds.

247
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,815
I hate this bit.

248
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,335
I really hate it.

249
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,655
Let's see how it turns out.

250
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,975
One...

251
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,495
It's supposed to be split
out, so it's fine.

252
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,455
Let's see.

253
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,495
So far, so good.

254
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,575
I think they're OK.
Yeah. Great.

255
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,735
Whilst most of the bakers
can breathe a sigh of relief...

256
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,855
Done.

257
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,695
...for Carole...

258
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,975
Right, here we go.

259
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,535
...the proof is still in the pudding.

260
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,415
Please stay together.

261
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,015
Please!

262
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,815
I'm a little bit worried
they might go splodge.

263
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,815
Said no more mistakes.

264
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,655
Let's have a look.

265
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,695
Oh, no!

266
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,415
It's collapsed.

267
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,335
No, no, no.

268
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,615
How stressful is this one?

269
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,855
Yeah. He's... See?

270
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,655
Not cooked.

271
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,495
It is what it is.

272
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,255
Eight collapsed puddings.

273
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,535
What a disaster.

274
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,615
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

275
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,535
Speedy Gonzalez.

276
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,055
We don't have a lot of time.

277
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,575
Got cream dripping down the side.

278
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,495
Ugh! Oh, this is bad!

279
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,455
Just sticky toffee sauce.

280
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,815
Let's see how it looks.

281
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,935
Umbrella.

282
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,775
Pour in custard. Flowers.

283
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,935
Nearly there.
You're the steam queen, right?

284
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,735
Choo-choo!

285
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,175
Gold.

286
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,815
What do I do with this pickle, then?

287
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,095
Plonked candied peel on top.

288
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,735
Taro ice cream.

289
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,095
The golden boy.
I add gold to everything.

290
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,335
Might be a bit messy.

291
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,975
Agh!

292
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,255
This is a horrible one.

293
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,015
Bakers, your time is up!

294
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,735
That's it.

295
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,815
Finished.

296
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,215
They're not very pretty puddings.

297
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,215
They're just humble
clootie dumplings.

298
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,695
They're beautiful to me.

299
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,135
<i>Ban“!</i>

300
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,455
I like that.
What the hell?

301
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,975
How did you manage that, Carole?

302
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,335
I can't guarantee they will
like the flavour.

303
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,735
No more mistakes, he said.

304
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,255
Well, this is one.

305
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,215
Flippin' 'ell.

306
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,975
The bakers' steamed puddings will

307
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,335
now face the judgment
of Paul and Prue.

308
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,815
Hello, Syabira.
Hi, Syabira.

309
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,135
Well, the design is amazing.

310
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,015
I love the way you've coloured
it so that when it does split,

311
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,615
you get that watermelon inside.

312
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,175
Ancl I like the seeds as well.
They do look incredible.

313
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,135
You are one clever baker.

314
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,415
Thank you.

315
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,335
OK.
I have lychee custard.

316
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,655
Taro...
Ice cream.

317
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,095
...ice cream.

318
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,695
Wow.

319
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,975
Look at that.

320
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,895
That ice cream is really fragrant.

321
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,375
Sensational.
I never had anything like that.

322
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,855
Thank you.

323
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,695
The watermelon essence in the
pudding is just too much for me.

324
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,015
Unfortunately.

325
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,935
It tastes a bit fake. Mm.

326
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,655
You've over killed it
with the essence.

327
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,135
I'll say that with a heavy heart.

328
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,575
Yeah... I agree.
I did put too much today.

329
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,495
Decorated well.

330
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,295
They certainly look Middle Eastern
and very, very pretty.

331
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,655
They have date and fig in them,
and saffron pouring custard.

332
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,615
Saffron and the caramel sauce
works beautifully well

333
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,975
and the fig and date,
again, works lovely.

334
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,055
It's moist and delicious
and it's light as anything.

335
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,615
Thank you. Thank you.

336
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,415
Obviously the cream's melted,

337
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,415
because it is quite warm
in the tent today,

338
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,935
but good height to them.

339
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,295
I made my version
of sticky toffee pudding.

340
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,135
We've got pecans and dates.

341
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,175
It's moist but really sticky.

342
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,055
That is the perfect
sticky toffee texture.

343
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,775
There's just enough nuts
to balance in there.

344
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,855
Ultimately, it's a great eat,
well clone. Thank you. Thank you.

345
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,375
They're a little uneven looking.

346
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,735
Some of them seem
to have more topping than others.

347
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,055
OK.
What's in this? Orange and apple.

348
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,655
Apple is nice and tart.
Ancl the orange works beautifully

349
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,895
as well with it. Yeah, well clone.

350
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,935
So what is the booze?

351
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,015
That's coconut rum.

352
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,815
There you go.
Try it with the rum.

353
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,575
You've probably ruined it now.

354
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,415
No, you haven't!

355
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,095
It has caramelised pineapple
with coconut sponge.

356
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,695
That coconut sponge,
it's a bit like tanning lotion.

357
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,255
Explain that.

358
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,775
Well, tanning lotion, I always
associate with some of

359
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,535
the tanning lotion I use - a bit of
a coconut smell. Oh, I see.

360
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,135
It's like being on holiday
when you walk down the beach.

361
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,455
You've got a coconut sponge
that's very sweet.

362
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,055
I just think it's slightly overkill.

363
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,415
These are clootie dumplings.

364
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,775
So they're made with fruit
soaked in whisky.

365
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,695
They're all misshapen.
So it looks messy. Yeah.

366
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,855
I love the flavour.

367
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,895
I just think it would
be much better lighter.

368
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,535
It's dried out.
It's just too stodgy for me.

369
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,015
It's too dense. Far too dense.
It's the wrong recipe for this.

370
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,335
Yeah.

371
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,535
I know you said no more disasters,
but I think I've done

372
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,295
this one in style.

373
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,655
I don't think my water and
my steam bath was hot enough.

374
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,055
I'm going to be kind and pick one
that's actually semi-done. Yeah.

375
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,775
It's stem ginger with plum.

376
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,815
It does taste delicious.

377
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,335
The sharpness from the plums
really works as well.

378
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,975
It's just that the pudding
didn't get cooked.

379
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,375
It's heartbreaking, really.

380
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,655
Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks, Carole.

381
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,055
They look quite sweet -
glitzy on the top.

382
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,535
They look very tempting.

383
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,815
I made apple and cherry
crumble puddings.

384
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,895
There's a bit of liqueur in there.
That looks like good sponge.

385
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,095
The cherry and the apple and
actually with the custard as well,

386
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,855
that blend of the spices works
beautifully well together. Thanks.

387
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,775
The crumble is perfect.
The custard is perfect.

388
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,815
I think the cherry liqueur
is perfect.

389
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,255
I think you've clone a good job.
Yeah, well clone. Thank you.

390
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,775
Super pleased with the feedback
I've got.

391
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,415
Felt like the handshake
was almost gonna...

392
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,655
Never mind. Next time.

393
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,055
I agree that it was too dry,
so I kind of saw it coming.

394
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,095
Very mixed feelings.

395
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,615
Just a tad bit too much
of watermelon essence,

396
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,015
that brings me...
It's fine.

397
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,615
I hate technicals. I really do.

398
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,215
Ancl the pressure is on.

399
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,335
While the bakers could
practise their signature bake,

400
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,695
the technical challenge
is a mystery.

401
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,055
Hello, bakers.
Welcome back to the tent.

402
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,855
It's time for your technical
challenge, which this week

403
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,135
has been set for you by Prue.

404
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,535
Prue, any words of wisdom or advice?

405
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:39,255
This is my favourite pud, so please
read the recipe very carefully.

406
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,815
As ever, this task
is judged blind.

407
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,055
So we ask Paul and Prue
to leave the tent.

408
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,415
They are actually heading off
to Pasha in Ibiza,

409
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,775
where they have a residency.

410
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,975
Dj Sweet Bread and MC Crusty Baps.

411
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,855
Paul's MC Crusty Baps, obviously.

412
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,615
For your technical challenge,
Prue would like you each

413
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,855
to make a lemon meringue pie.

414
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,855
You have two hours.
On your marks...

415
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,575
Get set...
Oh, go on, then, bake!

416
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,175
Have you seen the method, guys?

417
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,975
Oh, my God.

418
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,295
Come on.

419
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,735
There isn't any instruction.

420
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,895
No wonder she said
read the recipe carefully.

421
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,455
It just says,
"Make a lemon meringue pie."

422
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,775
The recipes before
were, like, decent.

423
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,695
This is like, what's the point?

424
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,215
Never made one before.

425
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,815
Don't know how I'm going
to survive this.

426
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,415
So, Prue.

427
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,415
So you've asked them to make a lemon
meringue pie, without a method?

428
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,175
Well, there's the pastry shells,
the lemon filling,

429
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,415
and there's the meringue.

430
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,735
I'm quite sure they can do
all three.

431
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,055
Why do they need a recipe?

432
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,695
Where do you think
they'll go wrong?

433
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,695
If they don't blind bake,
they'll be in trouble,

434
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,455
get a soggy bottom,
and if there are any cracks in it,

435
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,095
when they pour that filling in,
it's going to run straight out.

436
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,735
What you want is a crisp meringue,
but a soft sort of marshmallowy

437
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,935
but cooked middle, and the lemon
filling is just soft but firm.

438
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,855
The sharpness from the filling with
the sweetness in the meringue.

439
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,335
It's perfect.
This is a classic bake.

440
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,415
I really do expect the bakers
to all do well with it.

441
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,775
I totally agree.

442
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,455
I'm starting with the pastry,
it's a shortcrust pastry.

443
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,815
One egg, beaten. OK.

444
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,695
Don't handle it too much
because it will go too tough.

445
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,175
I've always clone my shortcrust
in the kitchen.

446
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,655
Ancl I just know when to stop.

447
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,015
Sweet shortcrust is sturdy,
isn't it?

448
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,375
It is pretty sturdy, yes.
You need to make sure

449
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,735
you don't roll it too cold,
because then it breaks.

450
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,735
That's what I'm talking about -
this guy knows.

451
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,615
He knows his baking!
Good luck.

452
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,975
Thank you.

453
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,335
Syabira, are you a fan
of lemon meringue pie?

454
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,695
I'm not really a huge fan
of the lemon meringue.

455
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,975
Well, make something else.

456
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,335
He's going to have seven
lemon meringue pies to try.

457
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,775
Maybe sweetcorn pie.
Sweetcorn pie, yeah.

458
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,375
So I've brought my pastry together.

459
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,855
I'm going to let it rest
to let the gluten relax.

460
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,055
Freezer.

461
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,775
Lemon filling.

462
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,375
So that's five lemons, cornflour,
orange juice,

463
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,215
caster sugar and egg yolks.

464
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,535
It resembles a curd, basically.

465
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,935
Put everything in a saucepan.
Keep whisking it.

466
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,895
I think everybody cooking their...

467
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,815
Yep. I'm going to follow.

468
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,855
This is just beginning
to really thicken quickly.

469
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,735
I hope it's enough, because if
it isn't enough, I'm in trouble.

470
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,095
Dawn, you must know
about lemon meringue.

471
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,455
I have made quite a few.
You've made a few, right?

472
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,975
They're the sort of thing
that I'd do on a Sunday lunchtime.

473
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,695
This is where experience
in baking comes in.

474
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,295
Right. It's great dough,
pretty straightforward to make.

475
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,975
I want the pastry to be sort of
even in thickness throughout.

476
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,815
If it's too thin, it could crack.

477
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,375
It has to be properly inserted.

478
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,135
Ohh!

479
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,455
I will blind bake it
for around 15 minutes.

480
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,015
Blind baking,

481
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,935
it sort of pre-bakes the bottom
so you don't have a soggy bottom.

482
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,815
I've always got a soggy bottom,
I have.

483
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,815
Oh, people are blind baking.

484
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,135
I don't know if this is
correct way to do.

485
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,735
I'm going to do the same.

486
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,655
Syabira might be worried

487
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,215
about her first-ever
lemon meringue pie... Ooh!

488
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,295
...but Sandro... That's good.
..Is hopeful his will get him a win.

489
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,655
You know what?
If I was to get Star Baker,

490
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,975
that would mean the world to me,
because it's like

491
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,175
proper validation, that.

492
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,855
Bakers, you are halfway through.

493
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,495
You want to see me juggle?
It's pretty powerful.

494
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,935
So I'm just making
a French meringue.

495
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,215
So you whip your egg whites

496
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,975
and then start adding sugar
bit by bit.

497
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,375
Hey! You did it.

498
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,615
I did it for a minute.

499
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,975
All right. There you go.

500
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,295
Let's see what we can do.

501
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,535
It's not as neat as
I'd like it to be, but it's fine.

502
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,575
Now I've blind baked it,
I'll bake it a bit more.

503
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,935
If it's under baked,
it will just stay gloopy.

504
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,015
It will not be crusty,
you know, nice.

505
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,055
I don't want to risk to overcook
the base.

506
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,335
I think it should be
partially cooked.

507
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,855
Just 45 minutes remain.

508
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,215
It looks cooked
and it's started to brown.

509
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,735
With bases baked,
or partially baked...

510
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,575
...construction can commence.

511
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,935
Oh, my God.
There's nowhere near enough filling.

512
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,335
I'm absolutely heartbroken
about this.

513
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,655
I'm just going to have to go
with it.

514
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,055
The next question is how to pipe it?

515
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,615
Make it look pretty.
Gonna be creative.

516
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,295
Just in case something's gone wrong,
at least it looks good.

517
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,335
I'm going in now.

518
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,815
I don't know how long for.
How long do they bake for?

519
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,935
How long?
Hopefully, half an hour,

520
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,055
so we go crunchy on top
and gooey inside.

521
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,695
Oh, it's going to be awful.

522
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,535
I've got about that much
filling, if I'm lucky.

523
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,535
I feel really bad because
it's a dish that my friends...

524
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,295
I have to make it for them

525
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,175
cos they reckon it is
off-the-scale good.

526
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,975
Well... And this isn't
off the scale good.

527
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,735
It's probably a lot better than
you're giving yourself credit for.

528
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,415
I don't think so.

529
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,135
I'm just staring at it!

530
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,895
She's not very interesting though.
She doesn't say much.

531
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,935
Quite dull and boring.

532
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,495
I ain't getting on the floor looking
at it cos I won't get up again.

533
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,015
I'd be like Bambi on ice.

534
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,215
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

535
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,575
Ooh!

536
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,935
Five, four, three, two, one.

537
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,815
OK, it's going to have to come out.

538
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,055
It's a bit rough and ready.

539
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,015
My first meringue pie ever.

540
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,775
Oh, no.

541
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,655
Oh, man. Cracks.

542
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,215
My gloves caused it to, like,
pop out.

543
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,895
The really, really fun bit

544
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,855
is actually getting it out
without destroying it.

545
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,055
Thank you!

546
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,295
Ooh! That doesn't look cooked.

547
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,215
I think I actually under baked
the first bit.

548
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,575
If I go back in, increase it to 180
degrees, I might take the chance.

549
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,295
Bakers, you've got one minute left.

550
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,975
Uh-oh.

551
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,415
Maxy, would you hold my plate?

552
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,695
This is nerve-racking.

553
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,095
Ahh!

554
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,535
Yeah, there we are.

555
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,535
Dearie me.

556
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,535
I don't think mine is cooked.

557
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,455
Bakers, your time is up.

558
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,495
Oh!

559
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,135
It's ridiculous.

560
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,615
I make this probably every week,
and I completely stuffed it up.

561
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,855
Oh, no, Dawn!

562
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,255
Please bring your lemon meringue
pies to the front

563
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,615
and place them behind
your photograph.

564
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,975
It's definitely not cooked,
at all.

565
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,335
Paul and Prue are expecting
eight perfect lemon meringue pies

566
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,615
with crisp pastry and a silky
filling topped with billowing

567
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,535
golden meringue peaks.

568
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,135
But they have no idea
whose is whose.

569
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,055
You can see none of you needed
a recipe, did you?

570
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,575
Start with this one. Looks neat.

571
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,575
The pastry is a nice colour and
there's no leaking that I can see.

572
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,895
That base is a bit soggy,
but it's tart,

573
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,895
and actually, the meringue
is not bad. No.

574
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,695
Good. OK. Right, next one.

575
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,655
Looks as if the base cracked
as it came out,

576
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,135
but it's not leaking.

577
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,495
Holds well, it's got a great base
on it.

578
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,535
That looks really luscious,
the lemon, it's not too thick.

579
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,055
It's just holding.

580
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,975
It's very tart as well.
Just a pity about the crack.

581
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,335
This is a mess.

582
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,895
The pastry shell is all over
the place. That's falling apart.

583
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,255
Doesn't look as if there's
enough filling there.

584
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,655
No, there isn't.
Where is the filling?

585
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,935
It's tart enough, but there's
not enough filling

586
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,535
and the pastry shell is not good.

587
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,295
Shell's quite good.

588
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,055
I quite like this -
mad waves on top. Yeah.

589
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,255
Ancl the crust looks properly baked.
Wow.

590
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,775
Wow. That's a nice, proper...
Billowy meringue.

591
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,175
Very good.

592
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,535
That is a really good
lemon meringue pie. Yeah, it's nice.

593
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,895
Moving on.
That shell's a mess.

594
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,895
It's just not neat.
It's cracked all the way around.

595
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,855
The meringue looks quite nice. Yes.

596
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,975
But it's a bit soggy.

597
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,895
Well, this is quite novel.
Interesting, yeah.

598
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,295
This has been piped.
But look at the base -

599
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,735
holes all over the place.
Yeah. It's falling apart.

600
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,175
I like the meringue, though.

601
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,815
This is too thick on the walls.
Look how thick that is.

602
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,935
Quite clumsy.

603
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,855
It's quite soggy underneath.
Not enough blind baking.

604
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,895
Raw. It is.

605
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,215
It's tart enough,
but the base is a problem with that.

606
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,335
Moving on to the last one.

607
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,255
It's like a patchwork quilt,
and the meringue isn't as high

608
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,735
as it should be. But it's got
a lovely crisp bottom,

609
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,175
which means it's had a proper
blind baking.

610
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,855
That's nice. That tastes good.

611
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,335
The textures are all right.

612
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,775
Prue and Paul will now rank
the lemon meringue pies

613
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,095
from worst to best.

614
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,895
In eighth, we have this one.
Whose is this?

615
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,295
Too thick and too raw.

616
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,655
In seventh place,
we have this one.

617
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,335
Dawn? The filling was
a little narrow.

618
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,775
In sixth, we have this one.

619
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,175
Pastry all over the place,
broken up.

620
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,895
Kevin takes fifth place,
Sandro fourth and Maxy third.

621
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,015
Second, we have...

622
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,135
...this one. Whose is this?

623
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,255
Abdul? Pretty good, actually,
just a little bit broken up.

624
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,175
Which means, janusz -

625
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,535
this was a perfect
lemon meringue pie.

626
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,855
Thank you.

627
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,855
The method was, "Make the pie."

628
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,655
So I was like,
I'm going to make the pie.

629
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,255
Made the pie, won the pie. Great!

630
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,455
Dessert week is not going
too well.

631
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,895
Sixth in the technical,
but I wasn't last,

632
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,615
so it was one thing.

633
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,935
Nightmare come true.

634
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,095
Note to myself next time,
even if you don't like it,

635
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,015
just eat all of the British
very traditional classic dessert.

636
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,615
Fuming.
I am absolutely "beep" fuming.

637
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,215
I've made about 500, I reckon,
in my life,

638
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,455
so I'm just mad with myself.

639
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,855
It's quite exciting coming
into this Show Stopper.

640
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,415
I think it's split between two
camps at the moment.

641
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,495
Abdul, Sandro, janusz and Maxy.

642
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,575
All four of them are in line
for Star Baker, and I think the rest

643
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,495
of the guys are sitting
down at the bottom.

644
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,055
Carole's in trouble. Mm-hm.

645
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,415
I thought, the Signature, she didn't
do very well at all.

646
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,335
I think Dawn's down there and Kevin.

647
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,215
Including Syabira, weirdly.

648
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,015
But you know what? On her day,
she can be a bit of a genius.

649
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,415
Her technical was such a pity,
because she is such a good baker.

650
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,335
It's going to be tricky,
this Show Stopper today.

651
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,735
It's a difficult one, and I'm not
sure that the bottom bakers have got

652
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,095
the skills to be able to produce
something that good.

653
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,415
Surely that's your fault
for setting this challenge.

654
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,415
No, no, it's not our fault.

655
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,335
Bakers, welcome back to the tent
for your Show Stopper Challenge.

656
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,215
The judges would like you to make
a visually spectacular mousse-based

657
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,495
dessert with a surprise inside.

658
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,095
Any surprise you like.

659
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,415
Could be Quentin Tarantino's
pencil sharpener.

660
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,015
Ooh, crunchy.

661
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,535
Your Show Stopper must have at
least three further dessert elements.

662
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,735
One of which, weirdly,
for this show, must be baked.

663
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,095
You have 4.5 hours.

664
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,735
On your marks...
..get set...

665
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,055
...bake!

666
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,895
Let's do it.

667
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,335
I'm feeling nervous about
this challenge.

668
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,255
I hope this time they will like it.

669
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,615
Our Show Stopper Challenge
is mousse cake.

670
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,615
The bakers have got to produce
what essentially is...

671
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,975
...magic.

672
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,055
We want to see the layers,
and it's got to have that hidden

673
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,935
surprise smack bang in the middle.

674
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,255
Making my surprise.

675
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,175
The most difficult part
is the surprise, because you want

676
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,815
that surprise to be seen
in every slice.

677
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,855
I'm using gelatine, which helps
set a mousse.

678
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,815
More gelatine!

679
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,135
It's like a gelatine fest.

680
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,935
This is all about the use
of gelatine, because in and around

681
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,455
that surprise, it's got
to be stable.

682
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,175
Gelatine is my enemy.

683
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,335
They must be careful
because too much gelatine, instead

684
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,095
of getting something light and airy,
they'll get something that's

685
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,735
rubbery and unpleasant.

686
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,335
Hi, Carole. Carole, tell us about
your mousse dessert.

687
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,855
I'm going to make a strawberry
mousse.

688
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,255
Ancl through the middle
will be a red velvet strawberry.

689
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,935
Lovely.

690
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,855
Carole's making red and green
velvet sponges

691
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,015
to form her strawberry surprise.

692
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,815
They'll be encased in strawberry
and chocolate mousses.

693
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,175
How much gelatine are you going to
go through?

694
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,815
I've got about 30 leaves
all together.

695
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,215
I don't want this to go splodge.

696
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,535
But also don't want it to fall
on the floor and hit the ceiling.

697
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,895
Bounce. Like a football. Good luck.

698
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,415
Thank you.

699
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,775
Working with gelatine
is a dangerous business.

700
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,255
You need to find the right balance
between it being not rubbery,

701
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,095
but set hard enough.

702
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,735
A large portion of gelatine
will help the layers

703
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,015
of creamy mousse set...

704
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,175
We're getting somewhere.

705
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,015
...but it runs the risk of making
the mousse dense and inedible.

706
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,415
Ancl one baker who won't be
compromising on texture is Syabira.

707
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,455
I need to be careful with the amount
of gelatine, because I want

708
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,695
it to be nice and smooth
when you bite into it.

709
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,415
It gives you a very pleasurable,
tingling feeling.

710
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,895
It's a buzzing bee's mousse cake.

711
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,775
Syabira is using the subtle melon
flavour for the second time

712
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,535
in Dessert Week, though today
she's avoiding artificial essence

713
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,615
for a more natural taste.

714
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,135
The top features jelly and a biscuit
bee.

715
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,855
Inside, there's a surprise of sponge
bees and plus signs.

716
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,655
I made a very silly joke
like "What is the bee's blood type?"

717
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,535
It's a bee positive.

718
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,055
While Syabira's planning a hidden
hive,

719
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,015
Kevin is determined to bury his
bone.

720
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,295
My bake is about my dogs digging
up the garden and the shape

721
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,895
inside is going to be the bone
that she's digging for.

722
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,775
Kevin's garden will be made
from creme mousseline,

723
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,175
banana mousse and chocolate mousse.

724
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,135
Buried beneath a butter cream
lawn will be a sponge bone.

725
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,495
So there's going to be bones
inside a cake.

726
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,935
But when I practise at home,
I didn't have a dog bone cutter.

727
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,655
Sol had to use a gingerbread man
and it just looked like a dead body

728
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,215
buried in the garden.

729
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,775
Let's bake. Colour, here we come.

730
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,255
Most of the bakers are making their
surprise element out of sponge.

731
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,375
This takes about 20 minutes
and then leave them to cool.

732
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,255
Hopefully I'll get it clone in time.

733
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,975
Fingers crossed for this one.

734
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,335
But if baking wasn't time consuming
enough...

735
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,335
Now we're going to make
a mess with lemon jelly.

736
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,855
...Dawn's making her surprise out of
jelly,

737
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,215
which takes even longer to prepare.

738
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,575
The mould, it's got a flower
pattern,

739
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,455
so I'm now going to fill these.

740
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,335
As long as they set,
I'll be all right.

741
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,815
Dawn's going to create a woodland
mousse dessert featuring two

742
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,895
ambitious set surprises -
a raspberry mousse toadstool,

743
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,815
and her lemon jelly flowers.

744
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,575
Obviously, yesterday I had problems,

745
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,855
so it's lemon redemption, jelly, OK?

746
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,455
With added basil.

747
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,695
Let's just hope it's not
a touch of Basil Fawlty.

748
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,615
Dawn's not the only baker
gambling on a set surprise.

749
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,935
Right. But if Sandro is to succeed,

750
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,535
he's going to have to conquer
the world.

751
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,895
I am doing the entire planet
with this panna cotta jelly.

752
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,255
It's basically going to be Earth's
core.

753
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,575
I'm hoping to create something
impressive.

754
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,735
No pressure.

755
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,415
In order to create planet Earth,

756
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,655
he must make a sponge panna cotta
and jelly core,

757
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,415
set a thick coating of white
chocolate mousse,

758
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,175
and shape the entire structure
into a perfect sphere.

759
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,655
This is structurally quite
difficult to do.

760
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,495
Yeah, the white chocolate mousse
is the majority of the dessert.

761
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,375
So I've got quite a challenge
ahead of me, but I'll put them in

762
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,935
two of these. It should set.

763
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,455
Come on globe. Look forward
to it. Good luck. Thank you.

764
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,055
Good luck, Sandro. Thank you.

765
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,175
I have to say, I don't have a huge
amount of confidence in this.

766
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,135
It looks too complicated,
but you do usually pull it off.

767
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,455
We'll see!

768
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,215
Sandro's not the only baker
shooting for the stars.

769
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,135
So I'm basically making
a little galaxy.

770
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,295
I'm a huge fan of space, planets,
just trying to understand what's

771
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,255
happening and it is just stunning
what's out there.

772
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,575
Abdul's galaxy features white
chocolate spheres,

773
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,295
and a celestial mirror glaze.

774
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,695
Inside, cake pop planets will be
suspended in layers of almond

775
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,535
crunch, blackberry mousse
and yuzu curd.

776
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,015
Abdul, you doing some space
business?

777
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,775
I'm doing some space business,
indeed.

778
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,855
Is he doing some space business?

779
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,455
He's doing an Earth apparently.
No competition though, right?

780
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,295
No. No competition, no.

781
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,735
Done.

782
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,855
When it comes to the competition
for the best sponge,

783
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,935
Carole's concerned she might
be sitting in last place.

784
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,855
Those little patches are under baked.

785
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,095
We don't want under baked
little patches.

786
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,895
I'm going to put this back
in the oven.

787
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,295
Janusz, though, is celebrating
all things cake.

788
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,655
I am quite confident today,
because what is the best thing

789
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,815
to hide in a cake than a cupcake?

790
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,175
Janusz's Rainbow Surprise
Cupcake features white and red

791
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,415
whipped cream to represent
icing and cherry.

792
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,855
He'll be surrounded by chocolate
mousse and chocolate sponge.

793
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,295
Can I try? Go for it.

794
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,655
Just the chocolate sponge.

795
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,295
I'm a little scavenger.

796
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,495
Very good. You can say
this to Paul now.

797
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,255
Paul Hollywood, right?

798
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,175
I know it's chocolate,
but it's a bit chocolaty for me.

799
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,415
I would have put less chocolate
in,

800
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,455
but more chocolate.

801
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,895
So I can see that we've got
the next judge brewing here.

802
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,975
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

803
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,335
Oh, I'd love to.

804
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,095
Oh! Yes.

805
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,815
It's judgment time for Sandro.

806
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,215
He's about to find out if his jelly
gamble has paid off.

807
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,255
Got the weight of the world on me.

808
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,175
It's coming off the moulds.

809
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,735
Barn.

810
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,015
It's definitely set.

811
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,295
But Dawn's jelly flowers...

812
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,255
No. That one's fallen apart.

813
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,935
...are a little wobbly.

814
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,255
Can't see the design.

815
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,895
I'm just going to say
they're very abstract flowers.

816
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,295
That's such a shame.

817
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,735
It's terrible. I hate it.

818
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,175
Bakers, you are halfway through!

819
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,615
OK.

820
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,135
Hey, Matt, not only is Sandro
a great baker... Hmm?

821
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,815
...but sometimes he shrinks himself
down and lives in my ear.

822
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,975
Don't be ridiculous.

823
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,335
Check this out.

824
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,495
I stand corrected.

825
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,895
At least my custard set.

826
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,895
Once each layer is set, the next
can be inserted and more surprise

827
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,215
elements hidden inside.

828
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,935
Strawberries.

829
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,215
Here we go.

830
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,335
From strawberries...

831
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,415
...to bees... to bones,

832
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,575
the sponge surprises are beginning
to come together.

833
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,695
It seems fine. There's just so much
sponge.

834
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,655
It's quite a firm structure.

835
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,335
But a stable sponge isn't for Dawn.

836
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,815
Having failed to set her flower
jelly,

837
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,095
she's now undertaking a second set
surprise.

838
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,095
My mousse toadstool.

839
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,295
I just hope I can get it to hold
together.

840
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,175
It's really a massive risk.

841
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,575
In order to complete planet Earth,

842
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,095
Sandro also has a mammoth
amount of mousse.

843
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,695
I'm really worried about how
the mousse will set.

844
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,015
I'm going to hope
that it gets solid.

845
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,295
Fingers crossed!

846
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,375
There might be pressure at
the centre of the Earth,

847
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,855
but Maxy is bringing the sunshine.

848
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,495
My Swiss roll.
It's meant to be the sun.

849
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,295
That's my surprise.

850
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,655
And it reminds me of summertime.

851
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,175
I hope it looks good.

852
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,335
She's making a sunset
surprise mousse cake.

853
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,335
Her Swiss roll sun will glow
amidst lemon curd,

854
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,815
and vanilla and strawberry mousses.

855
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:53,215
But this challenge is the first time
Maxy has ever made mousse.

856
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,335
I'm not a big mousse maker,
so I'm a little bit nervous today.

857
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,895
Oh, no, she's nervous.

858
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,335
Yes, I am.

859
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,335
But I'm hoping it works out.

860
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,055
Yes, you'll be all right.

861
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,095
Good luck. Sounds great.
Thank you so much.

862
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,975
It does sound delicious,
I must say. Thank you.

863
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,895
Bakers, you have one hour left.

864
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,815
We'll see if it's set.

865
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,575
OK, I'm just working on
my yuzu curd.

866
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,775
While most of the bakers
are building their final layers...

867
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,055
Quick blue butter cream. Let's see.

868
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,495
Right.

869
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,615
Freezer.

870
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,415
Done.

871
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,455
Syabira's jelly topping is yet to be
added to her cake.

872
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,375
My jelly has a biscuit bee.

873
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,775
Her decorative biscuit bee must be
embedded within the jelly,

874
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,015
but its intricate body
is prone to tear.

875
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,295
Come on.

876
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,695
Oh, no.

877
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,255
It's broken.

878
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,615
It's very scary, actually.

879
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,655
The more time Syabira spends
fixing her bee, the less time

880
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,495
the liquid jelly will have to set
on her cake.

881
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,215
It's a jigsaw.

882
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,935
Kevin, can I borrow your scissor?

883
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,135
Aye, go for it.

884
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,415
I made a lot of mistakes,
but I would expect this happened

885
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,335
because it's very delicate.

886
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,695
Quick.

887
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,695
It's done. Finally, I'm going to put
a jelly on top.

888
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,935
But Syabira's worries
aren't over just yet.

889
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,215
I have to be careful, because when
I pop it in the freezer,

890
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,695
it might break.

891
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,615
It's moved.

892
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,335
Disaster.

893
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,135
Urgh.

894
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,495
While Syabira's facing a bee
in bits,

895
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,015
Kevin's struggling with his
decorative dog.

896
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,255
Ca role!

897
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,135
You're good at fondant.

898
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,815
How do I get these wee eyes to
stick on?

899
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,335
Put the ball in and then flatten
it out. Oh, OK.

900
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,295
That was a warm moment. Yeah.

901
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,935
She's trying to sabotage you.
You know that, don't you?

902
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,815
Come on.

903
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,975
Reconstruction.

904
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,655
Nearly there.

905
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,815
It is very fiddly.

906
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,295
I don't know why I put myself
through this one.

907
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,655
I was worried.

908
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,255
If the jelly doesn't set in time.

909
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,895
Right.

910
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,335
An unset mousse cake is
at the forefront of everyone's mind.

911
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,415
It needs more.
Three minutes and I...

912
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,695
...see if I will take it out.
It's nerve-racking, honestly.

913
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,375
It's like, if you get
it wrong, that's it.

914
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,895
I hope it doesn't collapse.

915
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,695
If it collapses, then I just
basically curl up in a ball

916
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,215
in the corner and give them
a tray of...

917
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,415
...gloop

918
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,015
My tiny baking children,
you have half an hour remaining.

919
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,815
Half an hour!

920
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,535
I'm so nervous now.

921
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,935
OK, done. Enough, enough.
Let's do it.

922
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:58,095
Once the moulds are removed,
any unset mousses will leak...

923
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,375
Oh, boy.

924
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,055
...and ruin the appearance
of the cakes.

925
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,855
So far, so good.

926
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,815
It needs to be so solid.

927
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,775
It is.

928
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,375
Yeah.

929
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,415
But even if they appear to look good
on the outside...

930
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,695
It's held fine.

931
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,375
Very happy. The jelly set.

932
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,695
...the cake still might be a gloopy
mess

933
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,535
when the judges cut a slice.

934
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,455
My mousse is all right.

935
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,735
But I'm just going to check inside.

936
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,375
And Dawn can't resist
having a sneaky peek

937
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,015
at her toadstool mousse surprise.

938
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,935
I really need this to work.

939
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,175
Oh, God.

940
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,175
ToadstooFs vanished.

941
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,655
There is no flower pattern.

942
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,615
It hasn't worked.

943
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,535
Oh, BLEEP.

944
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,575
Excuse my French.

945
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,895
That is absolutely awful.

946
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,535
Bakers, you have 15 minutes
remaining!

947
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,335
Arghg

948
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,295
Right. So I'm making my Earth.

949
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,655
It should be OK.

950
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,255
I just need to decorate it.

951
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,895
Most of the bakers are decorating
with butter cream or icing.

952
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,415
Beautiful.

953
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,295
But some have opted for a shiny
mirror glaze.

954
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,895
Gelatine. Here we go.

955
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,255
Ancl this means working with
gelatine once again.

956
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,615
OK, there's a lot of gelatine
in my mirror glaze.

957
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,935
You don't want to use too
less because then it's going

958
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,895
to just ooze out.

959
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,215
There's a lot that can go wrong now.

960
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,575
I just want more gelatine.

961
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,855
Oh, my God. I've got seepage.

962
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,735
I'm in trouble, aren't I?

963
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,495
Look at that.
All my lumps and my bumps.

964
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,215
It's not perfect.

965
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,055
But don't tell Paul.
No, I won't.

966
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,975
Rushing this.

967
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,055
How long left?
Five minutes remaining.

968
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,415
Quick. OK.

969
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,855
It's a bit of a mess.

970
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,135
It just doesn't look right.

971
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,575
Planets - awesome.

972
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,095
It's going all right!

973
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,495
I am stressed!

974
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,535
Gold. It's getting intense now.

975
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,095
Pretty good.

976
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,375
Ew, that's terrible.

977
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,375
I'm just mortified.

978
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,975
Bakers, your time is up.

979
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,255
It's a mousse world.

980
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,615
That's my own little country.

981
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,335
Sandro, you've outdone yourself.

982
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,975
We'll see.

983
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,655
I don't know if I've done enough
to save myself.

984
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,935
Some elements have been burnt.

985
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,255
Oh, clear.

986
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,255
Mine looks like a car crash.

987
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,655
My bag is there, ready to go.

988
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,655
See ya.

989
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:56,375
It's judgment time for the bakers'
surprise-inside desserts.

990
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,975
Abdul, would you like to bring up
your surprise-inside dessert?

991
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,495
That is one of the best
mirror glazes I've ever seen.

992
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,015
It's just beautiful.

993
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,215
It's like a really expensive piece
of marble.

994
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,375
Oh, look at that planet.

995
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,655
Perfect planet. That's so cool.

996
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,935
Look, the universe.

997
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,895
Uh-oh.

998
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,575
Blackberry mousse - lovely.

999
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,215
Yuzu curd - too much gelatine.

1000
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,375
The marble effect on the top -
like rubber.

1001
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,575
It's a shame, really.

1002
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,055
It is. A bit too firm.

1003
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,295
Thank you, Abdul. No worries.
Thank you. Thank you. Well done.

1004
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,895
That's a work of art on the outside.
Isn't it fantastic?

1005
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,575
That's wicked!

1006
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,815
Too much gelatine.

1007
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,135
I absolutely love the look of it.

1008
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,815
It's so exuberant.

1009
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,135
Thank you.

1010
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,495
Oh, I see the sunset there.
Yeah. Perfect.

1011
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,295
So now it just has to taste good.

1012
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,695
The lemon curd was too gelatinous.

1013
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:30,055
Oh. But the mousses, Maxy,
are absolutely beautiful.

1014
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,615
Yeah, well clone. Thank you.

1015
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,575
I must say, it looks just so funny.

1016
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,855
This is the dog
that digs up the garden.

1017
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,015
A bone!

1018
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,375
A bone.

1019
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,375
The cake is quite tough,
but the chocolate mousse is heaven.

1020
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,735
Yeah. The banana mousse
tastes amazing.

1021
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,295
Really punchy banana.

1022
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,255
It's just got too much gelatine
in there.

1023
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,695
It could have been
a bit more colourful.

1024
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,935
Yeah, I agree.

1025
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,655
Ah! Goodness. Look at that.

1026
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,815
I think that's beautiful.

1027
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,535
You can certainly see
the cupcake in there,

1028
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,015
with the cherry as well on the top.

1029
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,495
Wonderful, strong colours.

1030
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,775
I approve, janusz.

1031
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,295
Chocolate cake is beautiful,

1032
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,695
and the chocolate mousse
is delicious. It's really light.

1033
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,615
The drips, what are they?

1034
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,215
White chocolate and cream.

1035
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,495
Wonderful mixture of flavours.
Lovely. Thank you.

1036
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,495
This sort of lost its way
a little bit on the top, hasn't it?

1037
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,375
The template you've got
on the top? Yeah.

1038
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,455
Nevertheless,
I do think it's very sweet.

1039
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,455
Thank you.

1040
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,015
What's the bee's blood type?

1041
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,695
It's "bee" positive.

1042
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,975
Oh, that's the positive!

1043
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,935
Positive "bee".

1044
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,535
Come on, that's genius.

1045
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,015
I have made melon mousse
and jasmine jelly.

1046
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,055
Textures of the mousses are perfect,

1047
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,215
but overall, the flavours
could be a little stronger.

1048
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,415
The melon, I cannot hunt
any flavour in that mousse.

1049
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,455
Yesterday, you went really
overboard with the watermelon.

1050
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,695
Ancl then today, we're going,
"Where's the flavour?"

1051
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,215
The cake looks amazing.

1052
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,895
Is that Sandro Island down there?

1053
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,455
It is my island, yeah.

1054
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,535
Wow. Look at that.

1055
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,215
You can see the Earth's core.

1056
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,535
Isn't that clever?

1057
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,055
Sandro, it is absolutely
astonishing.

1058
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,655
To be able to put that design

1059
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,815
together with mousse and keep
that shape is impressive.

1060
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,255
There is prosecco jelly with fruits,

1061
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,575
and then it's
the white chocolate mousse.

1062
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,015
The chocolate mousse
is mousse-like, light, perfect.

1063
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,175
Love the core.

1064
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,775
I love the textures.

1065
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,535
I enjoy the flavours as well.

1066
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,255
Well designed, well thought through.

1067
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,815
Thank you, Sandro. Thank you.

1068
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,895
Well done. Thanks.

1069
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,695
It looks very '70s.

1070
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,095
Another Fanny Cradock job.
Yeah, I think it is. Yeah.

1071
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,695
There's nothing wrong with that.
No, there's nothing wrong with that.

1072
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,135
Right.

1073
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,455
Wow. Wow. That IS a strawberry.

1074
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,015
Ancl the strawberry is red velvet?
Yeah.

1075
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,695
Strawberry mousse is fantastic.

1076
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,295
The chocolate one is too gelatinous.

1077
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,895
Ancl also both bits
of the cake are a bit tough.

1078
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,015
Mm.

1079
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,015
You look a bit dejected.

1080
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,975
It doesn't look as sharp
as I wanted it to look.

1081
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,255
So... It's gone a bit wayward.

1082
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,255
Yes.

1083
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,095
Oh. Is that your toadstool?
Is that it there? Yeah.

1084
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,215
The pink bit? It's lost
its shape a little bit.

1085
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,615
That was very ambitious, to try
to do a mousse toadstool shape.

1086
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,335
What does the jelly represent?

1087
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,015
It's supposed to be a flower.

1088
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,535
I wanted to leave it in,
even though it had lost its shape,

1089
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,095
because I liked the sharpness.

1090
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,495
The sharpness of
the jelly is delicious.

1091
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,935
The textures are very good.

1092
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,775
Very creamy mousse.

1093
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,455
The lime one's got
yoghurt in it as well.

1094
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,775
Technically, both the mousses
and the dacquoises

1095
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,135
together are perfect. Oh, good.

1096
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,855
However, you have no real surprise.

1097
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,095
The surprise is there's nothing.
There's nothing. Yeah, well clone.

1098
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,935
No-one saw that coming!

1099
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,215
What was a delicious surprise
was the jelly.

1100
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,935
Thanks. Well done.

1101
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,615
Thank you. Well clone.

1102
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,455
The feedback was
better than I thought.

1103
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,935
I mean, they did like the flavours.

1104
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,935
That was the only positive thing

1105
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,295
that could have come out of that,
really.

1106
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,295
Have I clone enough to stay?

1107
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,815
Hmm. I still give it 50/50.

1108
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,575
If I gotta go, I gotta go.

1109
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,135
I'll go and weed the garden.

1110
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,295
Those were some good-looking
Showstoppers, weren't they?

1111
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,615
They looked good. Yeah.

1112
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,655
Not all of them had
quite the right texture.

1113
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,535
I mean, for instance,
you look at Abdul's cake,

1114
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,895
which looked amazing,
but tasted awful. Beautiful.

1115
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,415
But then you look at Dawn's
that didn't look very good,

1116
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,575
but tasted amazing.

1117
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,055
Did anyone manage to get
their designs inside

1118
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,535
and their textures right?

1119
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,495
Sandro did well.
Sandro did. Sandro.

1120
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,975
Yeah, I think Sandro andjanusz
were in line for Star Baker.

1121
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,615
I think, for me,
in trouble is Carole.

1122
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,855
The chocolate mousse,
it was just too stiff again.

1123
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,775
She has not had a good week.

1124
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,095
I don't know if she's clone enough
to pull herself out of the hole.

1125
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,055
And then you look at Dawn.
Dawn's a good baker,

1126
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,815
I just feel she's messed up
on a little things,

1127
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,535
which has snowballed
into something that's quite big.

1128
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,135
And you think, "Oh, she could go."

1129
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,095
And Syabira...

1130
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,055
For someone who's so potent
with her flavours,

1131
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,695
she's failed us this week on her
signature and on her Showstopper.

1132
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,975
Well, bakers, that was a tough week
and that was an epic Showstopper.

1133
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,015
Now, there can only
be one Star Baker,

1134
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,335
and that Star Baker is...

1135
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,775
...Sandro.

1136
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,375
Well clone!

1137
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,455
Well done, Sandro. Thank you.

1138
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:15,815
That leaves me the horrible task
of announcing

1139
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,495
the person who's leaving us.

1140
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,175
Unfortunately, the person
who's leaving us this week is...

1141
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,815
...Carole.

1142
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,615
Oh, Carole...

1143
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,215
Aw. That's all right.

1144
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,935
My time to go.

1145
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,295
Very proud of myself, cos I come
here to achieve something

1146
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,495
as I get older.

1147
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,935
So sorry, mate.

1148
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,415
That's what I said - it was
between the two of us.

1149
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,735
Even to get through
and walk through that tent,

1150
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,175
that is an achievement in itself.

1151
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,855
And those... those bakers,
what a great bunch of people.

1152
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,615
I'm going to miss you so much.
I know.

1153
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:09,015
Next week, I'm going to focus
more on the flavour and be brave.

1154
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,895
I'm delighted and stunned
I'm not going home.

1155
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:17,295
Well clone. And obviously
chuffed to bits for Sandro.

1156
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,855
He's been craving Star Baker
from the get-go, I think.

1157
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,655
Happy for you.

1158
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,055
I mean, janusz started
so good this week,

1159
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,815
so I really thought
he would have got it.

1160
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,415
Ancl it's been bouncing between
him and Maxy, so I thought

1161
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,655
that was going to continue.

1162
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,375
But I'm going to definitely
push myself every week,

1163
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,895
cos now I've got Star Baker,

1164
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,415
I've got...|'ve felt...

1165
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,095
"I've tasted it, and I love it!

1166
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,055
Next time...

1167
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,655
Whooo!

1168
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,095
...Halloween comes early...

1169
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,455
Did I scare you?
..With a scary signature...

1170
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,055
It's like a cauldron. I just
don't want to ruin my make-up.

1171
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,335
...a terrifying technical...
Too much.

1172
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,695
Is this one on fire?

1173
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,215
...and a spooky Showstopper...

1174
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,615
WOW!

1175
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,975
We're struggling.

1176
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,495
...that will leave one baker...

1177
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,775
It's not going to hang.

1178
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,455
...digging their own grave.

1179
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,095
Oh, please! Oh, my God.

1180
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,855
THUD!
Oh.
