00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,975
Hello, viewer. Welcome to our
first-ever Halloween week.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,015
Ewww!

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,895
Oh, wow. Look at that.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,815
Ew, the witch's hair.
Ooh, that nose.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,095
Oh. Is that prosthetics or CGI?

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,415
I haven't been to make-up yet.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,495
Welcome to The Great British
Bake Off.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,215
Should I go and look for
another job now? Yes.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,535
Last time, the bakers
tackled demanding desserts...

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,575
Oh, my God! You know, desserts
backwards is stressed. And I am.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,415
...and while Sandro was on top
of the world... Wow!

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,815
Look at that. It is astonishing.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,295
...Syabira struggled with flavours.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,775
It tastes a bit fake. But Carole's
puddings collapsed...

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,415
Oh, what a disaster!

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,895
...and her time in the tent
was up. Oh! That's all right.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,575
This time... Woooo!
..It's Halloween week...

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,415
Hold your breath. ..With a
spine-chilling signature...

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,135
This witch has eyeliner problem.
I'm scared.

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,455
...that's all about apples.

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,295
It's like a cauldron. I'll just
don't want to ruin my make-up.

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,895
Goodness! A terrifying technical...

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,535
So sticky. ..That has the bakers
feeling the heat.

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,855
Is this one on fire?!
Ah! Too much!

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,455
No, no! They're all burning.

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,735
WOW!

27
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,415
<i>And a showstopper...</i>

28
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,255
I don't know whether to be shocked
or turned on.

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,655
I don't know what's going on here.

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,095
It's falling apart.

31
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,735
...that's sure to cause nightmares.

32
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,135
It's not going to hang.
Just breathe, breathe.

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,015
HAPPY Halloween!

34
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,535
Yeah, I'm excited about this week.

35
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,575
Gives us a bit more opportunity
to be more creative.

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,015
The more revolting, the better,
you know?

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,455
Do you know what? I think my bakes
are quite cute, so I don't think

38
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,735
they'll frighten them. If I get put
out and I need to do my leaving

39
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,055
speech in this shirt,
I'll be well annoyed.

40
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,175
Bakers, welcome back to the tent
for Halloween week.

41
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,615
Yes! How do you like them apples?

42
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,135
Well, quite a lot, I hope, because
for your Signature Challenge,

43
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,735
the judges would like you each
to bake an exquisitely

44
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,655
decorated apple cake.

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,055
Apples have been intertwined
with Halloween throughout history.

46
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,855
How so, Noel? Well, in the olden
days, peasants were put

47
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,215
in a bucket and a giant apple
would turn up

48
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,655
and try and pull them out
the bucket with its teeth.

49
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,015
Have you been reading books
upside down again?

50
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,415
Possibly. You can use any type of
sponge you like,

51
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,855
but your hero ingredient must be
fresh apple.

52
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,735
You have two spooky hours.
On your marks...

53
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,735
...get set... Boo!

54
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,375
I love Halloween. Love trick or
treating, love dressing up.

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,135
It's an opportunity to be
a big kid again.

56
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,375
This is Halloween week.

57
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,255
Obviously, Halloween we think
of dunking apples, etc,

58
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,135
so we want to celebrate the apple.

59
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,455
We want the apple to be the hero
in this cake.

60
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,775
That is how many apples we've got.

61
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,295
I need to stick some spices in
there, so cinnamon sticks.

62
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,695
Things like cinnamon go
so beautifully with apples,

63
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,655
but I do think the bakers
have to be careful because we want

64
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,975
the dominant flavour to be apple.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,855
Ultimately, we want an apple cake,
not, and I stress not, an apple

66
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,855
pudding, trifle or an apple dessert.

67
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,815
I really want to see at the end
of this challenge an apple cake

68
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,175
that, A, looks amazing and, B,
tastes of apples.

69
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,775
Hi, janusz. Hello. Happy Halloween!
Happy Halloween.

70
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,775
I've decided to dress as Noel,
but I'm going to call

71
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,495
myself Not Fielding.

72
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,135
So I'm baking in heels today.

73
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,655
Look at those!

74
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,255
I like the eye make-up too.
Thank you.

75
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,255
Yeah. Big shout to Syabira.
She's clone it.

76
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,855
Right. Tell us all about your apple
cake. What are you doing?

77
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,535
I've decided to make something my
mum would make when I was a child.

78
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,655
Janusz' mum's apple cake
celebrates two varieties -

79
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,255
sharp Coxes flavour the sponge
and sweet pinks in the butter cream,

80
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,175
both spiced to bring Halloween heat.

81
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,895
I'm putting ginger,
cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg

82
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,215
and allspice.

83
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,015
I want my spices to be
recognisable, but not to kill the apple.

84
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,575
OK, well, good luck.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

85
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,415
This is chilli.
It's Halloween.

86
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,895
You need something spicy.

87
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,575
After failing to impress with
flavour last week,

88
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,815
Syabira plans to wow with a cake
inspired by her favourite

89
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,055
Malaysian dessert.

90
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,095
Asam boi, which is a sour plum,
and also chilli.

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,095
So I'm actually trying to bring
that flavour together.

92
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,015
She'll spread sour plum and chilli
cream cheese icing and Bramley apple

93
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,295
crumble between layers of apple
sponge to create a giant

94
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,695
apple-shaped cake.

95
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,895
It's going to be red

96
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,175
and then it has witch eyes
and a hat.

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,655
A witch's hat.
Wow.

98
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,055
This is a very ambitious thing. Are
you going to finish it in time?

99
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,615
Yes, I will. Good luck.
Bonkers. Sounds like you.

100
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,855
It's going to be great. Good luck.
Witchy apple.

101
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,055
While Syabira's putting on a spooky
spectacle...

102
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,975
Woooo!

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,975
Did I scare you?

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,335
Yes. Oh, good.

105
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,455
...Maxy's apple cake is somewhat
more traditional.

106
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,815
It's apple and walnuts
with cream cheese frosting.

107
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,495
Is that cream cheese frosting
or is it SCREAM cheese frosting?

108
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,295
Her classic cake features layers
of spiced apple and walnut sponge

109
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,975
filled with cream cheese frosting,
apple puree and salted caramel,

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,615
elegantly decorated with fresh
apple and whole walnuts.

111
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,295
I don't love walnuts. Why?

112
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,335
Looks like monkey brain.

113
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,655
Don't think it's a bad thing.

114
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,295
You like eating brains, do you?
No. It's a bit Halloweeny.

115
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,935
SHE LAUGHS

116
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,415
I am using Bramley apples.

117
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,735
I think when it's cooked, I think it
tastes more apple than any other apple.

118
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,095
Whatever variety the bakers
choose...

119
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,455
I have Granny Smith
and pink apple,

120
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,975
so it has a sourness to it
and a sweetness.

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,375
...how it's incorporated is critical

122
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,375
to achieving the perfectly even
distribution the judges expect.

123
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,535
I'm going for chunks and, of course,
if I grate some of them,

124
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,135
they will kind of like melt.

125
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,495
Initially, I wanted to chop my
apples and put them in,

126
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,495
but grating the apples releases
the flavour.

127
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,335
This is the Granny Smith
going all the way through the cake.

128
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,655
It's very light, this cake,

129
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,135
so the apples have a tendency
to end up at the bottom.

130
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,655
Dawn will attempt to suspend
her sliced apple within a fragile,

131
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,615
fat-free sharlotka whisked sponge
and her toffee apple decorations

132
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,055
will be soaked in blood orange juice
for extra creepy colour.

133
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,015
Are you a big Halloween fan?

134
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,175
I do like Halloween, yes. It's good.
What you do for Halloween?

135
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,655
Creepy baking. Yeah.
And what...

136
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,935
Matt, what are you doing?
Whoa!

137
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,135
Oh, he's scary enough anyway.

138
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,455
He doesn't need to creep around.

139
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,775
I'm trying to be speedy as possible
because my sponge is baked for

140
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,615
40 minutes, which is quite a while.

141
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,495
The addition of fresh fruit
to their batter increases

142
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,295
the moisture content,
meaning a longer bake.

143
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,415
The clock's ticking. So the quicker
they can get them in the oven,

144
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,735
the more time their sponges
will have to cool.

145
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,215
Got a broken wing!

146
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,415
I can't use this arm!
Right. Going in now.

147
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,815
Any attempt to assemble
and decorate when warm,

148
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,215
could result in catastrophe.

149
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,295
The cakes are in for about
40 minutes. We're right on time.

150
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,015
But Kevin's cake isn't ready
to bake.

151
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,895
Yeah, I'm making a streusel cake,
so each sponge will have chunks

152
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,215
of apple and streusel on top.

153
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,655
So there's actually quite a lot
to do before I get it in the oven.

154
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,295
Kevin will fill his streusel-topped
sponges with cream cheese frosting

155
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,695
and top his cake with apples poached
in spiced cider and caramel shards.

156
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,055
Do you know, it sounds
so delicious.

157
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,695
The crunchy strudel
and this sponge.

158
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,615
We should start a band called
The Crunchy Streusels.

159
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,575
Ladies and Gentlemen, The Crunchy
Streusels. I want to be in that.

160
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,975
It feels like a jazz trio.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,095
MIMICS A TRUMPET

162
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,895
Bakers, you are halfway through!

163
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,095
Sorry I'm late.

164
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,535
Oh, right, I see what's going on.
Fine.

165
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,535
I-I actually thought this was Noel.

166
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,815
A bit behind.
HUMMING

167
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,895
So that's the sponges finally in.
They'll get 30 minutes.

168
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,215
So I just hope I've got time
to decorate.

169
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,295
While Kevin plays catch up,

170
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,735
the rest of the bakers press
on with fillings and toppings.

171
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,335
Apple spiced butter cream.

172
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,975
It's like a cauldron. I just don't
want to ruin my make-up.

173
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,855
Not only must every element
work in harmony...

174
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,495
I really love caramel
with apple cake.

175
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,775
...it's crucial nothing overpowers
the flavour of their apple.

176
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,615
Sour plum and chilli.

177
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,615
It's a risky business, putting
flavourings. Wicked.

178
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,855
But in his bid for a second
straight Star Baker crown...

179
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,455
I'm using cinnamon whisky.

180
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,535
...it's a risk Sandra's embracing.

181
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,095
These are just going to stick
in the, in the sponge.

182
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,375
He'll cover his cake with

183
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,855
caramel glaze, spiced apple and
walnut crumble.

184
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,615
Ancl in case his whisky transfusion
isn't terrifying enough, a crystal

185
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,975
sugar skull will sit glaring
from the top.

186
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,295
Is this is my death mask?
And then this...

187
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,055
This is your skull right here.

188
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,415
I'm worried about the weight
of that skull.

189
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,015
I think he'll be fine.
I'm not adding any more to it.

190
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,855
Abdul's also going all out with his
decorations. So, I'm making,

191
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,215
basically a bonfire cake.

192
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,935
Logs that are going to be made out
of apple clipped in chocolate

193
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,375
and caramel shards represent fire.

194
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,735
Hoping to set the judges'
hearts alight,

195
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,095
his bonfire cakes contain apple
and almond sponge, cream cheese

196
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,775
frosting and almond streusel,

197
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,695
all wrapped in a delicate
piped chocolate collar.

198
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,095
Abdul, you've come as, what,
scary NASA?

199
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,575
Yes!

200
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,175
I'm a rogue astronaut.

201
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,895
What's your favourite costume?

202
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,695
If I really want to scare people and
make them unnerved, I would dress

203
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,975
as Paul Hollywood.

204
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,215
Well, they look ready.

205
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,215
OK, go.

206
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,455
You can't hear any sound
of it cooking.

207
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,735
It's cooked. The quicker
the cakes are out of the oven...

208
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,255
I will cool it for 15 minutes.
..The longer they'll have to chill

209
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,015
before assembly starts.

210
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,255
I'm literally waiting for the cakes to
cool, so I can start working on them.

211
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,575
But Kevin's are still baking.

212
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,495
The sponges need to be
completely cool,

213
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,135
otherwise the icing will just
melt out the sides.

214
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,295
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

215
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,015
I think you've got a spider in your
hair. Really? Yeah.

216
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,815
I'll just... get it out.

217
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,855
Thanks. There you go.

218
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,575
Righty-ho! Should be ready.

219
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,855
Hold your breath.

220
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,695
It's very light, this cake.

221
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,015
It's a bit broken there.

222
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,375
I am frosting it.

223
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,695
Yep. Cake's out.

224
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,015
Just not sure if they're going
to be cool enough.

225
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,335
Caramel glaze.

226
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,535
This is apple crumble filling
and the sponge.

227
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,175
This is incredibly fragile.

228
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,055
I don't think it's going
to be cold enough.

229
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,575
Are you a big trick of treater?
Of course.

230
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,775
Who do you like to dress up as?
- A pregnant nun.

231
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,175
A pregnant nun?! That is correct.

232
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,575
Do you get a lot of interest
from guys?

233
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,575
Yeah, especially from monks.

234
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,175
The feast of Halloween.
Witch apple.

235
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,655
I can't go back now.

236
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,455
Either they like it or they don't.

237
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,015
How long, really, can I get away
with leaving for icing?

238
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,255
Maybe five minutes.

239
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,255
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

240
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,335
Maybe I can do it in three minutes.

241
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,495
Dipping apples very quickly
in caramel.

242
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,215
Got our caramel, as well, going
on the top. Chocolate trees,

243
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,735
you have to handle it delicately
or it can just break apart.

244
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,815
Oh, man down! I know how to make
it look scarier.

245
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,175
I'm always doing this in the last
few minutes.

246
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,655
Oops! Almost dropping an orange on
top of my cake!

247
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,255
That is my chocolate drip.

248
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,935
This is my skull.
I frickin' like it.

249
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,095
It's just so stressful.
How are we doing for time?

250
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,895
One minute left.

251
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,535
Oh, man alive!

252
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,455
This witch has eyeliner problems.

253
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,975
It's just not even.

254
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,855
Definitely learnt not to rush.

255
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,975
You want it to look nice
and neat. Add the... Yes!

256
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,615
I'm happy!

257
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,095
Bakers, your time is up.

258
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,575
Looking around the room, I can see
really lovely cakes, and it's like,

259
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,295
oh, is mine too simple?

260
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,095
That's so good!
I didn't make enough trees.

261
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,775
Oh, they're lovely, though.

262
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,095
Even that wee heat is enough
to melt your icing.

263
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,855
The bakers' apple cakes now face
the judgment of Paul and Prue.

264
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,695
Hi, Sandro. Hello.

265
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,615
I'm going to take that off a second.

266
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,815
I mean, I know it's Halloween,
but I really think that skull

267
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,655
ruins your cake.
Oh, really? OK.

268
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,335
It's such a beautiful shape and you
plonk a great big skull on top.

269
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,335
What's in this?
It's a cinnamon whisky.

270
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,015
That's really got whisky in it.

271
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,375
Even for me, I don't think
I'd put any more in.

272
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,695
Maybe I will. Why not?

273
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,695
Why change the habit of a lifetime?

274
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,455
I made a spiced apple sponge.

275
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,255
It's a lovely, moist sponge.

276
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,135
It's an amazing spice cake pudding.

277
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,975
It is. But apple?

278
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,295
Not really. No?

279
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,575
For me, it's not appley enough.

280
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,895
OK.

281
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,735
Well, I can see
it's a bonfire.

282
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,135
I like the trees.

283
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,415
It's quite effective. But the
caramel shards are a bit thick.

284
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,975
OK. I put grated apples
in there and almond streusel.

285
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,615
Good streusel.
Good texture.

286
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,655
I think it's a really good cake. You
have the whole apples in there,

287
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,815
which do taste of apple, with,
actually, a beautifully moist sponge.

288
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,375
I think you did really well.

289
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,655
Thank you.

290
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,615
The sponges are made with
Cox apples

291
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,855
and then the butter cream
is pink apples with spices.

292
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,215
I'm not getting any apple flavour.

293
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,455
I am getting the spices.

294
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,255
It's a shame because I think
the sponge is lovely.

295
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,615
And you know what? The texture of
the butter cream is lovely.

296
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,255
I love the idea of the puree, but
again, the spices have killed it.

297
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,735
If this was a spice cake
challenge, you'd win it.

298
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,775
Misses the brief. Yeah.
Well, it misses the apple.

299
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,695
Yeah! Thank you, Noel. Thank you.
Er, janusz.

300
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,855
It's a very light sponge.

301
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,855
I put some toffee apples
and some whipped cream on top

302
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,495
and it sunk a bit, yes.
I'd say quite a bit.

303
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,855
Yes, quite a lot.
How did you put the apple in here?

304
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,295
I put a layer of apple, another
layer of apple to distribute it.

305
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,055
I'm not getting a lot of apple.
OK.

306
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,375
Got it down at the bottom.

307
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,255
I actually really like the apple
on the top!

308
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,975
Toffee apples are so powerful,
they make the rest

309
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,615
of the cake rather dull.
OK.

310
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,255
It does look a bit of a mess.
I promised a lot.

311
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,135
You did it, obviously,
when it was warm.

312
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,255
That's the reaction between
cream cheese and the hot cake,

313
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,015
and it just pours out.
It's like lava. Yeah. Yeah.

314
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,455
So tell us about your apple cake.

315
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,735
Well, it's an apple streusel cake
flavoured with almond.

316
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,055
Apples are beautiful in it with
the almond, especially with cream.

317
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,335
Yeah. It tastes amazing.

318
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,055
It's a bit like a trifle.

319
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,455
Just delicious, isn't it?

320
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,695
But we wanted a cake, not a pudding.

321
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,495
If I'd walked into a room and saw
that, I'd know that was your cake.

322
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,175
It's got Maxy written all over it.

323
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,615
I mean, it is neat as a pin.

324
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,055
I love the decoration on the top,
the little apple strips. Thank you.

325
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,935
So I've made a apple and walnut
cake, and I've topped the top layer

326
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,055
with some caramel.

327
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,935
I think that's a really good cake.

328
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,215
Really good. Thank you. The apple
comes through beautifully.

329
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,095
Walnut is that texture at the end.

330
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,575
I think you've clone the apple
justice, actually.

331
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,495
Well clone. Oh, my God. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

332
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,935
Thank you. Well done, Maxy.

333
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,255
Well done. Thank you.

334
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,855
I'm not sure about the face.

335
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,215
It's sort of gone all over
the place, innit?

336
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,575
I love the face. I mean, for
heaven's sake, it's a witch,

337
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,815
of course she can be crooked.
It has eyeliner problems today.

338
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,175
Yeah! It's a hot clay.

339
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,815
This is my favourite snack of
apples, sour plum and chilli.

340
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,895
I love it.

341
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,735
Really powerful flavours.

342
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,255
Sour plum is perfect.

343
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,095
The cake is beautiful.
And it's so light.

344
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,095
I was going to say I didn't get
the chilli. It's just come in.

345
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,535
I'm not sure about the face,
nevertheless...

346
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,535
Oh, thank you! Oh, I'm glad.

347
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,975
I enjoyed that. I think
you deserve that.

348
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,815
Chilli is the thing that gets me.

349
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,375
It's a real triumph.
The flavour's back!

350
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,535
Well clone. Thank you.

351
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,415
I'm very pleased.
First, the handshake

352
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,655
and they said my flavour is back!

353
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,135
I just feel super, super happy.

354
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,455
I'm over the moon.

355
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,255
Yes, you did, you got one!

356
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,935
I'm pleased for Maxi and Syabira.
Syabira's first handshake.

357
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,015
It's just a shame.

358
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,535
Apart from the obvious
construction issue,

359
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,295
they had a lot of nice things
to say about it,

360
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,855
which was really sweet of them.

361
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,535
I don't think it was a disastrous
judging, but I'm really worried

362
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,135
that at this stage,
you really need to nail it

363
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,415
and I didn't.

364
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,535
Ancl my technicals have been very up
and down, so I've got to throw

365
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,895
everything at this.

366
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,415
While the bakers were able
to practise their signatures,

367
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,215
their next challenge
is a total mystery.

368
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,455
Bakers, it's time for your Halloween
Technical Challenge, which today

369
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,335
has been set by Paul.

370
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,335
Paul, any words of advice?

371
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,095
But please say them
in your scariest voice.

372
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,815
There are two...
Ah! It's too scary!

373
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,655
There are two very distinctive
textures you have to get right

374
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,855
in this recipe and allow
time for setting.

375
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,615
You have to figure that one
out yourself.

376
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,055
As ever, the Technical Challenge
will be judged blind.

377
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,935
So we're going to have to ask
Freddy Prueger and Paultergeist

378
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,295
to leave the tent.

379
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,255
For your Technical Challenge,

380
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,695
Paul would like you each to make
eight s'mores, the kind of sweet

381
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,535
treat you might have round
a campfire

382
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,175
while telling scary stories.

383
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,615
Your s'mores should have
a gooey toasted marshmallow

384
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,615
and a creamy dark chocolate ganache

385
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,735
sandwiched between
two digestive biscuits.

386
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,055
No more instructions, please!
It's too scary!

387
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,295
You OK? Yeah, I'm fine.

388
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,055
I'm gonna tell them
how long they've got.

389
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,415
You gonna be fine with this?
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

390
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,735
You have two hours. On your marks...
Get set...

391
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,775
"bake?

392
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,175
Goodness.

393
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,215
S'mores. Shmores... schmorshs?

394
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,735
All righty. S'mores, they're
a distinctly American confection.

395
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,175
I've never had one, but
I've seen it in the movies.

396
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,695
I've never made marshmallows
or digestives.

397
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,935
I'm completely lost!

398
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,935
So, Paul. S'mores.
It's a great challenge, actually.

399
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,215
Ancl the reason why I said about
the two contrasting textures

400
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,335
is obviously the marshmallow
and then the actual biscuit itself.

401
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,335
The biscuit's
straightforward enough.

402
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,935
It's about rubbing all the dry
ingredients with the butter,

403
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,295
adding the liquid,
bringing it together.

404
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,215
The next thing is obviously
the marshmallow,

405
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,575
which is basically
whipped Italian meringue.

406
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,815
You've got to add gelatine.

407
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,135
The key thing is, once you've added
the gelatine, is leaving it to set.

408
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,535
Now, if they don't,
the whole thing could collapse.

409
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,095
We want it to be
as neat as possible.

410
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,815
We want the chocolate in there
as well.

411
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,655
Not too much, you don't want it
flooding down the side.

412
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,415
But then you want this blowtorch

413
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,735
around the outside of
the marshmallow.

414
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,295
Now, they could go wrong with this,

415
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,975
because if they add too much heat,
it's going to melt.

416
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,335
So very lightly.
Ancl it just looks beautiful.

417
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,255
Ultimately, you're meant
to eat it like this.

418
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,615
I don't know that I can.
You get absolutely covered

419
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,175
in chocolate, marshmallow and
a little bit of crumbs of biscuit.

420
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,175
I think it's lovely. It is.
But hold back.

421
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,455
We've got another seven
to try in there.

422
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,735
First I need to make
the biscuit dough and chill.

423
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,335
I have made digestive biscuits
before, but...

424
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,895
No, you just buy them.

425
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,455
I'm just looking for
a biscuit dough,

426
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,815
something that holds together
and isn't too crumbly,

427
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,535
so that when I roll out,
it will still hold its shape.

428
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,055
Hello. Hello!

429
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,575
Did you get a handshake?

430
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,895
I did.

431
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,455
Right hand, I haven't washed it
since then. Can I touch it?

432
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,735
No! A a a ah!

433
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,215
I need some of that power.

434
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,575
That Paul power?
What did it feel like?

435
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,215
I was surprised. Did you look into
his eyes when he shook your hand?

436
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,055
No, I didn't, I was just like,
"Thank you!"

437
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,495
I'm more happy because they said
my flavours is back, so...

438
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,775
Wow.

439
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,615
I think this is about right.

440
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,975
Dough is done
and I'm going to chill it.

441
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,815
Right. I'm going to crack on
with the marshmallow now.

442
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,615
Marshmallows are really
just an Italian meringue.

443
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,535
I'm guessing it's with gelatine.

444
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,135
I don't really know how to make it.

445
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,455
Whip your egg whites,
add hot sugar,

446
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,855
keep on whipping. Done.

447
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,695
Are you a fan of s'mores?

448
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,175
I've never had a s'more.

449
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,615
Too sweet for me.

450
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,135
I know the sweetest thing
I've ever eaten. Yeah?

451
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,655
When I was a little kid,

452
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,175
my mum had sweeteners
that you put in your coffee,

453
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,455
and I ate a couple of those. Ooh!

454
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,975
All my hair fell out. Are...

455
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,575
Stiff peaks. I think we're there.

456
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,615
I need to bloom the gelatine.

457
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,575
Gelatine is key to
the marshmallow structure.

458
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,215
Let's hope this works.

459
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,455
But adding it at the right time
is crucial.

460
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,095
I'm not going to put the syrup
inside the meringue.

461
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,615
Unless their gelatine is
dissolved completely,

462
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,575
the bakers could end up with
a marshmallow monstrosity.

463
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,855
Oh, shoot!

464
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,135
I forgot my gelatine.

465
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,175
Did I forget something?

466
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,535
I feel like
I've forgotten something.

467
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,255
I forgot to put gelatine in there.
Damn!

468
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,735
I forgot to put the gelatine in!

469
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,135
What happens now?

470
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,775
I was going to put it in the syrup.

471
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,255
I don't know if I've ruined it.

472
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,695
Hello, Dawn of the Dead.

473
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,655
You all right?
Did you get a handshake?

474
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,655
No! Made good toffee apples,
though, apparently.

475
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,615
But the cake was rubbish.
I love toffee apple.

476
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,695
Dentist's nightmare, though, the
toffee apple, innit? Oh, God, yeah.

477
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,255
That's why I've got
so many fillings.

478
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,895
I've got fillings that go
right down my back tooth

479
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,415
and all down one leg.

480
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,735
Really? Yeah. That's impressive.

481
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,975
Into my long toe. That's very good.
That's very impressive, I must say.

482
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,735
Which is my second toe,
because I'm an amphibian.

483
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,255
I think we're just about there.
Righty-ho! That's setting.

484
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,095
Looks nice and bouncy.

485
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,095
I don't know what I'm looking for,
to be honest.

486
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,655
I'm just going to stick with it.

487
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,735
Next, I'm going to roll out
biscuit dough.

488
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,615
I'm quite pleased with my dough.

489
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,095
We're looking for
16 of these bad boys.

490
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,455
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight...

491
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,775
They're all sticking to the paper.
I'll re-roll it.

492
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,055
Oh, what a mess.

493
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,975
Now the stamping will be fun.

494
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,295
It's very delicate.

495
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,575
They're all different shapes.
But, you know, it'll be fine.

496
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,935
That one can be hidden
at the bottom.

497
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,575
Let me bake them. The instructions
doesn't say how long.

498
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,095
Good luck, biscuits. Do me proud.

499
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,135
Noel, are you OK?
Yeah. My gerbil died.

500
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,015
I'm so sorry to hear that. It's not
that, I'm not bothered about that.

501
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,815
It's just, he's haunting me.
Ooh!

502
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,095
Aww... Hello!

503
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,415
Ow! Still bites.

504
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,695
Bakers, you are halfway through.
What?!

505
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,055
Oh, my goodness.

506
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,335
What am I doing? Ganache, ganache.

507
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,255
Classic ganache is half and half.

508
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,975
So it's half double cream
and half chocolate.

509
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,735
The ganache should be set,
not a watery ganache.

510
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,055
So it needs time to be
in the fridge.

511
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,975
Oh, it's so liquidy.

512
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,015
Pop that in the fridge for a minute.

513
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,855
What's going on with these biscuits?

514
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,095
So looking a bit pale and squidgy.

515
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,655
Just a bit more, I think.

516
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,615
Paul's gonna say
it's not golden enough.

517
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,335
I'm trying to get it
more to his tan,

518
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,375
so I'm just going to give it
another two minutes.

519
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,735
Think they're ready.
Yeah.

520
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,095
I feel like they are digestive-y
biscuits.

521
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,415
These are just starting
to go golden around the edges.

522
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,615
I think that's the sweet spot.

523
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,415
They could have been more uniform.
They're looking pretty good.

524
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,135
Have you made digestives before?

525
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,455
No. This is the first time
I'm making them.

526
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,535
I mean, they're so cheap.

527
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,895
You're just like,
"hmm, I'll just go buy it."

528
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,575
There's your passion as a baker
coming out!

529
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,695
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

530
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,135
Oh, my goodness.

531
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,495
Panic, panic.

532
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,055
Turn the marshmallow out.
Cut out eight rounds of marshmallow.

533
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,495
My marshmallow is definitely wrong.

534
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,815
It's not as stable as it should be.

535
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,215
It's set from the outside,
but I think from the inside,

536
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,855
it's still very wet and sticky.

537
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,975
Risky.

538
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,255
I'm going to get it clone in time
if it kills me.

539
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,775
Urn... This isn't easy.

540
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,175
So sticky.
Come on, baby. Get out.

541
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,055
This ain't looking too pretty!

542
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,655
Chocolate...

543
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,375
It's assembly time.

544
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,335
I'm just giving the ganache
a bit of a spread.

545
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,335
I wish I'd set the chocolate first.

546
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,655
They did the right thing by cooling
theirs cos my one's quite... soft.

547
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,335
Hoo...

548
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,895
Oh, no, no!

549
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,255
It's a pain in the ass to assemble.

550
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,655
They don't like mess.

551
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,535
That one's not great.
They're just not looking uniform.

552
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,775
Bakers, you have one minute left.

553
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,775
OK. I have to be careful now.

554
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,335
I'm looking for a golden colour.

555
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,215
Is this one on fire?!

556
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,175
Doing a bit of touch-up.

557
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,415
Ah, too much!

558
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,415
No, no! They're all burning.

559
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,455
This just don't stop dripping.

560
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,175
I wish I'd set my ganache.

561
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,615
No! Why are you
doing this to me, man?

562
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,135
Bakers, your time is up.

563
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,455
Not bad.

564
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,775
A mess is what this is.

565
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,135
Please bring your s'mores
down to the gingham table

566
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,135
and place them
behind your photograph.

567
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,815
Thank God it's over.
I think I've cooked it too much.

568
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,015
Paul and Prue are looking for
eight s'mores

569
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,815
with crisp digestive biscuits,

570
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,735
silky chocolate ganache,

571
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,215
and a beautifully toasted
marshmallow centre.

572
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,775
They have no idea whose are whose.

573
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,175
We'll start with this one.

574
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,695
Straight off,
lost the definition in the biscuit.

575
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,135
Yeah.

576
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,495
I like the biscuit.

577
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,415
But the marshmallow does melt
a little bit too readily.

578
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,935
It's more meringue than marshmallow.

579
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,415
OK. Moving onto this one.

580
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,135
Nice bit of colour on that biscuit.

581
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,295
I think they look nice, too.

582
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,535
I like the way it's torched.

583
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,855
This has got much more definition
on the biscuit.

584
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,295
Ancl it's got a little bit more chew.

585
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,615
A little bit more goo
to the marshmallow as well.

586
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,175
Moving on. Bit all over the place.

587
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,815
Colour looks a bit light as well.

588
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,135
They're not identical, are they?
No, they're not.

589
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,215
It's a bit rubbery, that biscuit.

590
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,855
Marshmallow is too soft, and the
biscuits also are slightly too soft.

591
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,735
It is.
This is definitely chocolate drips,

592
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,015
which we didn't intend.

593
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,335
No, the chocolate
has gone everywhere.

594
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,655
All down the side.

595
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,055
The biscuit's all right.

596
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,615
It's very soft marshmallow.

597
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,375
It disappears almost instantly.
Moving on.

598
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,375
The colour is perfect on the side.

599
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,695
And also,
they all look exactly the same

600
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,535
and the definition is really good.

601
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,175
Just that one's lost a bit. Mm.

602
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,455
The chocolate is
the right consistency.

603
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,495
Texture's perfect, I think. It is.

604
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,855
The chocolate's perfect,
neat as a pin.

605
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,175
This one's a bit messy.
It's a little bit messy.

606
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,575
The colours are right on the side.

607
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,975
The biscuits are really nice,

608
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,855
but they're quite well baked,
aren't they?

609
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,775
Any longer and it would have been
too much.

610
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,375
They're not the best-looking things,
but the textures are nice.

611
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,855
Moving on to the big issue.

612
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,695
The marshmallow is a disaster,

613
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,055
but the biscuits look
really perfect.

614
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,455
Biscuits are good.
The marshmallow is terrible.

615
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,935
That's a shame.

616
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,415
Paul and Prue will rank the s'mores
from last to first place.

617
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,135
OK, in seventh spot,

618
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,455
we have this one.

619
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,455
Abdul. Big problem
with the marshmallow.

620
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,775
Yeah, I decimated them
with the burner.

621
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,135
Really? Yes, they came out like...

622
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,495
You just superheated them
and they melted? Yeah.

623
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,295
Right, in sixth place,
we have this one.

624
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,655
Maxy. The texture was just
a little bit too soft.

625
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,535
In fifth place is Dawn,

626
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,575
Sandro is fourth,

627
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,455
and Kevin third.

628
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,735
In second place, we have this one.

629
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,455
Who's that?

630
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,215
Janusz. This is
a really nice s'mores.

631
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,055
Lovely texture.
Just a little bit of definition,

632
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,335
not looking perfect.

633
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,335
Ancl in first, we have this one.

634
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,055
syabira!

635
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,055
You were 95% there.

636
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,895
Just one never really had
the definition,

637
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,215
but everything else was really nice.
Perfect. Well clone. Thank you.

638
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,655
I am very, very happy
that it worked out well.

639
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,455
Although Pauls aid it's 95%,
it's A-plus, still.

640
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,335
Coming second,
it's a really good result.

641
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,055
Ancl I'm really happy for Syabira,

642
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,415
because she needed
this confidence boost.

643
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,015
Sad life. All I needed to do was
lightly use the burner.

644
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,655
But I was like...

645
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,495
That went so-so.

646
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,855
Not great, not good enough.

647
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,575
Potentially, I'm in trouble.

648
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,655
The competition is just
incredibly fierce.

649
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,695
I don't feel
in a particularly strong position

650
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,415
because the morning was rough, and
even coming third in the technical,

651
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,095
I don't think there was much in it,

652
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,655
so I need to have
a really good Showstopper.

653
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,095
Just one challenge remains
before Paul and Prue

654
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,415
decide who is this week's
Star Baker,

655
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,215
and whose time in the tent is up.

656
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,415
Good morning, bakers.

657
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,415
Hope you're having
a happy Halloween.

658
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,135
I hope you haven't been scared
by any ghosts

659
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,535
or spooked by any spectres.

660
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,415
I hope you haven't been shocked
because you've seen some ghoulies.

661
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,495
Noel, you're looking a bit pale.

662
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,855
Did you see some ghoulies? I did
see some ghoulies, and so did Prue.

663
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,735
Was this in Paul's dressing room?
Yes, it was.

664
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,015
I'm so sorry.

665
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,295
OK, bakers, for your Halloween
Showstopper,

666
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,775
the judges would like you to make
a hanging lantern.

667
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,295
Think trick or treat,
think jack-0'-lantern.

668
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,175
And when smashed open, must reveal
an array of sweet treats inside.

669
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,935
You have four hours.

670
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,215
On your marks... Get set...

671
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,615
...bake!

672
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,295
Feeling good,
feeling excited for today.

673
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,095
Actually, I am quite nervous
because it's a Showstopper.

674
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,455
The last thing you want to do
is be doing it badly.

675
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,535
Didn't have a strong clay yesterday.

676
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,735
Sol can't do anything short of
my best work.

677
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,655
Any less, I'm clone for.

678
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,015
The bakers could really
have fun with this.

679
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,015
We want them to make
a hanging lantern

680
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,775
out of whatever they wish.

681
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,175
Structurally, has to be sound,
but it's got to taste good as well.

682
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,495
It has to be robust enough to hang,

683
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,895
but fragile enough to crack it
with one bang of a rolling pin.

684
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,695
So that sweet treats can tumble out
like a pinata.

685
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,655
We want at least two varieties.

686
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,655
This is Halloween,
so we're expecting maybe eyeballs,

687
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,215
fingernails, witches' hats, noses.

688
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,895
I've got my blood-berry coulis.

689
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,535
As always, timing will be
really crucial

690
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,415
because it will be tricky enough
to make and bake sweet treats

691
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,775
and the lanterns,

692
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,135
but then they've got to
decorate them

693
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,495
and they have to have time
to do it exquisitely.

694
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,215
I want to see Halloween
hanging in a lantern

695
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,735
with maybe a few windows
and a bit of light.

696
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,975
That's not difficult, surely!

697
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,375
Morning. Good morning.
Hello, janusz.

698
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,335
Tell us about your hanging lantern.

699
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,855
I've decided to celebrate
horror movies.

700
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,335
So I'm making a popcorn box
with scary decoration.

701
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,655
And I'm going to hide
two different truffles.

702
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,735
Trick or treat truffles.

703
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,975
Janusz's truffles will be hidden
within a popcorn box lantern

704
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,855
built from almond sable biscuit,

705
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,255
and feature a treat flavoured
with spiced pumpkin

706
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,935
and a trick containing pistachio
and crickets.

707
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,975
Cricket? Cricket? Yes. They're going
to be made with cricket powder.

708
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,455
And then with smoked whole crickets
inside to provide the crunch.

709
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,095
They grind down really nice,
actually.

710
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,775
They're more like peppery,
aren't they?

711
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,535
Yeah, they make quite good flour.

712
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,335
Sorry, what, are we just
talking about insects here?

713
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,255
We are. And you know what,
insects are going to be the future

714
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,295
because they're easy to farm, cheap,
very ecologically sound.

715
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,535
And they're pretty nice as well.
They taste like you're eating bacon.

716
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,815
I think that's very original.

717
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,335
I'm looking forward to that.
Thank you. Thank you.

718
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,655
Poorjiminy Cricket!

719
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,615
Would you like one?
No, I would not!

720
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,655
I love scary movies.

721
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,055
We usually watch scary movies
all the time.

722
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,415
My boyfriend used to do
ghost hunting

723
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,055
and we always watch
paranormal stuff.

724
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,535
We do enjoy our scary pleasure!

725
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,135
And it's scary pleasure
Syabira's planning to serve up.

726
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,455
Her spider made from spiced biscuit

727
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,135
will contain peanut cookie
Frankenstein fingers

728
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,935
and mummy shortbreads featuring
a unique flavour combination.

729
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,015
I'm making an orange shortbread
with white truffle maple syrup

730
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,495
cream cheese filling.

731
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,815
It's a little bit like a gamble,
that one is.

732
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,055
Are you nervous today?

733
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,335
Yeah, because... Hold your hand out.

734
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,255
She's shaking!

735
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,695
It's another handshake
before baking!

736
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,415
You just did it!

737
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,975
You'll be fine. Enjoy it.
You've clone really well so far.

738
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,535
You're having a good week.
Thank you, thank you so much.

739
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,575
But Syabira's spider isn't the only
eight-legged Showstopper

740
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,695
in the tent.

741
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,055
My bake is called Arachno-FOMO,

742
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,695
as in fear of missing out.

743
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,575
Because we were never allowed
to dress up as anything scary

744
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,975
for Halloween like zombies
or vampires.

745
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,735
We're Christian, so we had to
dress up as something benign.

746
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,735
One year I got dressed up as a clock
with a mouse running up it,

747
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,975
as in Hickory Dickory.

748
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,415
We've got a friend that's a
Christian as well, and his mum

749
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,175
sent him out trick or treating
dressed as Toulouse-Lautrec.

750
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,655
Kevin's spider will be made from
orange and five-spice sugar cookie

751
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,975
with choux pastry legs
and marshmallow eyes.

752
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,335
Inside the beastie's belly

753
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,575
will be toffee apple macarons
and hard-boiled peanut sweets.

754
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,935
Do you like spiders in real life?
No.

755
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,495
Everyone thinks I like them because
of the way I dress and because

756
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,975
I look gothic, but I actually
am quite scared of spiders.

757
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,295
They're not my biggest fear?
What's your biggest fear?

758
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,895
Well, the same as any musician.

759
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,575
Child prodigies. Child prodigies?!

760
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,375
Aye.

761
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,055
Good answer!

762
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,535
Put that in Room 101.

763
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,135
This is my gingerbread dough
for the lantern.

764
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,975
Whatever the bakers choose to
build their lanterns from...

765
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,295
I'm making gingerbread.
I'm bringing cinnamon, allspice,

766
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,055
ginger, nutmeg.

767
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,815
...not only must it be delicate
and delicious to eat...

768
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,215
It contains almond flour,

769
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,175
but I've added some almond extract
just for extra kick.

770
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,015
...but when suspended, sturdy enough
to hold their treats too.

771
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,775
A lot of people use gingerbread
because it's nice and strong.

772
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,535
I prefer working with sugar cookie.

773
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,575
It's got high sugar content
so it makes it quite firm.

774
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,895
This is sort of like a gingerbread,

775
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,375
but it's using
carbon black cocoa powder,

776
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,695
which bakes coal-black.

777
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,415
So kind of gives you
a head start, really,

778
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,015
when you're trying to do
a black cat.

779
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,455
Dawn will construct her
ferocious feline

780
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,895
filled with monster macarons
and raspberry jelly eyeballs

781
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,135
by carefully joining

782
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,735
her two baked biscuit domes

783
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,975
to create one seamless sphere.

784
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,895
I need to make it meet.

785
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,415
So it's important to not cut corners

786
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,215
and just take
whatever time you need.

787
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,975
It's not the neatest,
but should be OK.

788
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,335
That's biscuits in.

789
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,255
As the bakers' lanterns start
to hit the heat...

790
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,775
Bake well.

791
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,975
...in a bid to stand out
from the crowd...

792
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,935
I'm just melting some chocolate here
so I can make a chocolate sphere.

793
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,895
...Sandro's chosen to avoid
the oven altogether.

794
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,455
I think I'm the only person
using chocolate.

795
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,495
I'm a rebel by nature.

796
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,815
Sandro will transform his
chocolate sphere

797
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,615
into a skull-encrusted disco ball,

798
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,975
containing no less than
five different treats,

799
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,975
including chocolate orange palmiers,

800
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,375
nutty orange florentines

801
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,415
and chilli chocolate fudge cookies.

802
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,935
You know, you only have to do
two sweets.

803
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,775
I know, but I'm trying
to impress here!

804
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,095
Ancl how many skulls
are you actually making?

805
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,815
About 200 skulls.

806
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,095
What?!

807
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,415
200?

808
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,375
Wow. Good luck, Sandro.
Thank you.

809
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,575
I thought you was going to be
doing it with, like, actual skulls.

810
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,135
I did try to find them, but I got
kicked out of the graveyard.

811
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,775
Next time.

812
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,055
Next time, please.

813
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,135
Such a fan.

814
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,135
I mean, I just loved you
in Jason And The Argonauts.

815
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,935
Bakers, you are halfway through.

816
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,655
Oh, my gosh. Halfway through?

817
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,295
It's a real pleasure
to work with you guys.

818
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,335
The biscuits are done.

819
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,015
I'm taking it out from the oven.

820
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,215
Before the bakers can start
to construct their lanterns,

821
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,735
they must allow their biscuit
to cool and firm up.

822
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,255
It's a bit well clone.

823
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,215
It will be covered in
chocolate ganache

824
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,095
so you won't see
that it's over baked.

825
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,895
I just hope it doesn't taste
over baked as well.

826
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,615
But they can't stop for a second...
Cookie time!

827
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,935
...as they still have
sweet treats to create.

828
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,615
I'm adding some espresso powder.

829
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,055
I'm also going to add
cayenne pepper.

830
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,335
A whole lotta heat. It is Halloween!

831
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,855
It's going to be a cricket truffle.

832
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,295
So the powdered cricket tastes
a bit more savoury,

833
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,055
which is contrasting
to white chocolate and pistachios.

834
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,375
Powdered crickets, the insect.

835
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,695
They rub their legs together,
don't they? They do.

836
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,975
Do you rub your legs together?

837
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,815
I do rub my legs together!

838
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,215
And I used to jump a lot,
but not so much now.

839
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,175
Whilejanusz hopes to hit the mark

840
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,535
with his creepy-crawly
confectionary...

841
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,895
I am making brownie truffles
and pumpkin macarons.

842
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,775
...Maxy's going for cute and cuddly.

843
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,735
Sort of basing it on
my childhood memories of Halloween

844
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,175
so it's not going to be too gory.

845
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,855
As well as monster brownie truffles
and pumpkin spiced macarons,

846
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,855
Maxy will make meringue ghosts
and tuile biscuit bats,

847
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,175
but with so many elements to bake,

848
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,455
her orange and cinnamon shortbread
lantern is yet to hit the oven.

849
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,455
Just rolling out my biscuit dough.

850
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,015
I really need to get
these baked as soon as possible.

851
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,895
Yeah, I've got quite a lot to do.

852
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,255
This is the ultimate juggling act.

853
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,255
I'm just making the florentines

854
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,095
and melting some more chocolate
for the skull.

855
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,695
Not only must the bakers ensure
every texture is spot-on...

856
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,375
These are hazelnuts.

857
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,055
I've done florentines before,

858
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,535
and I just found that
they're not nutty enough.

859
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,135
You've got the chewiness.
You've got the crunch.

860
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,175
Just started on the jelly eyeballs.

861
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,655
The judges will demand perfectly
balanced flavours

862
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,975
across the bakes, too.

863
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,295
This is raspberry flavouring.

864
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,855
Need to go
really carefully with that.

865
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,895
If you put too much in,
it will be hideous.

866
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,575
These are the mummy biscuits.

867
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,855
It's orange shortbread biscuits.

868
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,935
Bit of truffle.

869
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,975
I just like the combination
of white truffle and orange.

870
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,375
It's weird, but this is the time

871
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,855
that you're going to try
all the weird combination flavour

872
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,255
and see what the judges think.

873
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,855
Do you like it? Do you not like it?
Do you like it? Do you not like it?

874
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,495
Syabira is not
the only one taking a risk.

875
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,775
I'm now making my date balls.

876
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,175
It's rose water that's going in

877
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,815
and you can already smell it
so it smells pretty nice.

878
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,175
But not content
with one contentious flavour...

879
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,855
I'm making brandy snaps.

880
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,895
...Abdul's doubling down.

881
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,295
I'm going to clip them
in match a white chocolate,

882
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,175
which is a bit risky because
the judges don't like match a.

883
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,455
Abdul will add almond nails
to his match a-dipped brandy snaps

884
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,895
to create witch's fingers

885
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,455
while his rose water and spice
date balls will become witch's eyes,

886
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,735
both encased in
a gingerbread lantern.

887
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,735
I'm basically trying
to multitask over here.

888
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,095
I'm trying to make
the brandy snaps and my date balls.

889
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,415
I think I'm running a bit
behind schedule, actually,

890
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,575
about ten, ten minutes.

891
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,215
Bakers, you have half an hour left!

892
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,815
Oh, I think your family's here.

893
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,335
Oh, yeah. I invited them down
to meet Paul and Prue.

894
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,295
It's my Auntie jean in the red.

895
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,295
I'm just multitasking and trying
to do so many things at once.

896
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,815
It's going to be quite tight.

897
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,615
This is a Frankenstein finger.

898
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,015
I'm using classic traditional
Malaysian peanut cookies.

899
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,535
Peanut is definitely
a hero flavour for this one.

900
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,055
Erm, what have I got left to do?

901
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,375
Bake the choux pastry spider legs,

902
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,815
glaze the macaron shells, finish
and clean up the boiled sweets.

903
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,335
Ancl you're doing five things?

904
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,135
Three so far have been clone,
and I've got just two to do.

905
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,815
I am on track.
I've got the florentines clone.

906
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,975
They're quite thick,

907
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,815
so I'll call them florentine cups,
because if I don't,

908
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,735
Prue's going to say, "Oh, it's
a bit thick for a florentine."

909
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,055
Are you feeling the stress?

910
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,895
Yeah, I'm definitely
feeling the stress.

911
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,175
What are these going to be?

912
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,375
Little monsters.

913
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,895
Well, they're massive.

914
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,815
You're working fast, aren't you?

915
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,295
Sort of have to!

916
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,295
I've got thousands of things to do.

917
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,735
Really? Yeah.

918
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,655
This is the raspberry jelly worm.

919
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,575
I want that bite, the chew.

920
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,895
Everything that
gummy worms gives you.

921
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,215
So these are the fingers.

922
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,535
That's the final piece
of the puzzle.

923
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,535
OK, assembly.

924
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,335
So now I have to put the lantern
together, put the sweets in,

925
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,775
decorate the popcorn.

926
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,735
If I'm watching a horror movie,
I would definitely go for popcorn,

927
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,055
but I would buy it
in the supermarket!

928
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,375
This is the backs of the eyeballs,

929
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,615
so I'm just putting
a bit of melted chocolate on.

930
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,975
How's it all going?

931
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,495
Tried to do too many things
and I've run out of time.

932
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,375
I've got to join this together

933
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,015
but it's extremely wonky-looking.

934
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,815
I'll just take off the rough edges

935
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,455
and it'll pop together.

936
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,495
I've got to just see
if I can make it meet.

937
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,855
Oh, God.

938
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,495
There's some gaps.
But what can you do?

939
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,895
I'm flattening the top,
just to make sure that it lies flat.

940
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,415
What I don't want is
it's going to be all wonky.

941
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,615
I'm coating this with chocolate,

942
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,015
like a texture of a spider skin.

943
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,295
That looks good, Syabira.

944
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,855
Thank you, Sandro.

945
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,775
That is a perfect ball right there.

946
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,335
I plan to completely cover
the entire ball with skulls.

947
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,215
This just isn't sticking.

948
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:19,495
We're struggling. Just going to make
some butter cream really quickly.

949
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,615
I need options at the moment.
It's very dodgy.

950
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,895
Ah, it cracked!

951
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,375
That's a big old crack right there.

952
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,575
What crack?

953
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,055
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left!

954
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,415
Going to pipe the centre
of these macarons.

955
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,775
This sweet peanuts just need
to come out the mould.

956
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,415
Ancl then I just need to ganache
the spider and put it together.

957
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,455
HE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

958
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,975
It's going to break.

959
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,335
BLEEP

960
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,095
This isn't going to be hanging
on anything.

961
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,895
It'll be hanging by a thread.

962
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,495
Oh, these are so sketchy.

963
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,215
These smell gorgeous!

964
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,895
Flake lamination.

965
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,655
A bit chewy.

966
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,055
It's falling apart.

967
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,055
Oh, man alive!

968
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,535
I'm cutting through
to make the hole.

969
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,295
I'm really trying.
I think I need a drill.

970
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,735
Where are you, switch?

971
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,815
Oh, yeah.

972
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,335
I don't know whether to
be shocked or turned on.

973
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,095
I don't know what's going on here!

974
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,535
If I could just get it
to hold together,

975
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,895
I can get the eyes on at least.

976
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,175
That's not going to hang.

977
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,815
It's not going to hang.

978
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,655
It's OK. Just breathe. Breathe.

979
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,415
This is
popcorn with white chocolate.

980
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,775
Ooh! Look at those.
Are they moustaches?

981
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,055
No, they're supposed
to be spider legs.

982
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,735
Disco ball.

983
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,175
WOW!

984
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,495
Is it spooky now?

985
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,575
Come on, stick.

986
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,255
Bakers, you have one minute left!

987
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,615
Time to hang you, babes.

988
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,895
Get off!

989
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,535
Oh, so sticky.

990
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,415
So I decided to
cut the florentines in half

991
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,375
because they won't go in as a whole.

992
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,775
It won't hang, so... Oh, my God.

993
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,095
Bakers! Your time is up.

994
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:42,455
Please step away from
your Halloween Showstoppers.

995
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,775
That is shocking.

996
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,055
Well done, everyone.
This is wicked.

997
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,535
Syabira, get out.

998
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,855
That looks amazing.

999
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,335
Man alive.

1000
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,855
It's like a horror movie itself.

1001
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,495
I can't look at it.

1002
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,015
That...

1003
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,335
It looks like...

1004
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,775
Oh, you're digging deep here.

1005
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,935
No! No;

1006
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,415
It's judgment time for
the hanging Halloween lanterns.

1007
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,455
Sandro, would you like to
bring up your hanging lantern?

1008
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,215
Do you need a hand?
Should be fine.

1009
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,615
Not with those guns.

1010
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,455
It looks fantastic.

1011
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,935
This is something that
you could buy in a supermarket.

1012
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,615
The skull ball is just amazing,

1013
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,615
but the treats are all a bit big
to go in your lantern.

1014
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,215
They are indeed.
It is florentines but halved.

1015
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,215
OK.

1016
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,775
WOW!

1017
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,015
There you go. They are as well.

1018
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,175
That looks like solid caramel.

1019
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,295
Oh, my God!

1020
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,575
I It's a bit thick.

1021
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,975
The florentines taste amazing.
Just too thick.

1022
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,255
OK. What about
the chocolate fudge cookies?

1023
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,535
There's coffee and chilli.

1024
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,495
Bit of coffee.
A bit of chilli. Yes.

1025
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,615
Yeah.

1026
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,935
Ergh...

1027
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,695
I've just found
the trick in this lot.

1028
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,975
Yes. That's far too potent.

1029
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,495
Wow.

1030
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,935
That is really...
I can't eat anything else

1031
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,255
cos I won't be able
to taste anything else.

1032
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,575
It's clever.

1033
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,335
The box is very neat as well.

1034
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,815
And I love the popcorn. And the eyes
look really well made, too.

1035
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,935
Right...

1036
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,135
Let's try the biscuit first.

1037
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,375
The biscuit has
a lovely almond flavour.

1038
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,295
It's lovely.
It's quite short as well.

1039
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,615
There's thick truffles.

1040
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,215
This is the one with
the cricket flour.

1041
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,895
Ancl a whole cricket inside
as well for a crunch.

1042
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,695
Just casually threw that in there.

1043
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,015
It's a bit too sickly sweet for me.

1044
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,375
I think you should have had
more crickets in there.

1045
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,815
The crickets have got
quite a nice savoury flavour.

1046
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,735
It would have balanced it better.

1047
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,815
Next thing you've got pumpkin spice.

1048
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,655
Mm. Over-spiced. Which is a pity
because I like the textures.

1049
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,415
I'm just concerned about some
of your flavours going wayward.

1050
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,015
Mm. Shame.

1051
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,655
What happened to the lid?

1052
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,015
Unfortunately, a zombie came
into the tent and smashed it.

1053
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,855
We saw them, actually. Yeah.
They are Noel's family, though.

1054
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,375
It's a bit of a mess,
but it is hanging.

1055
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,775
I like the biscuit.

1056
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,335
It's not too sweet,
and it's very orangey.

1057
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,095
The bake's got a nice crunch to it.

1058
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,895
Almost shortbread-like.

1059
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,135
Right. Give it a whack.

1060
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,135
The treat's pumpkin spiced macaron.

1061
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,935
It's delicious macaron. Thank you.

1062
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,415
Soft in the middle,
crunchy on the outside.

1063
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,055
Ancl just the right amount
of pumpkin spice.

1064
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,295
I also made brownie monsters.

1065
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,095
Chocolatey, nutty.

1066
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,495
It's extremely dense.

1067
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,255
You couldn't have too many of them.

1068
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,335
They're very rich. Tasty but
they are massive for what you need.

1069
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,575
If they'd been tiny, the denseness
wouldn't have mattered.

1070
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,615
The lantern looks neat as a pin.

1071
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,455
Well constructed,
seems pretty solid.

1072
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,815
Shall we have a taste?

1073
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,015
Softer than I thought
it would be, actually. OK.

1074
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,375
I think it could have been
baked a little bit longer,

1075
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,695
but the flavour is delicious.

1076
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,695
Are you ready? It mightn't break.

1077
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,855
You're right! Again!

1078
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,695
Dramatic!

1079
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,095
Oh, that's so satisfactory,
I tell you.

1080
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,655
All right,
so we've got witch's fingers.

1081
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,855
Brandy snaps. Brandy snaps.
Covered in match a white chocolate.

1082
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,175
Lovely flavour with the match a.

1083
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,975
I'm not normally a great match a fan,
but I think that is perfect.

1084
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,255
It's nice and thin, and
the almond is delicious.

1085
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,375
Right. This is the dates?
Yes. The date ball inside.

1086
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,695
The texture is good, but
all I'm getting is rose water.

1087
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,015
OK. It's too strong.

1088
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,495
If you'd pulled that back a bit,

1089
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,055
allow all the other flavours,
the pistachio, to come through,

1090
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,935
the dates to come through, I think
you would have been onto something,

1091
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,855
but it's just overwhelming.

1092
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,255
Well, it's quite scary.

1093
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,495
Really scary!

1094
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,815
But it's very messy.

1095
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,615
OK. Do your worst.

1096
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,135
Go on, Prue, give it some.

1097
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,175
Hey!

1098
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,295
Is it gingerbread?

1099
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,255
No. It's sugar cookie
with orange and five-spice.

1100
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,255
Ganache is delicious.

1101
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,895
Biscuit's lovely and crisp.

1102
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,375
Are you eating the macaron? Mm-hm.

1103
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,695
Very sweet, but good flavour.

1104
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,695
It's a bit crispy, though. You want
it to be a little bit chewy inside.

1105
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,095
Yeah. They weren't
my strongest macarons.

1106
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:56,095
What's this made of? It's
butterscotch with salted peanuts.

1107
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,095
It's just sweetness
rather than flavour.

1108
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,775
Ancl it needs to
be finished properly.

1109
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,135
I think somewhere with
the nuts sort of hanging out...

1110
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,695
I think it's...
I think it's all right.

1111
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,495
That's normally Prue's
territory, saying things like that.

1112
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,135
The whole thing just needed
more time, more effort, because each

1113
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,415
individual bit is not perfect.
Mm-hm.

1114
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,455
It may not hang. You can try.

1115
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,735
Oh, please. Yay!

1116
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,015
Erm... It's a bit messy, isn't it?

1117
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,975
Yes, it is. The two halves
aren't perfectly together,

1118
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,015
but the general idea is impressive.

1119
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,735
Well, let's look inside, shall we?

1120
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,615
Well, that worked.

1121
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,295
It's black cocoa powder biscuit.

1122
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,215
It's got a bit of cardamom
in there as well.

1123
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,855
But only a very small amount.

1124
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,975
Very hard.
Can't really taste anything.

1125
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,735
Oh, OK. It's nice and thin,

1126
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,655
which is just as well
because it is rock hard.

1127
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,495
Now, the issue I have
with the macarons,

1128
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,975
they're a little bit too simple.

1129
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,335
I wanted to do a lot more detail on the face.
I thought there'd be a lot more going on.

1130
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,095
That's just chocolate ganache?
Yeah. With a bit of brandy in it.

1131
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,695
Again, that's quite simple. Yes.

1132
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,015
Chewy in the middle.
Shiny on top.

1133
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,095
Good.

1134
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,855
Eyes.

1135
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,415
I must say, the jelly eyes
are really beautiful.

1136
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,415
Because the jelly is unsweetened,
it's just texture.

1137
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,895
But you do get the chocolate.

1138
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,015
I just think it's all
a little bit, dare I say, basic.

1139
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,615
I think it looks amazing.

1140
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,055
I mean, really stunning,

1141
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,855
even down to the green light
coming from the mouth.

1142
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,855
It is astonishing to look at

1143
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,415
and everything is
very neatly and delicately done.

1144
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,295
That's unbelievable.

1145
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,255
The dark chocolate is bitter enough
to work really nicely

1146
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,095
with the ginger biscuit itself,
which is exceptionally crunchy.

1147
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,695
Do you want to smash this one, Prue?

1148
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,375
Whoa! Whoa!

1149
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,055
Ancl it's still holding.

1150
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,215
Sinister finger.

1151
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,255
That peanut biscuit's lovely.

1152
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,295
Crumbly. The peanut kick
is just perfect. Beautiful.

1153
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,735
So this is orange...

1154
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,855
...and white truffle
cream cheese filling.

1155
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,735
Oh, too much truffle.

1156
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,215
Why did you put truffle in there?
Why did you put truffle in there?

1157
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,335
It's not working?

1158
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,895
It did have flavour.
I'll give you that.

1159
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,535
Syabira!
You're off your head, honestly.

1160
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,535
Orange and truffle
does not go in a biscuit.

1161
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,255
I accept that they don't
like the white truffle in an orange,

1162
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,615
but it's fine.

1163
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,255
White truffle!

1164
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,575
It is very good comments, and I'm
very happy with it. I don't want to

1165
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,415
jinx it, but I was hoping
for Star Baker this time.

1166
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,415
That went pretty much as expected.

1167
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,135
I reckon I'm not only
in danger of going home,

1168
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,735
I think it's a pretty
foregone conclusion.

1169
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,255
I'm bracing myself, to be honest.

1170
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,775
I'm kind of trying to get my head

1171
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,495
around the idea that
I might not come back next week.

1172
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,095
Well, we've learned something
from that Showstopper,

1173
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,695
which is that when
Dame Prue has too much sugar,

1174
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,175
we need to keep
that rolling pin away from her

1175
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,535
because she will whack anything
in sight and will eat any creature.

1176
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,855
Loves a cricket.

1177
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,695
But I thought that overall, one
person did better than anybody else.

1178
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,255
Ancl I would say Syabira. Yep.

1179
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,095
Now, when you look at the
circumstance we were coming into today...

1180
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,695
Yeah, because
she'd had a handshake.

1181
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,175
Yeah. And she won the technical.

1182
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,815
She won the technical.
There you go.

1183
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,215
I mean, she's unstoppable.
That's the long and short of it.

1184
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,695
So does she have any competition
for Star Baker?

1185
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,375
For the first time, no.
There's not going to be a shock.

1186
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,735
The ideas of all
of the bakers were very sound.

1187
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,055
I just thought there was
a little bit of a rush job

1188
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,375
on some of these bakes.

1189
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,935
I mean, Kevin's spider
looked such a mess.

1190
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,455
For me it's Kevin and Dawn
who are in a bit of trouble.

1191
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,455
I didn't think Dawn really
did enough. Coming into today

1192
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,255
I would have said, you know,
at the bottom of a very tight group,

1193
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,295
it was Dawn and Kevin
sitting down at the bottom

1194
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,615
and I think we're still
looking at those two now.

1195
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,975
Hello, bakers.

1196
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,375
Luckily, I've got the great job
of announcing Star Baker this week,

1197
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,175
and that person
has had an amazing week.

1198
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,015
Handshake, first, in technical.

1199
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,535
Great showstopper. Syabira.

1200
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:56,335
Now, I have the less fun job
of announcing who is leaving us,

1201
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,735
and we obviously are
growing closer to all of you

1202
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,615
and so this person will
really be missed, actually.

1203
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:08,135
I'm sorry to say that the person
who is leaving us this week is...

1204
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,255
...Dawn.

1205
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,695
It's fine.

1206
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,455
Poor Dawn.

1207
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,295
Well clone, Dawn. You did well.

1208
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,615
Game over.

1209
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,255
I really don't want to
shed tears over it,

1210
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,735
because it's just been
the most amazing experience,

1211
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,575
really one of the absolute
best experiences of my life.

1212
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,055
I can't wish for more than that,
you know.

1213
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,175
There's a tear. Look.
Don't let anyone see that.

1214
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,815
My kids will be like, "Mum doesn't
do emotion. What the hell's going on?"

1215
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,735
I'm really, really proud
of what I've done.

1216
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,455
And I've had fun. Such fun.

1217
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,855
You OK?

1218
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,135
Dawn was a saint.

1219
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,775
In my head, I was already gone.

1220
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:07,175
And, yeah, mmm...
I didn't expect that at all.

1221
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,575
Now I'm in the top half
of the bakers.

1222
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,655
That's another weird feeling.
I wasn't expecting that either.

1223
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,095
And well done, Syabira.
What an amazing week.

1224
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,895
Thank you. Amazing week.

1225
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,935
I feel very happy and grateful
to get the Star Baker.

1226
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,495
It's a great feeling. You deserve
it, girl. You deserve it.

1227
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,295
But that's a scary place
to be, honestly,

1228
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,775
because the only way is going down.

1229
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,015
So I'll try to maintain it.

1230
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,655
Going to miss you.
I'm going to miss you. Brilliant.

1231
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,295
I'm really sad to see Dawn go.
She's funny.

1232
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,815
I love her.

1233
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,935
It's been lovely having you in
the tent. It's been a pleasure.

1234
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,575
I just remembered you're not
a hugger. Oh, you're not a hugger?

1235
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,855
Not really. Remembered that
too late. It's torture!

1236
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,535
Group hug! Let's kill Dawn!

1237
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,655
Come on.

1238
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,335
Next time...

1239
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,855
ls there such a thing
as too much custard? No.

1240
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,015
...the bakers attempt to
conquer custard as it's poured...

1241
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,255
Float, baby, float.

1242
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,855
...layered... Super jiggly.

1243
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,655
...and frozen.
I'm ready for you, ice cream.

1244
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,935
Whose custard is set for success?

1245
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,735
That custard gateau is impressive.

1246
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,535
And who... Oh, no!

1247
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,455
"Will have their final wobble?

1248
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,935
Oh, no.

1249
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,215
My ice cream didn't set.
It's like water.
