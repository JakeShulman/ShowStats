00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,575
Hello, viewer! It's the semifinal
and it's patisserie week.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,415
I cannot believe
I let you style my hair.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,775
There's just so much you can do
with creme pat.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,455
It feels quite solid. Looks great!
Really? What, floret head?

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,255
Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,175
How Long's it gonna stay like this?
Six months? Six months?!

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,775
Come on, Harpo,
let's have a cup of tea.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,135
Last time...
I think it's gone pear-shaped.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,535
...it was pastry week.
Should have paid attention!

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,775
Ancl while most of the bakers fell
short with their Signature Bake...

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,695
They're all over the place,
aren't they? Yeah.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,455
...it was Syabira who rose to the
challenge with her vol-au-vents...

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,335
I think the flavours are beautiful.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,135
...with a Star Baker hat trick.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,455
I don't know if
I want to be happy or cry.

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,295
I don't wanna present raw pastry!

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,015
Ancl with a risky choice of pastry
for her show stopper...

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,175
You're going to make filo pastry?
Yeah. By yourself?

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,015
...it was Maxy who became
the latest baker to leave the tent.

20
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,975
I had a bad, bad week.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,095
Now... Hello, semifinalists!
..It's patisserie week.

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,495
It's about finesse.

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,735
The bakers face a dainty
but daunting signature...

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,335
They're not mini!

25
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,375
...a technical turned on its head...
I don't know how they will eat this.

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,055
You'd need a very wide mouth.

27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,655
...and a towering
biscuit show stopper.

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,015
Stress.
But who will stand tall?

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,535
That's not gonna hold.

30
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,215
Ancl who will collapse
under pressure... Oh, no.

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,295
...and miss out on a place. Bye-bye!

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,935
...in the Bake Off final?

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,815
Oh!

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,495
I nearly had a moment there.

35
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,455
How is it four of us?
Ah, that is crazy.

36
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,775
Semifinal of Bake Off,

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,855
like this is something
I would have never dreamt of.

38
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,615
I feel like this is
the most nervous I've been.

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,055
I need to get to the finals.

40
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,095
I'm, like, one step too close
to, like, leave now.

41
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,415
Good luck, lovely. Good luck, mate.

42
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,975
Today feels different
than every other week,

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,295
because this is the final push,

44
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,135
and it's patisserie,
my biggest weakness.

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,855
Any little mistakes
they're going to tear you apart,

46
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,655
telling you what you've clone wrong.

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,215
But you just have to fake it
until you bake it.

48
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,415
Good morning, bakers,
and welcome to the semifinal!

49
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,775
Now, for your Signature Challenge,

50
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,455
the judges would like you
each to bake

51
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,375
a batch of six identical
mini charlottes.

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,495
Your mini charlottes should have
a beautifully set filling

53
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,815
encased in a sponge of your choice.

54
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,135
I love mini charlottes. Oh, me too.

55
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,655
Do you wanna play a game
of mini charlottes? Yes, please.

56
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,335
Charlotte Church, five foot four.

57
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,655
Charlotte from Sex And The City,
five foot one. Oh!

58
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,975
Princess Charlotte, four foot six.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,375
The spider from Charlotte's Web,
16 millimetres. Oh... Yes! You win.

60
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,135
You have two and a half hours.
On your marks...

61
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,255
Get set...

62
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,855
Bake.

63
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,975
I have to push myself now.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,335
Semifinals, they're going
to expect quite a lot.

65
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,655
The pressure is on for sure,
but pressure works with diamonds.

66
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,575
It just feels crazy at the moment
to be part of these amazing bakers.

67
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,255
It's patisserie week.

68
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,175
For our signature, we want
the bakers to make mini charlottes.

69
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,415
This is quite tricky.

70
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,775
Mini charlottes should have
a beautiful

71
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,495
very light golden brown sponge
on the outside

72
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,135
with gorgeous mousse
or bavarois inside.

73
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,095
The mousse can be
any flavour they wish.

74
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,095
It could be chocolate,
vanilla, orange, lime.

75
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,455
It's very important for me
to finish this.

76
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,255
So I have to make sure that at the
end I have enough time to decorate.

77
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,015
This is a chance to really show off.

78
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,375
We want to see
a real artistic flair.

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,095
It's got to look amazing as if
it should be in a patisserie shop.

80
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,855
We've got four great bakers,

81
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,295
but only three of them
are going through,

82
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,015
and they have to really work
for that place in the final.

83
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,455
Look at you in the semifinal! Whoo!

84
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,775
You made it. Yeah, I wanna...
I wanna go all the way, though.

85
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,695
I know. I can taste the final.
You can taste it. Yeah.

86
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,655
What does it taste like?
It tastes great! Marzipan.

87
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,735
Syabira, good morning.
Good morning, hello.

88
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,175
How does it feel
coming into this semifinal?

89
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,935
You've won Star Baker
three times now. Three times.

90
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,975
Yeah, I did win three times.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,975
It's always a clean slate
in the next week.

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,175
Tell us about your mini charlottes.

93
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,175
I am making cheesecake
mini charlottes today.

94
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,095
It's gonna have peanut butter
and berries.

95
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,735
Cheesecake. Yeah.

96
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,295
Peanut and fruit...
you wouldn't normally put together.

97
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,335
No, it sounds quite strange to me.

98
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,775
For her left-field mini charlottes,

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,415
Syabira will create a ring of
savoiardi sponge fingers,

100
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,335
filled with three layers
of cheesecake -

101
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,895
blackberry, strawberry
and peanut butter.

102
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,855
All along, you've given us
unexpected flavours,

103
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,695
and they have really worked,

104
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,655
so I don't think
you'll fail this time.

105
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,055
So I trust you entirely.

106
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,975
That's the thing, with
three Star Baker in a row,

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,175
it's just like more and more
has been expected so...

108
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,495
Quite right, you're right -
we do expect more and more.

109
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,815
It's so stressful!

110
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,375
The first thing I'm making
is the sponge itself,

111
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,895
because my whole dessert will
be assembled with the sponge.

112
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,935
The bakers' choice of sponge could
make or break their mini charlottes.

113
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,775
So right now I'm making
thejoconde sponge.

114
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,295
It should be a very, very light,
bendable without cracking sponge.

115
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,135
It needs to be robust enough
to contain their fillings...

116
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,455
I'm making Polish type ofjoconde.

117
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,895
So it's going to be
a dry, quite airy sponge.

118
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,055
...while still being light,
delicate and delicious.

119
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,535
A trick for the ladyfinger
is not to flatten the butter.

120
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,055
If you fold too much, too harsh...
goodbye to ladyfinger.

121
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,295
But if making one perfect sponge
wasn't difficult enough...

122
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,775
Do you know what? Today is not
the day to hand-whisk anything.

123
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,735
...Sandro's making two.

124
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,415
At the moment,
I'm making joconde sponge,

125
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,775
and I'm going to also be doing
a banana sponge,

126
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,135
trying to do that
all within the next half an hour.

127
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,455
So my mum makes this banana cake.

128
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,335
It's coated with caramel, and then
it's coated again with peanuts.

129
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,375
Definitely flavours that remind me
of baking with my mum,

130
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,855
so I'm making my version of it.

131
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,215
Sandro's turning
his mum's banana cake

132
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,815
into ambitious mini-charlottes.

133
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,455
As well as his two sponges,

134
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,015
he'll also pack in two mousses,
peanut and caramel,

135
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,615
along with caramel sauce,
praline crumble

136
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,375
and caramel chocolate ganache.

137
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,975
I mean, I worry about this.

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,335
Are you going to
get it finished on time? Yes.

139
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,135
I mean, look at that. That's taking
up half of your bench. Yeah.

140
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,455
How many eggs are you using?
24 of them. 24 eggs?

141
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,855
Cos I'm also making
patisserie cream to go on top.

142
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,455
I think I should stop talking.

143
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,335
I think we should go away.
Unbelievable.

144
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,735
Good luck. Thank you. Prove him
wrong. I definitely need it!

145
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,975
Meanwhile, Abdul's taking
a "less is more" approach.

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,135
I'm going with tiramisu.
It's not too complex.

147
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,495
I kept it simple enough,
it's classic.

148
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,895
I rather like the fact that
you've chosen quite a simple idea.

149
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,255
Yes. This is patisserie week,
so I need to make sure

150
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,695
I have enough time at the end
so I can finish it.

151
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,175
Well, I think you're very sensible
and I hope it works.

152
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,975
Abdul will need to perfectly
execute each element

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,935
of his simple tiramisu-inspired
mini charlottes

154
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,255
featuring sponge ladyfingers

155
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,695
and pistachio and coffee
flavoured creams.

156
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,015
Have you had a little quiet moment

157
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,975
to reflect on the fact
that you're in the semis?

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,815
It's been a roller-coaster, really.

159
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,295
But when you see yourself
having improved so much,

160
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,455
it's kind of awesome to see that.
I know, and that's what it's about.

161
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,095
Ancl if we pushed ourselves all
the time, we could be Prue Leith.

162
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,055
Yes, it would be very difficult
but...

163
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,575
I like to push myself.

164
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,095
I like to push others -
when they're not looking!

165
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,215
All the spongey fingers
will be piped now.

166
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,775
With my shaky hands,
so they won't be neat.

167
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,055
I need six of these ladyfinger.

168
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,255
I'm not doing ladyfingers.

169
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,775
I'm making a joconde that will
just seal all the way round.

170
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,495
180...

171
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,655
So those sponges will bake
for 40 minutes in 170 degree.

172
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,455
So right now I'm moving on
with my... cream-cheese filling.

173
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,135
The bakers' choice of flavours
must not only work in harmony...

174
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,175
Who doesn't like peanut butter?

175
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,175
You're probably missing one of the
most wonderful thing in the world.

176
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,695
...but every element
must be perfectly set too.

177
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,975
This is peanut butter mousse.

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,535
There is gelatine.

179
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,735
I did pull back because in practice
it was a bit too much gelatine.

180
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,295
Get it wrong, and they could be
serving a sloppy trifle instead.

181
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,455
No-one will see.
It's my favourite chocolate mousse.

182
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,135
This mousse doesn't have
any setting agent.

183
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,495
So I'm basing my mini charlottes
on my childhood-favourite candy,

184
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,815
which is a chocolate plum.

185
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,335
Janusz's tribute to
his favourite childhood treat

186
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,255
will contain plum and
dark chocolate mousse

187
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,615
surrounded by chocolate
joconde sponge fingers,

188
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,975
topped with a dome
of hazelnut custard.

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,335
Ancl he's hoping
practice makes perfect.

190
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,095
Have you allowed yourself to think
about getting to the final?

191
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,535
I went farther than I have
expected myself to go. Really?

192
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,375
Oh, you will not believe how much
I've exceeded my expectations.

193
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,255
Really? Yeah, they were really low.
Well, how wrong you are!

194
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,615
Ancl yet we all probably thought
Maxy would still be here.

195
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,095
I've told Maxy, "You will be
the finalist, you know that, girl,"

196
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,855
and she was like, "Don't be silly,"
and I said, "No, you will be."

197
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,415
You jinxed her! Evil!
Syabira, you will be the finalist!

198
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,215
Bakers, you are halfway through

199
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,575
your first semifinal challenge.

200
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,975
I've got time. I've got time.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,975
Hello, semifinalists!

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,855
Busy!

203
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,135
87 things at the same time,
of course, great!

204
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,695
Creating perfect patisserie...
They are done.

205
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,535
"Will test the bakers
to their limit.

206
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,135
So I'm making
the mascarpone filling.

207
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,455
I'm then going to fold it
with my caramel.

208
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,375
With so many elements to juggle...

209
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,335
ls someone browning some butter?
I can smell burning.

210
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,295
...attention to detail is crucial.

211
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,335
Oh, my God I've burned my caramel.
Sad life!

212
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,655
Hello. Hello! Semifinal.

213
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,015
Are you enjoying it still?
I really love baking.

214
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,775
Why don't you enter it again
next year?

215
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,055
In a disguise!

216
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,975
Oh, cool, of you?

217
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,135
Come in with a beard and
really high shoes

218
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,855
and call yourself Olaf.

219
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,415
Right, everything is
practically ready to go.

220
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,975
This is the joconde sponge.

221
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,935
You want the ends to meet perfectly.

222
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,855
Patisserie is all about precision...

223
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,695
I've got a ruler,
and everything needs to be 5.5cm.

224
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,135
...and the judges will demand
consistency across the batch.

225
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,575
Trying to be quick with filling.

226
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,055
I was hoping to set them in
the fridge at least half an hour.

227
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,935
The banana sponge
will be the bottom layer.

228
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,615
It's nice and moist, it tastes nice.

229
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,055
Mini charlottes, Prue.

230
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,415
You have Sandro, who's gone down
150 different layers and flavours.

231
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,095
Well, he says he's reined it back

232
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,135
but Sandro's idea of reining it back
is from, you know, 100 to 95.

233
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,775
This is peanut butter mousse.

234
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,535
You have Abdul, who's gone down
a more direct route - less is more.

235
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,135
Caramel is running behind a bit.

236
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,895
Because there's not a lot
of complexity,

237
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,255
I need to make sure each element
has been executed perfectly well.

238
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,095
Andjanusz, I like the idea
of the plums in there.

239
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,055
It carries such a beautiful flavour.

240
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,375
So it's half plums,
half chocolate.

241
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,135
Hello!

242
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,295
Ah... Is this a little treat for me?

243
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,815
Oi! Don't touch my plums.

244
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,215
But then when you look at Syabira...
Peanuts and fruit cheesecake.

245
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,895
It doesn't sound like
my favourite thing.

246
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,735
Peanut butter, cream-cheese first.

247
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,055
She's given us
a lot of funny flavours,

248
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,455
and they've been wonderful.

249
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,335
Red for strawberry,
looking for the equal layer.

250
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,335
I mean, for patisserie week, a mini
Charlotte is all about delicacy,

251
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,695
that little bit of finesse,

252
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,055
and I want them
to really step up this week.

253
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,415
Clearly, I'm not listening
to the brief anyway.

254
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,735
It said mini charlottes.
They're mot mini.

255
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,935
<i>Mmm!</i>

256
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,855
They taste good!

257
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,055
Let it set for half an hour
in the freezer.

258
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,375
With their mini charlottes
chilling...

259
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,975
My next task is the flower.

260
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,175
...Syabira andjanusz...
I'm going to make my custard.

261
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,095
...turn their attention
to decoration.

262
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,135
This is caramel ganache.

263
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,495
But Sandro's still building
his layers.

264
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,175
The caramel mousse
is going to be done shortly.

265
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,055
Still a lot of elements,
but I can get all of them done.

266
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,135
Ancl Abdul has barely begun.

267
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,455
I'm now going to start assembling
the layers, my mascarpone's ready.

268
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,535
So, yeah, it's going to be... tight.

269
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,735
It's gonna go in
the freezer straight away.

270
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,375
It's about finesse.

271
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,375
You wanna be in the Bake Off
hall of fame, don't you?

272
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,735
We're going to see about that.
You know what happens, don't you?

273
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,055
What happens? I don't know.
Someone pulls the lever,

274
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,295
trap door, you fall down,

275
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,935
and you get initiated into
a weird ceremony.

276
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,895
Have you ever seen when
people go along on mopeds

277
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,855
and they all get on
each other's shoulders? Yes.

278
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,775
Like a human pyramid. Yes.

279
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,295
Yeah, well, Rahul's
at the bottom on a moped,

280
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,695
and you all get into a pyramid!

281
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,855
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left!

282
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,175
Time is, like, very short

283
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,095
so I'm just going to go
as quick as possible.

284
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,055
There's a lot of worries, actually.

285
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,935
Let me bring out my book of worries
at the moment.

286
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,615
I'm gonna just check my mousse,
if it's set.

287
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,735
It's nice and set already. Ooh!

288
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,535
I'm going to put this in the freezer
and then just hope for the best.

289
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,895
With the moulding, the mousse just
is about to set now.

290
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,095
Oh, it's not really that set.

291
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,855
This is just some cream
with a bit of the caramel.

292
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,375
Why are they called charlottes?
Cos Alisha was taken already.

293
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,535
Do you think so? Mm-hm.
Mini alishas. Mini alishas.

294
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,055
There was quite
a few decoration elements.

295
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,455
I'm going to skip the piping.
Just do the chocolate.

296
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,855
Oh, my God. It's just I cannot
tie bows without the finger.

297
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,735
How do you tie a ribbon?

298
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,575
Can I have someone's finger?

299
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,655
I need a longer ribbon.

300
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,415
I'm going to need your finger
in the middle.

301
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,175
Just put your finger here.
Just there? Yes.

302
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,495
I'm going to dust them
with icing sugar.

303
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,055
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

304
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,495
Oh, do you know what?
I don't wanna tidy up right now.

305
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,815
Ugh!

306
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,055
Finishing touch.

307
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,375
It's not as perfect
as I wanted it to be.

308
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,775
The hardest bit is making the bow.

309
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,535
I just want them to look at this and
know straight away I've made this.

310
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,895
I've skipped all the decoration,
but it doesn't matter.

311
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,215
I can't make the bow
to save my life!

312
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,055
Can you hold that one,
please, babes?

313
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,975
Yeah, tighter, tighter.

314
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,575
Ancl this is the last one.

315
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,215
Bakers, your time is up!

316
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,135
Please step away
from your mini charlottes.

317
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,455
Yeah, we've done it.

318
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,775
Let's go and have a coffee.
Do you want this?

319
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,095
Mm! Oh, wow. I like that.

320
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,615
I really hope
they don't... split open.

321
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,895
It's time to judge
the bakers' mini charlottes.

322
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,215
Hello, Sandro. Hello!

323
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,855
Sandro, we were asking for finesse.
Do you think you've pulled it off?

324
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,095
I don't know.

325
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,975
Finesse, I always associate with

326
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,375
something that's slightly smaller,
and it is quite chunky. Yeah.

327
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,895
It is a little clumsy,
but it makes your mouth water.

328
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,295
Wow. Oh, that looks beautiful.

329
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,615
Well, you've got
all of the layers in there.

330
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,775
Let's see about the taste.

331
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,135
It's all absolutely delicious.

332
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,175
It's just so rich and strong.

333
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,015
It's quite overwhelming with the
nuts in there and everything else.

334
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,735
There's a lot going on. Yeah.

335
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,935
All the layers are soft
but not stodgy,

336
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,295
except the peanut one,
it's a little bit gluey.

337
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,935
That's the only one that
had gelatine.

338
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,735
But the sponge on the bottom,
it's really beautiful.

339
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,215
That's some of the best sponge
I've ever eaten.

340
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,775
It's just amazing.

341
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,855
I think I'll take it with me.
Thank you, thank you very much.

342
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,215
It took me all my will power
not to just go...

343
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,495
I know, right?
I really wanna do that.

344
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,975
It looks a bit untidy on the side.

345
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,935
This one, the way it's been tied up.
Yeah. It's broken slightly.

346
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,695
But overall, I think
they're very sweet and pretty.

347
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,335
There's a lot of flowers.

348
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,175
There is a lot of flowers there,
isn't there?

349
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,815
The plum is nicely set,

350
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,695
but the chocolate certainly isn't.

351
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,135
It's too loose.

352
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,335
You should be able to cut
right through it and get a slice.

353
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,655
The flavours are lovely - plum and
chocolate go very well together.

354
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,015
But the joconde is quite tough,
it's much firmer than the middle.

355
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,415
It comes down to the textures.

356
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,895
But I do like it,
the flavour's good.

357
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,375
Thank you. Well done. Thank you.

358
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,655
This is peanut butter, strawberry

359
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,375
and blackberry
cream-cheese mini Charlotte.

360
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,295
They look really pretty.

361
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,975
I do love the outside of this,
quite elegant.

362
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,335
How's this tied up? Double knot.

363
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,575
You were in the Scouts, weren't you?

364
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,615
The strawberry cream
is not quite holding its shape.

365
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,055
The sponge is delicious,
beautiful and light.

366
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,415
Syabira, I think you've got
really excellent flavours.

367
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,775
They're unusual, I would never have
thought of that combination,

368
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,095
and I think it really works.

369
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,575
But the two creams
that you've got your fruit in,

370
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,975
they're not set enough,
that's the biggest issue,

371
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,535
cos your bottom layer
with the peanut butter is.

372
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,055
Thank you.

373
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,775
It's a little bit messy.

374
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,895
But it looks like a tiramisu.

375
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,535
Let's have a look, shall we?

376
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,775
It cuts well.

377
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,455
<i>Mm'!</i>

378
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,375
I think the textures are lovely.

379
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,935
Very, very light.

380
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,255
And I like the fact that
the sponge is light too.

381
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,935
The coffee levels are perfect.

382
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,695
They blend beautifully
with well-set cream.

383
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,055
Inside and flavour, ten out of ten.

384
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,855
The overall look of it...
Not so good.

385
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,495
...not so good. Yeah.

386
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,135
Not quite up to
the patisserie-week standard.

387
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,855
Yes, yes. You'd be like that.
"This is delicious."

388
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,135
Well clone. Thank you. Thank you.

389
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,575
Saved by flavour!

390
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,295
Man, I need to sit with all of you
and get some decoration tips.

391
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,615
Just some flowers on it!

392
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,815
I'm happy -
at least the insides were great.

393
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,375
They say it's slightly unusual
but it does go together.

394
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,255
What does it mean by unusual?

395
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,615
I think this unusual means
a good thing.

396
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,015
Prue said it was one of
her best sponges she's ever had.

397
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,775
That's my recipe too, ho-ho-hee!

398
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,615
They liked the look,
they liked the flavours.

399
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,495
So 50% there, not bad.

400
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,735
Now... it's time for lunch.

401
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,095
The pressure of patisserie week's
about to ramp up,

402
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,855
as the bakers once again
face the unknown.

403
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,775
Well, bakers,
today's Technical Challenge

404
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,935
has been set by
the amazing Pruedini!

405
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,415
Any words of advice?
Yes, precision is all.

406
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,255
If you aren't precise,
this recipe will not work.

407
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,455
OK, as ever, the Technical
Challenge will be judged blind,

408
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,255
so the great Pruedini and
her beautiful assistant Pauline

409
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,695
will now escape the tent.

410
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,495
For your Technical Challenge,

411
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,335
Prue would like you each to make

412
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,655
four identical

413
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,335
chocolate, hazelnut and
raspberry vertical tarts.

414
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,655
Your vertical tarts

415
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,095
should be made up of crisp rings
of sweet shortcrust pastry

416
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,615
and filled with semicircles of
light chocolate and hazelnut mousse

417
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,615
and topped with a raspberry jelly.

418
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,975
They need to be identical,
they need to be elegant,

419
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,375
the sort of thing you'd see through
a patisserie window.

420
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,735
Boulangers, you have two hours.

421
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,335
On your marks... Get set...

422
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,335
Bake!

423
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,055
What the...?

424
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,255
I have no idea what
it's supposed to look like.

425
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,375
What? This is going to be
incredibly challenging,

426
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,655
because this is, like, beyond me.

427
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,055
I hope I could smash it, actually.

428
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,775
Prue, patisserie week,
vertical tarts.

429
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,295
What on earth are you thinking?

430
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,855
It's the semifinal,
we should be pushing them.

431
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,735
So take us through it.
It's really delicate pastry.

432
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,175
It's a shortcrust,

433
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,895
but it has ground almonds in it,
so it's really tender.

434
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,575
The chocolate mousse
actually has

435
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,255
whisked meringue in it
to make it a bit moussey,

436
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,615
and then when it's set,

437
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,975
decorate it with jelly,
with whipped cream,

438
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,375
raspberries and little
tempered chocolate discs.

439
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,655
And gold leaf. Ah...

440
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,575
I thought it was difficult!

441
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,615
So it's not exactly easy.

442
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,975
OK, shall we try?

443
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,335
The pastry's got such a nutty
flavour to it, it's delicious.

444
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,015
That's a really rich mousse,
isn't it?

445
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,735
Mm, and the raspberry's quite sharp
as well.

446
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,495
The trick is the assembly.

447
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,255
If they don't do that carefully
and with precision,

448
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,975
that's where they'll fall down.
Yeah.

449
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,535
I can see trouble.

450
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,895
I can see trouble in the tent.

451
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,175
First instruction -
make pastry and chill.

452
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,575
So I'm currently weighing
all the ingredients.

453
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,455
Mix the butter and the flour
to get them into crumbly texture.

454
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,055
There's ground almonds.

455
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,575
So this is very similar
to the French pate sablee,

456
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,815
it's like shortcrust
but with tiny bit of almond in it.

457
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,215
I'm just adding in the beaten egg.
It says one to two tablespoon.

458
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,175
Just going to mix it
until it's combined.

459
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,695
Oh! This tent gets a bit windy.
Perfect!

460
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,015
Yeah!

461
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,375
What on earth is a vertical tart?
I don't know.

462
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,375
We're going to have to wait
until this is done...

463
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,975
To know what it is. ..To know
what it's supposed to look like.

464
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,215
Have you got an image in your mind?
Nope, nada. Blind baking. Yeah.

465
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,575
I've been first
for two technicals in a row,

466
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,935
and I would really like
to get the third.

467
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,455
That would be good, wouldn't it?
Yeah.

468
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,415
I haven't got a handshake yet...
Have you never had a handshake? No.

469
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,855
Would you like one from me?
Meaningless. Thank you. Meaningless.

470
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,455
No, it means a lot to me, man.
I kind of need this hand, though.

471
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,295
Oh, yeah, sorry. Thanks!

472
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,455
The dough now is ready.

473
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,655
Happy with that.

474
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,975
So this one needs to be
in the fridge

475
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,695
so it's easy to handle.

476
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,495
Next, wash your hands.

477
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,775
Done, and make the chocolate mousse.

478
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,055
So this is the meringue type mousse.

479
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,975
I think I remember how to make it.

480
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,695
The key to an airy mousse

481
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,935
is gently mixing
the rich chocolate and hazelnut...

482
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,215
That's the praline paste.

483
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,735
That's 50g.

484
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,015
...together with the meringue.

485
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,695
But care must be taken.

486
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,495
Fold this bad boy in.

487
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,055
Under mix, and it'll be splotched
with egg white.

488
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,255
Hmm!

489
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,895
But over mix,
they'll knock the air out,

490
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,775
and instead of a light fluffy
mousse,

491
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,015
they'll be left with
a heavy, dense ganache.

492
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,335
Anything I can do?

493
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,975
Yeah, stay away!

494
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,135
Stay away!

495
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,175
No, it's fine. Bye-bye.

496
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,455
Bye, Syabira!

497
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,255
Bye-bye!

498
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,495
Next, line the two 8cm tart rings
with acetate.

499
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,735
Have we got acetate?

500
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,055
Oh, God.

501
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,335
I don't know if this is
the right technique,

502
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,695
but I'm going to put the acetate
and just cut around it.

503
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,295
Divide the mixture
between the two tart rings.

504
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,135
Chill until set.

505
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,495
The mousse is clone.
I'm just going to chill it.

506
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,095
Now I am going to move on
to my raspberry jelly.

507
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,375
I'm going to cook them with sugar
and then add gelatine to them.

508
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,295
I have never made jellies before.
I have made jams.

509
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,295
No water in the recipe,
but that could be a trick.

510
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,175
I think that's not enough liquid.

511
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,575
That's it. No more than that.

512
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,215
Ancl it says smooth -
that means I need to sieve them

513
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,455
before I mix them with the gelatine.

514
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,375
That's not a lot of jelly there.
I think I done it right.

515
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,375
Oh, how I enjoy these technicals!

516
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,455
Bakers, you have one hour left!

517
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,535
Roll out the pastry
and cut four equal strips.

518
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,255
The butter is melting,

519
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,575
because it's really warm
and I'm really warm.

520
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,095
So there we are.

521
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,215
It has to be thin but not too thin.

522
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,615
I wanted to make sure they're
at least half a centimetre thick,

523
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,935
which is like a pound coin?

524
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,495
I rolled the pastries,
and I think I rolled it too thin.

525
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,175
Because there's quite a few
left over.

526
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,655
But it's been clone, so.

527
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,935
Why do I have rice?

528
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,415
When you bake the tart,

529
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,055
it has to have something
to hold the crust on the side.

530
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,535
It is important to have that.

531
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,895
I'm going to bake mine.

532
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,615
Oh, 40 minutes, no,
I don't want 40 minutes.

533
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,455
So I'm going to let it bake
for about 20 minutes,

534
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,215
then I'm going to check it out,
it should be crispy and golden.

535
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,575
That's what
they're gonna wanna look.

536
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,335
These are so tiny I have no idea
how long to cook them for.

537
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,895
They will not bake for long at all.
Eight, maximum ten.

538
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,415
Are you a fan of vertical food?

539
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,215
Not really, this is the first time
I've seen vertical food.

540
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,215
It might look super cool. I don't
know how they will eat this, though.

541
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,215
You'd need a very wide mouth. Yes.

542
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,495
Bakers, you have...
30...minutes remaining.

543
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,575
They are falling apart.

544
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,455
Yeah, that's what happened.

545
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,575
Two of them needs to be rerolled,
end of story.

546
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,895
My plan is to put these back in

547
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,535
and see what happens to these ones
and then take it from there.

548
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,255
I should have clicked
that there's rice in the drawer,

549
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,535
but I didn't realise,
so there you go!

550
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,535
Yeah, they're looking really good,
actually.

551
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,455
I'm just filling my tarts with rice
so they don't flop on sides.

552
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,015
I like what it looks like.
It looks really clean.

553
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,055
Yeah, they're definitely
gonna break.

554
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,975
Actually, they look fully baked.

555
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,095
Yeah, it's cooked.

556
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,455
I need to be careful
not to break them.

557
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,735
Oh, I've got rice stuck to them,
great.

558
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,215
These are done.

559
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,535
"To assemble,
cut each mousse in half

560
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,135
"so that you have four semicircles."

561
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,135
I think I was supposed to line
my shell, like the acetate around,

562
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,815
because that would've made it easier
to get it out.

563
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,535
I'm just going to cut my mousse
in half.

564
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,775
I hope they fit.

565
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,615
It looks good, it looks good.

566
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,455
That is definitely not half.

567
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,935
"Place one semicircle inside
the pastry ring."

568
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,935
What happened?

569
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,015
It's just a bit on
the thick side of things.

570
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,375
So I'm going to just
make it slightly smaller,

571
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,775
so it can fit in perfectly in there

572
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,255
with one of these.

573
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,135
That one. That one.

574
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,815
If it's a bit wonky,
it's gonna go that way.

575
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,575
If it's not straight,
it's gonna go back.

576
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,855
At least it stands.

577
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,295
That doesn't look nice at all.

578
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,055
"12, place a strip of jelly along
each cut side of the mousses."

579
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,615
But it is so sticky, so I don't know
what's the best way of doing this.

580
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,055
The jelly didn't set all the way.

581
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,415
Possibly be due to
the amount of water that I added.

582
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,295
How the hell am I going to
put this one on top?

583
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,375
It can't be that. It cannot be that!

584
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,815
"Place a strip of jelly along..."

585
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,535
I don't know
what that fricking means!

586
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,895
"Along each cut side of the mousse."

587
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,135
"Each cut side",
which will be this side.

588
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,135
But then that's not gonna fit,
and it says a strip.

589
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,615
What does "along" mean?

590
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,015
That is actually
the trickiest part of this.

591
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,415
"To assemble,
cut each mousse in half."

592
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,935
That way,
so you have... semicircles.

593
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,615
And then it's the cut side.

594
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,415
It goes that way.

595
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,735
Can you just tell me
how long we've got, please?

596
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,695
Bakers, you have ten minutes left!

597
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,295
Honestly, I'm really trying
to hold back my tears right now.

598
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,375
It looks good.
I mean they're standing at least.

599
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,655
Please stay!
Can I have my serving plate, please?

600
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,695
To decorate, I need double cream.
Doesn't matter how much cream it is.

601
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,455
Shaking!

602
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,015
OK, that's whipped.

603
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,575
This is so difficult.

604
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,415
This is like really complicated
patisserie.

605
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,095
Wow.

606
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,335
Uh!

607
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,735
Oh, no! One of my rings just broke.

608
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,815
If I use the mousse as a glue,
we can be fine.

609
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,855
How are you supposed
to take these in front?

610
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,095
Right, that's much better.

611
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:31,255
I didn't get away with it fully,
but at least it stands, you know?

612
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,255
How many minutes left?
Bakers, you have one minute left.

613
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,695
Half raspberry on top.

614
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,295
It's not as shiny
as I wanted it to be.

615
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,015
I have never used gold leaf before.
How do you apply it?

616
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,615
Oh, don't touch it!

617
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,015
Bakers, your time is up.

618
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,935
Bring your bakes down to the table

619
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,295
and place them behind
your photographs.

620
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,575
Oh! Why would you do this to us?

621
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,695
Prue and Paul are expecting
four exquisite vertical tarts

622
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,335
with crisp pastry,
luscious light chocolate mousse,

623
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,655
and decoration worthy
of a Parisian patisserie.

624
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,175
Right, bakers!
It's quite impressive.

625
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,055
Yeah, some of them are all right.

626
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,895
OK, start with this one.
Well, one's fallen down already.

627
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,215
They do look pretty neat.

628
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,535
They're a bit dark, I think,
in places, over baked.

629
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,135
That's a ganache.
It's no longer a mousse.

630
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,735
Hmm!

631
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,775
Tastes lovely, really hazelnutty.

632
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,055
The flavour's good.

633
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,375
But the big problem for me
is too stiff.

634
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,655
OK. This looks very neat.

635
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,335
Good colour, uniform.

636
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,895
The chocolate's like a ganache.

637
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,295
It's quite delicious, though.

638
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,855
If we'd said, "Can you put
ganache inside a pastry?"

639
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,175
It's spot-on. Yes!

640
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,815
These ones are a bit messier.
Dear me, yeah.

641
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,215
The actual pastry itself
is very thick.

642
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,975
The jelly's not set.

643
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,655
<i>Mmm!</i>

644
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,015
The pastry's good,
but it doesn't look good.

645
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,335
No, it doesn't look good.

646
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,655
Now these are slightly under baked.

647
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,575
I mean, this is not quite
the precision we're asking for.

648
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,535
But this mousse looks better.

649
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,895
That's more mousse-like. Mm.

650
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,695
It's under baked, you see
how soft that is. Oh, yeah.

651
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,575
That's a shame cos the chocolate's
all right.

652
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,775
Wow.

653
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,655
Prue and Paul will now rank
the vertical tarts

654
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,375
from worst to best.

655
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,015
In fourth spot, we have... this one.

656
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,055
Sandro, pastry far too thick,
and it was a mess. Yeah.

657
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,535
In third spot, we have this one.

658
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,055
Janusz, the mousse was the best,

659
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,095
but the pastry was really under baked
and soft.

660
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,295
In second place, we have this one.
Whose is this?

661
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,935
Abdul, slightly over baked.

662
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,455
The chocolate was
a little bit tough.

663
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,975
Which means, Syabira,
the pastry was beautifully neat.

664
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,895
It had the
precision we were asking for.

665
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,135
Well done.

666
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,655
So technical,
either I'm first or last.

667
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,775
I mean, given my pastries
were falling apart,

668
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,015
second is pretty awesome.

669
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,695
That was confusing.
That was really confusing.

670
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,135
My comprehension,
I could work on that a little bit.

671
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,095
You know it's four of us,
I was third.

672
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,015
Still sort of middle!

673
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,375
But tomorrow will show,
one crack and you're out.

674
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,615
Just one challenge remains

675
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,375
before Prue and Paul decide
who will fail to make the final.

676
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,935
We've got a situation
where one of the people

677
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,535
who have been pretty consistent
throughout

678
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,295
is in a little bit of trouble -
janusz.

679
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,655
I expect him to bounce back
in the show stopper.

680
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,135
But at the moment I'd say he was in
the worst position out of the four.

681
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,895
But I think he's not
the only one in trouble.

682
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,695
I think Sandro,
his flavours are great,

683
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,775
but he never finishes,
and it never looks perfect.

684
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,135
He did a lot of work
in his signature, didn't he?

685
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,495
Yeah, and that sometimes
has been his downfall.

686
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,455
One I'd really root for is Abdul.
I mean, he hasn't had Star Baker.

687
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,455
He's gone under the radar a bit,
hasn't he?

688
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,935
Yeah, but he's consistently good.

689
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,255
You'd have to say it's Abdul
and Syabira in line for Star Baker,

690
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,375
and it'sjanusz and Sandro in line
for going home at the moment.

691
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,215
Which is an extraordinary thing.
Yeah.

692
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,095
I hate to say this but it's all...

693
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,375
Down to the show stopper?

694
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,535
It's all down to the show stopper!

695
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,575
Bakers, it's time for your
semifinal show stopper challenge.

696
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,255
Now, today the judges
would like you to create

697
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,655
your own visually spectacular take
on the traditional Nordic krokan.

698
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,655
An elaborate multi-tiered
Swedish patisserie

699
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,175
using almond biscuit dough,
marzipan,

700
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,175
and featuring icing
and sugar-work decorations.

701
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,575
Now remember, this is your last
chance to impress the judges

702
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,855
and secure a place in the final,
so don't hold back.

703
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,455
You could just bribe them.

704
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,855
Yeah, Paul's price is 30p
and a small slab of toffee.

705
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,695
Whereas Prue, a little more classy.
Wine gums.

706
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,695
You have four hours.
On your marks...

707
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,095
Get set! Bake!

708
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,895
A bit nervous but push myself,
push myself.

709
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,655
There's no space to be worried.
I'm just going to do my best.

710
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,015
Everyone is just so close.

711
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,255
It is very, very skilful person
around me here.

712
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,175
Ancl all lads - it has to be clone
for the girls, isn't it, Sandro?

713
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,455
Girl power, yeah, yeah, yeah,
all about the girl power.

714
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,655
It's the semifinal,
our show stopper is a krokan.

715
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,495
It's a celebratory
Swedish wedding bake.

716
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,135
It's like a wedding cake,

717
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,535
but it's made with very intricate
almond biscuit dough.

718
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,535
Crisp on the outside
and a bit chewy in the middle.

719
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,095
And it is absolutely delicious.

720
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,215
It's almond flavour, of course,
because it's made of almond flour,

721
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,855
but I'm also adding lemon zest
and a bit of lemon extract

722
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,615
to get that flavour up and running.

723
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,615
Of course,
they can do any flavour they like,

724
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,775
but we want it to be tall,
celebratory, elaborate -

725
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,775
a real show stopper.

726
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,375
I'm using at least 6kg
of ground almonds

727
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,375
and 6kg of icing sugar,
but that's a lot.

728
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,895
The krokan has to be
a minimum height of 60cm,

729
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,175
so structurally, it has to be sound.

730
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,735
They've got to get their bake right.

731
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,135
Overbake it, and you're going
to lose that chewiness.

732
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,335
If they underbake it,
it'll be too soft on the outside

733
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,815
and the whole structure will
come tumbling down.

734
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,135
I'm in a bit of panic mode

735
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,495
to make sure that
all the dough goes well.

736
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,815
This is the last challenge
before the final.

737
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,735
Get this wrong...

738
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,735
...they're going home.

739
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,255
Hi, Sandro. Good morning.
Hello, Sandro. Good morning.

740
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,055
Sandro, we need to know about
your krokan.

741
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,695
My super ambitious krokan.

742
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,855
PAUL SIGHS
Is it? Is it super ambitious?

743
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,615
So, this is an ode to Africa
and to the UK -

744
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,975
where I was born
and where I was raised.

745
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,815
It's almost like a thank you

746
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,215
for accepting my mum all those years
back, with two kids,

747
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,855
single mum. If it wasn't for that,
I wouldn't be here right now.

748
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,815
Fantastic. That's lovely.

749
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,175
Sandro will use two
flavoured doughs -

750
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,535
raspberry and pistachio,
and rhubarb and custard -

751
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,855
to construct his ambitious krokan,
featuring Big Ben's clock face,

752
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,935
a map of Africa and the London Eye.

753
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,295
He'll bring his highly detailed
design to life

754
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,255
with intricate piping,
marzipan and sugar decorations.

755
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,935
The last couple of weeks, you've
been pushing yourself,

756
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,295
which is good. But you've fallen
a little bit flat. Yeah.

757
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,295
Now today, you've gone down
a very intricate route again.

758
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,655
We want to see absolute
perfection today.

759
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,015
I'm aiming for it, aiming for it.
Absolute perfection.

760
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,855
You are one bake away from
the final!

761
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,535
Good luck. Good luck, Sandro.
Thank you. Thank you.

762
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,855
Use the force. Yes.

763
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,575
While Sandra's structure
celebrates his life...

764
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,895
Today I am making
double-helix krokan.

765
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,295
...Syabira's is dedicated
to life itself.

766
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,575
My specialise is
computational biology.

767
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,975
I would analyse data
to understand the human genome,

768
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,495
so my krokan, it is celebrating DNA.

769
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,415
She'll create chromosomes
from classic almond dough

770
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,975
and flavour each of
the 50 biscuits that form

771
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,495
her DNA helix with rose
and pistachio.

772
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,255
Decorated with colourful icing
and marzipan, her towering design

773
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,735
will be supported by nothing
more than thin biscuit rods.

774
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,015
It is a quite risky structure.

775
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,975
It has to be perfectly straight

776
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,775
and it has to be precisely arranged
up to the top.

777
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,455
To keep the balance between
the two? Keep the balance.

778
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,335
Honestly, it failed for
the first three times that I tried.

779
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,655
Oh, my goodness. Wow. OK.

780
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,135
But the fourth one stayed standing
for three clays. So, hopefully.

781
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,135
Well, good luck. Wow.

782
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,095
Any hope of assembling
a solid structure rests on

783
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,655
the bakers' ability to roll

784
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,615
and shape every one
of their biscuit building blocks...

785
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,975
This is gonna be helix.

786
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,735
...with pinpoint accuracy.

787
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,135
So, it all has to be 14cm long.

788
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,775
This is the raspberry
and pistachio dough.

789
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,055
So, I'm just making squared bases.

790
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,455
I want to make sure it's precise,

791
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,455
they're all the same thickness.

792
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,615
So, I'm putting the exact same
amount of dough with each one.

793
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,655
But not all of the bakers are
rocking the rolling pin.

794
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,295
I'm going to pipe
my individual pieces.

795
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,895
That's why I printed these
templates,

796
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,215
so I can easily follow them.

797
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,535
My plan is to make, like,
a rocket shape.

798
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,495
I'm basically celebrating my passion

799
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,535
and humanity's achievement
of getting to space.

800
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,935
Full of fresh flavours,

801
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,735
Abdul's ornate rocket will be made

802
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,495
from lemon dough,

803
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,815
with orange-zest space-themed
marzipan decorations,

804
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,255
and he'll add a splash of colour

805
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,975
with sugar stained-glass windows.

806
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,895
Wow, look at the ambition of this!

807
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,175
Hello, Matt. Fantastic shapes.

808
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,415
This requires so much energy.

809
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,375
But then this is your last chance
to impress the judges, isn't it?

810
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,175
It is. You've been the dark horse
here because I don't think

811
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,855
you've had a handshake
or a Star Baker, have you?

812
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,495
No, no, I haven't. This is why I'm
like, "How did I make it this far?"

813
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,575
It just feels... Well, you only have
to look at what you're doing

814
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,935
to see how you've made it this far.
Look at it.

815
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,535
This is one of
the most ambitious things

816
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,455
I've seen attempted since I've come
into the tent. No way! Really?!

817
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,895
Yeah. In that, I would include
Paul Hollywood trying to smile.

818
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,055
This is the most demanding bake...
OK.

819
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,455
...the semifinalists
have faced so far.

820
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,855
That's gonna go in
for about 12 minutes, but I think

821
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,735
I'll bake these ones for a bit
longer cos they are the base,

822
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,455
so I do want it to be
a bit more strong.

823
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,815
The key here is making
the biscuits strong,

824
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,775
but actually, it has to be soft
and gooey still in the middle.

825
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,935
But if they're to achieve
the krokan's trademark texture...

826
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,975
The key to the texture is
the right time in the oven.

827
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,055
...they must walk a time
and temperature tightrope.

828
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,935
Gonna switch them around,
so they get even colour.

829
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,855
My timer's ending,
but they're still very light.

830
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,215
I might bump up
the temperature, maybe.

831
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,335
Dude, may I ask what temperature
are you baking at?

832
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,015
I put mine up to 180.

833
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,175
But that's not all...

834
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,055
One out, one in, all the time.

835
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,735
...consistency will be crucial...

836
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,255
This is the hardest part,
batch baking.

837
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,975
It's gonna be nonstop today.

838
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,415
...with every biscuit baked
to perfection.

839
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,975
I'm making 19 different pieces.
It is a lot.

840
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,295
This is just isomalt.

841
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,095
I've decided to make
something colourful.

842
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,935
First tier will be
a celebration of the gay flag.

843
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,535
My design is Brighton Pride.

844
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,855
Janusz's three-tiered krokan is
an explosion of colour.

845
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,895
Sitting atop his Pride flag-inspired
base will be pink

846
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,695
and blue hearts, as well as black
and brown musical notes

847
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,135
to celebrate both the transgender

848
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,655
and black, Asian and minority
ethnic communities.

849
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,095
These look great.

850
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,535
Not really patisserie, is it
those colours?

851
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,255
But you're in the semis, so you can
do what the hell you like.

852
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,015
You wanna be in the final, don't
you? Well, of course I want to be

853
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,895
in the final. But I see
the people around me.

854
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,935
It's anyone's game.
Just depends on who has a good day.

855
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,055
This looks amazing.

856
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,455
Ancl it's as messy as ever,
which is a good sign for you.

857
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,255
It is a very good sign. Good luck.
Thank you, thank you.

858
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:21,015
Bakers, you are halfway through!

859
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,455
I would've liked all the biscuits

860
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,655
to have been baked within
the first two hours.

861
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,975
I've got a lot to do
and not much time.

862
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,775
These are the chromosome.

863
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,055
Chromosome is like a bag that
contains all your DNA in it.

864
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,455
If you untangle your genetic
structure, which is your helix,

865
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,775
you will have about 67 billion miles
of DNA. How mad is that?

866
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,135
Krokan, I think this is
a really exquisite challenge

867
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,495
for the semifinal.

868
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,175
It's really difficult.

869
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,495
When you think that Syabira
is trying to do

870
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,535
the double helix,

871
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,215
I don't know how she's
going to manage that.

872
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,695
The structure itself is quite
ambitious - I would admit that -

873
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,655
so if I muffed it, I'm not through
for the final.

874
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,775
If Syabira's doesn't fall over,
she could win.

875
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,135
This does play to
Syabira's strengths

876
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,255
and also, actually, janusz's.
He's building Pride.

877
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,295
The layers have to be really
carefully brought together.

878
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,655
All is good, all is good,
all is colourful, all is pretty.

879
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,815
Once isomalt is in those hearts,
I can start assembling.

880
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,055
My money's on Abdul.

881
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,535
The rocket? That looks quite...

882
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,375
It does look amazing,
quite spindly.

883
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,495
I'm almost clone now.
There's the last pieces.

884
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,855
I just think he's so precise,

885
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,215
organised and it's a really
good idea.

886
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,295
I mean, then you've got Sandro
building, well, essentially Big Ben

887
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,455
with all the bits.

888
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,815
I would be surprised if Sandro
finishes, though,

889
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,575
because it's just so complicated.

890
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,015
I'm sure he'll finish it,
but to what level of finesse?

891
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,055
They keep underestimating me.

892
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,375
I'm being ambitious with it.
I'm going for it.

893
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,775
I'm going for perfection.

894
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,055
Just 90 minutes remain.

895
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,135
That's the last one.

896
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,935
That should be enough for
the whole entire helix.

897
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,255
Come on sugar, cook.

898
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,855
I'm using the caramel to just glue

899
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,735
the structure together cos
caramel's really strong.

900
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,655
I have to start assembling.

901
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,375
This is the most
nerve-breaking part.

902
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,895
My hands are shaking.

903
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,495
Oh, this one's not meeting.
Move! Move quickly!

904
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,095
That's better.

905
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,135
I am glueing this main structure
together now.

906
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,175
This is gonna be
the central pole of the helix.

907
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,535
It has to be super straight,

908
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,935
so it is how precisely I can arrange
this together,

909
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,455
so that it wouldn't fall down.
No room for wonkiness.

910
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,015
But while Syabira's, Sandra's...

911
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,895
Africa's sticking just fine.

912
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,655
...and janusz's structures
take shape...

913
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,135
Yep.

914
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,015
...Abdul's still baking.

915
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,975
That's the last one that's going in.

916
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,535
I'm just gonna do my decorations
as quick as possible.

917
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,775
I am running behind.

918
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,135
Time, time, time again.

919
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,775
Bakers, you have one hour left!

920
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,695
Stress. Right.

921
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,175
These are the chromosome.

922
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,215
Just making my marzipan decoration -

923
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,535
my stars and planets
and astronauts -

924
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,815
and then start assembling it.

925
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,695
Oh, it's taking shape, isn't it?

926
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,055
And what's the purpose
of having this cup here?

927
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,255
It's gonna hold what I'm about
to put on.

928
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,895
It's all good. It's all good.

929
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,215
Ooh!

930
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,975
This cup's not great, innit?

931
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,335
No. I nearly had a moment there.

932
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:44,135
I'm doing the double helix.
It's gonna spiral to the top.

933
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,215
I'm just trying to make sure
they're all vertical,

934
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,015
all straight,

935
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,335
and also make sure my caramel
doesn't burn.

936
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,495
Making more glue.

937
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,335
My eyes are burning.

938
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,735
What a different life it would be
if you were that tall.

939
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,735
I like your little purple gloves.

940
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,975
You look like a Batman villain.

941
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,575
So, I have the flat edges

942
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:26,615
and now it's just time
to start sticking them together.

943
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,215
Seems to be holding really well
at the moment.

944
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,255
So, this is the London Eye.
It's custard and rhubarb.

945
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,695
That's not gonna hold.
It's too weighty.

946
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,255
Oh, this is huge!
This is what it's about right.

947
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,175
I'm gonna do a lot of pipework now.
Pipework.

948
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,855
Pipework, make the dreams work.
Everyone's dug in deep,

949
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,295
pulling off some business.

950
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,655
I mean, janusz's one looks
like perfection.

951
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,295
Beautiful, isn't it?
You can't even see the caramel.

952
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,615
Look at my caramel mess,
but I'm gonna hide this.

953
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,175
Get in the zone, get in the groove.

954
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,495
Got an amazing structure.
Now make it look pretty.

955
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,735
Bakers, you have half-an-hour left!

956
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,655
Nearly there with the assembly

957
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,375
and then move on with some of
the decoration.

958
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,655
My royal icing is
Brighton Gin-flavoured.

959
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,175
Janusz, I need some help.

960
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,575
Syabira, I'm coming.
What do you need me to do?

961
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,895
I need to put this
on the top here.

962
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,695
I'm not sure if it's stable enough.

963
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,495
OK. Gonna lift it and you help.

964
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,815
I'm gonna hold the...

965
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,575
I'm holding the biscuit
on the bottom.

966
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,415
Yeah, can you hold it?

967
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,495
Yep. Crazy Syabira, of course.

968
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,375
I'm just doing some pipework.

969
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:52,815
Just to add some decor
and definition to some of the bits.

970
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,175
So far, so good. I have just
the final top bit left now

971
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,775
and then I'll go back
to my marzipan.

972
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,375
Colour them, stick them,
finish this, finish this.

973
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,695
My marzipan's falling off!

974
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,055
After I've finished my hearts,
I will get piping.

975
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,175
Every single heart needs to have
a white outline.

976
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,055
That's the isomalt, to bring some
colour, cos I'm gonna do blue,

977
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,455
white and red for the flags.
It's coming together.

978
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,215
But I'm trying to cover up
the imperfections.

979
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,655
I need to show that I can
finish things off.

980
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,455
Bakers, you only have
five minutes left.

981
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,375
Lots to do, lots to do.

982
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,775
These look an absolute mess though.

983
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,815
This is marzipan
with ground pistachios.

984
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,455
I'm stamping the letters of the DNA.

985
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:43,895
The code in the genome contains four
different letters - G, C, T and A.

986
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,375
You all right?
Getting a bit stressed.

987
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,935
Got enough time? Hmm. Doubt it.

988
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,535
I'll do what I can do though.
I'm not gonna give up.

989
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,175
How long do we have left?
You have one minute left.

990
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,935
Isomalt is gonna go on.
Blue, where's the blue?

991
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,615
Where's the blue gone?

992
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,615
I wish I had royal icing.

993
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,615
That's the red.

994
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,735
Hasn't come out how I wanted it.

995
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,495
This one keeps drooping down.

996
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,135
OK, bakers, your time is up.

997
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,415
<i>And breathe.</i>

998
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,375
And we can breathe as well now. God.

999
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,135
Whoa, man! You pulled off the DNA.
High five. Look at that!

1000
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,415
Beautiful.

1001
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,135
I hope it didn't fall down though.

1002
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,375
No, no, no, no. Don't say that.

1003
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,055
There is more that I could've clone.

1004
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,695
But I'm happy with how it
turned out.

1005
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,095
My red sugar just fell off.

1006
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,255
Oh, no.

1007
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:05,695
It's time to judge
the bakers' show-stopping krokans.

1008
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,695
Abdul, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

1009
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,335
Oh, my hands are
so sweaty right now.

1010
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,575
Please don't drop that!

1011
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,375
I think it looks

1012
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,655
absolutely magnificent.

1013
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,175
And I love the little spaceman.

1014
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,535
I think it looks great.
You've managed to achieve

1015
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,535
the symmetry beautifully,
all the way down.

1016
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,575
Ancl you've got some nice detail in
there. I love the isomalt windows.

1017
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,495
Very clever.

1018
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,535
It does feel like vandalism,
breaking it up.

1019
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,335
Breaking things like that!

1020
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,175
All that work.

1021
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,015
I think the biscuit's delicious.
It's almondy. It's chewy.

1022
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,215
It's got a good colour.

1023
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,175
So, all these are marzipan,
these little stars?

1024
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,615
Yes. They're all orange marzipan.

1025
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,975
Mmm. That's delicious. Is that
made with essence or with...?

1026
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,415
There's orange zest in there...

1027
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,775
Hmm. It tastes fresh.
..As well as some essence. Yeah.

1028
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,255
That's really nice, that.
Abdul, I think you've done

1029
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,935
a terrific job. Well done.
Thank you.

1030
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,215
It's absolutely wonderful.

1031
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,895
I think your design is amazing.
The colours are incredible.

1032
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,415
And the chromosomes, are they
actually supporting

1033
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,215
the whole structure? Yes.

1034
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,255
It is just amazing.

1035
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,775
I made the base
with almond krokan

1036
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,455
and the top with pistachios
krokan.

1037
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,055
I think the flavours are all
absolutely spot-on,

1038
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,815
but the baking varies.
Some of them are a little too dry.

1039
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,815
The main stand bit is OK.
It's slightly chewy in the middle.

1040
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,535
The pistachio tastes amazing.
The almond tastes amazing.

1041
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,175
But they're both over baked.

1042
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,415
Thank you. Thanks, Syabira.

1043
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,815
I think the bottom tier is
beautifully neat,

1044
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,655
well executed, and the way you've
put the different colours

1045
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,015
inside there,
I think it really works.

1046
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,855
I just think it's slightly untidy
as you go up.

1047
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,175
The hearts are pretty even.

1048
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,775
These ones are closer together
than those ones.

1049
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,615
Well, let's see what it
tastes like.

1050
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,255
Mmm, delicious flavour.

1051
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,815
I want to see if I can taste
the gin in the icing.

1052
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,335
'Course you do!

1053
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,695
Flavours are excellent.
They are a bit over baked.

1054
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,215
They're not chewy enough.

1055
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,695
The best bit I've found was just
here, where it's a little bit

1056
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,175
softer. But it's lost its crisp.

1057
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,575
You've gone from slightly over
to slightly under.

1058
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,375
Ancl we're trying to look for
something bang in the middle.

1059
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,215
I do like it. It's mad.

1060
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,735
It's sort of all over the place,
like a Monty Python krokan.

1061
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,095
We have the whole of Africa here.
The whole of Africa.

1062
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,335
There's red and blue isomalt
for the UK flag,

1063
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,655
but the red isomalt fell off.

1064
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,015
It does look as if you've
overdone the caramel...

1065
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,135
Most definitely.
..Like it's almost burnt.

1066
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,895
What's the tang in that?
That's rhubarb and custard.

1067
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,215
Mmm. Wow, yeah.

1068
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,495
Africa's raspberry
and the pistachio.

1069
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,255
It's more raspberry than pistachio.
But the texture's beautiful.

1070
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,935
I mean, every part has got
a softness to it,

1071
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,495
which is exactly how it should be -
crispy on the outside,

1072
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,215
soft on the inside.

1073
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,135
Chewy, with flavour.

1074
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,935
It's just a little bit
all over the place.

1075
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,415
Yeah, I would've wanted it
a bit more finessed,

1076
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,455
especially with being
the week it is.

1077
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,015
Well done, Sandro.
Thank you, Sandro.

1078
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,455
It wasn't as bad as
I thought it would go.

1079
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:11,055
And, for once, Paul actually seemed
really impressed with the flavour.

1080
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:18,575
Hopefully, I've clone enough to save
myself a place in the finals.

1081
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,015
I've got this feeling that
I am today in the bottom.

1082
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,375
I know that patisserie is
my weakness, so it's gonna be

1083
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,775
a challenging decision,
which one is going home.

1084
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,815
Well, that was an amazing
Showstopper. Yeah.

1085
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,615
All four did really well.

1086
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,255
Syabira's helix looked
extraordinary.

1087
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,095
I mean, that is an insane idea,
right? Amazing.

1088
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,535
The problem with that design is,

1089
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,655
you've got small bits of biscuit,
so it was slightly over baked.

1090
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,895
She won the Technical and had
a good Signature, didn't she?

1091
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,975
Syabira has had a really good couple
of days. And the same with Abdul.

1092
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,415
Fantastic. I thought his textures
were all spot-on.

1093
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,895
It's Syabira or him,
isn't it, for Star Baker? Yeah.

1094
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,895
But by the very virtue of the fact
we're talking about Syabira

1095
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,575
and Abdul for Star Baker,

1096
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,135
we are now looking atjanusz
and Sandro to go.

1097
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,695
It comes down to little differences.

1098
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,575
Can I just say as well, this is
the worst time to go home?

1099
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,055
But one of them has to. Yeah.

1100
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,455
Let's hold hands.

1101
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,615
It's inconceivable to think that
we will be saying goodbye to

1102
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,455
one of you, but we will.

1103
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,895
Three of you have made it
to the final

1104
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,855
and one of you is Star Baker.

1105
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,095
And this week, the Star Baker is...

1106
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,255
Congratulations, Abdul.
APPLAUSE

1107
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,895
That means I've got the horrible,
horrible job of announcing

1108
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,215
the person who is leaving us,

1109
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,135
and this is just the worst time
to go home.

1110
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:12,455
But the person who's leaving us
this week is...

1111
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,735
...janusz.

1112
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,015
Doesn't surprise me.

1113
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,775
Ancl janusz is leaving the tent!

1114
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,055
You are a really good baker.
You're not only a good baker,

1115
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,975
you're such a lovely guy.

1116
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,135
I am not upset.

1117
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,695
The best three bakers are left,
clearly.

1118
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,375
We're going to miss you so much.
I know.

1119
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,215
It was an amazing time
with amazing people.

1120
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,135
Guys, you're in the final!

1121
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,495
I don't know, man. It's crazy.
It's just crazy.

1122
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:00,655
In the final and just Star Baker
as well, like... unbelievable.

1123
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,015
Well clone, mate. Thank you.
See you in the final.

1124
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,455
This is just awesome to see

1125
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,135
because it just shows that
I have been improving

1126
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,695
and this gives me confidence that
I belong with the other two bakers.

1127
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,535
You did so well. Thank you.

1128
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,975
I'm very happy. It means everything.

1129
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,135
It's something that
I wouldn't think I could achieve.

1130
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,535
Congratulations. That was close.

1131
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:33,415
I'm relieved. I'm happy that Paul
and Prue see something to be able to

1132
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,375
hold me a space for the final.

1133
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,015
Congrats!

1134
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,415
That's just where
I wanted to get to.

1135
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,855
Yeah.

1136
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,215
Yeah.

1137
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,255
Happy tears.

1138
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,255
Oh, mad.

1139
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,575
Next time...

1140
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:59,495
I'd like to invite the three
finalists to come and join us here.

1141
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,655
This is the calm before
the storm. Going to get messy.

1142
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,295
The winner... They are overcooked.

1143
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:11,335
Oh, man. My bread! I don't
know if you're baked, mate.

1144
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,175
...of The Great British Bake Off...

1145
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,655
Stress!

1146
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:19,175
How many minutes do we have left?
I can feel myself shaking over here.

1147
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,735
Please, please, please don't.
..Is...

1148
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,975
Are you a Star Baker in the making?

1149
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,735

series of Bake Off, visit...
