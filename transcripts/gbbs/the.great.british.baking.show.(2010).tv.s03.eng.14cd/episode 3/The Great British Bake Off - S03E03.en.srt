00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Welcome back to Somerset, and to our illustrious tent 

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,800
wherein ten bakers are continuing to do baking battle. 

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,960
They face a weekend of arduous challenges 

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,680
in an effort to impress Mary Berry and Paul "The Silverback" Hollywood. 

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,720
Well, the butter is room temperature, the flour is sifted. 

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,480
But who will crumble? Forgive me! 

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,520
Welcome to The Great British Bake Off. 

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,320
Last week... 

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,160
- It's sticking! 
- ..bread proved tricky. 

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,680
I'm going again! I'm going again! 

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,760
For the first time... 

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,520
I feel like I'm sort of an impostor. 

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,160
- ..Victoria struggled.
- They're a bit weak. They're a bit flat. 

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,640
- But, it was dad of two, Peter... 
- WATER SPLASHES 

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,200
..who was next to leave. 

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,760
To say it was a disaster would be a humiliation to disaster. 

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,120
While law student, John, was judged Star Baker. 

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,440
- Chuffed to bits! Chuffed to bits! 
- 'This week...' 

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,240
- Did I just say you measuring pastry? 
- Yeah! 

20
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,880
'..the bakers tackle tarts. 

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,600
'But who'll create pastry perfection?' 

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,040
- I love that!
- You could see this on the front of a patisserie window. 

23
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,080
Who'll manage to pull off... 

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,520
Let's try that again. 

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,920
..a technical triumph? 

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,320
A little bit of a soggy bottom in the middle. 

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,360
Who'll be the next Star Baker? 

28
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,160
Yes! Yes! Sorry! Yes! 

29
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,400
And whose Bake Off... 

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,040
I will, today, design a tart that will look stunning. 

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,760
..is about to come to an end? 

32
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,160
So this is going to go in the bin. 

33
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,160
I'm really, really, cross with myself. Really cross. 

34
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,480
Aargh! 

35
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,080
Silly! Silly, silly, silly! 

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,840
So, this week, it's all about tarts. 

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,080
Such a shame you can't get any double entendres out of this week. 

38
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,120
Hmmm... 

39
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,480
Did you say, "tarts?" 

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,800
Tarts, yeah. 

41
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,520
- No, nothing.
- No. 

42
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,120
Morning, bakers, and welcome back to the Bake Off tent. 

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,640
And this, your signature challenge. 

44
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,320
We're going to be asking you today 

45
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,440
to rustle up a bit of a French classic... 

46
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,880
SHE ADOPTS FRENCH ACCENT ..which is the tarte tatin. 

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,440
- Oh!
- Thanks very much. 

48
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,400
Now this is a particularly tricky thing to bake, 

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,920
because it requires a real knowledge of pastry, 

50
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,120
and apparently, very steady hand when you're turning it out. 

51
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,480
Well, that rules you out. 

52
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,720
We're looking for a classic tarte tatin, sweet or savoury, 

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,840
and you've just got two and a half hours to do it. 

54
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,920
- So...
- On your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake! 

55
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,840
The classic tarte tatin 

56
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,160
is traditionally made with caramelised apples, 

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,800
which are baked under a lid of pastry before being inverted, 

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,080
so that when it's served, the pastry is underneath and the filling on top. 

59
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,560
The finished result should be 

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,520
a crisp pastry once they turn it out, 

61
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,440
and on top, 

62
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,120
a lovely, syrupy, shiny caramel. 

63
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,880
If they bake it too little, it will remain pale. 

64
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,360
That, with the liquid of whatever fruit they're going to use, 

65
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,760
will go into the dough and make it soggy. 

66
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,560
And that, for me, is a big no. 

67
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,120
This is something that I do actually make for lunch. 

68
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,680
We eat it at home. 

69
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,080
Whether it's a classic tarte tatin, I don't know. But we eat this. 

70
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,680
- It's edible! I know it's edible! 
- SHE LAUGHS 

71
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,320
As well as her friends and partner, Michael, 

72
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,600
it's intensive care consultant Danny's work colleagues 

73
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,760
that are the willing guinea pigs 

74
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,560
for her latest baking inventions. 

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,000
Today, it will be Paul and Mary's turn to try her savoury tatin, 

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,920
featuring pear, walnut, thyme and Roquefort cheese. 

77
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,080
Sounds very interesting, doesn't it? 

78
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,840
It does, it sounds nice! 

79
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,080
I mean, pear and Roquefort really go well together. 

80
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,760
As long as you don't overwhelm the pear with Roquefort. 

81
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,360
That's the secret. It's about the blend of the flavours. 

82
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,720
To get the cheese flavour in, 

83
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,240
because it melts, you've got extra kind of moisture. 

84
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,720
The first time I made it, it was FAR too sweet. 

85
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,600
So I've cut back, and I've gone to almost no sugar 

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,640
and then go back up again, to try and get the balance right 

87
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,720
between the amount of "caramel" and liquid 

88
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,160
that's coming from the cheese. 

89
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
- Wait and see!
- Yes! 

90
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,680
There are no flies on these bakers! 

91
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,720
Most of the bakers are making rough puff pastry 

92
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,640
by adding chunks of butter to flour. 

93
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,400
I've brought my own knife from home 

94
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,400
cos it's got a perfect rounded end for going round the bowl 

95
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,800
and cutting through the butter and stuff. 

96
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,040
I can't make pastry without this knife 

97
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,600
so I have to bring it with me! 

98
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,080
They must add just enough water 

99
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,800
to bring the mixture together into a soft dough. 

100
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,560
You put some lemon juice in with the water. 

101
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,600
Don't quote me on this, but I think it's to help 

102
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,280
start break down the gluten in the flour, 

103
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,760
so that the layers can really puff up. 

104
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,240
To produce the rough puff's distinctive layers, 

105
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,920
the dough must then be rolled and folded. 

106
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,880
I've done three folds. Pop it back in the fridge. 

107
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,080
That should be A-OK. 

108
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,160
James has opted for a different approach. 

109
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,440
HE HAMMERS BUTTER 

110
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,280
He is the only baker attempting 

111
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
the more time-consuming full puff pastry, 

112
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,080
which means adding the butter in one flattened piece. 

113
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,760
It's then distributed as he rolls and folds the pastry dough. 

114
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,480
Doing it this quickly is hard! 

115
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,240
By ensuring the butter is perfectly sandwiched between each layer, 

116
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,920
he should produce a lighter pastry. 

117
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,480
To be quite honest, I've got no idea 

118
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,400
what rough puff pastry is or how to make it, 

119
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,720
This is the only sort I knew! 

120
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,240
When he's not experimenting with his baking, 

121
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,720
James relaxes playing double bass in a band with his sister. 

122
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,000
THEY PLAY SCOTTISH FOLK MUSIC 

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,840
Today, he's baking a personal tried and tested favourite, 

124
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,720
an apple and lavender tart. 

125
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,920
- Apple and lavender?
- Yes! 

126
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,480
How are you infusing the lavender, then? 

127
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,640
I'm just actually putting some dried lavender 

128
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,520
in with the caramel and it works, yeah. 

129
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,560
Why lavender? 

130
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,520
This is the only tarte tatin I've ever made or ever tasted! 

131
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,200
- And you leave the little bits of lavender in it?
- Yeah, yeah. 

132
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,200
- Nice! 
- That'll be interesting to see.
- Yeah! 

133
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,160
With the pastry resting in the fridge, 

134
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,760
the bakers must focus on perfecting their toppings. 

135
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,200
I tend to like just a trace of a flavour 

136
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,360
and Paul and Mary like FLAVOUR with a big F, 

137
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,280
so I'm sort of doubling up the amount I'm putting in. 

138
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,120
When she isn't baking, Victoria knits, 

139
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,960
using the quiet time to dream up new flavour combinations. 

140
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,680
Her tart is a daring mix of figs, walnuts and pink peppercorns. 

141
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,120
Now, these peppercorns, they are dry? 

142
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,800
Yes, they are like this. 

143
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,200
But I've found when you crush them, they're still quite soft inside. 

144
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,040
They're not like black peppercorns 

145
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,640
which seem to be very hard and dried. 

146
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,600
- Not infused in anything?
- No. 

147
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Good luck. I'm looking forward to seeing 

148
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,240
how those peppercorns come through against the figs. 

149
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,280
I've actually practised this yesterday, 

150
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,120
and actually last week as well. 

151
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,600
I don't want to be on the back foot all the time, you see? 

152
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,560
If I do this well, 

153
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,680
it eases the pressure and I can enjoy the weekend. 

154
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,320
For Ryan, baking is all about preparation. 

155
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,160
He practises all his recipes 

156
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,680
until he gets them absolutely perfect, 

157
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,720
often with the help of his two-year-old daughter, Molly. 

158
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
- Uh!
- Yes, you're having a lot of fun, but you're not making much! 

159
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,760
He's hoping that will pay off 

160
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,640
with his vanilla and cinnamon spiced pear tarte tatin. 

161
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,520
I'm scraping out the vanilla seeds and rubbing it into the pears. 

162
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,600
And on top of that I'll stick 

163
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,800
the left over vanilla pod into the pear, 

164
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,400
to drive some of the flavour inside the pears. 

165
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,280
Ryan isn't the only one who's been practising. 

166
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,160
I've done this one three or four times, 

167
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,280
just because it's everybody's favourite. 

168
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,920
It's very simple, though. 

169
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,720
Compared to everybody else's, it's very simple. 

170
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,800
Vicar's wife, Sarah-Jane, has hundreds of baking recipes 

171
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,240
that have been handed down to her by her grandmother. 

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,440
Her family's favourite tarte tatin 

173
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,960
only features caramel and fresh banana. 

174
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,400
- I LOVE bananas!
- Oh, that's good! 

175
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,080
Did you know that, Sarah-Jane? 

176
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,160
I didn't, no! 

177
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,680
And are you slicing your bananas or..? 

178
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,360
I'm going to slice them into discs. 

179
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,440
It looks quite pretty. 

180
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,240
So it won't be too deep. 

181
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,000
If you did it very deep it would fall apart when you cut it. 

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,040
Yes. 

183
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,280
But you've worked all that out, haven't you? 

184
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,640
I don't want to say too much, 

185
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,400
but it does work quite well at home 

186
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,080
and everybody really likes it. 

187
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,880
So we expect perfection, then! 

188
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,040
Nothing less than perfection, Sarah-Jane, is that OK? 

189
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,280
That's fine, yeah! No pressure! 

190
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,160
My children are definitely the guinea pigs for my recipes. 

191
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,480
But my children are probably my harshest critics, 

192
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,640
cos if they don't like it, they just won't eat it 

193
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,560
and they won't pretend that it's lovely. 

194
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,600
Mum of two, Cathryn, takes her family camping as often as she can, 

195
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,520
and even life in the great outdoors won't stop her from baking. 

196
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,320
She's making life difficult again with her tarte tatin, 

197
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,440
creating her own five spice mix 

198
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,320
and de-stoning almost a pound of fresh plums and cherries. 

199
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,640
SHE SIGHS 

200
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,360
Hasn't been entirely successful when I've been practising at home, 

201
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,960
so hoping that I've got all my... 

202
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,080
ironed out the creases at home 

203
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,120
and it'll be all right today. 

204
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,080
Got an hour and ten minutes. 

205
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,640
With 90 minutes to go, 

206
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,760
caramel becomes the key element in the tarte tatin. 

207
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,480
Made by carefully melting sugar in water, 

208
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,920
not only does it give the tart a golden colour, 

209
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,960
it should also provide a shiny, glazed finish. 

210
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,360
Because I've got apple juice and cinnamon in there, 

211
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,480
I can't quite gauge the amber tones, cos it was already fairly brown. 

212
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
- Gauge the amber tones? 
- Gauge the amber tones! 

213
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,080
I tell you what, if the baking doesn't pay off, which it will, 

214
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,760
- poetry is always there. 
- Yeah, well... 

215
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,080
When his parents divorced 16 years ago, 

216
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,360
John and his mum found that baking 

217
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,080
was a great way for them to bond and to keep the family together. 

218
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,960
In my tum-tum! 

219
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,960
He's determined to repeat last week's success 

220
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,640
with an apple and vanilla tarte tatin, 

221
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,840
topped with a walnut praline. 

222
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,280
I'm aware that when I speak to you 

223
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,480
there should be a certain amount of reverence in my tone, 

224
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,840
cos, last week, Star Baker. 

225
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,160
Well, yeah, you're talking to a king now, Sue. 

226
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,960
- I know, I know. Excuse me, let me defer.
- Thank you! 

227
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,400
It's nice to have that accolade of Star Baker, 

228
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,440
but it doesn't really mean anything in the grand scheme of things. 

229
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,280
Everything's set to zero today and... 

230
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,640
- Would it mean more if we gave you a crown?
- It would, actually. 

231
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
You can fashion one out of foil or something. 

232
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,080
- Something quite simple.
- You've heard about the licence fee freezes, then? 

233
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,080
- Yeah.
- It literally would be made out of foil. 

234
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,600
Any prospect of being this week's Star Baker... 

235
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,040
So this is going to go in the bin. 

236
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,400
..could already be slipping away from Manisha. 

237
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,800
I think the sugar crystallised. 

238
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,840
That's never, ever happened before. Yeah, going to start again. 

239
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,720
When she's not baking or looking after her dad and brothers, 

240
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,640
nursery teacher, Manisha, spends as much time with friends as she can. 

241
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,880
They've all tried her classic apple and pear tarte tatin. 

242
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,120
Manisha, I saw you having a little bit of trouble with that caramel 

243
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,280
and you know, in a non-stick pan, 

244
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,920
very often, it will crystallise, 

245
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,000
and it's very important not to stir. 

246
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,280
You dissolve the sugar stirring, then leave it alone 

247
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,680
and let it boil till it's a caramel. 

248
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,320
And you've got there in the end. 

249
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,560
I've got two going at the end. 

250
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,840
Just in case! How many times have you..? 

251
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,120
This is the fifth and sixth. 

252
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,360
I've got a good feeling about six. 

253
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,400
- I've not touched number four and three...
- Just leave them alone. 

254
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,200
How the bakers arrange their fruit is critical. 

255
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,440
An apple left to eat! 

256
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,560
Failing to create an attractive pattern at this stage 

257
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,480
will result in an ugly mess once their tart is turned out. 

258
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,040
I like tarte tatin to have strong, deep apples. 

259
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,120
It sort of adds to the presentation of it and depth of it. 

260
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,800
When 63-year-old Brendan was in his teens, 

261
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,600
he planned to train for a career in baking. 

262
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,160
But money at home was tight and he had to put his dreams on hold 

263
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,720
so that he could find work to support his family. 

264
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,160
His signature tarte tatin uses ginger 

265
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,720
to complement the flavour of 12 apples. 

266
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,280
Using this particular upright method, I bake it first of all, 

267
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,720
before putting the pastry on, and then finish it. 

268
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,360
That will be in there for 25 minutes. 

269
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,480
The final piece in the tarte tatin puzzle is the pastry top. 

270
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,680
That, after baking, will become the bottom. 

271
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,600
Danny, did I just see you measuring pastry? 

272
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,160
Yeah, it's too thick. 

273
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,840
- You've been measuring that way as well?
- Yeah, and it's too thick here. 

274
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,600
You're going to need an electron microscope to see that! 

275
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,200
But Stuart isn't rolling out pastry. 

276
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
For the almond flavour, I'm using marzipan, 

277
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,080
cos it's just quite an intense almond but nice balanced flavour. 

278
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,120
So I'm putting that on top of the fruit 

279
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,760
and pastry on top of the marzipan. 

280
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,800
PE teacher, Stuart, is currently having to divide his spare time 

281
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,480
between practising for the Bake Off 

282
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,720
and training with his local rugby team. 

283
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,160
He's tackling a pear and almond tarte tatin. 

284
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,440
It could look very messy as it melts, the marzipan. 

285
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,840
But that marzipan is going to give a really good flavour, 

286
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,360
because I often make marzipan, grated 

287
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,520
into a mixture of apples or pears, 

288
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,040
and I think it adds a lot to a tart. 

289
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,560
40 minutes remaining. 

290
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,080
I think that'll do. 

291
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,960
When baking in the oven, 

292
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,520
any liquid from their fruit will create steam 

293
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,960
that can soak the baker's pastry, rendering it a soggy mess. 

294
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,480
So, hopefully it should be OK. 

295
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,320
By pricking the surface, the steam can escape, 

296
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,200
helping the pastry stay as crisp as possible. 

297
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,840
Fingers crossed! 

298
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,880
When to remove a tarte tatin from the oven is an agonising decision. 

299
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,920
The bakers will only be able to see when their PASTRY is baked. 

300
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,600
I want to keep the bottom of the pastry as crisp as possible. 

301
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,840
But it means that it's colouring a lot more quickly than it would. 

302
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,040
So I've made a little hat to put on the top 

303
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
to stop it from going too dark while it finishes cooking. 

304
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,560
They have to rely on their baking instincts to reassure them 

305
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,280
that their hidden fruit toppings 

306
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,040
are cooked through without becoming mushy and shapeless. 

307
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,560
And even if they think they have judged it correctly... 

308
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,400
Has everybody else brought theirs out? 

309
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,120
..they will only know for sure if they manage to turn it out. 

310
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,720
There is a lot of liquid, still. 

311
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,760
Moment of truth now. 

312
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,520
Oh, syrup, disaster! 

313
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,440
Puff the Magic Pastry. Here it comes. 

314
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,600
That is not only a taste of France, it is the size of France. 

315
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,720
That would do a proper old-fashioned family of eight, wouldn't it? 

316
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,880
It really would. 

317
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Oh, my days! Woah! Look at that! 

318
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,920
It has kind of collapsed slightly on this side. But, yeah, it looks good. 

319
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,520
That is not too bad. 

320
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:51,880
Yes, yes! Sorry! Yes! That is so childish! 

321
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,160
You had a tricky time to start with, with that caramel, didn't you? 

322
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,080
- Yes.
- But you got there in the end. 

323
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,360
- This was the sixth caramel you made? 
- Eighth. 

324
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,480
The eighth caramel?! 

325
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,760
My only thing is, I like a dark colour, I like to see a caramel. 

326
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,720
The pastry could do with a bit more cooking. 

327
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,440
The flavours are good but it is under-baked. 

328
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,720
I think it looks great. You have a fantastic colour. 

329
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,280
- I love what has happened to the bananas.
- Thank you. 

330
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,080
- It is red. I didn't even know they were bananas.
- No, I know. 

331
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,680
It is lovely and flaky underneath. 

332
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,880
You know what I'm going to say about that? 

333
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,200
- No?
- No soggy bottom!
- Thank you! 

334
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,360
That tastes absolutely delicious. 

335
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,800
I was very impressed with the way you chose something simple 

336
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,400
and carried it out perfectly. 

337
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,440
- Thank you so much.
- That is delicious. 

338
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,120
Toffee, banana, crispy, layered, buttery. Well done. 

339
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,160
Thank you so much. 

340
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,560
Weights and measures wise, 

341
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,480
you have used an orchard's worth of apples for this? 

342
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,440
- There's 12.
- That is a nightmare to cut into! 

343
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,520
Normally it fuses so you would not have that issue. 

344
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,360
You are going to have major issues. Obviously it will remain soggy. 

345
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,920
Any layers you've managed to build up will collapse. 

346
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,200
- It needed longer.
- Yes. 

347
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,640
Your apples are not quite... I would have, a little bit more. 

348
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,960
I know they are al dente, now, but it needed more. 

349
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,160
But the flavours are very good. 

350
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,360
And as you say, a little bit longer in the oven. 

351
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,720
Lots of colour, but does the colour 

352
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,640
then mean lots of flavour? 

353
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,840
I can see that the pastry is not done. 

354
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,040
That does not really work for me. 

355
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,000
It does not know what it is. That is the problem. 

356
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,080
The bake actually is all right. 

357
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,840
- That marzipan, with that, is spectacular.
- Thank you. 

358
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,200
The amount of liquid in this has made you have a very soggy bottom. 

359
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,280
It looks lovely and colourful though. 

360
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,440
It's terrible, isn't it? 

361
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,960
I was a bit anxious about the five-spice, 

362
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,320
because I have not done that before with something sweet. 

363
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
It is quite scrummy. 

364
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,760
And clever you, with that five-spice. It goes very well. 

365
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,040
Happy? 

366
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,480
- Generally, I can't complain. 
- That is a very good attitude. 

367
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,240
I like the way that each person will get half a pair. 

368
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,040
Or if you are Paul, a whole pear! 

369
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,320
Could have been a little bit thicker with the caramel. 

370
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,120
The pastry in certain parts is a little bit underdone. 

371
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,160
You went to a lot of trouble to get that vanilla flavour and it works. 

372
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,440
- You've got a true shine over the whole thing.
- Brilliant. Well done. 

373
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,800
It is dark, it looks inviting, it looks toffee-like. 

374
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,080
From here, I can see the layers of the pastry. 

375
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,880
Just look at that for an underneath. Beautifully baked. 

376
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,960
You needed more Roquefort. It is a strong flavour but don't be afraid to use it. 

377
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,560
I can see from here you have got a nice soft fruit. How about that? 

378
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,120
Lovely, crisp underneath. 

379
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,200
The bake is good. I think the flavours altogether are fantastic. 

380
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,280
Thank you. 

381
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,680
We have got a bit of colour on the bottom there which is good. 

382
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,600
The fruit is cooked. 

383
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,240
The texture of the apple is lovely, 

384
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,600
the flavour combination is good. 

385
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,560
- I liked the lavender, you have really conquered that.
- Thank you. 

386
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,120
It could have gone knicker drawer, that, you know what I mean? 

387
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,160
There is always that worry with lavender. But it is just delightful. 

388
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,320
Thank you very much. 

389
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,640
It was the risk of using the lavender that got all the positive comments. 

390
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,400
I'm so frustrated, really cross with myself. Just a bit under-baked. 

391
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,880
They are the judges on the day. 

392
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,240
So obviously disappointed I have not done better in their eyes. 

393
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,160
For Mary Berry, a legend, to say that mine was perfectly baked? 

394
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,000
It is up there with one of my best life experiences ever. 

395
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,880
For now, I'm aiming to do a good job later 

396
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,720
and forget about it being a bit pants. 

397
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,160
If you visited your GP and he prescribed a jam tart 

398
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,720
instead of antibiotics, you could be forgiven for thinking 

399
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,320
he's more in need of urgent treatment than you. 

400
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,040
However researchers at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh 

401
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,720
have unearthed a sweet tart recipe from the 1950s 

402
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,600
which shows how pioneering doctors and dieticians 

403
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,600
have totally revolutionised our approach to healthy eating. 

404
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,800
In 1920s Edinburgh a state of the art branch of food science 

405
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,120
was founded at the Royal Infirmary. 

406
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,160
Dietetics claimed that eating the right food 

407
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,720
could benefit your health 

408
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,040
and led to a wealth of new hospital recipes 

409
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,280
such as the bizarrely named invalid fruit tart. 

410
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,160
Well, the invalid fruit tart and the other recipes of the time 

411
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,600
showed that there was an interest in treating medical conditions by diet, 

412
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,760
so dietetics developed. 

413
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,600
Nurses who were working in the wards where the doctors asked 

414
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,920
for this particular treatment got particularly interested, 

415
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,000
and they were the ones caring for the patients, 

416
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,840
they were the ones feeding the patients. 

417
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,480
And they liaised with the cooks and the catering department 

418
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,880
so the nurses were able to feed the patients correctly. 

419
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,400
Nurses started specialising in the science of dietetics 

420
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,400
and classes were held in kitchens as well as in the ward. 

421
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,440
These newly-appointed sister dieticians 

422
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,600
now had the skills they needed to design and create recipes 

423
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,840
to help put their patients on the road to recovery. 

424
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,400
The invalid fruit tart recipe was one of several recipes 

425
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,200
that was discovered in the archives of the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh. 

426
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,520
It's a layered dish, a very soft dish, easy to chew, 

427
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,760
but perhaps not the traditional tart that we would eat nowadays. 

428
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,560
The invalid fruit tart is made from stewed apples, stale sponge 

429
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,720
and custard - each ingredient carefully chosen 

430
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,440
to give patients a balanced intake of nutrients. 

431
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,880
Nutritionally, I think the apples provided fibre, 

432
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,240
but also various micronutrients that would have been recognised 

433
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,000
to contribute to good health at that time as well. 

434
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,680
We think that the recipe said for stale sponge 

435
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,040
because the drier texture of a stale sponge would allow the custard 

436
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,560
to be absorbed better. If it was a fresher sponge, 

437
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,400
then it tends to make more of a pasty consistency. 

438
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,440
The custard, made from milk and eggs, 

439
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,720
added a high amount of protein to the dish, 

440
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,160
ensuring plenty of energy for the patients. 

441
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,920
The appearance of a tart was also taken into consideration, 

442
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,760
and a meringue topping would have made the invalid tart 

443
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,760
a mouth-watering prospect for hospital patients at the time. 

444
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,000
I think there may need to be some changes if it were to be used now, 

445
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,600
in terms of using things like pasteurised eggs in hospital. 

446
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,400
and I also think that the name - 

447
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,720
the invalid fruit tart - might need to be changed 

448
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,280
to make it more appealing for patients looking through menus. 

449
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,640
The pioneering work of these early dieticians 

450
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,160
gave us a greater understanding 

451
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,200
of how food can aid our path to recovery, 

452
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,880
proving that an apple a day - even in a baked tart - 

453
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,000
really can help keep the doctor away. 

454
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,480
A storm has hit the Bake-Off, 

455
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,680
just in time for pastry week's most chilling test. 

456
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,760
Bakers, it's the moment I sense that you might all be dreading - 

457
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,440
it's, of course, time for the Technical Challenge. 

458
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,120
Now, this is going to be judged blind, as you know, 

459
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,720
- so Paul and Mary, with the greatest respect, please leave. 
- Good luck!
- Thank you. 

460
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,560
This week, the Technical Challenge is going to be... 

461
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,120
a treacle tart with a woven lattice top. 

462
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,920
This is Mary Berry's recipe, OK? No pressure. 

463
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,160
She will know the difference between a great bake, as per her instructions, 

464
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,920
from something substandard. You've got two hours, so... 

465
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,640
- On your marks...
- Get set...
- Bake. 

466
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,480
Crack on. 

467
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,360
All the bakers have the same ingredients 

468
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,200
and the same very basic recipe. 

469
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,480
Beyond that, they're on their own. 

470
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,160
See if I can guess all the stuff that's not in the recipe. 

471
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,440
Mary Berry's recipe. Such pressure. 

472
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,680
If I don't present them with something perfect I'll feel dreadful! 

473
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,040
So, Mary, why have you picked a treacle tart? 

474
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,440
Well, it's a classic recipe, everybody loves it 

475
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,280
and it's quite tricky to make. 

476
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,360
It crumbles so easily. 

477
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,240
Look at that texture. Fantastic. 

478
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,000
And if you just turn it upside-down, there it is - 

479
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,280
lovely and brown underneath, just that pale golden colour. 

480
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,800
If you had a thicker pastry, it would not be as good. 

481
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,560
I think the lattice work on the top will cause a few problems 

482
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,160
cos most of them have probably not done it like that before. 

483
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,840
They're not just to put them on all one way and all another way. 

484
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,440
We've made it a bit tricky for them. 

485
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,040
We've told them they have to interweave all the strands. 

486
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,600
So a lot of things can go wrong. 

487
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,800
The shortcrust pastry base is made 

488
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,840
by combining two parts flour to one part fat... 

489
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,240
rubbing them together to form fine breadcrumbs, 

490
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,200
and then adding water to bind it into a dough. 

491
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,200
Trick with it is to just work it as little as possible 

492
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,600
and add as little water as humanly possible. 

493
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,440
It's very short, that. 

494
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,480
I'm not sure if it's just got too little water in it. It is pliable. 

495
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,440
I've put the recipe's amount, 

496
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,040
- so I'm not going to fiddle with Mary Berry - she'll have me. 
- HE LAUGHS 

497
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,920
Chilling the dough relaxes the gluten in the flour 

498
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,000
and prevents the fats from melting into a sticky mess... 

499
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,920
..which should allow the bakers to roll it out as thin as possible 

500
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,520
to line their tins. 

501
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,280
That is a thing of great beauty. 

502
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,880
Are you starting to think there might be people here 

503
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,080
that look like they could go all the way? 

504
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,600
- Oh, absolutely! 
- Is it getting competitive? 

505
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,760
- Not in that sense.
- No. Not yet. Just wait. Ooh! Just wait. 

506
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,800
So, at the moment, sweetness, light, a lot of support in the room, 

507
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,400
a lot of love in the room. Wait till week five. SHE CLICKS HER TONGUE 

508
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,320
The treacle-tart filling has three key ingredients - 

509
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,680
golden syrup, lemon and breadcrumbs. 

510
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,880
I thought a treacle tart would have treacle in it. Apparently not. 

511
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,880
Ideally, the bread used should be a couple of days old 

512
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,480
so that it's slightly dry, 

513
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,240
which helps prevent the crumbs sticking together when blended. 

514
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,160
I can't believe you've cut this into triangles and now you're going to put it into a blender 

515
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,480
- and now smash the living daylights out of it!
- Yes! 

516
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,920
'The bigger the breadcrumbs, 

517
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,960
'the more lumpy the consistency of the filling and the more prone it will be to catching when baked.' 

518
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,640
Heating the golden syrup thins it slightly, 

519
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:35,200
allowing the breadcrumbs to absorb it more easily. 

520
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,280
And adding lemon zest and juice cuts through the sweetness. 

521
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,760
I've just tasted this filling and it's so lemony, I didn't realise... 

522
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,000
But Mary loves lemons, doesn't she? 

523
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,080
The bakers have to work quickly. 

524
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,560
If the mixture is allowed to cool too much, it'll begin to solidify, 

525
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,880
making it impossible to work evenly into their pastry cases. 

526
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,520
It's supposed to be more thinner but we won't talk about that just yet... 

527
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,080
Mary's recipe demands that every tart be topped by a carefully woven pastry lattice. 

528
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,120
The only problem is just the weaving of it. 

529
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,520
I need a ruler! 

530
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,640
The lattice needs to be made quickly. 

531
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,360
If the strips are too thin... 

532
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,000
..the butter will melt as soon as they touch the warm filling... 

533
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,440
..making the dough soft, and hard to work with. 

534
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,960
By definition, lattice, I think that it is like strands interwoven. 

535
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,000
That was my idea at first. 

536
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,840
But as soon as I put the strands on, it stuck to the treacle 

537
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,120
and I can't lift it back out again. 

538
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,160
I've got more serious concerns about whether the pastry is OK, 

539
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,480
rather than these minor issues. 

540
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,560
I'm just trying to decide whether diamonds or squares would look better. 

541
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,880
But the lattice isn't a MINOR issue for everyone. 

542
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,600
- How many inches between each lattice, James?
- Four centimetres. 

543
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,920
Four centimetres, apparently. 

544
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,160
You practised your lattice! 

545
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,520
Once the pastry got onto the warm filling, 

546
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,680
it's much too soft and you can't do it. 

547
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,680
So you suffer from LCD. You've got Lattice Compulsive Disorder! 

548
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,080
Slide that on top - 

549
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,160
Bob's your uncle. 

550
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,520
Let's try that again. 

551
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,720
Oh! You're doing a sort of spiral lattice? 

552
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,000
- That is my plan. 
- That is way ahead of my abilities. 

553
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,440
You can twist the pastry and then make a lattice out of it. 

554
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,040
It seems pretty OK. 

555
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,080
That'll do. 

556
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,880
The bakers have only been given an oven temperature. 

557
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,600
With just 45 minutes remaining, 

558
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,760
the exact baking time is up to them. 

559
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
There's one chance to get it right 

560
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,760
and if you don't get it right, then, you know, it could be the end of it. 

561
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,600
Ah, it looked really good before... 

562
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,960
It's too late now. 

563
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,720
I stupidly messed up again. 

564
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,520
I misread the recipe 

565
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,120
so I put 150g LESS golden syrup in than I should have. 

566
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,880
So it's going to turn out really dry and horrible. Argh! Silly! 

567
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,200
Silly, silly, silly! 

568
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,600
Can I borrow your golden syrup, please, James? 

569
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,040
- Yeah, of course. 
- Is that all right? Cheers, mate. 

570
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,360
Try and pour it in and see if they notice! 

571
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,280
Yeah, who knows, I might have reinvented Mary Berry's recipe! 

572
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,680
MEL: Bakers, you've got ten minutes left on your technical tarts! 

573
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,480
Ten on the treacle technical tarts. 

574
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,480
To be quite honest I've got not a clue 

575
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,280
whether that's done or whether that's not. 

576
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,440
Easy, tiger! 

577
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,280
There she blows. 

578
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,360
This just looks like the cat's been sick on. 

579
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,920
There's one minute, bakers! Just a minute left! 

580
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,560
Ow! 

581
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,000
Release the tart! 

582
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,440
Woo-hoo! 

583
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,960
OK, bakers, time's up! 

584
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,040
Well, I think it's under-baked. 

585
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,200
It's judgment time... 

586
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,240
..and Mary and Paul have no idea whose tart is whose. 

587
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,560
Well, they look pretty good, don't they? 

588
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,920
- Shall we start from this side? 
- Start from there. 
- This one looks all right. 

589
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,840
- Mmm-hmm. 
- Quite a strong bake, isn't it? 

590
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,160
Can really taste the lemon in there. 

591
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,200
Nice consistency, thin pastry, good lattice and a nice glaze on top. 

592
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,600
OK, we'll move onto this one. 

593
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,400
It looks quite bland on the top, doesn't it? 

594
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,920
- Nice even bake. 
- It's got a nicer bake. 

595
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,280
It's essential to get the bottom crust thin 

596
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,760
otherwise you won't get it cooked through. 

597
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,080
That one has been overworked. It's a little bit thick on the outside. 

598
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,160
Nice thin lattice on that one. It's a nice colour on that one as well. 

599
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,800
Colour's good and they've glazed it too. 

600
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,280
Got a little bit of a soggy bottom in the middle, but it's thin pastry. 

601
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,440
Nice, crisp, short pastry. Not overworked. 

602
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,000
Lattice on that isn't too bad, though the filling 

603
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,440
looks like it's been boiled slightly. 

604
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,360
It looks quite dry, doesn't it, on the very top but...good bake. 

605
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,520
Nice short pastry. It's good. 

606
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,160
This one looks a little bit more higgledy-piggledy. 

607
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:49,800
- Not quite so even, the lattice. 
- Yeah. Bottom's just about done. 

608
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,920
Even so, it's a short, crunchy pastry. 

609
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,640
Shall we move onto this one? 

610
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,560
The lattice is one of the better lattices. 

611
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,200
The actual syrup mixture is a little bit pale. 

612
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,960
Yeah, well, it's down to the bake, isn't it? It's very thin, this one. 

613
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,520
Towards the centre, slightly under-baked. 

614
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,960
Someone's done a little twist 

615
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,320
and haven't bothered to lattice it, just laid it on the top. 

616
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,040
We wanted you to do it, intertwining it. 

617
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,680
And this is just five pieces that way, five pieces the other way. 

618
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,280
Nice short pastry. Flavour's absolutely fine. 

619
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,080
This one is quite different 

620
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,600
and not actually following the pattern that we asked. 

621
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,560
It's not interwoven at all. 

622
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,200
It's very thin on the bottom, which is good. 

623
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,920
The sides are quite thick again. 

624
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,160
This has got an interlocking pastry, but it just looks a bit messy. 

625
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,600
It's a bit heavy for the amount of filling. 

626
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,560
It's quite rubbery, that one. 

627
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,160
The filling hasn't been mixed in properly. 

628
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,520
Maybe just a little bit heavy on the breadcrumbs. 

629
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,320
OK, we'll move onto the final one. It's quite an even bake. 

630
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,240
- And a good lattice. 
- Lattice isn't too bad at all. 

631
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,480
It's quite thick. 

632
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,840
- It's cloyey.
- Cloyey! 
- Cloyey.
- New word.
- New word. 

633
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,400
When it is like that, it means just a few more breadcrumbs 

634
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,160
have got in there. 

635
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,360
'But whose tarts tower above the rest, 

636
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,840
'and which bakers have failed to pass Mary's technical challenge?' 

637
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,440
- That's good pastry. 
- Bit of a soggy bottom. 

638
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,400
This has been extremely difficult. 

639
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,880
In fact, one of the most difficult ones that we've had to do 

640
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,680
because they're all very similar, so we've been very nit-picking. 

641
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,360
And we're going to start from the person who was last. 

642
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,480
In 10th place is this one. 

643
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,400
The mixture was just far too thick. 

644
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,520
Number nine is this one. 

645
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,160
And again, it was a little bit cloyey, the actual mixture. 

646
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,400
Number eight is this one. 

647
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,560
The design-work on the top, obviously, was a bit lazy 

648
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,320
because it wasn't interlocking. 

649
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,200
'Stuart's quick fix sees him sneak into seventh. 

650
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,680
'John's soggy bottom has him sitting in sixth. 

651
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,000
'Ryan is fifth. 

652
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,960
'After a disappointing signature bake, Victoria's fourth place 

653
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,720
'could buy her some breathing space going into the final day. 

654
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,280
'And in third place, another solid performance from Cathryn.' 

655
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,280
And at number two, not bad, quite thin. Interlocking not bad. 

656
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,760
- Keep your lines straight, but the pastry was well baked.
- Thank you. 

657
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,680
And at number one, we had lovely thin pastry, 

658
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,840
very good texture and flavour. You're number one. 

659
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,080
APPLAUSE 

660
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,240
Erm, I'm pretty stunned, actually. That's amazing. 

661
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:46,120
I managed to not come last, which was quite amazing really. 

662
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,040
I'm really, really cross with myself. 

663
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,600
Really cross, cos I should have made more effort to plait it properly, 

664
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,520
and I didn't cos I thought it looked good as it was, and it didn't. 

665
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,440
I can't believe I've actually cried. 

666
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,560
It's ridiculous. It's a bloody treacle tart! 

667
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,080
'One pastry challenge remaining. 

668
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,440
'In just a few hours, Mary and Paul will decide on the new Star Baker 

669
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,920
'and who will be on their way home.' 

670
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,360
Paul, Mary, who's impressed you this weekend so far? 

671
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,360
Well, I really enjoyed Sarah-Jane's... 

672
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,600
Bananas. 

673
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,120
- ..bananas!
- I thought James' with the lavender worked particularly well. 

674
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,960
Brendan, who's done so well up till now, 

675
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,960
and if you remember his tarte tatin, he was disappointed and so were we. 

676
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,720
And when you came to Victoria's with figs, 

677
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,760
it was not exciting to look at. 

678
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,720
It didn't tempt me, I didn't want to try it. 

679
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,640
- I think Stuart.
- He's a name that's often mentioned at this moment. 

680
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,240
He's been in the bottom two every week. 

681
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,240
Every week. I think you have to put him in there. 

682
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,920
And Manisha, she had such trouble with her caramel. 

683
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,160
- She came last in the technical. 
- You marked her last. 

684
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,000
So we're heading into a very interesting showstopper day. 

685
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,600
It's all on the showstopper. 

686
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,920
Hello, hot stuffs! Today, Day Two and the Showstopper Challenge. 

687
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,760
What we're looking for today is one large designer fruit tart. 

688
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,080
Easy! 

689
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,200
But you've got to make it as ornate and elaborate as you can. 

690
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,520
Now, the choice of pastry, filling and fruit topping 

691
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,920
are all entirely up to you, 

692
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,000
but Mary and Paul are looking for a tart 

693
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,080
which is fit for a window display, a top patisserie, for example. 

694
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,520
You've got three hours to fashion this tart of all tarts, 

695
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,760
- so on your marks... 
- Get set.
- Bake. 

696
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,720
'This is the ultimate test. It's not just about the baker's pastry skills 

697
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,120
'and flair with flavours. 

698
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,840
'They now also have to prove that they have the patissier's vision 

699
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,960
'to design a spectacular show-stopping tart.' 

700
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,320
We are on-the-edge bakers. It feels quite tense in here this morning. 

701
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,800
There's quite an atmosphere. 

702
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,080
'The bakers start their tart by making sweet short-crust pastry, 

703
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,200
'but adding sugar to dough stops the gluten from becoming elastic, 

704
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,680
'making it notoriously difficult to handle.' 

705
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,600
This bake's got sort of fairly tricky elements. 

706
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,720
It's just making sure that everything's set, 

707
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,480
cos if it's not set it'll just all ooze out 

708
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,560
and won't be very nice really. 

709
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,840
'Stuart hopes to put his technical slip-up behind him 

710
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,240
'with a triple-layered chocolate tart 

711
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,800
'which includes a fresh raspberry jelly.' 

712
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,280
Let's not beat around the bush. 

713
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,360
You've been struggling for a couple of weeks. 

714
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:39,200
- Yeah, I know.
- And this I think has got to be your masterpiece. 

715
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,400
- Mmm-hmm.
- And where are the macadamia nuts coming? 

716
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,440
That's going to be in the crunch layer, 

717
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,440
so it's going to be... I'll turn it into a praline, 

718
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,360
then mixing it with a brown sugar crumble and some fortune cookies. 

719
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,720
- Can I look at one of those fortune cookies?
- You may. I've got enough. 

720
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,880
They're not difficult to get out. This is your classic fortune cookie, 

721
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,200
- then you break it.
- Oh, right. 
- Like that, you snap it. 

722
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,440
And it says, "Speaking is silver, listening is gold." There you go. 

723
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,400
Good luck. 

724
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,320
My most difficult part is my pastry. 

725
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,840
It's got lots of sugar in it, 

726
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,440
so it's really soft and it's quite hard to work with. 

727
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,400
Half of it's just gone on the floor. I'll clear that up in a minute. 

728
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,800
'Cathryn is the only baker not creating a round tart. 

729
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,120
'Her rectangular showstopper will have a pistachio sweet-crust pastry, 

730
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,880
'filled with fresh lemon cream.' 

731
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,840
I'm sensing there's a bit of stress going on behind those eyes. 

732
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,840
- What are we talking? 
- It's worry behind the eyes today. 

733
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:51,400
- What's happening?
- Maybe what I've done is a bit simple slash ordinary. 

734
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,040
This is your third bake-off. You're doing extremely well. 

735
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,000
You've had no major disasters. 

736
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,560
Do you feel somewhere in there that there's some confidence on the brew? 

737
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:06,160
Every time they say something nice, I get a little bit more confident. 

738
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,040
But I can't shake how nervous I am. 

739
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,600
D'you know what? My dad always told this to me. 

740
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,040
If I was doing an exam, really, really nervous... 

741
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,600
Don't say pretend they're naked! 

742
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,120
- Pretend they're naked. 
- I knew you were going to say that. 

743
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,520
That'll make it so much worse. 

744
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,800
Pretend Hollywood and Berry are fully in the buff. 

745
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,560
That will help, seriously. 

746
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,200
Exactly, seriously! 

747
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,800
'Overworking sweet pastry risks creating a rubbery texture. 

748
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,440
'Once rested, rolling out has to happen quickly and accurately. 

749
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,840
'Re-rolling after a mistake will create a tough and chewy pastry.' 

750
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,320
It's good to use a small piece of soft pastry 

751
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,560
rather than your fingers. You're dealing here against metal, 

752
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,400
and it's very easy to pierce the pastry or tear it. 

753
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,560
'Brendan's showstopper will see blackberries, nectarines 

754
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,080
'and dragon fruit combined with vanilla creme patissiere, 

755
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,720
rosemary-scented mascarpone cream and an elderflower glaze. 

756
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:17,520
I particularly want to regain my ranking and my position, 

757
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,480
having had two poor-quality bakes yesterday, 

758
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,160
which wasn't a pleasant experience, 

759
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,280
but I will today design a tart that will look stunning. 

760
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,840
'Getting the duration right for the blind bake is crucial. 

761
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,000
'The pastry's so thin, it can turn from under to overcooked in seconds.' 

762
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,280
'Victoria failed to impress with her heavily flavoured signature bake. 

763
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,320
'The showstopper could be her last chance to get the balance right.' 

764
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,560
I don't want to do too many flavours. 

765
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,200
I'd sooner do a few right, I think. 

766
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,760
'She's making a tropical fruit tart, 

767
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,880
'made with a macadamia nut praline, topped with a lime glaze.' 

768
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,120
What's your base going to be? Is it a basic sweet pastry? 

769
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:13,800
It's a short pastry which I'm... I'm adding, erm, black pepper to, 

770
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,480
because I would quite like a warmth from the pastry. 

771
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,280
You're into your peppercorns! 

772
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,880
You've a lot of different aspects, and a lot of combinations. 

773
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,480
Let's just hope that it works well. 

774
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,800
Bakers, you might not believe this. You are over halfway. 

775
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,040
Put the wind up 'em. 

776
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,720
I've overworked it slightly, so...it's very crumbly 

777
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,640
and it shouldn't be like that. 

778
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,440
I'm just waiting for it to cool down before I pour the filling in, 

779
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,400
but I'm worried that it's cracked a little bit 

780
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,000
and the filling might get underneath. 

781
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,320
But James doesn't just have his pastry case in the oven. 

782
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,120
Well, this is a flavour combo that I first had in Paris, 

783
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,560
and I was so blown away by the combo that I thought 

784
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,840
I had to bring it up here at some point in the bake-off. 

785
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,280
James' macarons will decorate his rose, 

786
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,600
lychee and raspberry creme mascarpone tart. 

787
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,960
- How many macarons do you need? 
- Erm...not as many as that. 

788
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,040
A wee bit over, actually. Not entirely happy. 

789
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,800
Oh, they're delicious. 

790
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,800
Mmm. Maybe this one because it's got a tail. 

791
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,960
I don't think you want Mary to see that. 

792
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,400
- No, Mary, that one did not exist. 
- That's a genetic mutation. 

793
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,160
It's gone now. 

794
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,480
'While their pastry cases cool, 

795
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,160
'the bakers have to focus on preparing their fruit.' 

796
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,160
When you're looking at French patisserie and stuff, 

797
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,400
it is quite often quite simple things. 

798
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:01,360
It does tend to be one fruit and just one cream underneath. 

799
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,280
But just done to look amazing. No pressure at all. 

800
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,840
Sarah-Jane's French apple tart features a frangipane on top 

801
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,920
of a secret ingredient straight out of her grandmother's cookbook. 

802
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,760
But with a kick she'd probably approve of. 

803
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,520
This is homemade jam. 

804
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,120
It's blackberries, some apple 

805
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,320
and a few tablespoons of Cassis in the end. 

806
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,600
Just gives a really different colour, I think, to the... 

807
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,040
otherwise the tart is quite white, cos it's all quite similar colours, 

808
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,400
but it just adds a nice layer of colour and flavour as well. 

809
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,120
Whilst Sarah-Jane has made an almond frangipane filling for her tart, 

810
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,480
most bakers have opted for a French classic. 

811
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:51,160
What I'm making is creme patissiere, which is French egg custard. 

812
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,000
And you must keep it moving because it will curdle otherwise. 

813
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,200
I'm just waiting for the creme patissiere to cool down, 

814
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,240
so while that's cooling, I've got everything ready. 

815
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,000
All the components are ready. 

816
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,040
Just need to pop everything in. 

817
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,280
Manisha's rum and tropical fruit tart 

818
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,560
will see blackberries and pineapples sit on her creme patissiere. 

819
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,480
But, between that and her coconut-flavoured pastry, 

820
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,880
she's created a layer of coconut sponge 

821
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,920
and she's going even further to secure her place in the competition. 

822
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,720
In this pot, I'm making 

823
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,920
the glaze to go on top 

824
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,560
of my tropical tart. 

825
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,840
I've added apricot jam, with some rum - 

826
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,360
to bring out the coconut flavour. 

827
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,840
Bakers, you have ten minutes before I get my hands on your fruity tarts. 

828
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,840
OK. 

829
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,560
Bakers, time's up. "Tartageddon" is nigh. 

830
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,240
Move away from the tarts. 

831
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,280
'The ten bakers have done all they can. 

832
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,120
'But only nine can make it through, 

833
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,120
'and be in with a chance of winning The Great British Bake Off.' 

834
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:32,520
- Looks good, doesn't it?
- I'd have liked to have seen more colour on the pineapple. 

835
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,880
Even if you'd used the blowtorch. 

836
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,200
- It's baked, but it's wet.
- Yeah. 

837
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,920
The texture of the frangipane, 

838
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,000
it's a little as though it's curdled slightly. 

839
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,720
- That apple and coconut is gorgeous.
- It's a lovely flavour. 

840
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,440
Thank you very much. 

841
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,200
I'm a bit unsure about the colour of this pastry. 

842
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,480
A lot of water coming out of that fruit. 

843
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,680
It's quite wet, right underneath, as well. It's damp. 

844
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,960
Slight soggy bottom, there. 

845
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,920
You put, I think, the grated rind of about four limes in there, didn't you? 

846
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,920
- Yes.
- Very, very lime-y. 

847
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,000
I think the flavours you picked to go with it are not strong enough 

848
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,520
to fight any form of lime. 

849
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,320
The fact that the lime "creme pat" that's underneath 

850
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,240
is quite loose and quite sour, 

851
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,840
I think it's all fighting. 

852
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,120
OK. 

853
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,960
You've gone to town. I like the little macaroons on the top. They're tricky to make. 

854
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,920
It's a nice colour. 

855
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,920
And it's a nice depth. 

856
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,720
Good, strong bake. 

857
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,680
This "creme pat" on the top has held reasonably well, as well. 

858
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,160
I love that! 

859
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,760
HE LAUGHS 

860
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,560
That's like a Turkish Delight. 

861
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,200
- Tastes like a rose cream. 
- It's lovely. 

862
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,760
I have never had a rose-flavoured tart before. 

863
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,000
- Well done.
- Thank you very much. 
- Well done, James. 

864
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,400
It's crispy. 

865
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,320
A nice, thin base. 

866
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,560
- It's a rubbery base. 
- I think the base could do 

867
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,800
with a little more cooking. 

868
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,840
I think that pastry's been handled a little too much. 

869
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,200
A very professional-looking look. 

870
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,480
The way that's been set out takes time, and I think it looks great. 

871
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,240
It looks like jewels. 

872
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,720
That pastry is absolutely delicious, 

873
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,840
and it isn't too sweet for me, either, 

874
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,200
because you've got it so thin. 

875
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,880
It looks lovely, in a different shape. 

876
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,440
We've had all round ones. We have one that's oblong. 

877
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,200
Very regimented. Very Parisian in its look. 

878
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,640
Nice colour on the side. 

879
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,840
How's the base? 

880
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,680
It's very greasy, 

881
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,240
but it seems to be baked. 

882
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,840
- The base actually looks a bit buttery, doesn't it?
- it does. 

883
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,720
But a nice, thin layer of pastry. Let's see how it tastes. 

884
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,960
I could do with a little bit more flavour 

885
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,520
in the actual cream. 

886
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,000
Cream probably needs a little bit of attention, 

887
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,200
but it's good and it's solid. The base is very good. 

888
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,280
Thank you. 

889
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,080
I love the two-tone of colours. 

890
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,560
The base looks pretty well done, as well. 

891
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,480
You've certainly been original. 

892
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,120
We like people to be original. 

893
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,440
I've never had a tart 

894
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,480
with a layer of sponge. 

895
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,880
It's got a good bake on it. 

896
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,640
- Nice pastry. 
- Pastry-tastic.
- Crumbly. 

897
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,800
I think you've ticked most of the boxes, to be honest. 

898
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,960
Even the sponge is good. 

899
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,840
I think that's just delicious. 

900
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,400
Thank you. 

901
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,880
What a picture. 

902
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,640
I think it looks great. It's a platter of fruit. 

903
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,160
It's something we've never seen before 

904
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,640
with these very attractive Florentines around the outside. 

905
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,640
It's got a nice bake underneath. 

906
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,680
The whole combination is nice. 

907
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,480
The creme patissiere could have been a little but thicker. 

908
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,720
It tastes cooked-through. 

909
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,920
It just needs to be a little more solid. 

910
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,720
It looks good. 

911
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,880
It looks very good. 

912
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,080
The colour on the side looks pretty good, as well. 

913
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,120
The pastry sounds crisp. 

914
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,080
It's got a good bake on it, underneath. 

915
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,400
Sarah-Jane, you've kept the apple crisp, 

916
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,160
which is really nice, and the almond flavour's coming through, too. 

917
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,280
- I've enjoyed that.
- Thank you! 

918
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,400
It's very attractive. The colour on it looks pretty good, as well. 

919
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,040
Look at that. Coming out, you can see all the layers on it. 

920
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,880
- How about the bottom?
- Good base. 

921
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,600
I can see this in the front of a patisserie window. 

922
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,560
- Very clever.
- I like that.
- Mm! 

923
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,560
There's so many textures going on in there. 

924
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,200
You have the sharpness coming through the fruit, as well. 

925
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,920
Very clever, 

926
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,760
- and very original.
- Excellent. 

927
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,200
- Well done.
- Thank you. 

928
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,840
Thanks, Stuart. 

929
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,080
I think I've done enough 

930
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,280
to get through to next week, hopefully. 

931
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,280
But I wouldn't like to say who's up, really. 

932
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,120
I think it's too close to call this week. 

933
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,000
Well, I'm going home. 

934
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,840
I think that's very clear. 

935
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,280
It's a cumulative thing, 

936
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,120
and I've been under pressure this weekend, particularly. 

937
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,800
That's not very nice. 

938
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,440
I've experienced stuff that the first few weekend, I didn't. 

939
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,480
Very much conscious of it this weekend. 

940
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,320
So I'm not going to let that happen to me again. 

941
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,960
So it's getting past this weekend. 

942
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,800
Who stands out this weekend 

943
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,360
as possibly in the frame for Star Baker? 

944
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,400
James had a wonderfully-flavoured tart. 

945
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,640
And he bothered with those little, tiny macaroons. 

946
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,800
It was just perfection, wasn't it? 

947
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,480
For me, Stuart is up there. 

948
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,280
What a turnaround! 

949
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,920
I know. His flavour combinations have been fantastic. 

950
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,320
He promised us the three layers of chocolates. 

951
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,840
When you cut through, there it was. 

952
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,880
If we look at the other end of the spectrum, and who's possibly facing the chop? 

953
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,120
I would say Victoria's in trouble. 

954
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,440
She did get a thin pastry, but it wasn't quite cooked. 

955
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,280
The creme patissiere is all over the place, 

956
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,000
and the fruits she chose were very, very wet. 

957
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,200
Brendan had a bit of a disaster on his tarte tatin. 

958
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,480
Today, he has picked it up. Does that qualify him to be in the bottom? 

959
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,680
Maybe, because all the others are very good, as well. 

960
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,160
Obviously, Brendan's had a very troublesome first day. 

961
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,080
Victoria's had a very troublesome second. 

962
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,760
- Good luck, Paul and Mary.
- We'll be there to do your dirty work, as per...
- Always. 

963
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,760
Bakers, Mary and Paul have made their deliberations, 

964
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,520
and they've decided who this week's Star Baker's going to be. 

965
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,880
And they're giving it this week to the person who's displayed 

966
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,280
superb flavours across the board, 

967
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,080
fine technical skills, 

968
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,040
and the best tank top in the room - it's James. 

969
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,600
APPLAUSE 

970
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,880
Well done. 

971
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,320
But for one person, of course, every week, 

972
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:34,720
the Bake Off journey has to end. 

973
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,720
And the person who's going to be leaving us this week is... 

974
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,640
..Victoria. 

975
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,280
We'll be sorry for you to go, Victoria. 

976
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,200
Well done. 

977
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,280
Don't say that. 

978
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,800
It's absolutely the right decision that my bake was not up to scratch, 

979
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,840
and that's how it's judged. 

980
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,400
Yeah, no case to answer. "Guilty, M'lud". 

981
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,960
Of course I will keep baking. 

982
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,560
It's a wonderful way of giving, 

983
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,960
and of working with the creative side of yourself. 

984
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,920
And anyone can do it. 

985
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,640
It's great to get to live to fight another day. 

986
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,520
Onwards and upwards, and all that. 

987
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,960
This weekend has been a trigger now, a catalyst 

988
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,440
to open up the competition. 

989
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,960
So it will be very interesting 

990
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,080
to see now how it will evolve. 

991
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,720
It was worth the trip to Paris, don't you think? 

992
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,720
To get Star Baker! 

993
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,800
HE LAUGHS 

994
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,080
Victoria's gone home today, 

995
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,760
and I think she's brilliant. 

996
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,280
If she's gone before me, I owe it to myself 

997
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,960
and to Victoria, to be a bit more confident. 

998
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,680
And not be so scared. 

999
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,000
The dread about next week starts already. 

1000
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,680
And it's just like, "Ah!" 

1001
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,000
Next time... 

1002
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,480
Hello? Are you in there? 

1003
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,480
..we're ready for desserts. 

1004
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,040
I'm going to booze it up 

1005
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,800
- and get Mary a bit sloshed. 
- That's tricky. 

1006
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,920
With spectacular... 

1007
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,440
- INDISTINCT 
- ..signature tortes. 

1008
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,680
It looks like a chocolate breeze block. 

1009
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,560
'Mary's toughest technical challenge yet.' 

1010
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,880
Creme caramel. 

1011
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,400
Oh, my days! 

1012
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,800
It's got a good wobble. 

1013
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,800
'And quadruple-layered...' 

1014
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,160
- Look at that! 
- '..show-stopping meringues.' 

1015
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,360
- Are you feeling up for it today? 
- Yeah. 

1016
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,040
- 'Whose desserts will dazzle?' 
- That's quite something. 

1017
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,120
- 'And whose will be...?' 
- Oh, that's hot! 

1018
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,760
'..their final course?' 

1019
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,920
It's leaning that way. 

1020
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,880
