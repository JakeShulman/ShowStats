00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,000
The Great British Bake Off sees 12 home bakers battle it out 

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,240
over cakes, pies and pastries 

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,560
in a bid to become Britain's best amateur baker. 

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,400
Some rise to the challenge, while other fall apart. 

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,600
- HE SIGHS 
- It's a shame. It's a shame. 

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,560
Technically, this is absolutely rubbish. 

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,000
Recovery from disaster. 

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,600
Each week the bakers are asked to complete three challenges. 

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,560
But the most feared by far, and the most revealing, 

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,800
is the Technical Challenge. 

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,400
- Who knows how it's going to go?
- It's like the worst nightmare, this is. 

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Always a closely-guarded secret, 

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,120
success in this challenge relies upon their baking skills... 

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,720
Oh, my days. 

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,880
..experience... 

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,560
The number of decades I've been baking, it does help. 

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,840
..and intuition in the context of a classic recipe. 

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,720
I do know what it should be like in the end. Just not entirely sure 

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,600
how to get it to that point. 

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,000
But now it's the turn of Bake Off's very own judges to get baking themselves. 

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,520
Queen of cakes Mary Berry and master baker Paul Hollywood 

22
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,800
have so far been judging other people's efforts. 

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,000
- Good flavour.
- Looks like a chocolate breeze block. 

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,320
That is absolutely delicious! 

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,800
- I think it works.
- It's different. I don't know that I like it. 

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,880
To say it was a disaster would be a humiliation to disaster. 

27
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,200
Go on, say something nice! 

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,160
But now it's time for Mary and Paul to show off their skills 

29
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,520
and make all of the Technical Challenges, 

30
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,520
so that you can get the perfect result every time. 

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,200
Well, Paul and I have had it pretty good, just judging. 

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,520
But now it's all on us. So we've got to show you exactly what to do, 

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,680
step by step, to get even better results than the bakers. 

34
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,000
Paul will be making his rum babas, a light and fragile sponge dessert 

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,280
soaked in rich rum syrup, 

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,200
a mind-boggling eight-strand plaited loaf 

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,160
with its perfectly golden crust, 

38
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,960
and Paul's traditional hand-raised pie, 

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,920
packed full of tender chicken and juicy apricots. 

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,880
Mary brings us her recipe for treacle tart - a real classic 

41
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,520
with a perfect balance of thin pastry and decadent filling, 

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,160
and creme caramel, 

43
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,680
a freestanding sweet custard with a layer of moist caramel on top. 

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,240
And finally, if you've ever wondered how to shape dough, 

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,320
pipe meringue or create spun sugar, Mary and Paul will show you 

46
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,400
how to get the perfect results with a series of quick tips. 

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,200
Finally, a chance for Mary and I to get baking ourselves 

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,640
in the Bake Off tent and show you guys exactly how to do 

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,840
all the Technical Challenges properly. Game on. 

50
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,920
This year, the Bake Off began with cakes. 

51
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,400
The bakers started by creating colourful concoctions 

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,840
with their own take on the upside-down cake, 

53
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,360
before wowing the judges with their ingenious 

54
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,200
and technically difficult hidden design cakes. 

55
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,800
But what caught many of them out was Paul's half cake/half dough 

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,280
Technical Challenge. 

57
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,880
Bakers, adopt the brace position. 

58
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,480
This is your first Technical Challenge. 

59
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,080
This recipe is for a classic, 1970s' staple. 

60
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,040
Rum baba. 

61
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,760
Four perfect babas with cream in the middle 

62
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,880
- and perfectly-sliced fruit on top. On your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake! 

63
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,760
I'm quite afraid of this recipe. 

64
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,600
I've got no idea what I'm doing! 

65
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,680
Rum babas are cakes made from leavened dough, 

66
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,440
a highly enriched batter that is soaked in rum syrup, 

67
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,480
decorated with fruit and Chantilly cream. 

68
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,720
Rum baba. It's that strange hybrid between cake and bread. 

69
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,360
But it's something very special. But a little bit tricky. 

70
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,440
- Very tricky.
- But you'll show us that it's easy. 

71
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,760
Let's just see how easy it is, shall we? 

72
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,160
What would you like? Can I do any weighing for you? 

73
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,200
Can you weigh up 220 grams of strong flour, please? 

74
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,280
Sometimes plain flour is used for rum baba, isn't it? 

75
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,920
I tend to use strong flour because it's quite a wet dough, 

76
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,960
and so strong flour will give you that spring in the oven 

77
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,040
- to give you that dome on the top of the rum baba itself.
- That's it. 

78
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,800
Thank you. Could you also give me seven grams of fast-action yeast? 

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,280
Half a teaspoon of salt. 

80
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,160
Keep the salt and yeast separate in the bowl to start with 

81
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,320
as the salt will slow the development of the yeast. 

82
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,640
Measure out 50g of sugar, 2 medium eggs and 70ml milk. 

83
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,680
Add a little bit of milk to start with. 

84
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,480
- I want to develop the dough first before I add that butter.
- Right. 

85
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,920
So just start stirring in the mixtures, 

86
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,880
just taking it from round the side, more milk. 

87
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,760
So carry on working this dough, 

88
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:22,520
manipulating it, building up that gluten and moving the bowl around, 

89
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,240
keeping it active. 

90
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,280
There's always a danger of giving up too soon, 

91
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,360
but the batter needs as much air in as possible to create the sponge. 

92
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,640
And what you could start doing now, please, Mary, 

93
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,880
is begin to add the butter. 

94
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,720
Measure out 100 grams of softened butter. 

95
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,760
It's important to develop the dough fully before adding the fat, 

96
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,320
as fat slows the gluten development and makes it weaker, 

97
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,200
which is why enriched dough is soft and fragile. 

98
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,120
Rub that butter into that dough. 

99
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,880
This is the most important stage of making rum baba. 

100
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,920
See, it's getting more gelatinous now, more stringy. 

101
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,920
You have to incorporate all the butter properly - 

102
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,680
otherwise you'll get streaks in there. 

103
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,880
Now you are extremely strong and have got very good arms, 

104
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,240
could I please do this in a machine with a dough-hook? 

105
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,840
Course you could. Just take your time, it'll take about ten minutes, 

106
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,840
so imagine how long it'll take doing this. 

107
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,000
I thoroughly recommend using a dough-hook, then. 

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,640
It's beginning to come now. 

109
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,720
- It's lovely and shiny, not a lump in sight.
- No. 

110
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,600
What I'm going to do is coat that in a little bit of flour now. 

111
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,400
You get moisture molecules sitting on the outside of the dough/batter, 

112
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,920
and the moisture is soaked up by the flour 

113
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,960
and it just helps you to manipulate it a little bit easier. 

114
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,320
Give it a light coating in the flour. 

115
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,480
So you're taking in quite a bit of extra flour 

116
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,440
- to the flour that you've used. 
- I'm coating the outside of it. 

117
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,480
- Any moisture it's holding there... 
- Right. 

118
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,680
..will soak up. 

119
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,040
At that stage, I'd leave that for nature to take its course. 

120
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,520
A good hour in a warm environment and that will start to grow. 

121
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,840
- Can I just feel it?
- Yeah, of course. 

122
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,040
Now when you press it, the indentation stays there. 

123
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,360
- That's right.
- And when you've proved it, it should spring back. 

124
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,040
It will, but don't forget, that's a very soft batter. 

125
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,400
If you have risen batter and put your finger in it, it'll still leave an indentation, it could collapse. 

126
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,920
- It's very delicate.
- Right. 

127
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,400
Cover in clingfilm and leave for an hour to double in size. 

128
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,120
OK, Mary, here are four rum baba moulds. 

129
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,880
Would you mind brushing the inside with plenty of butter 

130
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,200
and then just a light coating of sugar, please. 

131
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,720
Now, this is the mix which has been resting for about an hour. 

132
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,480
It's sort of about double the amount. 

133
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,520
It's quite aerated already, and it's perfect for going straight 

134
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,240
into a piping bag and then we'll pipe that into the bowls themselves. 

135
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,480
I've well buttered that. I don't have to do it in the middle, do I? 

136
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,800
You can a little, 

137
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,480
cos I'm trying to get a little bit of a lip on it as well. 

138
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,120
Well, I'll make sure I do it well. Otherwise I'll get blamed! 

139
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,200
- Yes, you will.
- Right. And then sugar? 

140
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,120
Just a light dusting of sugar, please. 

141
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,840
Sugaring the moulds helps get these fragile cakes out of the tins once baked. 

142
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,360
But for some in the Bake Off, it didn't go to plan. 

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,800
- I've ruined it completely. Do you know what I've done?
- What? 

144
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,920
- Used salt in my tin.
- Oh, no! 
- I want to go home! 

145
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,600
Oh, I've messed up big-style here. 

146
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,640
It's going to put me in the bad books from the start, 

147
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,880
it's going to..."John's the boy who messed around with salt." 

148
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,080
So, you do that. 

149
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,560
That's sugar. 

150
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,960
- It'll give it a nice crust, won't it? If you have sugar.
- Absolutely. 

151
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,080
And all you do is pipe round the mould, about halfway up. 

152
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,920
Because that will grow. Snip it off, and there you have it. 

153
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,800
Join the rest up with your fingers. 

154
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,200
- And another one.
- Keeping up with Hollywood is quite difficult. 

155
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,960
Come on, Mary, hurry up. Thank you. And again, pipe the last one in. 

156
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,120
There you go. 

157
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,480
So they need to rise for about an hour in a warm place, 

158
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,800
and then they're going to be baked. You must cover it, 

159
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,520
because what you don't want, at this stage, is for the top to get a skin on. 

160
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,400
So you take a polythene bag, prop it up with a couple of spice jars 

161
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,480
or something and tuck the rest underneath. 

162
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,920
What we've got, though, is proving drawers, 

163
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,480
essentially a humidifier. Set it around 32, 33 degrees. 

164
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,840
These are going to go in there, and we'll leave them to rise 

165
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,560
and have a look in about an hour. 

166
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
- Wow!
- Yes. 

167
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,240
- Here we go.
- They look absolutely beautiful. Really well risen. 

168
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,440
And you were quite wise to suggest that it was buttered all over, 

169
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
because it's just come over the rim. 

170
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,560
That'll give it the little ridge that you put your cream on. 

171
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,840
But you see it, it's soft, it's delicate. 

172
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,280
You've got to be really careful at this stage. 

173
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,200
It's an enriched dough, any form of knocking will drop that 

174
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,400
and it'll lose its dome. 

175
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,280
So these are going to go straight into the oven now. 

176
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,560
160 fan, 180 non-fan, 

177
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,920
for about 20-25 minutes until they're beautiful and golden brown. 

178
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,120
Because of the amount of butter and sugar in this enriched dough, 

179
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,040
the tops can colour quickly and the babas may look baked 

180
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,480
before they're actually done inside. 

181
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,120
Here's hoping. 

182
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,560
If over-baked, the babas will become crispy on the outside. 

183
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,640
Under-baked, and these delicate sponges will collapse. 

184
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,240
A challenge the bakers found tricky. 

185
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,960
Oh. It's all gone wrong. 

186
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,600
They're all stuck to the dish. 

187
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,280
- They look a bit of all right. 
- Nice and golden brown. 

188
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,960
They've released quite well. 

189
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,880
Do it while it's warm, because the butter's still warm in the mould. 

190
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,120
And actually they'll come out easier. 

191
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,040
What I've got to make now is a syrup 

192
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,640
to go with this and let it soak in while it's still warm. 

193
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,840
For the syrup, measure out 250g of caster sugar, 20ml of hot water 

194
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,840
- and then add the rum.
- How many tablespoons?
- Three to four.
- One... 

195
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,760
- two, three.
- You call that a tablespoon?!
- Absolutely perfect. 

196
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,120
- Don't want it too weak. 
- Mary, that's brutal!
- No, just right. 

197
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,320
OK, all I'm going to do is heat this up now. 

198
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,760
I can feel that that's actually all dissolved in there 

199
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,880
- amongst your half a bottle of rum! 
- You might need a little more rum... 

200
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,360
We're not putting any more rum in there! Let me have a look and see. 

201
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,080
Actually, it's pretty good. 

202
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,240
So we've got warm babas, hot sauce and on it goes. 

203
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,440
If you find that it's not soaking in, we can turn it upside-down. 

204
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,320
It's to ensure that it's equally spread. 

205
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,880
If that was a normal cake mixture 

206
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,200
- and you tried to turn it upside-down, it would all break apart.
- Yeah. 

207
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,760
This is quite strong, with big holes in, 

208
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,520
and so it will take being turned over. 

209
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,160
The other way of doing it is to tilt it, take more syrup, 

210
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,160
then just drizzle it over the top again. 

211
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,720
- And then you serve it while everything is very, very cold.
- Yes. 

212
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,960
Allow the hot babas to completely soak up all of the rum syrup. 

213
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,200
Then put them in the fridge to cool for about half an hour, 

214
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,000
so that they are ready to decorate. 

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,600
It's lovely. It's just the right amount of rum. 

216
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,080
Now I've got some cream in here, whipped up some vanilla 

217
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,320
and some icing sugar. 

218
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,160
All I'm going to do is pipe around, keeping it in the centre. 

219
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,200
After that, fruit on the top. 

220
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,880
Lovely. Now, the finishing touch... 

221
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,440
- ..is some icing sugar.
- This is my most useful thing in the kitchen. 

222
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,600
You know when you burn the side of an apple pie - I'm sure you never do - 

223
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,240
you put an awful lot on that side and a little less on the others. 

224
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,520
But these are perfect. 

225
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,280
And, of course, once you've done it, because they're moist, they do... 

226
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,520
- Soak it back up. How simple is that? 
- I think they look wonderful. 

227
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,160
A rum baba made by hand. Piped cream in the middle, fruit on top, 

228
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,400
covered in a stock syrup with rum inside it. 

229
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,240
That's how simple it should've been. 

230
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,280
Well, this was the first of our Technical Challenges, Mary. 

231
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,720
And obviously there was a bit of a Rumgate between me and yourself. 

232
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,680
So the only way to see if the rum was the right level is to eat it. 

233
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,760
Absolutely. 

234
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,240
This is the strange hybrid between cake and bread, 

235
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,920
never been seen before on Bake Off. 

236
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,840
And that's what caught them out, I think. 

237
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,760
- Enough rum?
- Well, I wouldn't mind a little bit more.
- Unbelievable. 

238
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,960
It's moist, it's sharp with the fruit, 

239
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,240
you've got that beautiful Chantilly cream inside. 

240
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,480
- It's unusual and it's different, and it's so good.
- Mm. 

241
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,640
Mm! Lovely. 

242
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,880
And now Paul's top tip to perfectly pipe with cream. 

243
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,440
When I first started in a bakery, my first chore was to pipe cream 

244
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,880
into either doughnuts or the top of the cookies. 

245
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,720
Very simple rule - get a good bag, 

246
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,160
either a cloth one or a plastic one like this, 

247
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,200
and make sure it's filled to the top and you seal the top, 

248
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,360
either with fingers, by twisting it, or just with your hands. 

249
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Put a bit of tension on there. Just so the cream comes right to the end. 

250
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,840
So you start... 

251
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,720
and then turn, turn, turn, release. 

252
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,360
That inside any bun, or on top of any cake, looks fantastic. 

253
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,480
The next ones you can do, hold your piping bag straight down, 

254
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,240
pipe till you're happy you've got enough, release. 

255
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,240
Then you can do any swirl. So again, start from the top, 

256
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,680
keeping the tension all the way. 

257
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,360
And so the whole thing is neatly done with equal pressure. 

258
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,560
That's the key when icing or piping. 

259
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,120
Week two of the Bake Off saw the bakers doing battle with bread. 

260
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,760
They were asked to make signature flatbreads... 

261
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,880
..and a show-stopping batch of bagels. 

262
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,440
But it was Paul's tricky Technical Challenge 

263
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,600
that really got the bakers in a twist. 

264
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,320
We are calling this the Rapunzel Challenge. 

265
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:37,240
We're asking you today to prepare and bake an eight-strand plaited loaf. 

266
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,920
We want each plait to be an even width and length, 

267
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:47,040
- with a nice golden crust and a soft crumb.
- On your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake! 

268
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,200
Time to experiment a bit. 

269
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,160
I didn't even know there was such a thing. 

270
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,240
A complicated eight-strand plaited loaf, 

271
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,200
with a crunchy golden crust and dense crumb structure. 

272
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,320
Eight-strand plait. To me, it seems a very difficult choice. 

273
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,280
That's precisely why I chose it. 

274
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,560
I wanted to see them sweat a little bit on the Technical Challenge, 

275
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,520
and it was nice to choose something even a baker would find difficult. 

276
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,000
So to start with, we need to make the base dough. 

277
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,160
So can you put 500g of flour into there for me, please? 

278
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,080
- And strong flour, of course? 
- Strong flour. High in gluten. 

279
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,760
That gives you the elasticity and strength 

280
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,680
to hold the bubbles inside as the bread grows. 

281
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,600
Seven grams of fast-action yeast, please. 

282
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,560
If you can only get the fresh yeast, then you need to add 12 grams. 

283
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,320
Give me 10 grams of salt. 

284
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,080
That goes in there to the other side of the bowl. Why do we do that? 

285
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,200
Because if you put it over the other side with the yeast, 

286
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,800
- it slows down the action. Am I getting there?
- You are. 

287
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,920
Come and work with me any time. OK, the next ingredient I'm adding - 

288
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,720
- olive oil.
- Does that have to be a good olive oil? 

289
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,400
You don't need to use virgin olive oil, just any olive oil is fine. 

290
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,600
Now, I'm adding about 320ml of water. 

291
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,720
Cool water is absolutely fine. 

292
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,320
Start off by adding half of it. 

293
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,120
Fingers like a mixer. 

294
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,880
- In you go. And then just turn it.
- So often bread recipes say warm water. 

295
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,120
- You were saying cool.
- If you want to use warm water, that's fine. 

296
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,240
It just speeds it up. 

297
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,520
And the thing about making bread is, the slower the prove, 

298
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,880
the more intense the flavour, the better the fermentation. 

299
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,240
All I've done there is crushed the dough together 

300
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,600
and you end up with a soft dough like that. 

301
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
That still needs work. 

302
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,840
Olive oil onto the bench, pop your dough into that. 

303
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,560
And just coat the outside with the olive oil. 

304
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,600
One thing I've learnt from you is not to add too much extra flour, 

305
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,800
and also having a nice oily surface, it's much easier to work. 

306
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,560
If I add lots and lots of flour to that, it'll take forever to rise, 

307
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,080
air holes will be very tight, and it'll end up like a house brick. 

308
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,800
So as I work it more, I begin to speed up. 

309
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,240
And you do this for about ten minutes. 

310
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,960
But it is important at the very beginning 

311
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,840
to have that fairly wet dough, 

312
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,000
which looked as though it would stick to the table 

313
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,680
and everything else, but because of that olive oil, it's completely free. 

314
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,840
It's very difficult for bakers to teach people how to knead. 

315
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,600
Everyone's got their own way. I hold the bottom... 

316
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,880
grab the top. You've initially stretched it. Then you roll it up. 

317
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,120
So you're in, you've ripped and then you're rolling up. 

318
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,600
And that's the motion I've used for many, many years, and it works. 

319
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,480
Everything's been incorporated in. It's got a lovely shine from the olive oil. 

320
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,720
It's quite stretchy and resistant as well. 

321
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,360
So pop that in a bowl, 

322
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,920
clingfilm that and leave that for about an hour. 

323
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,360
- Here it is then, Mary. 
- That's fully proved. 

324
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,680
It couldn't get any more proved. It'd be climbing out the bowl and trying to get off the table. 

325
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,280
- It will carry on growing.
- So the aim is to get it to double its size? 

326
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,800
At least double in size. 

327
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,200
And you can see it, it's just full of air. 

328
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,280
Sinking back in, you've burst all the bubbles and it starts to drop. 

329
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,440
Those little creases there are actually signs that the bread 

330
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,880
is risen and then fallen back. 

331
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,360
We call it "the drop". 

332
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,160
If you saw your dough like that, you'd instantly go, "It's fully proved." 

333
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,760
It's exhausted all the flour and it's fallen back 

334
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,880
- and created creases. 
- So the next move? 

335
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,200
The next move is to tip it out, just stretch it slightly. 

336
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,880
Bang it down a little bit. 

337
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,480
Now you want to divide it into eight, so find roughly halfway. 

338
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,600
And then divide that again. 

339
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,120
And then once you've got your pieces, lay them out. 

340
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,280
That one's a bit small. That one's a bit big. 

341
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,960
This bit was quite tricky. 

342
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,200
And I know the bakers will struggle with this. 

343
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,400
The bakers were asked to divide the dough 

344
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,120
into eight equal portions, which some took more literally than others. 

345
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,200
- It's 106 grams per portion. 
- OK, that's pretty precise! 

346
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,080
- So this is per strand, is it? 
- Per strand.
- To make the octopus. 

347
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,880
The eight strands must be evenly rolled out, 

348
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,600
or else you'll get an uneven, lopsided plait. 

349
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,520
I haven't done any of the kind of fancy weighing out, 

350
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,560
but I figure if they're all roughly the same thickness... 

351
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,360
But I might've completely stuffed it up. 

352
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,480
You've got to roll each piece out nice and neat and equal. 

353
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,720
You start in the middle, rolling it. 

354
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,760
And then you roll out. 

355
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,680
You put quite a bit of weight on your hands and you can see, 

356
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,360
I open and flare my fingers like that. 

357
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,560
And sometimes you'll hit an air pocket like that one there. 

358
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,400
That will affect the growth, you see, if it wasn't knocked out. 

359
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,520
You can see, on the bench, there's not a lot of flour, is there? 

360
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,040
You want that dough to stick. 

361
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,480
If there's too much flour, it just skids. 

362
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,760
- You need that bit of adhesion, don't you?
- Yeah, you need that bit of bite. 

363
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,440
So we roll it out. Now, you went something like that, did you? 

364
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,400
- I'm not doing karate on it, Mary.
- I have every sympathy with our bakers. 

365
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,480
- I can tell you, it's pretty difficult.
- It's hard. 

366
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,720
Roll out eight equal strands. And then you're ready to assemble. 

367
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,720
So all I'm going to do is line them up, like an octopus. 

368
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,400
I think if I were doing it, it would stay a bit like an octopus! 

369
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,080
- HE LAUGHS 
- OK. 

370
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,680
Gather the ends and then just tuck them together and tack them 

371
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,360
to the table. So you've got something to plait with. 

372
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,320
That's your starting point there. 

373
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,200
Each one of them is numbered. One, two, three, four, five, six, 

374
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,960
seven, eight. What you've got to be careful of, 

375
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,840
and no matter who you are, you will need the sequence to do this. 

376
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,000
If you haven't got the sequence, you won't get it. 

377
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,240
And even with the sequence to follow, 

378
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,480
the bakers found themselves in a bit of a knot. 

379
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,440
"Eight over five, until the dough's ended." 

380
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,560
I'm feeling like this could go horribly, horribly wrong. 

381
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,360
"Eight under seven, over one..." 

382
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,400
One, two, three, four, five. 

383
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,240
"Eight over five. 

384
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,200
"Two under three..." 

385
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,600
That looks a bit weird. But how can I mess that up? 

386
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,720
Eight... 

387
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,800
Then eight over five, so one, two, three, four, five. That goes there. 

388
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,080
Eight under seven, 

389
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,400
and then seven... 

390
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,920
over one. I've got no idea what I'm doing. 

391
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,800
Six over one. 

392
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,560
Three over eight. Three over eight... 

393
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,760
What I love about this particular challenge is that after a while, 

394
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,120
everyone sounds like Rain Man. Eight over five, five over two. 

395
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,640
Oh, dear! 

396
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,840
MEL: This is like the Generation Game gone bad. 

397
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,040
Seven over one. Is that seven? I've no idea. Seven over one. 

398
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,120
I'm going again. I'm going again. 

399
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,800
OK, so what you've got is eight strands laid out. 

400
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,600
As you move it, you then recount. 

401
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,480
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. 

402
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,560
The first move is the only move you don't repeat. So you start off... 

403
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,680
- Eight under seven over one.
- OK. 

404
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,760
So when we count again, that's one, two, three, four, five, six, 

405
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,920
seven, eight. 

406
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,880
The next move is your start of your four sequence. 

407
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,360
So two goes under three 

408
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,040
and over eight. 

409
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,440
- Simple.
- Simple. 

410
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,400
And then one over four. 

411
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,040
The next move is seven under six over one. 

412
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,480
And then eight over five. 

413
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,840
- There.
- I'm keeping very quiet so as not to muddle you. 

414
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,720
There's two under three over eight, and you repeat that till you finish. 

415
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,600
Seven under six over one. Eight over five. 

416
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,640
Two under three over eight. One over four... 

417
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,440
Paul might've been doing this for years, 

418
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,040
but to make this complicated plait yourself, make sure you have 

419
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,360
the sequence written down in front of you before you start. 

420
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,680
All the way... 

421
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,080
down to the bottom. 

422
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,760
HE CHUCKLES 

423
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,360
Like that. Squeeze. 

424
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,720
There you have it. 

425
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,080
An eight-strand plait. Very simple...ish. 

426
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,000
That is magnificent. 

427
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,240
- Easy.
- Easy peasy. 
- Easy peasy. I mean... 

428
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,920
- How old were you when you first did your first one like this?
- 16. 

429
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,480
What you're looking for, you've got your line running across the top, 

430
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,000
you've got the two either side and then you roll it over. 

431
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,640
There's your sequence again. 

432
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,240
You need to prove that up. 

433
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,480
Allow the dough to prove again for about an hour, 

434
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,560
although the plaited structure will prevent the dough from rising 

435
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,440
as much as it might normally. 

436
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,320
Once it's ready, brush it with egg wash and a pinch of salt, 

437
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,440
to help form the crunchy golden crust. 

438
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,840
Bake in the oven for at least 25 minutes, 

439
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,240
until the dough is fully baked inside. 

440
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,120
Paul might make it look simple, 

441
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,400
but the bakers got themselves in a bit of a twist over this challenge. 

442
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,240
Oh, go in! 

443
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,240
There's no turning back now. 

444
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,920
Technically this is absolutely rubbish. 

445
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,280
It's just... There is nothing good about this loaf. 

446
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,680
- Is it stuck, Sarah Jane?
- I don't know if it's right or not. 

447
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,880
I kind of freestyled a bit towards the end. 

448
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,680
Oh, my giddy aunt. 

449
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,600
- SUE:
- What's wrong with that? 

450
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,600
Cooked! Yay! 

451
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,840
- OK, Mary, let's have a look.
- Well, that's got the wow factor, for me. 

452
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:38,520
- It looks amazing.
- If you knock it, it's a loud, hollow sound. 

453
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,600
And if you lift underneath, I've got asbestos fingers, 

454
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,240
you've got all the beautiful colours underneath - the golden brown - 

455
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,880
and you can see where it's all interlaced all the way down. 

456
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,360
- And it smells divine. 
- Can I have a taste then?
- No.
- Why not? 

457
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,640
You want to leave it for at least half an hour, 

458
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,040
three quarters of an hour. 

459
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,840
The inside of is still going to be very, very hot. 

460
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,200
- Even the very, sort of, end? 
- Leave it alone! 

461
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,200
- Now it's time to eat the plaited loaf.
- Seems a long wait.
- Absolutely. 

462
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,000
- You want the crust?
- Definitely. That just looks wonderful. 

463
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,960
Look at the structure inside. 

464
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,560
How even it is, considering it's all been plaited individually. 

465
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,440
It's such a beautiful loaf. Once it's baked and it's cooled, 

466
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,040
which is the best way of keeping bread? 

467
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,600
I just wrap it up in loose paper and put it in a breadbin. 

468
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,840
- Not in a fridge?
- No, no. If you put it in a fridge, they stale three times quicker. 

469
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,840
The cool air in the fridge draws all the moisture out from it. 

470
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,080
I love it cos it's crusty. 

471
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,200
- It tastes like bread ought to taste like.
- Mm. 

472
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,560
Really lovely. 

473
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,160
And now Paul's top tip for shaping a bloomer perfectly. 

474
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,960
You start with your dough, which has been rising for about an hour. 

475
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,160
From the bowl, in the flour, just flatten out the dough gently. 

476
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,200
This is to distribute the air pockets that have started growing 

477
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,880
and to make them equal inside the dough. Grab the ends of the dough 

478
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,920
and fold them over each other. 

479
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,640
Knuckles in, and you can hear the air pockets 

480
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,560
bursting as you use your knuckles. Top of the dough, 

481
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,360
fold over. Fingers go over. And use your thumbs. 

482
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,760
You roll the dough up, keeping it nice and tight. 

483
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,160
One quick roll. Tuck the ends to neaten it up. 

484
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,720
Make sure you get one line underneath, because the bread will be weak where the line is, 

485
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,440
and if it's right at the bottom of the loaf, it'll mean the loaf 

486
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,080
will bloom up naturally without splitting at the side. 

487
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,520
Onto a baking tray, leave that to rise for about an hour. 

488
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,800
Then get a knife, cut - and there you have it. The perfect bloomer. 

489
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,600
Week three of the Bake Off tested the bakers' knowledge of tarts. 

490
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,800
From fruity tarte tatins... 

491
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,920
..to spectacular designer fruit tarts, 

492
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,920
the bakers battled and baked to impress the judges. 

493
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,360
But it was an old, classic tart recipe that Mary chose to test them on 

494
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,080
in the Technical Challenge. 

495
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,520
This week the Technical Challenge is going to be... 

496
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,320
a treacle tart with a woven lattice top. 

497
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,680
OK, this is Mary Berry's recipe, OK? No pressure! 

498
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,640
It's got to be perfect. So... 

499
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,040
- On your marks.
- And get set.
- Bake! 

500
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,840
I've never made a treacle tart ever. 

501
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,360
So... I've probably seen one, 

502
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,240
but I've never like, "Oh, treacle tart - I need one." 

503
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,440
Mary Berry's recipe - such pressure. It's got to be perfect. 

504
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,160
A traditional English dessert made with shortcrust pastry 

505
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,600
and a thick filling of golden syrup, breadcrumbs, and lemon juice. 

506
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,000
Why did you pick this as the Technical Challenge? 

507
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,600
I chose treacle tart because it's pretty tricky to make. 

508
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,680
But it's an absolute British classic. 

509
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,920
First off, put a heavy baking sheet in a pre-heated oven 

510
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,320
at 200 degrees, 180 fan. 

511
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,280
When you come to bake the tart, this will bake the pastry base perfectly. 

512
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,040
With cake tins at home, you forget the exact size. 

513
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,240
So I always, with a waterproof pen, write "7 inches, 18 centimetres" 

514
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,040
and you know exactly where you are. 

515
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,280
Seriously, that's what you do? You go round your whole kitchen... 

516
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,840
All my cake tins. 

517
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,040
- Next time I'm at yours I'm going to check all your tins.
- Most of them. 

518
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,600
But it does help. So there it is, ready for action. 

519
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,440
- We've got to make the pastry first. So 250 grams of plain flour.
- 250. 

520
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,600
130 grams of butter. 

521
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,120
And then just process that until it becomes like breadcrumbs. 

522
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,040
Then I'm going to add just over three tablespoonfuls of water. 

523
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,920
And that is just about right. And off they go. 

524
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,280
That's it. And I'm going to gather those bits up by hand. 

525
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,360
I like doing it by hand, the whole thing, 

526
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,000
- because I feel more in control. 
- I feel very in control with this, 

527
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,560
and I can nip and do other things at the same time. 

528
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,480
I know by the sound when it's done. 

529
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,000
You're a professional baker and I'm a home cook. 

530
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,360
- So I'm just going to knead that, first of all.
- Can I feel that? 

531
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,120
- I mean, it's still quite short, isn't it?
- That's what I want. 

532
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,640
I want it short, but I don't want it to all break apart 

533
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,800
when I roll it out. 

534
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,360
So that's come together very nicely and I'm just going to chill that. 

535
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,000
It'll be easier to handle. 

536
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,160
Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes to relax the pastry. 

537
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:49,040
Now I'm going to take off 150 grams of that for the lattice. 

538
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,440
Put that to one side, flour the board and then roll it out, 

539
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,080
and I want it to be nice and thin. 

540
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,880
- We do not want a soggy bottom. 
- No, absolutely not. 

541
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,720
So the aim is to keep it fairly round and keep freeing it. 

542
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,200
Still, I want that thinner. Yeah. So, I've got my tin here. 

543
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,400
I take that base and slip that underneath there, 

544
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,560
to the middle, and then fold the sides in, so all the way round. 

545
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,240
And it's very easy to transport it into the middle here. 

546
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,960
And then just flick the sides over. 

547
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,240
So I'm just going to push that in all the way round, 

548
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,920
first of all with my finger like that, pressing it in, 

549
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,080
and then take a little lump of pastry and you press that in, 

550
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,840
keep flouring it like that. All the way round, 

551
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,240
so you get the indentations of the tin. 

552
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,440
That's it. And I'm ready to roll out the lattice. 

553
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,440
Roll out the set-aside pastry for the lattice so that it's very thin 

554
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,040
and big enough to fit over the tart. 

555
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,560
Place on clingfilm and leave in the fridge to chill, 

556
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,600
which will make it easier to cut into strips later. 

557
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,160
Then we'll get on to the filling. 

558
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,160
There's about six slices here of white bread, it's a day-old. 

559
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,600
You can always use the crust, make breadcrumbs of them 

560
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,880
and use them perhaps for cauliflower cheese or something like that. 

561
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,080
- That's perfect.
- Lovely and fine. 

562
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,960
If you use one or two-day-old bread, you'll be able to get it fine. 

563
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,480
If you use really fresh bread, you can't really get it fine. 

564
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,960
For the filling, measure out 400 grams of golden syrup into a pan 

565
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,800
and put on a gentle heat. 

566
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,720
Add the zest and juice of two lemons and fully mix in your breadcrumbs. 

567
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,720
Prick the thin pastry base with a fork 

568
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,800
so that it doesn't rise during baking, 

569
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,360
and pour the smooth treacle filling into the lined pastry case. 

570
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,080
If the mixture looks runny, add a few more breadcrumbs 

571
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,960
until you have a thick, smooth mixture. 

572
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,920
MEL: It's awesome. It looks really, really good. 

573
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,960
It's gone very Krypton Factor, hasn't it? 

574
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,800
I could watch this for hours. 

575
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,360
Agh! 

576
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,000
Let's try that again. 

577
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,760
To make the perfect lattice, 

578
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,680
remove the chilled rolled-out pastry from the fridge and egg wash. 

579
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:32,680
I am going to glaze this now rather than try to do it on the actual tart. 

580
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,960
- That's a nice tip, cos it just stops it going straight into the treacle, doesn't it?
- It does. 

581
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,680
Then wet all the way round the edge there. 

582
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,640
- That's ready for the lattice to stick.
- Yeah. 

583
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,040
I'm not letting it drip down the sides, cos I know 

584
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,960
there's a bit of pastry left that some little person will be making jam tarts. 

585
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,280
So I'm going to cut those strips. 

586
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,120
And you can make them as thin or as wide as you like, 

587
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,600
but I like them fairly thin. 

588
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,720
And you need ten, five across one way 

589
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,760
and five across the other way. 

590
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,800
Carefully line the vertical strips across the tart, 

591
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,120
and weave the horizontal strips through them. 

592
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,880
I'm quite nervous having you looking over the side of me! 

593
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,080
Make sure the strips are longer than the tart tin so that they hang 

594
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,320
over the edge, preventing any shrinkage during baking. 

595
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,120
We want these strips to stick to the pastry, 

596
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,840
and I'm just going to press down gently 

597
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,000
and let the actual tart tin do the cutting. 

598
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,880
Just go round, pushing it down, and I know that all those 

599
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,840
pieces of lattice are sticking to the actual pastry underneath, 

600
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,280
so you can gather all those together into a ball and use them later. 

601
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,640
There we are. 

602
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,960
Bake in the pre-heated oven on the hot baking tray 

603
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,800
for about ten minutes until the pastry has started to colour. 

604
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,800
Then reduce the oven temperature to 180, 160 fan, 

605
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,600
until the pastry is golden and the filling is set. 

606
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,640
Oh! 

607
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,360
This just looks like the cat's been sick on. 

608
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,280
To be quite honest, I've got not a clue whether that's done or not. 

609
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,840
- Your latticework was the neatest one out of all the bakers that did it.
- Do you think I might've won? 

610
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,400
- You might've got through. 
- Number one?
- Maybe. 

611
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,680
Your treacle tart is perfectly baked when it is a rich golden colour 

612
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,600
and the filling is set, not wobbling inside. 

613
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,720
Allow to cool a little so that the pastry edges shrink away from the sides, 

614
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,560
so you can lift it out of its case cleanly. 

615
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,040
Slide the tart off the base of the tin onto your plate, 

616
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,920
and serve warm with a little cream or custard. 

617
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,200
And let's have a look at the bottom. How's that? 

618
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,000
No soggy bottom there, Mary. 

619
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,800
That's because we put it on very, very hot baking sheet 

620
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,120
and we haven't baked it blind, and it's got wafer-thin pastry. 

621
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,160
That's it. 

622
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,120
Now that, as you can see, looks lovely and soft in the middle. 

623
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,880
It looks so good. I mean, that pastry is wafer-thin. 

624
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,840
That's lovely. It's light, beautiful lemons coming through. 

625
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:23,200
And the good thing about this treacle tart is you can make it ahead, 

626
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,560
just serve it warm and it'll keep too, 

627
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,120
so you don't have to eat it all on one day - though perhaps we might! 

628
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,240
- A true classic.
- Mm. 

629
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:39,320
And now Mary's top tip to get cold butter the perfect temperature. 

630
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,000
One of the real problems when you're creaming butter and sugar together 

631
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,480
to make a cake is getting the butter at the right temperature. 

632
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,200
It's nearly always too hard. This is a foolproof way of softening it. 

633
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,000
Here I've got butter. It's very, very cold, straight from the fridge. 

634
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,360
Put those squares into lukewarm water, 

635
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,760
sort of the temperature of a baby's bath, 

636
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,160
and leave it for about ten minutes. 

637
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,920
This now is squidgy and soft. 

638
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,080
Just the temperature for doing a creaming method. 

639
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,400
Get rid of that water. 

640
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,680
And there it is, as soft as can be. 

641
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,040
A simple, simple, foolproof way of doing it, 

642
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,800
and that is absolutely perfect. 

643
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,640
Look how lovely and soft that is. 

644
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,000
Softened butter in no time - a perfect tip ready for cake making. 

645
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,440
Desserts was the battle ground for week four of the Bake Off. 

646
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,080
The bakers created flourless tortes in all shapes and sizes. 

647
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,720
And incredible layered, gravity-defying meringues. 

648
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,520
But despite these elaborate bakes, it was the Technical Challenge that brought on a bit of a wobble. 

649
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,560
Today's Technical Challenge is the mainstay of French cuisine - 

650
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,160
creme caramel. You've got to master a baked custard and a caramel, 

651
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,440
and you've got to turn it out and give it a nice wobble we're looking for. 

652
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,360
- On your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake. 

653
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,000
This was a popular thing in the'70s, like Black Forest gateau. 

654
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,680
Quite a lot could go wrong, so it is actually quite difficult. 

655
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,600
I do know what it should be like in the end, 

656
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,520
just not entirely sure how to get it to that point. 

657
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,440
A freestanding sweet, baked custard 

658
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,120
topped with a layer of moist caramel. Easy when you know how, 

659
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,200
but the technique is notoriously hit-or-miss. 

660
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,320
First of all, you need to make the caramel that goes in the bottom of the dish. 

661
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,240
Measure out 160 grams of granulated sugar 

662
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:40,120
and place into a stainless steel pan, with six tablespoons of water. 

663
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,080
One, two, three... 

664
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,800
Avoid using a non-stick pan, because the mixture will crystallise. 

665
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,680
I can still feel a little bit of grit at the bottom there. 

666
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,160
Once all the sugar has dissolved, do NOT stir it, 

667
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,560
but wait for the mixture to become clear and boil rapidly, 

668
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,080
- watching it the whole time.
- Don't be tempted to put a spoon in there, 

669
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:06,160
because it will immediately cloud over and begin to crystallize. 

670
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,640
When sugar is heated, 

671
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,320
each crystal is broken down into carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. 

672
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,040
The hydrogen and oxygen re-combine to form water, which evaporates, 

673
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,840
leaving the carbon, which becomes caramel. 

674
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,240
- Now you can smell the caramel. 
- You can. 

675
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,360
And notice it was making that rapid noise. It's now quietened down. 

676
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,640
Don't let it get too dark. Have everything ready. 

677
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,400
And I have not buttered the ramekins. 

678
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,640
If you butter the ramekins first, what happens is you pour 

679
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,840
the caramel in and it'll go cloudy and crystallise. 

680
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,760
Then just gently pour that into each one. 

681
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,480
Now this will cool very rapidly, won't it? 

682
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,200
Start to solidify within minutes. 

683
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,280
And this is very, very hot. 

684
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,320
And it is very important to be aware how hot this is. 

685
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,920
- Don't have any children around you at this time.
- No. 

686
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,440
- Do you know how I get the sugar off? 
- How? 

687
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,000
Put water into that, you just fill it halfway full, boil it, 

688
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,080
and within 30 seconds your pan's clean. I'll pop that one over there. 

689
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,600
That's a jolly good tip. 

690
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,120
So these are a sort of deep caramel colour, 

691
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,080
and we'll leave those just on the top here. 

692
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,000
They don't need to go in the fridge. And they will set. 

693
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,440
Then I will butter them. 

694
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,400
Making caramel correctly is something that can really impress. 

695
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,640
But the bakers didn't find it as easy as Mary makes it look. 

696
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,160
Panicking here a little bit now. 

697
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,640
Oh, bloody hell. Is that burnt? 

698
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,440
- Let's smell it.
- It smells burnt. 
- That's burnt. 

699
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,280
Even though it's really tempting to stir this, 

700
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,360
it really is best to leave it alone. 

701
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,600
I'm dicing with death here. 

702
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,520
So, we now make the custard. Four medium eggs. 

703
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,280
- 25 grams of sugar, perhaps you can get that ready for me.
- Caster sugar? 

704
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,440
Caster sugar. 

705
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,720
And then I'm going to add some vanilla extract. 

706
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,000
Now, there are all sorts of kinds of vanilla you can do for this. 

707
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,720
You can infuse a vanilla pod in the milk, you can use vanilla paste. 

708
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,680
I prefer not to use essence. It's not as good. 

709
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,760
This is extract, and I'm going to add a good teaspoonful 

710
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,560
and that will give a good flavour. 

711
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,840
So I'm going to beat that together until it's smooth. 

712
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,400
Gently warm 600ml of full-fat milk in a pan. 

713
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,080
When I put my finger in and I can't keep it in, that is the temperature. 

714
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:38,080
- That's perfect. I could just hold it in there.
- OK. 

715
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,520
Right, so just beat like that. 

716
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,840
For custard, it is important to add the hot milk to the cold mixture, 

717
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,680
and NOT the other way around. 

718
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,800
We poured the hot milk onto the eggs. That's the right way round. 

719
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,360
If you do it the other way round, the egg would overcook. 

720
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,680
Cos you're putting egg mixture into a hot pan 

721
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,400
and it would start to scramble it. 

722
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,280
To make sure there are no lumps in your custard, 

723
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,680
you can strain it. 

724
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,160
Once the caramel has completely set, butter the ramekins generously. 

725
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,080
The one thing that I like about caramel custard 

726
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,560
is you can make it ahead, 

727
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,320
and it is greatly improved by making ahead. 

728
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,600
And we're going to cook them bain-marie, 

729
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:24,160
and bain-marie simply means that you're cooking it in boiling water. 

730
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,160
Divide the custard equally between the ramekins 

731
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,920
before adding the boiling water for the bain-marie. 

732
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,280
Whatever heat the oven reaches, the water can never go above 100 degrees, 

733
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,320
and the evaporating water simultaneously cools it. 

734
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,360
The heat is dispersed evenly by the water, 

735
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,960
baking the custard gently so that it is perfectly tender. 

736
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,680
It's important that when you're putting the water in, 

737
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,560
it doesn't go into the custard, because it would weaken it. 

738
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,920
Put them in a pre-heated oven at 150 degrees, 130 fan. 

739
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,080
We're aiming to get a custard that doesn't have a bubble in sight. 

740
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,760
If there are bubbles all the way round, 

741
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,040
it means that the custard is tough, 

742
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,680
and we don't want a tough custard. 

743
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,320
Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until the custard is perfectly set, 

744
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,240
with just a very slight wobble. 

745
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:21,080
Not good. So I'm hoping if it starts cooling, it should set a tiny bit. 

746
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,280
SHE GIGGLES 

747
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,320
It came out in one piece and it's got a caramel on the top! 

748
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,240
No, I... Oh. 

749
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,120
- We're going to smash porcelain! 
- Oh, my goodness. 

750
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,800
There's little bits of broken china on there and everything! 

751
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,720
Yeah, that's what I thought. Yeah... Pfft. 

752
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,680
- HE CHUCKLES 
- Oh, well. 

753
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,680
Right, let's see if they're done. 

754
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,960
So they should not be coloured. 

755
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,640
I'm just going to test whether, in the very centre here, there's a wobble. 

756
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,960
- Now can you see there's a wobble? 
- Definitely, Mary.
- That's right. 

757
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,800
Leave them in the water just for another ten minutes or so, 

758
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,080
and they will just gently go on cooking right through to the middle. 

759
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,400
Let them get stone cold in the fridge, 

760
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:25,000
and then the custard makes the hard caramel underneath soft, 

761
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,120
so that when you turn it out you get that lovely runny sauce. 

762
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,000
Now, we've made six. 

763
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,040
You could easily have made just one in a two-pint dish. 

764
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,240
Again you would do it in the bain-marie, but it would take 

765
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,720
about 10 or 15 minutes to cook. 

766
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,160
Once cool, leave them to set in the fridge 

767
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,440
for as long as you can, preferably overnight, 

768
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,120
so that the custard absorbs the caramel flavour 

769
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,680
and they are ready to be turned out. 

770
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,880
Tip them forward 

771
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,480
so that the weight of the custard will drop down a bit. 

772
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,120
- Can you see the caramel coming up? 
- Yeah. 

773
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:05,120
We've been all the way round, and then you simply take the plate, 

774
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:10,160
like that, and I'm going to give that a really good shake, first of all. 

775
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,160
- And then over there, another shake. 
- Do you want me to have a go? 

776
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,640
No. Because I would be at home without you, or without my Paul, 

777
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,040
and you have to be able to cope on your own. 

778
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,960
I'm going to make quite sure it's coming out. 

779
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,280
I heard a plop - I thought I did. So let's just lift that up. 

780
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,640
There it is. Now that is a perfect colour. 

781
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,600
It is sort of a deep caramel. 

782
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:40,320
- If it's looking any darker than that, it will be bitter.
- Yeah. 

783
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,840
And that's just lovely, and you've got your custard. 

784
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,960
Now, if you do that too soon, the very top here becomes pale. 

785
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,680
It loses its colour. 

786
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,760
So by all means loosen them, but turn them out just before. 

787
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,400
I think they look absolutely fantastic, Mary. 

788
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,840
Absolutely perfect, and I can't wait to try one. 

789
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,400
That's delicious. It melts in the mouth. 

790
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,640
It's smooth, texture's superb. 

791
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,760
Caramel's excellent. 

792
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,680
- Not a bubble in sight. They're gorgeous.
- Mm! 

793
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,200
And now Paul's top tip for perfectly spun sugar. 

794
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,960
All I've got in a pan is sugar, 

795
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,560
it's been caramelised with a little bit of water. 

796
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,960
Make sure you've got a good lump of sugar on the end of your whisk. Get a steel ready. 

797
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,080
And quickly, as it cools it crystallises. 

798
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,880
This is basically candy floss. 

799
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,840
And you end up with a nest of sugar 

800
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,960
that on top of any gateau looks fantastic. 

801
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,320
Now, what I've got here is a bowl that I brushed with olive oil. 

802
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,960
I'm just going to draw a line across the top. 

803
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,680
You need to do this a few times to build up the strength of the cage itself. 

804
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,200
And you can see now, the structure's beginning to form. 

805
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,480
So just crack the bottom to release the caramel. 

806
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,880
And there you have it - a sugar basket that will make 

807
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,200
any pudding or cake look a million dollars. 

808
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,360
It was halfway through the Bake Off that our bakers faced Pie Week. 

809
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:36,000
They pitted themselves against puff pastry for their Signature Wellingtons, 

810
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,080
and went all Stars and Stripes with their show-stopping American pies. 

811
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,000
But this week saw another of Paul's Technical Challenges, 

812
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,480
when he set them the notoriously tricky hand-raised pie. 

813
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,520
For today's Technical Challenge, we would like you 

814
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,240
to make a hand-raised pie. 

815
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,720
Now, this is made with a hot water crust, which is the kind of pastry 

816
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:02,120
that basically defies all the rules of pastry making. 

817
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,920
Hand-raised pies were actually used by Sweeney Todd 

818
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,440
and Mrs Lovett to conceal their victims, 

819
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:13,120
so Paul and Mary better watch out if the judging is unfavourable. 

820
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,840
- On your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake. 

821
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:25,120
"And mix in with the flour until it comes together and turn out." 

822
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,080
Shall I just stick it...? I'm going to stick it all in. 

823
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,120
I'm just, I'm totally perplexed by this. 

824
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,240
HE SIGHS 

825
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,720
It's going to be an interesting experience. 

826
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,320
A savoury pie made with hand-raised hot water crust pastry 

827
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,520
and a juicy chicken, bacon and apricot layered filling. 

828
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,720
It's basically a hand-raised pie around a dolly, 

829
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,040
just like this, crimped round the outside, egg washed and baked. 

830
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,880
Pretty straightforward, you think. 

831
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,360
But the difficulty is making the hot water crust pastry itself, 

832
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,920
because you're using boiling hot water. 

833
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,760
For the pastry, weigh out 50g of butter, 

834
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,440
200g of plain flour, and 40g of strong flour. 

835
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:18,120
The strong flour gives it that little bit of strength to keep the walls of the pie straight. 

836
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,640
Then use your hand to crumb the mixture together into breadcrumbs. 

837
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,440
Weigh out 60g of lard and leave it to melt in 100ml of hot water. 

838
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,640
Add to the flour mixture and mix together with a wooden spoon. 

839
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,440
It comes together quite nicely. It's still quite warm. 

840
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,520
It feels lovely, but it needs a little bit of manipulation. 

841
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:44,360
Traditionally, a hot water crust pastry was made of flour and lard, wasn't it? 

842
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,840
You've added a bit of butter to it. Is that for flavour? 

843
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,040
I think it adds to it, gives it a lovely flavour. And colour. 

844
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,280
And it's very warm, have you felt that? 

845
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,720
- It's lovely. It's a totally different pastry, isn't it?
- Absolutely, yeah. 

846
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,880
The more you work this, two things happen. It becomes more glutinous. 

847
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,800
But secondly, it begins to cool. 

848
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,960
When it becomes cool, it becomes very rigid. 

849
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,400
So what we want to do is try and manipulate this around a dolly now, 

850
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,120
- while it's soft.
- Right. 

851
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,680
Just cut that in half. Just take off a little bit. 

852
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,800
I'm going to make two little balls, for the lids. 

853
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,840
- A very small amount for the lid, a thin lid?
- Yes. 

854
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,240
It's only basically the width of the dolly. 

855
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,400
I'm going to rub some oil into the side of the dolly. 

856
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,400
I haven't got one at home and when I make this sort of thing, 

857
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,280
- I use a jam jar. 
- Yeah, you can use a jam jar. 

858
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:38,120
The advantage of using a jam jar is, when you come to get it off, 

859
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,480
you can put very hot water in the jam jar, and that 

860
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,800
melts the lard a bit and it pulls it out quickly. 

861
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,440
That's a good idea, actually. 

862
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,920
- Just gently shape the bottom of it. 
- Mm-hm. 

863
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,560
Place your dolly into the middle 

864
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,400
and then draw it up the side of the dolly itself. 

865
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,480
Making sure we haven't got too much of a fat bottom. 

866
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,120
I'm trying to make it look as neat as possible 

867
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,800
and as equal as you can up the side. 

868
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,400
Shape the pastry evenly around both of the dollies 

869
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,600
and place them on a non-stick baking tray. Trim the top of the pastry 

870
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,400
so there's a smooth, neat edge to the top of the pies. 

871
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,440
Don't make them too tall, as the walls could sag during baking. 

872
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,840
All I'm doing is flattening down the lid. 

873
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,680
You can use your fingers or roll it out with a rolling pin, then cut it with a cutter. 

874
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,000
As long as it's roughly the size of the dolly. 

875
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,120
I'm going to pop these in the fridge as they are. 

876
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,040
- Shall I do that for you? 
- Yes, please, Mary. 

877
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,800
What's it worth not to drop it? 

878
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,320
- HE CHUCKLES 
- You'll do them again! 

879
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,560
But dropping them was the least of our bakers' worries. 

880
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,080
I've never seen one of these before in my whole life. 

881
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,560
I don't know if this is right. 

882
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,240
This is going to go really wrong. 

883
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,200
I'm going to start again. 

884
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,400
How do you get these things off? 

885
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:04,000
So far, we are all in exactly the same predicament. 

886
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,160
Nobody was able to get their pastry off of the dollies. 

887
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,920
MEL: Is knocking going to help? 

888
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,320
- Why use a stupid thing like this? 
- Must be a technique. 

889
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,840
- This can't be right.
- It's out! It's out, it's out, it's out! 

890
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,720
Right, how did I do that just then? 

891
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,640
Sometimes they can be a bit tricky to get out. 

892
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:38,320
I would've thought it's quite a good idea to put clingfilm firmly round the dolly before you put it in. 

893
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:42,040
Absolutely. You can use clingfilm, you can use paper, baking parchment. 

894
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:46,360
Very neat. And nice thin pastry there, you've got. 

895
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:50,440
For the filling, chop up smoked bacon, chicken and dried apricots. 

896
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,680
The amount you need will depend on the height that you've made your pie. 

897
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,640
Make sure you cut the raw meat on a different board 

898
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,040
to the apricots. 

899
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,200
- You're making chicken and bacon.
- Yep. 

900
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,880
- You could make them all sorts of flavours.
- Beef's fantastic. 

901
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,880
Pork and apple works extremely well. 

902
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,920
But as long as you've got them cut up into enough chunky pieces, 

903
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,640
- they'll go well.
- Season with pepper, salt and fresh thyme. 

904
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,680
Oh, there's nothing like fresh thyme. You can grow it in a window box. 

905
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,240
- Is it easy to grow?
- Terribly easy. You can grow it from cuttings 

906
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,320
and it's got such a lovely flavour. 

907
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,360
So we're going to put a line of bacon at the bottom. 

908
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,440
- How many layers are you doing? 
- We're going to do two. 

909
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,760
Make sure it's pushed in right the way down to the sides. 

910
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,680
The next thing to add is chicken, and again, push it all to the walls. 

911
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,120
These are going to be the support of the pie as it's baking 

912
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,320
because it's not in a mould, 

913
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,640
so it's going to need some support from the filling. 

914
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,240
- That'll keep it upright, won't it? 
- Absolutely. 

915
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:51,160
Then add a layer of apricots, and repeat with all three layers 

916
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,280
until the pies are full and compact. 

917
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,120
Now what we have to do... is put our lids on. 

918
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,400
I'm going to cut out a little circle, because when it comes out 

919
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,240
the oven, that's where the gelatine will go inside and set the interior. 

920
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,840
Put the lids onto the pies, making sure that they fit neatly 

921
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:11,080
inside the edges. Crimp the edges to seal them, leaving no gaps 

922
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,560
for the filling to leak out. 

923
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:16,680
Make a gap with your finger and then push with the other one in, 

924
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,440
and then again a gap, and push in. 

925
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,720
Gap and push in. Gap, push in. 

926
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:28,880
Non-meat eaters could use all butter in the pastry if they wanted to, 

927
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,800
and do all sorts of roasted vegetables and things like that. 

928
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,000
Yeah, mushrooms work really well in there. 

929
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,360
You want some form of substance in there to make the pie a proper pie. 

930
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:43,480
Egg wash the top of the pies, as this will bond the walls to the lids 

931
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,760
and give the pastry a lovely golden colour. 

932
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,560
OK, an hour in the oven. 160 fan, 180 non-fan. 

933
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,760
Can't wait. 

934
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,360
Whilst Mary might be looking forward to them, the bakers weren't enjoying 

935
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,720
making the pies anywhere near as much. 

936
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,880
Isn't this the most horrible challenge you've ever done in your life? 

937
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,400
They look absolutely awful. 

938
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,320
Mine do look bad. 

939
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,360
They look a bit of all right. 

940
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:17,040
Final thing to put in there is, of course, the gelatine. 

941
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,400
And what I've got in here is water, vegetable stock cube and gelatine. 

942
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,120
That has to go in while this is hot, because, as it dries, 

943
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,040
it congeals and then solidifies. 

944
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,400
The jelly is crucial, keeping all the layers in place 

945
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,640
by filling the gaps and keeping the pie moist. 

946
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,000
But it's also crucial that the jelly stays inside the pie. 

947
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,920
Please do not leak. 

948
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,320
Stop dripping. 

949
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,480
It's going down and then out the bottom! 

950
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,720
HE SIGHS 

951
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,400
They've been resting overnight, the gelatine's now beautifully set. 

952
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,400
- Here we go. You should see all the layers.
- I'm most excited. 

953
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,400
That is a picture in itself - the apricot, the chicken, the bacon, 

954
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:14,360
all in beautiful proportions and the pastry's crisp all the way through. 

955
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,960
Oh, look, the jelly is absolutely filling every gap. 

956
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,920
Everybody's got to have a go at this. 

957
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,400
Great pastry, easy to make - I think it's a fantastic pie. 

958
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,560
It's a wonderful combination and I'm enjoying every mouthful. 

959
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,360
Five Technical Challenges done and complete, 

960
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:35,040
and we've still got five more to go, which I think get harder and harder. 

961
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,160
This one is a real winner. 

962
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,440
You can say that again, Mary. 

963
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:48,200
Next time, Mary and Paul take on five more of the Technical Challenges that they set the bakers.
