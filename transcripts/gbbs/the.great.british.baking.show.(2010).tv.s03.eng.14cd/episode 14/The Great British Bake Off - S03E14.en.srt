Today, it's the Signature Bake, 

56
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,760
and what we're looking for are flat breads. 

57
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,200
Now these can be tortilla, naan, roti, anything you like. 

58
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,400
You can bake them any way you want. So... 

59
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,480
- On your marks.
- Get set. BOTH: Bake.

63

so if you've ever had Bombay mix it's kind of the same flavour. 

64
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,560
This is traditional Chinese bread. 

65
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,080
I'm making some Italian-style flat breads. 

66
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,520
This is my mum's recipe that I'm using, 

67
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,800
and I'm not changing anything, so hopefully it should still work. 

68
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,160
Fingers crossed. 

69
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,880
Paul's twist on the Signature Flat Bread Challenge is his recipe 

70
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,160
for fresh dough combined with rich camembert and quince jelly. 

71
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,280
I've been making flat breads like this, 

72
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,360
and certainly this technique, for the last... 

73
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,160
- HE EXHALES 
- ..years, a long time. 

74
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,360
Flat breads go back right into history. 

75
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,440
For today's, I'm going to be using yeast, 

76
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,160
you can make it with a sour, 

77
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,560
but I'm going to modernise it by adding camembert and quince. 

78
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,800
Very simple to do, actually, and great for dinner parties. 

79
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,120
Weigh 500 grams of strong white flour into a mixing bowl, 

80
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,680
add 10 grams of salt to one side 

81
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,480
and 7 grams of fast action yeast to the other. 

82
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,400
The yeast is obviously the leavening bit, 

83
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,920
this is the bit that's going to put a bit of air in it 

84
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,800
and give it a bit of punch when you put it on to the skillet to bake it. 

85
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,720
And then a good glug of, it's about 20, 30 grams of olive oil, 

86
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,440
straight in. 

87
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,640
The next thing I'm going to add is my water, 

88
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,560
- a little bit to start with.
- Right. 

89
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,840
Fingers like a mixer, just mix it in, turn the bowl round. 

90
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,080
Could I do that in a mixer? 

91
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,320
You could do it in a mixer, use your dough hook, not a paddle. 

92
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,600
I'm using cold water, most people when they're making doughs 

93
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,760
- would use warm water, you know. 
- Yes, I would. 

94
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,960
But cold water will still rise the bread, it just takes longer 

95
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,360
and it's the length of time that it proves gives you the flavour. 

96
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,760
So a long prove gets the best bread. 

97
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,240
Long prove, more flavour, less prove, less flavour. 

98
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,720
So are you doing it to the same consistency that you would do 

99
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,200
for an ordinary white bread? 

100
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,600
A normal white bread, yeah. 

101
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
That looks about right. 

102
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,560
I've picked up most of the flour now on the bowl. 

103
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,360
Pour some olive oil onto the bench before kneading the dough. 

104
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,040
Don't use flour as it will tighten the dough 

105
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,680
and restrict it from growing. 

106
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,560
What you're trying to do is shape it into some sort of starting position 

107
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,520
and it's nearly there, a bit of pounding. 

108
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,200
When you're making bread, it takes a lot of energy out of you 

109
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,160
- and if you're feeling a bit cross and angry...
- Absolutely. 

110
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,120
..it releases it, but you're feeling all right today. 

111
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,320
No, I feel fine today. 

112
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,040
You knead this for about four or five minutes. 

113
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,080
If you're going to do it by hand, take your time if you want to, 

114
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,840
you can take up to ten minutes, it's literally the weight of your hand 

115
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,600
that's doing it and a little bit of a stretch and then roll up. 

116
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,960
It's a very simple technique, it doesn't take 

117
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,480
a lot of muscle at all, it's just the weight of your arm. 

118
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,400
And then you're looking for a soft consistency like this. 

119
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,920
Yes, still quite sticky. 

120
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,560
Yes, it is, and all you do is, once you've mixed it for a bit, 

121
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,400
five to ten minutes, depending on how fast you're going to go, 

122
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,760
you then place the whole thing back in the bowl, 

123
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,160
get a bit of olive oil in there 

124
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,920
and just leave it to rest for about ten to 15 minutes. 

125
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,040
'But the bakers were just as determined to prove that they 

126
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,080
'could impress Paul with their dough.' 

127
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,520
I'm captivated by your yeast slapping. 

128
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,640
It's very, very easy to overwork dough 

129
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,160
if you use the dough hook on the blender. 

130
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,560
Whereas it's a lot more difficult to do that 

131
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,520
when you're doing it by hand. 

132
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,120
A nice action, by the way. 

133
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,080
- Thank you.
- A very nice action. 
- Cheers. 

134
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,240
Just waiting for everything now, calm before the storm. 

135
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,080
What yeast have you got in there? 

136
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,280
Well, this is my Shetlandic homemade style. 

137
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,920
- Can I have a smell?
- Yeah, go for it. Eight years old, that one. 

138
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,040
- Eight years old.
- No way! 

139
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,080
Yeah, that's...that's nice, that. It's nice and active. 

140
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,120
I'm waiting for the flavours to meld in the roti 

141
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,760
and then it starts the cooking. 

142
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,400
Mary, can you bring that dough for me, please? Thank you. 

143
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,560
That looks well-risen. 

144
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,840
You can see in that short space of time it's risen, 

145
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,040
it's got some air in it, some flour, tip this dough out. 

146
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,680
So why have you changed to flour? 

147
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,760
Because I'm not mixing now, the dough's already done. 

148
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,240
Despite being a flat bread, the dough still needs to prove. 

149
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,880
Although you're going to roll this thing out and put it onto a pan 

150
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,920
and technically fry it to rise it up, 

151
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,320
the bubbles still need to be formed 

152
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,480
and the flavour still needs to be incorporated into the dough. 

153
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,320
Just stretch the dough out 

154
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,040
and just cut it into about roughly 70 gram balls. 

155
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,040
- I think you've done this before. 
- A couple of times. 

156
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,040
I'm making balls because it's easier to roll out a basic shape. 

157
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,040
So 70 grams is going to make quite big ones, isn't it? 

158
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,880
You can do them the size of your frying pan. 

159
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,000
If you've got a big frying pan, make them bigger, 

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,200
if you've got a small frying pan, make them smaller. 

161
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,760
Once your dough is ready, prepare your fillings. 

162
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,720
You can choose almost anything to fill these flat breads, 

163
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,640
but Paul is using camembert and quince. 

164
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,840
I'm just going to take a blob of the camembert and pop it 

165
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,720
inside the dough, just going to take a little bit of the quince jelly. 

166
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,200
And now you've got to make a little parcel, basically, 

167
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,320
by pinching up the sides and pinching it together. 

168
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,480
Once you've got the little parcel, use your rolling pin 

169
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,080
and just gently stretch it out. 

170
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,120
You will get a slight burst as the cheese 

171
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,480
and the quince tries to get out. 

172
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,280
Now, when your pan's nice and hot, 

173
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,800
I always test it with a little flick of flour, 

174
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
to see if it actually goes brown. 

175
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,320
Could you do it in a normal non-stick frying pan? 

176
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,600
Yeah, yeah. Use a little bit of oil. 

177
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,880
No more proving for that like you would with a roll? 

178
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,680
Well, no, it's flat, we proved it in the bowl 

179
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,240
to give it a bulk fermentation to give it flavour. 

180
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,080
What we're doing now is actually forcing the yeast to start to grow, 

181
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,720
it will start to bubble very, very quickly 

182
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,280
because it's on extreme heat. 

183
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,040
- See the bubbles beginning to appear all the way around?
- Yes. 

184
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,840
- All over the top, they're bubbling. 
- It's rising, isn't it? 

185
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,040
- It is.
- If you're going camping and you've got a frying pan, 

186
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,120
you could easily make this sort of bread. 

187
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,680
What fun to do out of doors! 

188
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,000
Yes, absolutely, and the kids love doing this as well. 

189
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,960
It's quite versatile. Put stilton, put grapes, put pecans, 

190
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,320
put mushroom, onions, anything you want, inside these. 

191
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,800
And the range of recipes which the bakers made 

192
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,320
showed just how varied these breads can be. 

193
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,760
That's how it's meant to look, sort of, isn't it? 

194
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,280
If they puff up like they are doing here, then they're cooked, 

195
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,520
the puffing up is key. 

196
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,680
You don't have to make flat breads in a frying pan. 

197
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,640
Many of the bakers did theirs in the oven, 

198
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,400
in all kinds of different ways. 

199
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,440
I'm trying to juggle lots of things, I've got the griddle on the go 

200
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,520
and the pizza stone. 

201
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,000
They're calling you Hot Rocks Brendan. 

202
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,160
It's a bit like, I suppose, the equivalent of our stone bake theory. 

203
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,400
- Stone bake pizza?
- Exactly, there's just an extra quality, isn't there? 

204
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,240
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
- There's an extra taste. 

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,560
The cheese is beginning to cook, the quince is beginning to melt 

206
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,120
and it's beginning to blow bubbles, see, and then steam pours out. 

207
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,280
Smells wonderful. 

208
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,080
As a party food, it works really well because you just chop them 

209
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,640
into lengths and serve them with an aubergine guacamole dip, 

210
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,000
which is one of my favourites because there's actually 

211
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,880
colour in the dough with some curry powder, it turns it green and you 

212
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,040
add a spoonful of sultanas and some mango chutney to that as well. 

213
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,920
A whole curry in a flatbread. 

214
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,240
I mean, anything works inside these things. 

215
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,200
Get a good strong colour on it, don't be afraid to put 

216
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,840
this little bit of black on it, that's what it should be. 

217
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,440
About three or four minutes each side. 

218
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,840
You leave that to cool and then chop it up while it's warm, 

219
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,360
and then you'll get all the ooze coming out of it. 

220
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,480
It's absolutely delicious, 

221
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,600
but that is how you make a camembert and quince flat bread. 

222
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Steaming. I've got the big half. 

223
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,200
So these can be done in advance and then warmed just before a party. 

224
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,320
I like the way it's so flexible, 

225
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,120
and you can imagine filling it with all things like 

226
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,640
a little bit of curry in there with a little bit of mango chutney. 

227
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,400
You can taste that camembert as well. 

228
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,800
The camembert's in there, little bit of quince I've just got as well. 

229
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,360
And together with the look of them, they're just, for me, 

230
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,800
they're fantastic flat breads. 

231
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,320
And so easy to make. 

232
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,920
- Well, I think they're absolutely lovely.
- Good. 

233
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Now Mary's top tip for perfectly lining a circular cake tin. 

234
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,440
First of all, I have got to grease the tin. 

235
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,840
Right in the corners. 

236
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,200
And then all the way around the sides. 

237
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,280
So you just take a strip of baking parchment, 

238
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,840
and it wants to be taller than the tin 

239
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,800
because it deflects the heat from the side. 

240
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,960
And take the strip and then fold in a piece at the bottom... 

241
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,880
..like that. 

242
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,480
So I've turned that in, then I'm going to cut diagonal slices, 

243
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,840
all the way down. 

244
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,120
As you put that in the tin, 

245
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,920
each one will overlap the other quite easily. 

246
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,840
So lift the paper up and where you've done that straight fold, 

247
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,600
that's got to go to the bottom of the tin. 

248
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,680
Press that all the way around. 

249
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,760
That's perfect. 

250
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,280
Then you just take the circle that you've cut, 

251
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,800
pop that over the top, and it's as neat as can be. 

252
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,680
Tin is lined, so all you've got to do is put the mixture in 

253
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,240
and just level it off. 

254
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,960
The third week of the bake-off was all about tarts. 

255
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,840
Mary's treacle tarte tangled them up in the technical challenge 

256
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,320
whilst their show-stopping designer tarts had the wow factor. 

257
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,000
But it was with their Signature Bake 

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,560
that the bakers hoped to impress. 

259
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,400
Now we're going to be asking you today to rustle up 

260
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,040
a bit of a French classic, which is the tarte tatin. 

261
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,720
So we're looking for one large tarte, 

262
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,000
which sounds like a Paul Hollywood personal ad. 

263
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,400
But it isn't, we're looking for a classic tarte tatin, 

264
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,320
- sweet or savoury. So... 
- On your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake. 

265
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,600
Whilst traditionally apple, 

266
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,240
the bakers put their own twist on the classic tarte tatin. 

267
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,680
I am making an apple and pear tarte tatin. 

268
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,200
Apple and lavender. 

269
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,080
- Apple and vanilla. 
- An apple and ginger tarte tatin. 

270
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,040
Others went even further. 

271
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,880
Blue cheese and walnut and a bit of thyme. 

272
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,600
Plum, cherry and five spice tarte tatin. 

273
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,040
- Caramelised banana.
- Oh, nice, that's my favourite one, that. 

274
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,600
- Oh, is it?
- Yes.
- That was lucky. 

275
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,840
But Mary's signature tarte tatin is the traditional apple, 

276
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,480
glazed in their own juices 

277
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,080
and layered with a homemade rough puff pastry. 

278
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,120
I think this is one of my favourite challenges, actually, 

279
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,600
the signature tarte tatin. 

280
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,560
I couldn't agree more, it's a French classic, 

281
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,880
I'm doing my own interpretation of it. I'm going to start off 

282
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,320
with the pastry, and I'm doing a quick rough puff. 

283
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,560
Weigh out 100 grams of plain flour and 50 grams of butter 

284
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,320
and 25 grams of lard that you've frozen, ready to grate. 

285
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,520
If you don't have it really, really cold, it won't grate. 

286
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,800
Put the lard into the flour, and in this way it doesn't really 

287
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,640
stick to your hands, otherwise you'll get in a real mess. 

288
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,400
Now you see what I'm doing here 

289
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,800
is keeping every little bit of fat separate. 

290
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,960
You know, rather than having big lumps, 

291
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,600
which is traditional for rough puff or little pieces for flaky. 

292
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,200
Do the same with the frozen butter until everything is grated 

293
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,640
and incorporated with the flour. 

294
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,400
This is how I make pastry at home, very quickly, 

295
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,280
whether it's a mince pie, any pastry that I want nice and flaky. 

296
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,440
The colder the butter inside the pastry, 

297
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,280
the more rise and puff you will get. 

298
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,560
People say you've got to have cold hands for pastry. 

299
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,520
I'm not too fussy whether my hands are cold, 

300
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,080
it's having the actual fat cold. 

301
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,200
Add about four or five tablespoons of water to the grated mixture. 

302
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,680
Combine the ingredients until the pastry holds together 

303
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,480
and it's ready to roll out. 

304
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,760
Flour the board. 

305
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,320
My nan used to use a lot of lard, you know, in a lot of her baking, 

306
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,000
you know, especially round World War One. 

307
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,040
Did you use a lot of lard then as well? 

308
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,080
You're always on about me cooking in the war! 

309
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,760
- You are rotten to me, aren't you? 
- Sorry, Mary. 

310
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,560
Roll it into an oblong, like that, 

311
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,400
and you can see how well the fat is distributed. 

312
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,280
So a good indication actually 

313
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,840
is looking for a good marble in this from the very beginning? 

314
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,640
That's right. I'm going to fold that in three, like that, 

315
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,320
brush off any surplus flour, then again like that. 

316
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,600
Seal the ends to keep the air in, and then one in the middle 

317
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,200
and there, and gradually you will build up layers, 

318
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,240
just as if you were doing real puff pastry. 

319
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,280
Repeat exactly the same folding sequence for a second time. 

320
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,800
I just put my knuckle in like that, 

321
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,120
so when I take it out of the fridge, it reminds me that I've done two. 

322
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,360
Wrap it in cling film and put the pastry in the fridge to chill. 

323
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,880
You'll need to repeat the folding process once more, 

324
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,480
chilling it in the fridge in between 

325
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,760
to prevent it from shrinking when baked. 

326
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,600
In the meantime, make the caramel. 

327
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,360
When making caramel, you have to have a pan that is stainless steel, 

328
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,120
not non stick, or it will crystallise very quickly. 

329
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,320
Add six tablespoons of water to a pan 

330
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,120
and then dissolve 175 grams of granulated sugar. 

331
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,360
It's no good trying to do this with any of the brown sugars, 

332
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,680
it doesn't work, you've got to have a white sugar. 

333
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,560
Stir until all the sugar is dissolved 

334
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,960
and then leave alone to boil rapidly for a few minutes. 

335
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,480
And you'll immediately notice that it starts to make a row. 

336
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,680
When it reaches the caramel stage, it will go peaceful, 

337
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,240
but don't wander round the kitchen, stay with it and watch it. 

338
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,280
Can you see in the middle there 

339
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,600
it's just beginning to turn the palest caramel colour? 

340
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,760
Although some of the bakers didn't find making caramel quite so easy. 

341
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,680
I think the sugar crystallised, so I'm going to start again. 

342
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,560
The pressure is definitely on at the moment 

343
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,320
as the caramel is going on for the fourth time. 

344
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,320
How many times have you done that? 

345
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,640
This is the fifth one and this is the sixth time. 

346
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,280
Watch these like a hawk, please. 

347
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,800
- I know. 
- SHE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY 

348
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,560
I've got a good feeling about number six. 

349
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,280
This sugar syrup is batch seven. Oh, please don't go crystallise now. 

350
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,800
I don't think the sugar likes me today. 

351
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,840
Now, that is just a gorgeous deep toffee colour. 

352
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,800
Pour that in quite quickly, don't grease this, 

353
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,560
if you grease it, as soon as the caramel goes in there, 

354
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,400
it will crystallise. 

355
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,080
I will use that pan to make the sort of syrup to go off the top, 

356
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,480
so I can just leave that. 

357
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,520
Then run that just round the bottom, 

358
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,600
and leave it to get absolutely cold, and then you put the apples on top. 

359
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,280
Slice 900 grams of eating apples into thin wedges. 

360
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,320
Don't use cooking apples as they will disintegrate while baking. 

361
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,680
I'm using Pink Lady because I'm leaving the skin on 

362
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,120
and they look very pretty. 

363
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,400
You could use Cox's, you could use any eating apple, 

364
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,080
and they need to be fairly evenly cut into wedges, 

365
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,760
especially on the bottom because you've got to make that pattern, 

366
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,560
which looks so pretty. 

367
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,360
Now, when you come to doing the apple, the natural thing to do 

368
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,680
is to put them in like that, but when you think about it, 

369
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,120
it's going to be turned out, 

370
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,360
so what you've got to do is put them that way round, 

371
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,760
and then you get that lovely pattern all the way round. 

372
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,800
Take the slices and just go all the way round in the circle, 

373
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,720
overlapping, and you only need do this for the bottom, 

374
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,520
or rather it will turn out as the top. 

375
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,000
You can just chuck the rest in on top. 

376
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,680
Add the juice of the lemon to the sliced apples 

377
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,880
to prevent them from going brown. 

378
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,040
I must say, you're doing this very meticulously and I'm very impressed. 

379
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,680
Thanks very much, Mum. Did you ever see Fanny Craddock, Mary? 

380
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,560
She had Johnny of course, 

381
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,200
but I treat you much nicer than Fanny Craddock treated Johnny. 

382
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,520
Add the lemon zest to the remaining apple slices 

383
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,680
and pile them all into the tin. 

384
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,960
So there it is full, now we have to put the pastry on top. 

385
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,600
Remove the chilled pastry from the fridge. 

386
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,560
It has already had three turns and is now ready for the final one. 

387
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,800
So one more rolling in the traditional way 

388
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,320
to get those folds and all the layers, 

389
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,800
and now all I've got to do is roll it to the shape of the tin. 

390
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,320
It wants to be just a little bit bigger. 

391
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,720
How you know how big it is, take the length of the rolling pin, 

392
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,360
put your nail there, that's plenty big enough. 

393
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,160
And then just lift it into the middle and gently ease it in, 

394
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,240
tucking it in. 

395
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,720
Can you see that it is a little bit on the big side? 

396
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,560
But that's how it should be. 

397
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,160
Pushing it down, you don't need to do any fancy edging with it, 

398
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,280
tucking it in all the way round, and then take a knife 

399
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,360
and just make a little cross in the middle to let the apples breathe 

400
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,080
and send some steam out. 

401
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,480
Put in a pre-heated oven at 220 degrees, 

402
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,480
200 fan, for about 40 minutes until the pastry is golden. 

403
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,040
There's a lot of liquid still. 

404
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,040
Moment of truth now. 

405
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,520
HE SIGHS 

406
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,280
It's kind of collapsed slightly on this side, but... 

407
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,000
Well, that's not too bad. 

408
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,760
Puff the magic pastry, here it comes. 

409
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,000
God, you need biceps for that. 

410
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,160
That's not only a taste of France, it's the size of France. 

411
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,040
Oh, my days. Look at that. 

412
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,760
Yes, yes, sorry. Yes. 

413
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,840
The main thing is the pastry is cooked through, the apples are soft, 

414
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,760
it's shrinking away from the sides a little, 

415
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,680
and I'm going to drain off any surplus juices 

416
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,360
and add a little more sugar to it. 

417
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,080
Add 75 grams of caster sugar 

418
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,120
to the pan that you used to make the caramel. 

419
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,320
Put a cloth over the top and drain any juices into that pan. 

420
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,920
In that way, you get a nice syrup. And reduce it. 

421
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,480
There's a little bit of caramel that was left from the caramel 

422
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,440
that I put at the base, it's a nice coating consistency now, 

423
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,600
and that will give a really nice shine on top. 

424
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,520
So that's ready. We'll turn it out and pour the sauce over the top. 

425
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,920
You never want to turn it out until you're serving 

426
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,480
so everybody's sitting down, 

427
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,640
everybody's anticipating it coming in, turn it out then. 

428
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,960
So put the plate over the top like that, a wing and a prayer... 

429
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,360
One, two, three. 

430
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,680
Like that. 

431
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,760
There we are, looks beautiful, 

432
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,080
and you see the way we had that pastry just pushed down. 

433
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,360
Yeah. 

434
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,080
It makes a lovely rim and then the extra sauce over the top. 

435
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,360
Now, doesn't that give a lovely shine to it? 

436
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,680
Can I eat it now, Mary? 

437
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,720
There's no sugar with the apple, that's intentional, 

438
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,560
you have the caramel at the top, and when the juices are drained off, 

439
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,960
you add more sugar, and that is the only sweetener. 

440
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,440
The flavour of the apple really comes through on this one. 

441
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,960
- Lovely crispy, buttery base. 
- And I think it works. 

442
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,000
That would be lovely with cream and stuff, beautiful. 

443
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,920
And now Paul's top tip to create a crimping crown for any pie. 

444
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,080
Grab the lid and pop it on top of the pie. 

445
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,320
A bit of pressure pushing your lid onto your base, 

446
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,440
just seals it all in so everything cooks within the pie. 

447
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,120
Lift up your pie, hold the knife at an angle, 

448
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,080
trim all the way around, nice and gently. 

449
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,000
The crimping is mainly for aesthetics. 

450
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,160
Start with two fingers on the corner, your next finger, 

451
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:06,120
your forefinger, then comes up and drives up a little arch like so. 

452
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,840
Go all the way around. 

453
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,320
That is one style of crimping. 

454
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,360
The next one is, just your thumb and your forefinger. 

455
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:20,680
Pinch, pinch on the edge of your pie, and it seals the lid 

456
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,280
and the base neatly and it looks very professional. 

457
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,080
You can seal a pork pie like this or any pie. 

458
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,800
Look at that. 

459
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,840
Week five of the bake-off and the remaining eight bakers 

460
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,320
were challenged to make Paul's technically tricky hand-raised pies 

461
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,480
and wow the judges with their show-stopping American pies. 

462
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,800
But it was the Signature Challenge 

463
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,080
that showed their twist on a puff pastry family favourite. 

464
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,800
Bakers, we'd like you to make a Wellington. 

465
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,840
The filling has to be savoury, it needs to be completely covered 

466
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,840
with pastry, but the rest is up to you, so on your marks... 

467
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,280
- Get set.
- Bake. 

468
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,680
I'm calling it a full English Wellington 

469
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,560
because it's got eggs, sausage, black pudding, tomato and mushroom. 

470
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,120
Chick peas, peppers and spinach, 

471
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,880
and then it's going to have some garlic mushrooms around it. 

472
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,920
I'm making a salmon coulibiac 

473
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,600
with layers of different types of vegetables and herbs. 

474
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,280
We all like a challenge. 

475
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,200
Paul's signature Wellington is a classic beef Wellington 

476
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,360
with puff pastry spread with pate 

477
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,400
and wrapped around a prime fillet of tender beef. 

478
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:46,960
So, beef Wellington, this is one of the real luxury dishes. 

479
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,120
I'm looking forward to your version. 

480
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,920
Today, I'll go down the classical route but for me, my twist 

481
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,200
is adding the pate, and all the flavours together are just stunning. 

482
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,080
Measure out 150 grams of strong flour and 150 grams of plain flour. 

483
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,360
You're dumbing down the gluten in the strong, 

484
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,240
but you're upping the gluten from the plain, 

485
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,840
so the balance actually would be quite a robust pastry 

486
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,320
that you can really roll out and slap your butter in 

487
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,640
and get some rise from. 

488
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,160
Add to the flour a pinch of salt and two whole eggs 

489
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,160
and 100 millilitres of water, a little at a time. 

490
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,360
Get your fingers in again, begin to mix the pastry round, 

491
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,560
you can do this in a mixer, 

492
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,240
essentially, it will just do this, that you can do with your hand. 

493
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,520
It's quite a robust little dough. 

494
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,800
Once you've taken all the flour that's in the bowl, 

495
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
pop it on the bench. 

496
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,520
A light dusting of flour and then just roll it up into a ball, 

497
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,240
and all you do is manipulate this, just for a couple of minutes, 

498
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,280
just until it goes smooth, and it will go smooth. 

499
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
Again, the technique, just flatten it down, 

500
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,680
and then roll it up. 

501
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,520
Flatten it down and roll it up. You only literally 

502
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,520
have to bring the ingredients together for a couple of minutes 

503
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,800
just doing this, and you can see the dough is much smoother. 

504
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,000
It's quite stretchy as well. 

505
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It's got a bit of resistance in there. 

506
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,440
Proper puff pastry must be chilled, or it can become tough, 

507
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,440
so wrap it in Clingfilm and chill in the fridge for as long as possible - 

508
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,080
overnight, if you have time. 

509
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,440
It's quite enjoyable to make your own puff pastry - 

510
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,480
when it turns out right. 

511
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,560
Everything is tricky about this bake - the meat, the pastry, 

512
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,880
the bits that you put with it. And they all have to be good. 

513
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,040
The secret with making... 

514
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,720
puff is obviously to keep 

515
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,320
your ingredients as cold as possible. 

516
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,600
I'm going to use a bit of flour and a rolling pin 

517
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,720
and just shape it, so it's nice and smooth, 

518
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,800
into a rectangle. 

519
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,240
Measure out 160g of very cold, unsalted butter... 

520
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,000
Coat it in flour. 

521
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,680
It is hard - you can put it between greaseproof and bang it out. 

522
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,000
Just keep it on a bench, and bang it out. 

523
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,520
Very good tip, to have it on a board, to do it. 

524
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,680
Yeah. It doesn't make THAT much mess, 

525
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,440
as long as your butter's cold. 

526
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,360
Make it into a rough rectangle. 

527
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,440
When you put the butter on the dough, 

528
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,280
it must cover two-thirds of it. 

529
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,080
I'm going to fold over the top bit now 

530
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,960
over half the butter, to about there. 

531
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,400
But to make it even more accurate, just cut your butter, 

532
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,360
lift it up, pop it on the top. 

533
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,560
Stretch the bottom, then place that over the top. 

534
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,400
Now, that looks very neat. The only difference is, 

535
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,040
when I make puff pastry, I do it the classic way, 

536
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,440
of equal butter to equal flour, 

537
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,800
and no egg in it - so, this is a totally different version. 

538
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,600
Egg is one of the key ingredients for flavour, 

539
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,680
and also for the spring as well. 

540
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,760
- It'll also give it a nice colour. 
- Yeah, golden.
- I'm interested. 

541
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,880
Tap the middle, 

542
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,520
and then tap down and tap up. 

543
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,920
If you start from the top and tap, all the butter 

544
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,920
runs down to the bottom, so start tapping gently from the middle, 

545
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,360
up and down, little bit of a roll... 

546
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,560
You're taking it down roughly to about...10 mil, in height. 

547
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,440
Once you've got that nice and neat - and try and get it 

548
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,280
as neat as you can - 

549
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,560
then you fold it one more time. 

550
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,800
That...is one turn. 

551
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,560
Tap it in the middle again, up and down, 

552
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,640
and then roll out again, to exactly the same size 

553
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,480
as you did a minute ago. 

554
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,880
Fold it again, and once more, over the top. 

555
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,640
Now, that...has had two turns. 

556
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,360
Now, it needs another two before you use it. 

557
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,680
Now, that will go straight into a fridge, 

558
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,680
and be left to chill, again, for at least an hour, 

559
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,960
or even a couple of hours, till that butter 

560
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,240
begins to solidify, and then we can do a final two turns, 

561
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,360
and it's ready to go. This is 750 grams 

562
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,280
of prime fillet steak. There's no way of doing 

563
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,440
a half-measure with this - you have to go for quality. 

564
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,800
You can get the butcher to clean it up, but if you do see any sinews, 

565
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,120
just drop your knife under and run it through. 

566
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,560
Now, this has been outside for a couple of hours - 

567
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,080
just in ambient temperature, room temperature, just to relax the meat. 

568
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,000
Because as soon as it goes into the fridge, it tightens up. 

569
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,840
You want it to be nice and loose. 

570
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,480
And most important of all, it must be 

571
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,960
- the centre cut...
- Yeah.
- ..because the tail comes here - that's thin, 

572
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,200
- and you wouldn't get the even size all the way down.
- Yeah. 

573
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,680
And the thick end here comes in two parts, and clever butchers 

574
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,000
tie it all together, but when you take a slice from it, 

575
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,960
- it's in two pieces. 
- Breaks apart, yeah. 

576
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,480
So, it should be the centre cut, which, I'm afraid, 

577
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,000
- is the most expensive cut. 
- Unfortunately, yes, it is. 

578
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,880
I'm just going to seal the steak off in a pan. 

579
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,760
Rub some salt in, and some pepper, 

580
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,880
get it inside the pan. 

581
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,840
STEAK SIZZLES 

582
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,760
Pop some kitchen roll on here, 

583
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,320
and just to take a little bit more of that juice off... 

584
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,120
And you need to leave that to cool. 

585
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,280
- Stone cold, otherwise it will melt the butter in the pastry.
- Exactly. 

586
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,920
But that was the least of the worries in the bake-off tent. 

587
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,040
Oh! 

588
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,200
It's a little bit unstable. 

589
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,080
This feels so funny! 

590
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,240
I can't decide whether to decorate or to score. 

591
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,040
- I'd decorate it. 
- You reckon? I might decorate it. 

592
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,680
And you know how Mary loves to see what's on the inside 

593
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,000
- replicated on the outside...? 
- Oh, no, don't! 

594
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,520
- I haven't got...
- I think you should do a full farmyard scene. 

595
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,120
Pastry here, which I'm now going to roll out, 

596
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,120
ready to have the steak put inside. 

597
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,840
You've got to think of the size of the fillet, 

598
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,880
which I've sort of got in my head. 

599
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,520
Now relax the pastry. Get a bit of air underneath it. 

600
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,640
You can see it's not springing back at all. Now's the fun bit. 

601
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,400
I've got about 150 grams of pate. 

602
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,680
Just begin to smear it onto the top of the puff pastry. 

603
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,760
As long as you get the majority of it equally down the middle that way, 

604
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,920
it doesn't matter too much 

605
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,400
cos that's the bit that's going to be folded over 

606
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
so you don't have to go right to the end. 

607
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,560
Do you know, one of the things I like about beef Wellington 

608
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,800
is that you can do it all ahead, you can actually assemble it completely, 

609
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,040
everything except for glazing it. 

610
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,000
Keep it in the fridge, 

611
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
do it the day before and then cook it in the oven. 

612
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,920
It will take a little bit longer. 

613
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,880
Got my rectangle here, I'm just going to tack a little bit down 

614
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,440
on the table. This just helps when you finally roll it up, 

615
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,720
you've got something thin to actually join on to. 

616
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,880
So get your fillet, the size is pretty good, 

617
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,000
pop that into the centre, get the top piece 

618
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,600
and then just try and tack that down on to the steak, 

619
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,920
keeping that quite tight. 

620
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,600
Fold your ends in, the same on the other side. 

621
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,120
It's funny how I learn something every day, I would never think 

622
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,520
of doing this business of pressing the pastry like you are there 

623
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,520
and pressing it down so it doesn't move, that's a very good tip. 

624
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,960
Yeah, it prevents it from moving but also when you 

625
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,440
seal it up you've got a nice thin line, 

626
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,160
because when you roll that over now you can pull it and get a bit 

627
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,800
of a tension and then you know it's going to be nice and neat, 

628
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,000
and you know underneath you've got the one line 

629
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,560
which is already self-tacked. 

630
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,600
Egg wash the Wellington so that it is covered all over, 

631
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,800
giving the pastry its golden colour. 

632
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,960
That'll give it a nice shine. 

633
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
You don't have to grease the baking sheet 

634
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,920
because there's plenty of butter in the pastry and it won't stick. 

635
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,520
Use the back of your knife and just run it from the top, 

636
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,800
don't put any weight on it, and just drop it down. 

637
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,280
Just doing diagonals. 

638
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,120
That's a lovely simple, smart way of doing it. 

639
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,720
- You can put leaves on top.
- Yeah. 
- And any trimmings if you want to. 

640
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,520
But don't use the sharp part of your knife, 

641
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,360
cos the last thing you want to do is cut through the pastry 

642
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,240
and then cause it to rip in the oven. 

643
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,600
That will give it a lovely pattern on top when it's cooking. 

644
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,480
Bake in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes at 200 degrees fan, 

645
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,640
until the pastry is crisp and golden and cooked all the way through. 

646
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,080
But not all the bakers were so lucky. 

647
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,640
OK, you need to go in. 

648
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,600
Oh, my god almighty. 

649
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,680
My pastry has completely melted and is falling off the meat. 

650
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,120
There's absolutely nothing I can do about it. 

651
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,040
This is like the worst thing, ever. 

652
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,640
Oh! 

653
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,280
Well, actually...ooh, hello! 

654
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,640
The pastry looks good. 

655
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,480
- That looks fantastic.
- One of the reasons why it puffs up so much 

656
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,280
is if you take it straight from the fridge and put it in the oven, 

657
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,000
that sting from being from the fridge where it's cold 

658
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,280
and hits the heat, it just wants to explode 

659
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,200
cos all the layers of butter are really cold. 

660
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,720
That's the secret to making a great puff pastry. 

661
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,960
And that for me 

662
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,640
is the best beef Wellington. 

663
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,440
It's lovely, it's golden brown. 

664
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,240
You need to rest this for a good ten, 15 minutes 

665
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,160
before you actually serve it. 

666
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,880
- And that's a very important part, isn't it?
- Yeah. 

667
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,280
Is your plate ready? 

668
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,480
Thank you. 

669
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,320
Oh, that's just how I like it. 

670
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,720
That's grand that, Mary. Especially with the pate. 

671
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,040
I think it's lovely. 

672
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,200
- Just going to carry on eating, cos it's delicious!
- Oh, it's good. 

673
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,720
And now Paul's top tip to create the perfect Danish pastry shapes. 

674
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,160
Get your pastry, roll it out and then trim it off 

675
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,720
so you have four squares. 

676
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,240
Two ends into the middle, 

677
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,720
that's your first shape. 

678
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,320
The second shape, into the middle for the two corners, 

679
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,080
and then again into the middle. The next one is a bit more complicated. 

680
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,000
Cut out from the middle to each corner. 

681
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,840
Pick a corner, fold it into the middle, miss the next one, 

682
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,960
and then fold the next one into the middle. 

683
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,480
Fold the next, that's called the Catherine wheel. 

684
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,680
The last one, cut round, nearly to the corners, 

685
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,560
make sure you cut all the way through, the same on the other side. 

686
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,080
Cut along and then down. 

687
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,400
Take the piece, place it over the other side, 

688
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,480
the other piece to the other side, and there you have it. 

689
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,720
Four different Danish pastry shapes. 

690
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,840
The final seven bakers had to 

691
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,480
put their money where their mouths were in pudding week. 

692
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,880
From a regal technical challenge making the queen of puddings 

693
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,240
to a show-stopper that saw them struggling to make strudel pastry. 

694
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,800
But the proof of this pudding was in the Signature Challenge. 

695
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,160
We'd like you to make two different flavoured sponges 

696
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,760
with two different accompaniments. 

697
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,480
They should be individual sized portions, please, 

698
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,240
and they can be baked, boiled or steamed. 

699
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,720
So on your marks. 

700
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,280
Get set. 

701
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,000
Bake. 

702
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,080
I feel a bit panicky already, which is not a good way to start. 

703
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,240
If we can't knock a couple of sponge puddings up in two hours, 

704
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,240
then we don't deserve the accolade of even being here. 

705
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,160
Today, I'm making a ginger sponge pudding with brandy cream 

706
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,680
and also a chocolate fondant with malt ice cream. 

707
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,960
A chocolate pudding. 

708
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,960
My accompaniment is actually going to be Jubilee cherries. 

709
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,480
I chose Clootie dumplings because they are traditionally Scottish. 

710
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,280
There are no two recipes of Clootie dumpling the same, 

711
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,320
everyone's got their own different recipes. 

712
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,400
Raspberry and white chocolate puddings with a basil ice cream. 

713
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,800
I'm not a multi-tasker but I'm doing literally a million things. 

714
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,880
Mary's signature sponge pudding 

715
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,480
is her sticky toffee apple and pecan pud. 

716
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,240
A light apple steamed sponge 

717
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,880
smothered in rich toffee and pecan sauce. 

718
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,200
Sponge puddings, Mary. One of my all time favourites. 

719
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,760
So to start off, let's make the toffee sauce, very easy. 

720
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,320
Measure out 300 millimetres of pouring cream into a saucepan, 

721
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,560
100 grams of light muscovado sugar and 75 grams of softened butter. 

722
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,400
So sensible to weigh the butter on top of the sugar. 

723
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,040
It'll slip out easily and we can use the pan without washing it up. 

724
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,520
In goes the sugar, in goes the butter. 

725
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,760
It's just a matter of stirring that together until the sugar dissolves. 

726
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,400
You just do it on a low heat and just cook it for about five minutes 

727
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,240
until it's a sauce consistency. 

728
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,280
While that's getting going I'm going to well butter a two pint basin. 

729
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,440
Weigh out 125 grams of light muscovado sugar 

730
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,600
and the same again of butter and place into a large mixing bowl. 

731
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,720
So in goes the sugar and lovely soft butter. 

732
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,680
I'm going to make this the creaming method, 

733
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,640
that's putting the butter and the sugar together, 

734
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,520
creaming it until smooth and then we're going to add the eggs. 

735
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,520
Why are you doing it that way, then? 

736
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,360
Just for a change, I always do the all in one 

737
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,080
and sometimes people say, "Why don't you do it the creaming?" 

738
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,880
It takes a bit longer but many people do it this way. 

739
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,920
So mix it until it's smooth. 

740
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,600
Mix together the ingredients until everything is completely combined 

741
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,400
and it gets lighter in colour. 

742
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,360
Add in a beaten egg a little bit at a time 

743
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,360
and weigh out 125 grams of self-raising flour. 

744
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,760
And you're doing me 125 grams? 

745
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,800
I'm doing it right now. 

746
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,240
Yeah, OK. Am I nagging you? 

747
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,960
- Yeah, you are. 
- I've still got some egg to add. 

748
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,920
At this stage it sometimes curdles. 

749
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,000
Therefore I'm going to add a little of the flour 

750
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,640
to the egg, butter and sugar mixture and that will just stabilise it. 

751
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,640
Whisk in the rest of the egg and add a teaspoon of vanilla extract. 

752
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,680
Peel and chop up one large cooking apple, 

753
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,720
or one and a half smaller ones into very small chunks, 

754
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,080
about the size of a pea. 

755
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,680
So you have to do it in reasonably small pieces 

756
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,600
- in order to get cooked in the time. 
- To get it in there. 

757
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,560
And also it's lovely to come across 

758
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,880
the little pieces of apple in the sponge. 

759
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,080
I'm now going to fold the flour in. 

760
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,400
Folding in, you should do very carefully to keep the air in. 

761
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,600
Add the chopped apple to the sponge mixture 

762
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,920
and roughly chop 75 grams of pecan nuts 

763
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,200
which will go into the sponge and the sauce. 

764
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,200
The toffee sauce has cooled. I'm going to put half of that 

765
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,720
into the basin, give or take, 

766
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,320
then I'm going to put half of these pecans 

767
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,600
over the top of the toffee sauce. 

768
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,000
And then in goes the sponge mixture. 

769
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,520
Put it in carefully to start with from the side, 

770
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,360
because otherwise the sauce will bubble up and mix with it. 

771
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,840
The bakers all made their sponge puddings in individual ones, 

772
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,000
and if you're going to make these individual ones, 

773
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,800
sort of that size, it'll make about eight. 

774
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,080
So just press that down all the way round. 

775
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,960
Then I'm going to just put a disc of non-stick paper there. 

776
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,800
Because of the apple you don't put the acid next door to the foil, 

777
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,400
because there's sometimes a reaction. 

778
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,520
It can even go pitted if it's cooked for a long time. 

779
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,120
To make a lid for the basin, cut a square of foil 

780
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,320
and fold a pleat into the centre. 

781
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,960
This will give you room for the steam that will be created. 

782
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,000
Seal the foil all the way around the basin so that no steam can escape. 

783
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,400
Once it's covered with foil, it's ready to go on the hob 

784
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,080
to be boiled or steamed. 

785
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,720
But first of all, I'm going to put a little cradle round it 

786
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,440
so I can lift it out of that pan. 

787
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,040
To make the cradle, fold a thick strip of foil 

788
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,600
so that you can lower the pudding basin into the saucepan. 

789
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,000
First place it on a jam jar lid so that the pudding basin 

790
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,200
won't directly touch the base of the hot saucepan and crack. 

791
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:57,640
Then the foil cradles and it's really easy to lift out of the pan, 

792
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:03,000
and make sure the pan is tall enough to take the basin. 

793
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,360
Carefully pour boiling water into the saucepan, 

794
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,680
about half way up the pudding basin. 

795
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,880
I'm going to put the lid on. 

796
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,840
But do keep checking it 

797
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,800
because the water can go low. You can do it in a steamer, 

798
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,680
it might take a little longer in a steamer than in simmering water 

799
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,560
and it will take about two and a half hours. 

800
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,960
Whilst Mary is steaming her pudding on the hob, 

801
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,120
the bakers explore other ways of baking their puddings. 

802
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,840
When it cooks, it creates a skin. 

803
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,200
Doesn't sound all that appetising. 

804
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,840
Three things going on at the same time there. 

805
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,840
Pouring, dipping, mixing. 

806
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,200
Oh, look at those! They look good. 

807
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,680
Oh, my giddy aunt! 

808
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,400
Ohh...oh, no! 

809
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,000
I could cry. 

810
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,920
Just lift it out, and we take off that lid. 

811
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,360
You see, it's a lovely colour, isn't it? 

812
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,560
It's that muscovado sugar gives it that flavour. 

813
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,520
Let's just see that it's done. 

814
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,960
You see, the knife comes out completely clean 

815
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,600
and so put the plate over the top like that, 

816
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,440
and don't turn it out until you actually need it. 

817
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,880
I rather like turning things out, I like the surprise. 

818
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,840
It's still very hot, there it is. 

819
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,360
- Lovely.
- You can see the pecans there, but it hasn't got that shine. 

820
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,160
The sauce has gone in to make the top very moist. 

821
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:43,400
Add the rest of the pecans to the remaining half of the toffee sauce 

822
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,800
and pour over the sponge. 

823
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,240
And let it just trickle down. 

824
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:52,040
You can make this the day before and let it get stone cold 

825
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:57,000
and then reheat it again in a pan of simmering water. 

826
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,520
It will take about an hour to re-heat. 

827
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,120
So there we are. 

828
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,160
Toffee, apple, pecan pudding. 

829
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,080
I'm looking forward to this one, Mary. 

830
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,280
Good enough to eat, that. Superb. 

831
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,600
Dig in and see what you think. 

832
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,080
That's wicked, that. You've got the texture of the pecan, 

833
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,280
you've got the flavour of the toffee 

834
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,120
and you're left with this beautiful flavour of apple. 

835
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,160
It's a lovely sponge. 

836
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,120
Mary's top tips on creaming, whisking and folding. 

837
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,560
Creaming is just beating, 

838
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,440
and I'm using a wooden spoon 

839
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,440
but you could use an electric beater 

840
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,600
if you're in a hurry. Add sugar, 

841
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,600
just give it a good beat. 

842
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,720
As you go on beating, it will get a lighter colour. 

843
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,640
The principle of whisking 

844
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,400
is getting as much air as I can into the mixture. 

845
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,560
Choose a whisk that's got quite a lot of spirals in it 

846
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,080
and you'll get a quicker result. 

847
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,800
The bigger the bowl, the more volume you can get. 

848
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,800
When it comes to folding, 

849
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,040
it's important to keep the air in the mixture. 

850
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,720
Round the outside of the bowl and cut through the middle. 

851
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,240
Get right to the bottom of the bowl, right round the edge, 

852
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,480
cut through the middle. 

853
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,800
The aim of folding in is to keep all the air in 

854
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,240
that you put in there originally. 

855
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,960
So it's well worth doing it carefully and following the recipe. 

856
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,720
Week Seven of the Bake Off, 

857
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,520
and the bakers were struggling with sweet doughs. 

858
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,680
They made show-stopping enriched dough loaves 

859
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,240
and the technically challenging 

860
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,520
fairground favourites, jam doughnuts. 

861
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,840
The pressure was on, 

862
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,320
and it was the Signature Challenge that proved difficult. 

863
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,080
So, today we'd like you to make 24 regional buns. 

864
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:54,360
They can be Bath buns, Chelsea buns, Colston buns, Devonshire Revel buns. 

865
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,720
- So, on your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake. 

866
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,840
Lardy cakes I'm making today, which is similar to Chelsea buns 

867
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,360
except for you put piles and piles of lard in it, 

868
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,120
so not exactly healthy. 

869
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,200
Because I'm from South Yorkshire 

870
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,680
and close to Bakewell, it's actually Bakewell inspired. 

871
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,760
I'm making Easter Chelsea buns. Basically hot cross buns, Chelsified. 

872
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,160
But Paul is keeping it classic. 

873
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,480
His signature regional sweet bun is the Chelsea bun, 

874
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,120
an enriched swirl of dough, 

875
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,480
encasing chopped sultanas, apricots and cranberries, 

876
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,040
layered with a gorgeous orange icing. 

877
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,400
I'm going to start by making the base dough. 

878
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Can I have 500 grams of strong white flour, please? 

879
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,440
You certainly can. And you always use strong flour? 

880
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,320
Most yeasted breads would be strong white flour. 

881
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,920
Seven grams of fast action yeast. 

882
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,520
Pop in one egg. While I'm doing this, 

883
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,320
could you weigh me up 40 grams of the caster sugar, please? 

884
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,960
Along with the sugar add 25 grams of softened butter, 

885
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,880
then add a teaspoon of salt but don't put it next to the yeast 

886
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,400
or it could de-activate it. 

887
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,240
That's all the key ingredients, 

888
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,640
except for milk, which has been warming nicely. 

889
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,160
Because it's an enriched dough, because it's got yeast in 

890
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,160
and eggs and sugar and butter, 

891
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,080
that tends to what we call retard the yeast, 

892
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,080
prevent it from working to its full extent. 

893
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,040
So warming up the milk actually helps activate it more. 

894
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,800
Then get your spoon in there. 

895
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,200
Could I do this with a dough hook? 

896
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,080
Course you could. If I'm not around, Mary, you can use a mixer. 

897
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,320
Well, we don't all have the energy and the skill 

898
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,920
that you've got with bread-making. 

899
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,440
It's not energy, it's technique, it's very simple to do, I mean, 

900
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,840
enriched doughs have been around from Tudor times, you know. 

901
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,120
Enriched doughs I think are so lovely, 

902
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:43,760
all the croissants and Danish pastries and things like that. 

903
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,560
Oh, yeah. If I get my hand in there now. 

904
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,600
- I didn't think it would be long. 
- A bit of flour for me, please. 

905
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,160
And I'm going to dollop this mess into the middle, 

906
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,840
coat it all round with some flour 

907
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,920
and then begin to shape it into a ball. 

908
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,560
The first thing that's happened is 

909
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,200
you're incorporating all the ingredients. 

910
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,840
The second thing is kneading builds up the gluten 

911
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,640
for the air to be able to sit inside the sack that it creates. 

912
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,240
You carry on doing this for about five minutes and it will get smooth. 

913
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,680
When you're using a plain dough, 

914
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,840
you very often put olive oil on the table. 

915
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,800
- Yes.
- And when you have an enriched dough, 

916
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,000
it seems to me that you put flour on the table. 

917
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,920
I put flour on the table, yes. 

918
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,320
Now once you've done that for five minutes, 

919
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,000
you see how smooth it's gone. 

920
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,240
Now that needs to rest. Pop it straight in the bowl. 

921
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,480
No oiling round underneath? 

922
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,920
This is an enriched sweet dough. 

923
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,880
The last thing you want to do is add olive oil. 

924
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,240
- Just nothing underneath it? 
- Just leave it alone. 

925
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,320
Ambient temperature we've got it at the moment. 

926
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,640
It's got not much wind so you can leave it uncovered. 

927
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,360
Pop that to one side for me and we'll leave that for about an hour. 

928
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,000
It should double, if not treble in size in that time. 

929
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,520
But the bakers had to prove that they had what it took 

930
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,760
to make their enriched regional doughs. 

931
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,720
This is such a sticky dough because it's got eggs and butter 

932
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,120
and milk in, it's not like normal white bread dough. 

933
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,840
I don't really know about the science but it seems to work. 

934
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,040
You'll let it relax for five minutes and then you start to knead it. 

935
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,400
During that time it will absorb more of the moisture and the liquid. 

936
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,520
Holds its shape well. 

937
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,960
It needs to double in size to prove, but it's too soon to take a look. 

938
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,760
I'm just worried. That's why I just keep on looking at it, 

939
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,200
but, I mean, it's too soon to actually really tell. 

940
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,000
- You can see how much it's grown.
- It has. 

941
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,880
I'm using flour on there and I'm going to tip this dough 

942
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,880
onto the bench and just coat it in a little bit of flour to start with. 

943
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,840
I'm just going to roll this dough out. 

944
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,240
What I'm doing here is actually making the base 

945
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,680
to roll up like a Swiss roll, you know, or a roulade? 

946
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,440
And then this bit here I just tack down to the table all the way along. 

947
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,600
Now I've got some butter here, it's about 50 gram. 

948
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,000
I'm going to leave some back 

949
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,840
to grease the tin I'm going to bake it in, 

950
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,120
but slap that in the middle and get your fingers in there. 

951
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,760
None of this sort of palette knife stuff, use your fingers. 

952
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,000
And the doorbell rings? 

953
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,560
Doesn't matter, let them wait. 

954
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,600
Smear the butter all over the top, 

955
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,880
I mean, this really is an enriched dough. 

956
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,000
I love your tip about fixing it to the table 

957
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,960
just by pressing your fingers into the dough and making it stick. 

958
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,360
Yep, it works. 

959
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,640
Now I've got 75 grams of soft brown sugar, scatter that over the top. 

960
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,880
Like so. And when this melts it will almost caramelise in the oven. 

961
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,480
Weigh out 100 grams each 

962
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,360
of currants, dried apricots and cranberries. 

963
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,080
Sprinkle two teaspoons of cinnamon all over the sugared dough. 

964
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,720
Thank you very much, Mary. Just give that a bit of a mix 

965
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:54,520
and then scatter these all over the top, 

966
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,960
so they're nice and equal. 

967
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,520
Put a bit of pressure on them to push them into the dough. 

968
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,720
Now you start rolling it up, you get your dough 

969
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,200
and then you begin to fold over the top bit as you would a roulade. 

970
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,480
Then the next bit. 

971
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,240
I think this is where people go wrong. 

972
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,240
They're not bold enough when they roll up. 

973
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:19,120
Now you are doing that quite tightly and firmly, pushing it down. 

974
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,160
Yeah, and you can see you stretch it slightly 

975
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,880
cos it's tacked to the table, it's not going to go anywhere. 

976
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,280
Now when you get to the end you just quickly roll up 

977
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,000
and all the tacked bit down at the bottom just release. 

978
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,360
That will now bond with the rest of it, which you pick up 

979
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:41,040
and drop in the flour, that way you can roll it slightly as well. 

980
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,760
It doesn't really matter if a bit of the fruit's coming through. 

981
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,880
- Once you've cut it all up it'll stick together anyway?
- Exactly. 

982
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,720
But a different story was unravelling in the bake-off tent. 

983
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,520
The hardest thing about making 24 sweet buns 

984
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,720
is probably making them all the same. 

985
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,960
Stop measuring the sausage. 

986
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,640
OK, so here we go. One, two. 

987
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,240
One, two. 

988
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,320
There's absolutely no technique to this at all, 

989
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,600
I don't know what I'm doing, basically. 

990
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,840
I'm just worried cos this isn't very, very soft. 

991
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,720
The dough might not actually hold. 

992
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,480
Stop fiddling with them, 

993
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,720
or else they'll just never be done, will they? 

994
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,480
This is the danger points for me. Folding these are taking for ever. 

995
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,240
You could have made a lovely simple pin wheel. What have you done? 

996
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,960
I should have done Chelsea buns, 

997
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,960
I knew I should have done Chelsea buns. 

998
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:38,680
Just trim off the ends and you end up with the perfect Chelsea bun, 

999
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,960
filled with all the fruits. Now, you're going to get 12 from this, 

1000
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,080
so roughly make a halfway mark, 

1001
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:48,960
- you've got to get roughly six from each.
- No ruler for Paul Hollywood. 

1002
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,160
And cut all the way through, rubbing the table 

1003
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,720
to make sure that you've broken it all the way through. 

1004
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,320
And there's your 12 Chelsea buns. 

1005
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,800
OK, I'm going to bring my tin in, this is a loose bottom tin. 

1006
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,160
Now I've got the butter that I left over before. 

1007
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,400
Grab that in your hand. Get it in there, 

1008
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,240
then smear it round the bottom. I'd advise you don't use oil on this. 

1009
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,480
It's essentially a sweet dough, so why would you use olive oil? 

1010
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,880
Butter's fine and you get a nice flavour from the butter as well. 

1011
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,800
So rub it round into the corners. 

1012
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,480
And I would say that's about a 12 by nine tin 

1013
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,280
and if you haven't got that tin, 

1014
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,120
- you could use a small roasting tin. 
- You can, as long as it's clean, 

1015
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,200
if it's dirty and it's had a big roast in it from Sunday 

1016
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,120
and hasn't been cleaned properly, and I've been accused of that... 

1017
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,880
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- I'm not! 

1018
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,760
Your roasting tins I imagine are spotless. 

1019
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,920
I've got all my 12 lined up. 

1020
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,000
Pick them up and then drop them 

1021
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,560
and I'm going to do four rows of three like so, 

1022
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:48,000
spread them out evenly, put a bit of pressure on them. 

1023
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,800
So press them down a bit. 

1024
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,960
It stops them from rising up too much that way, 

1025
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,600
because it's quite a soft dough so they tend not to balloon up, 

1026
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,680
they do tend to flow out. 

1027
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,320
So that will fill all those gaps 

1028
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,120
and you end up with square Chelsea buns, so at this stage 

1029
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,240
they need to rest for at least an hour. 

1030
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,880
If it's in a draughty environment cover it up, 

1031
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,040
but if it isn't just leave it as it is. 

1032
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,160
Look at them, Mary. 

1033
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,760
They've spread beautifully into the corners. 

1034
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,000
The rest of those gaps will be filled while it bakes, 

1035
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,840
so it will start to grow a little bit more. 

1036
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,800
They're going to go into an oven. 200 fan, 220 non, 

1037
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,800
for about 20 to 25 minutes until they're lovely and golden brown. 

1038
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,240
When baking enriched doughs you must be careful not to burn the top, 

1039
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,560
which can colour very quickly because of the amount of sugar 

1040
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,760
and butter in the dough. 

1041
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,520
Good luck little buns, good luck. 

1042
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,800
So the bakers had to watch them closely. 

1043
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,080
That's the one. 

1044
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,760
Oh, they're robust, we're all right. 

1045
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,600
Really, really rather fancy. They're absolutely huge. 

1046
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,160
They just look so pale. 

1047
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,680
These look awful, what's wrong with them? 

1048
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,800
He's going to say they're under-proved, they're under-proved. 

1049
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,960
I'm quite pleased with them actually, I'm loving this sugar. 

1050
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,240
- Look at those fellas. 
- They look wonderful. 

1051
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,320
All the fruit inside, it's a lovely colour 

1052
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,000
and it's filled all the gaps, see. 

1053
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,640
Now, while they're warm I have to finish these off. 

1054
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,200
Warm and sieve some apricot jam and brush it across the buns. 

1055
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,520
- Gives this a lovely shine as well as flavour.
- It does. 

1056
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,720
And while it's warm it just drips inside the Chelsea bun as well. 

1057
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,920
They smell fantastic and that sugar is caramelised inside, 

1058
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,880
gives it a beautiful flavour. 

1059
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,960
Now what I'm going to do is put some icing on this as well, 

1060
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:52,440
I'm going to make an orange icing so icing sugar, a spoon full of sugar. 

1061
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,160
I'm going to burst into song now. 

1062
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,200
We need Mel and Sue, they're always bursting into song. 

1063
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,440
It's very quiet in the tent isn't it, without them? 

1064
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,560
Now I'm going to get a zest of one orange. 

1065
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,000
So often we're eating the orange and we don't do anything with the zest. 

1066
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,320
It's a perfect way of using it. 

1067
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,040
A little bit of orange in there is beautiful. 

1068
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,240
Add just a little splash of water to the icing sugar to start with. 

1069
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,720
If you try and add too much water it just goes to liquid 

1070
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,400
and it doesn't all mix in. It almost looks split. 

1071
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,440
It's easier to start with a stiff bowl 

1072
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,480
and then weaken it off slightly. 

1073
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,760
Make sure you've got all the icing sugar in there, 

1074
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,560
then you break it down a bit. 

1075
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,080
Beautiful flavour, this orange icing. 

1076
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,640
Now look at the consistency. 

1077
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,640
- Just pouring.
- Lovely. 
- See, it does hold slightly. 

1078
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,560
And that will just drip down again with the apricot jam, 

1079
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,120
it will go in the gaps. 

1080
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,360
Exactly. And then just dab all around. 

1081
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,560
It gives an unusual colour. 

1082
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,960
It's normally white icing you have on the top, isn't it? 

1083
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,760
Yeah, I like to be something different, 

1084
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,760
and that little bit of orange goes really well 

1085
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,920
with the Chelsea bun. 

1086
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,960
You see it, drips down the cracks. That will be extra flavour. 

1087
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,840
Absolutely, yeah. It's fantastic this stuff, it really is. 

1088
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,400
It's got a loose base. Pop it on the top, 

1089
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,680
and then force down the outside. 

1090
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,840
Look at that! What a beautiful bake! 

1091
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,120
That looks wonderful. Then just tear and share after that, isn't it? 

1092
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:21,120
Exactly. So what you've got there are my Chelsea buns, 

1093
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,160
topped with a gorgeous orange icing. 

1094
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,600
Looks so tempting. 

1095
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,360
Would you have put me through if I gave you them on the Bake Off? 

1096
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,600
I'd give you ten out of ten. 

1097
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,560
Well, nine and a half. 

1098
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,800
Now, I'm going to rip into this fellow here. 

1099
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:44,960
You've left the pieces of apricot chunky and masses of fruit. 

1100
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,120
That's quite something, really good. 

1101
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,640
Follow the recipe originally 

1102
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,320
and then begin to tweak the flavours to the way you like it. 

1103
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,520
If you don't like orange, use lemon. 

1104
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,960
Use lime if you want. 

1105
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,440
You can change the fruit inside. You could put nuts in there. 

1106
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:07,840
I think you could actually do the same thing with any of our bakes. 

1107
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:12,960
But first of all follow what we say from beginning to end, 

1108
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,160
and then you can start to experiment. 

1109
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:20,000
And all we've done is help people onto the entry level of baking 

1110
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,480
and then send them on their way. 

1111
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,520
And good luck. 

1112
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,040
