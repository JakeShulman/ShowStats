1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,360
After weeks of furious whisking, caramelising and piping, 

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,480
we've seen the bakers struggle with strudel, 

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,560
design gingerbread constructions 

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,280
and battle with biscuits, pastries and doughs. 

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,000
- Amazing.
- I'm happy. 

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,480
Each week, the bakers are asked to complete three challenges 

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,920
but, as always, it is the technical challenge 

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,960
that sends fear throughout the Bake Off tent. 

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,520
Technical challenge. 

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,800
They are making the challenges harder and harder. 

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,560
To say it's a matter of luck would undermine everyone's efforts. 

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,200
It's like a Russian Roulette. 

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,320
Designed to reveal 

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,800
just who has enough baking experience, know-how and instinct 

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,320
that will impress even Mary and Paul. 

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,440
Mary's going to slap me in the face. 

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,280
The taste is not very appealing. 

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,840
- The texture's there...
- Hmm. 

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,360
..but the look is terrible. 

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,680
Oh, no! 

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,280
Ooh. 

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,720
There's nothing I can do. Everything's just gone to pot. 

23
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,960
That ticks the boxes, as they say. 

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,320
You've absolutely nailed that. 

25
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,000
Getting steadily more difficult, 

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,920
the judges were out to really test the bakers. 

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,600
Paul and I had to choose really difficult bakes for them. 

28
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,760
I knew if I found it tricky, they'll find it very tricky. 

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,560
But now it's time for Queen of Cakes, Mary Berry, 

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,440
and Prince of Pastry, Paul Hollywood, 

31
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,400
to get baking themselves. 

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,880
So, the tables have turned. 

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,640
I've really got to show that I can do it absolutely perfectly, 

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,320
but stopping at all the stages where everybody could go wrong. 

35
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,840
We're going to be there, taking you through the steps of making 

36
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,520
each of the technical challenges. 

37
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,840
So, nobody's got any excuse not to do it perfectly at home. 

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,880
Coming up - Mary's Queen of Puddings 

39
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,600
combines layers of rich baked custard and fruit jam 

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,920
with a frothy meringue crown. 

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,720
Paul's deliciously tempting recipe 

42
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,720
for homemade doughnuts bursting with jam. 

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,560
A British classic, teacakes, 

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,880
combining a crunchy biscuit and topped with soft meringue, 

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,840
all under a dome of shiny chocolate. 

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,480
Mary's recipe for a Fraisier, 

47
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,560
delicate layers of sponge sandwiched with the perfect creme patissiere, 

48
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,480
topped with marzipan and chocolate. 

49
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,160
Fondant fancies, the ultimate sweet treat 

50
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,560
of fondant icing, sponge and melted chocolate. 

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,400
And if you've ever wondered how to knead dough or pipe meringues, 

52
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,120
Mary and Paul will show us how to get the perfect results 

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,200
with their quick tips. 

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,920
Now it's my turn 

55
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,640
and I will go and play in the Bake Off tents. 

56
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,120
It's a lovely excuse to have a good cooking session. 

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,080
Halfway through the Bake Off 

58
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,840
and things began to steam up, as the bakers faced puddings. 

59
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,520
They had their hands full as they made sponge puddings 

60
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,720
and struggled with show-stopping strudels, 

61
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,640
but it was Mary's technical challenge 

62
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,720
that had them running scared. 

63
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,800
What we'd like you to make is... 

64
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,520
Queen of Puddings. 

65
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,320
It's layers of baked custard and jam topped with a chewy meringue. 

66
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,640
So... 

67
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,000
- on your marks...
- Get set... 
- ..good luck, and bake. 

68
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,600
There's always a certain amount of dread 

69
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,600
that you're going to make a prat of yourself on the technical challenge. 

70
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,840
I've never made jam before. 

71
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,640
That worries me a lot. 

72
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,720
I've known a few queens in my time, but never a Queen of Puddings. 

73
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,600
A timeless dessert made from breadcrumbs baked in custard 

74
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,160
with homemade jam and a crown of delicately peaked meringue. 

75
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,200
We're going to do a Queen of Puddings. It's a wonderful pudding. 

76
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,320
It's made from things that you're likely to have in the cupboard 

77
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,800
and it uses the whole egg, it uses up the breadcrumbs. 

78
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,080
It's a good pudding. 

79
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,560
But you're going to show us the definitive recipe 

80
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,720
that you invented back in the 1600s of how to actually make these... 

81
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,880
Cheeky! Cheeky, cheeky, as usual! 

82
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,480
So, to start off with, I'm going to butter the dish. 

83
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,560
Make sure you choose a dish that will go INSIDE your roasting dish. 

84
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,600
We're going to do it bain-marie, which just means 

85
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,880
we're going to have boiling water round the outside, 

86
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,480
so it doesn't cook too quickly. 

87
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,080
Prepare 75 grams of white breadcrumbs 

88
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,200
by blitzing them in a machine and pour into the buttered dish. 

89
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,880
Just put that in like that. 

90
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,840
Measure 50 grams of caster sugar and 25 grams of butter. 

91
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,040
It's a good idea to weigh the butter on top of the sugar 

92
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,600
because you've then got a clean bowl to weigh the next thing. 

93
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,360
So I need milk, 600 ml. 

94
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,840
So, into the pan, 

95
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,000
and I think it's best to use full-cream milk, 

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,960
and in goes the sugar and the butter. 

97
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,800
I'm going to add some lemon, only the zest. 

98
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,680
That addition of the lemon I think really adds to the custard. 

99
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,640
Orange is lovely in cakes 

100
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,440
but for this particular thing, 

101
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,320
I always add lemon. 

102
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Warm the milk until just hot, 

103
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,920
but not boiling. 

104
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,520
Separate three eggs and keep both the white and the yolk. 

105
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,600
You'll need the yolks for the custard now 

106
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,080
and the whites for the meringues later on. 

107
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,600
If you boil the milk now 

108
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,440
and you pour it straight on to the egg yolks, 

109
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,240
they'll immediately curdle 

110
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,440
and they won't be the thickening agent to the custard. 

111
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,000
So, first of all, get the egg yolks mixed together 

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,480
and then one little splash in to start with 

113
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,600
because if you put it all in, you won't get it smooth. 

114
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,680
Then in it goes. 

115
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,080
Then I'm going to pour that over the breadcrumbs. 

116
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,280
Leave that to soak. Then I'm going to make the jam. 

117
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,360
It's important to use equal quantity of fruit to sugar. 

118
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,040
So we've got some blackberries, some blueberries and some strawberries. 

119
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,840
Starting it off low 

120
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,480
and let the natural juice come out. 

121
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,120
But without the full instructions, 

122
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,440
making jam didn't come quite as naturally to our bakers. 

123
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,720
"Make the jam." 

124
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,440
That's detailed, isn't it, Mary? "Make the jam." 

125
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,680
I'm just trying to remember how to make jam. 

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,760
I'm trying to reduce it because the name jam suggests that, 

127
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,680
you know, it's quite thick. 

128
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,200
Every week, the technical challenge is a guessing game. 

129
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,320
As with all jams, you need equal amounts of sugar to fruit 

130
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,560
so with 200 grams of fruit there should be 200 grams of sugar. 

131
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,200
So I've turned the heat down a little 

132
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,560
and in goes the sugar 

133
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,960
and you've got to dissolve the sugar without boiling. 

134
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,600
And when it's dissolved, then boil rapidly 

135
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,440
until it is a jam consistency. 

136
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,920
Allow the jam to cool in the pan whilst you bake the custard. 

137
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,120
Pour hot water into the roasting tray around your custard dish 

138
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,040
and bake in a bain-marie for about 30 minutes at 150 fan. 

139
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,320
This is one occasion when you can keep opening the oven door 

140
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,400
and giving a little shake to see. 

141
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,960
- It just wants to be set. 
- You want that little bit of wobble. 

142
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,400
A little bit of wobble, 

143
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,560
and it will go on cooking as it comes out of the oven. 

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,760
That looks absolutely as it should do. 

145
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,000
It's really like cooking an egg custard 

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,280
but we've strengthened it with the breadcrumbs. 

147
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,640
No separation in it. 

148
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,040
And then you've really got to let that cool just a little 

149
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
before you put the jam on, 

150
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,000
otherwise the jam could mix with the custard. 

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,600
- Let's get on with the meringue.
- OK. 

152
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,400
Weigh out 175 grams of caster sugar 

153
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,600
which will be mixed in with your whisked egg whites. 

154
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,560
The eggs want to be fresh eggs. 

155
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,280
If an egg is old, say two weeks old, 

156
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,280
the white is runny and you don't get so much volume. 

157
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,960
If you use a hand mixer, 

158
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,760
big bowl and move it all the way round. 

159
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,160
But we've got a mixing machine, 

160
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,320
so put the eggs into the bowl 

161
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,360
and whisk it on full speed 

162
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,120
until it looks like cloud, and we've got a bit of that about today. 

163
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,920
Don't use a plastic bowl for whisking egg whites 

164
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,920
as they can retain a film of fat that can deflate the meringue. 

165
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,960
It isn't full volume yet, but it looks just like a floating cloud. 

166
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,080
- Yep.
- So at that stage, we start to add the sugar. 

167
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,640
And if you add it slowly, on full speed, 

168
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,400
it will get stiffer and stiffer and stiffer 

169
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,640
and it's very unlikely that you'll over-whip it, 

170
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,920
but most people under-whip it. 

171
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,680
Sugar not only adds sweetness, 

172
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,680
but it stabilises the egg whites by coating them 

173
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,920
so that they can be beaten for longer and not dry out. 

174
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,000
And that really is the beautiful stiff meringue 

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
coming up in peaks, 

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,560
I remember when we've done this before, the one thing you love to do 

177
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,880
is put it over my head. One day it will come all over me. 

178
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,520
- I'm sure it will.
- Go on. 

179
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,320
Let's just see if that day is today. 

180
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,960
Is it trickling down? No. 

181
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,240
Proper meringue. Perfect. 

182
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,920
No, nothing. I did try, Mary. 

183
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,760
- Did you give it a bit of a shake? 
- I did, actually. 

184
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,240
But the bakers weren't quite so confident in their own meringues. 

185
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,520
I get a bit scared with egg whites. I don't want to over whip it. 

186
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,120
I think you just need to whip it until it's, you know, 

187
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,200
quite stiff, so I'm just going to keep going. 

188
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,680
Oh, God, it's a bit runny. 

189
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,520
Hang on. Don't put that over my head, please, Ryan. 

190
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,000
Once your custard and jam are cooled and set, 

191
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,600
it's time to assemble your pudding. 

192
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,040
So, first of all, the jam going on. 

193
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,560
It's all about building the layers up now, isn't it? 

194
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,360
It is. Spread that very carefully over the top. 

195
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,200
You've got to be very delicate doing this 

196
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,840
because it's very easy to lift the custard up into the jam. 

197
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,240
That's just perfect. 

198
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,640
Then we've got the meringue to put on the top 

199
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,360
and I've found that it's best 

200
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,720
to put it on in sort of blobs to start with 

201
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,920
and then we can build it up from there. 

202
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,120
I'd be tempted just to dollop it on. 

203
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,840
I dare say you would, but having done this one or two times, 

204
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,400
I find that to do it sort of like that seems to work best. 

205
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,560
It looks as though I haven't got enough but I can assure you I have. 

206
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,360
In my very early days, 

207
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,360
I'd just finished making cakes 

208
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,840
and a lady rang up and said, 

209
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,320
"I like you because you're the only one 

210
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,240
"what's on TV that scrapes her bowls proper." 

211
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,120
So I'm now going to smooth that over using two spoons or a palette knife, 

212
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,280
and I'm going to spread that to the edges 

213
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,080
and then we can start to peak it. 

214
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,720
I think that looks really sort of homemade, don't you? 

215
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,160
- When you get the sort of peaks coming up.
- Mm. 

216
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,400
And that's just the right consistency for the meringue. 

217
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,200
There we are. Ready for the oven. 

218
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,600
You can see all the layers. 

219
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Lower the oven 20 degrees to 130 

220
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,080
and it'll take about 25 minutes. 

221
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,600
I don't really want to put the jam on yet. 

222
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,720
If I was at home, I'd wait another five or ten minutes 

223
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,320
but I think it would be worse to run out of time. 

224
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,960
I was worried if I plod a whole lot on 

225
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,280
and it will just go vroom, straight in. 

226
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,760
That just looks awful. Mary's going to slap me in the face. 

227
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,680
I'm a bit disappointed about the meringue. 

228
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,920
It kind of collapsed a bit, so it's a bit gooey. 

229
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,200
I was hoping to make it puffy and make peaks. 

230
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,680
Please be good. 

231
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,000
That looks better. 

232
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,880
It's the colour of ivory. 

233
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,200
So, the classic Queen of Puddings. 

234
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,560
A layer of lovely custard at the bottom, 

235
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,600
a bold layer of jam in the middle 

236
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,560
and a lovely thick layer of meringue, 

237
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,080
crispy on top, marshmallowy in the middle. 

238
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,880
It looks good enough to eat, Mary. 

239
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,200
That looks stunning, Mary. It really does. 

240
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,320
I love the way that meringue's all peaked. 

241
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,000
Would you like some? 

242
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I would like a scoop, please, Mary. 

243
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,760
It's all holding together nicely. 

244
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,440
Mmm! Oh, it's lovely. 

245
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,040
It's crispy. 

246
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,480
The custard's well set. 

247
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,880
I mean, really, for busy people, 

248
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,040
you can make the custard the day before 

249
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,240
and then just spread the jam over the top 

250
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,280
and put the meringue on the next day. 

251
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,000
Can I have some more, please, Mary? 

252
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,400
Of course you can. Oh, I'm so glad you like it. 

253
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,200
- There you are. A little bit of everything.
- Thanks, Mum. 

254
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,200
The seventh week of the Bake Off 

255
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,920
and the remaining bakers faced three sweet dough challenges, 

256
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,080
making signature regional sweet buns 

257
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,080
and show-stopping celebratory enriched loaves, 

258
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,520
and Paul was in his element 

259
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,960
as the bakers faced another of his tricky technical challenges. 

260
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,040
What we'd like you to make are jam doughnuts. 

261
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,880
Now, Mary and Paul are not only looking for consistency in size 

262
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,360
but also in jam distribution and colour. 

263
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,960
- On your marks...
- Get set... BOTH: ..Bake! 

264
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,800
I'm really frightened. 

265
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,000
It's going to be an experience, you know. 

266
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,160
It might not be a good experience. 

267
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,680
I really wish that I knew what I was doing. 

268
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,000
The technical challenge is sometimes, 

269
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,440
at the best of times, it's like a Russian Roulette. 

270
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,200
A fairground favourite, 

271
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,280
jam doughnuts made from hot balls of sweet dough 

272
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,040
filled with strawberry jam 

273
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,840
and rolled in caster sugar. 

274
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,440
Right, Mary. Doughnuts. 

275
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,240
It's a fairly straightforward method to making a doughnut, 

276
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,360
although a few stages that you've got to cover. 

277
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,680
Mix 500 grams of strong flour 

278
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,160
and 50 grams of caster sugar into a bowl. 

279
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,840
In fact, granulated, you can actually feel in the dough 

280
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,080
so the caster sugar's fine enough not to be felt 

281
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,280
once the liquid goes in. 

282
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,360
Add 40 grams of softened butter, 

283
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,240
10 grams of salt, 

284
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,040
14 grams of fast-action yeast and 130 mls of water 

285
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,560
into the same bowl. 

286
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,600
I'm also going to add two eggs to this as well 

287
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,320
and, again, it's an enriched dough. 

288
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,800
You need the eggs. It'll help to bind it together 

289
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,440
and give it a beautiful yellow colour inside. 

290
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,400
Then I'm going to get my hands in there initially 

291
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,880
and just gently turn the bowl 

292
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,000
and break down the egg 

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,560
until you can see it's actually starting to create 

294
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,200
a little form of dough like a paste. 

295
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,400
Now, you've added two sachets of yeast to 500 grams of flour. 

296
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,280
That's more than you would with bread. 

297
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,080
Yeah. It's an enriched dough. 

298
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,800
It's got eggs, butter and sugar in it, 

299
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,840
so it's going to need that extra bit of yeast to leaven it, 

300
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,000
to get it rising up. 

301
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Keep your milk in the other hand, which is 150 ml, 

302
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,760
and then gently begin to push the dough together. 

303
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,840
So the best way to add liquid to a mix 

304
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,000
is add about three quarters to it, mix it well 

305
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,080
and then drip feed in the rest. 

306
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,280
But this unusually wet dough 

307
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,800
was the first thing to catch out the bakers. 

308
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,480
My dough resembles some kind of swamp monster. 

309
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,920
I've put all the water in, but this just seems really weird, 

310
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
really sticky. 

311
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,440
It's very wet, which is good, it's nice to see wet dough. 

312
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,520
Wetter is better, as they say in the bread world. 

313
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,720
So this looks disgusting at the moment 

314
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,040
and if I work it properly it will stop being disgusting. 

315
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,240
I thought the dough was a little bit too wet 

316
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,320
so I'm putting more flour in. 

317
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,600
It's probably wrong. 

318
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,720
I'll probably get told off. 

319
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,800
I would describe kneading this doughnut dough 

320
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,000
as being quite like the gym. 

321
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,720
Slightly sweat-inducing, 

322
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,560
not my favourite. 

323
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,800
- You can feel how wet that dough is.
- Hmm. 

324
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,320
If there's one thing I've learnt from you, 

325
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,680
it is to make bread doughs, 

326
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,960
whether they're rich or normal bread doughs, 

327
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,200
to have it wet. 

328
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,160
- Yeah. It does make a difference. 
- It makes a better rise. 

329
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,560
Now, I'm using an enriched dough, so I'll use flour instead of oil. 

330
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,720
The wet, sticky mess goes into the middle. 

331
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,240
Coat the top with a little bit of flour, 

332
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,720
roll it round for a bit, 

333
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,880
and then heel of the palm in the middle, 

334
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,120
and initially I'm just going to coat it with some flour 

335
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,640
and then begin to roll it up. 

336
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,360
Now, all I'm doing here is, 

337
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,400
A, mixing all the ingredients together, but, 

338
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,720
B, you begin to develop the gluten, 

339
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,480
so the more I work that, 

340
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,160
the smoother that will get and the more of a stretch I get. 

341
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,600
And you can feel how soft it is, 

342
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,720
but it's the speed that prevents it from sticking too much. 

343
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,520
DOUGH SLAPS AGAINST TABLE 

344
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,760
And you can see it's getting smoother already. 

345
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,600
Any aggression, take it out on the dough. 

346
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,240
Well, please do. 

347
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,600
There you have the beauty of using a mixer 

348
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,720
and it's actually very possible to over-mix in a mixer, 

349
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,120
using a dough hook. 

350
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,640
The more they manipulate this then it just starts to break apart, 

351
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,000
it gets too glutinous. 

352
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,520
By hand, very difficult to over-mix, over-knead. 

353
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,240
Have a got with that. Go on, Mary. You chuck it down. 

354
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,360
Be brutal with it. 

355
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,520
That's it. From up here. That's it. 

356
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,120
Your cakes have just dropped in the oven. Think about that. 

357
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,320
That's the one. 

358
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,360
- You see how smooth that is now? 
- It looks remarkable. 

359
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,600
- A totally different dough to the one we saw a minute ago.
- Less wet. 

360
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,400
It's stretchy. Yeah. 

361
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,560
It's lovely. 

362
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,840
Now, that will go into a bowl, 

363
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,080
cling film that. 

364
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,120
You're making it technically airtight. 

365
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,880
It stops the draught getting to it, 

366
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,120
forming a skin and preventing it from growing. 

367
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,000
Leave the dough to prove for about an hour 

368
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,440
until it's doubled in size. 

369
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,840
Well, there it is, Mary. 

370
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,120
If I take this off, that is full of air. 

371
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,920
Absolutely... 

372
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,000
..full of air. It just bursts like a balloon. 

373
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,240
- You can see the structure of it as well.
- Hmm. 

374
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,080
The air holes of the doughnut. 

375
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,800
It's a bit like netting. 

376
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,200
Stringy, yeah. Bit like webs. 

377
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,280
Get that dough out into the flour. It's a very wet dough. 

378
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,400
You see how stretchy it is, as well? 

379
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,760
Coat it in flour. 

380
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,440
Now we need ten doughnuts. 

381
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,440
Get your little dough balls and then roll them into a ball, 

382
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
either in your hand or on the bench. 

383
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,440
It is tricky and it is a very, very wet dough. 

384
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,880
But I do like the feel of that dough. 

385
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,680
- That one's not too bad, is it?
- No. 

386
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,880
Then just leave it like that, cover it up with any bag 

387
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,080
and they'll double in size. 

388
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,000
That will tell you that they're ready to go in a fryer. 

389
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,080
Paul's doughnut challenge ran rings around some of the bakers. 

390
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,040
Quite splodgy, pancakey little badgers. 

391
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,280
Not sure that's exactly how they're supposed to be. 

392
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,720
My dough's really pretty wet and the dough's gone a bit flat. 

393
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,320
Technical challenge... 

394
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,280
I have no idea how these babies should look. 

395
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,920
I'm pushing it down a little bit, 

396
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,400
otherwise it'll have a little tan mark round its midriff. 

397
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,520
There they are, Mary. 

398
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,520
You see they spring back. Finger in, it bounces back. 

399
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,560
That is an indication that it's ready. 

400
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,400
Now, the fat is set at 160. 

401
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,080
- It's going to take roughly five minutes each side, OK?
- Yes. 

402
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,000
Grab your dough ball, 

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,840
drop it into the fat, 

404
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,320
grab your dough ball, 

405
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,520
drop it in the fat. 

406
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,040
These would normally take two at a time anyway. 

407
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,400
And this is the safest way of frying it, and you must, 

408
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,200
if you're doing it at home and you haven't got a deep fat fryer, 

409
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,960
have a really deep pan and always watch it. 

410
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,120
Yeah. Absolutely. 

411
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,560
You're looking for a slight oblong, not a perfect ball 

412
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,360
because it means it was under-proved, 

413
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,040
and not a flat disc because that means it was over-proved. 

414
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,000
When they go in the first time they do exactly half 

415
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,040
- and then you turn them over after five minutes...
- Yeah. 

416
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,880
..and you get that light line of a lighter colour in the middle. 

417
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,400
- Well, if you look inside here now, can you see the colour?
- Oh, yes. 

418
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,120
And there's the white line that runs round the middle. 

419
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,560
Now, those have had the allotted time. 

420
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,800
Just drain them off a little bit, take the extra bit of fat off, 

421
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,520
and then just roll it in the sugar. 

422
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,440
Dust them off with your fingers. 

423
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,600
Two more for the Hollywood Doughnut Factory. 

424
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,520
Ten little beauties. 

425
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,720
We can't jam them now. The dough is still cooking 

426
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,240
because of the fat that's round it, 

427
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,240
so what we need to do is cool these down, inject them with the jam 

428
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,080
and they'll be perfect and good to eat, 

429
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,600
so a little bit of patience, Mary. 

430
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,960
But the bakers had been patient and were ready for their injections. 

431
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,040
It's part-baking, part doctors-and-nurses, isn't it, this? 

432
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,080
It is. 

433
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,160
Doughnut doom. 

434
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,400
- I think you might have got... 
- I've got a blockage. 
- It's literally a jam. 

435
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,000
Oh, this is hideous. 

436
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Do you know what? I'm so pleased. 

437
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,200
I kind of don't care what Paul thinks 

438
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,040
because I am so proud of those. 

439
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,160
There they are, Mary. Now it's time for jamming. 

440
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,200
Get your doughnut. 

441
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,240
Pop a knife in, roughly half-way, a little bit of a wiggle. 

442
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,840
Get your jam which you'll put in a bag here. 

443
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,720
Just cut the end off. 

444
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,240
That's a pretty good tip of yours, to tie the end 

445
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,520
so it doesn't come out all over your hands. 

446
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,440
One. Two. That's enough. 

447
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,160
It's basically been sieved. 

448
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,120
So it's a strawberry jam, or, traditionally, raspberry jam. 

449
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,400
And another one. And obviously, you could fill these with anything. 

450
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,200
Custard. Apple puree works well. 

451
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,760
Jam is certainly the most popular one. 

452
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,800
But don't worry about the jam leaking out of it. It just means 

453
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,200
you've really got lots in there. Great colour, filled with jam 

454
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,280
- and we'll try some in a bit. 
- Can't wait. 

455
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,400
Paul, I think those are magnificent. 

456
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,600
They're all a beautiful colour with the white ring round it, 

457
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,360
full of jam, bursting with flavour. 

458
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,360
- Do you want some with some jam, I take it?
- Oh, definitely. Yes. 

459
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
Beautiful inside. 

460
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,120
Oh, thank you. 

461
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,280
It is absolutely beautiful. 

462
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,120
It's so soft and yet that lovely sugary outside... 

463
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,760
I don't think anybody could ever resist those. 

464
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,240
I'm quite certain that everybody now knows how to make 

465
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,880
a very good doughnut. 

466
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,560
And now Paul's top tip for kneading dough perfectly. 

467
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,880
Flour on the bench. 

468
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,000
Dough. Heel of the palm. Fingers. 

469
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,080
Gently tap the dough down, 

470
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,320
fold over the top bit and begin to roll up. 

471
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,280
And all I'm doing is incorporating all the ingredients together. 

472
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,680
This will begin to get smoother and smoother. 

473
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,040
A little bit more flour, just to stop the dough from sticking 

474
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,640
too much to your hands and the bench. Massage your dough. 

475
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,560
You're massaging with the heel of your palm and your fingers, 

476
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,680
beginning to build that gluten up, the bonding agent in all breads. 

477
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,200
Hold down the base, heel of your palm in, stretch, 

478
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,280
fold it up, pull, rip. 

479
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:43,720
And then repeat this process for about five, ten minutes 

480
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,600
and you'll feel it getting stronger and more and more elastic. 

481
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,960
Speed will come with practice. 

482
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,520
And I can feel this beginning to go. 

483
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:58,120
By hand, you can never overdo it, but you can certainly under-do it. 

484
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,880
But kneading is all about power and technique. 

485
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,480
Leave nature to do the rest. 

486
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,120
Week eight of the bake off and the remaining five bakers were tested on their biscuit knowledge. 

487
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,520
They were challenged to make savoury crispbreads 

488
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,960
and spectacular gingerbread structures. 

489
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,680
Thinking that the judges couldn't possibly find anything too hard to throw at them, 

490
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,080
Paul's technical challenge made them very nearly crumble 

491
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,640
under the pressure. 

492
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,040
Today we're asking you to make six chocolate teacakes, 

493
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,680
an iconic biscuit. 

494
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,640
- So, on your marks...
- Get set... 
- BOTH: ..Bake. 

495
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,680
Ah! 

496
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,040
Marshmallow chocolate teacakes. 

497
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,400
OK. I know them, I see them in the shops. 

498
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,560
- They're a Scottish classic. 
- I've had many of them, but never made one. 

499
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,280
My children would love these 

500
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,120
so if they turn out all right, I will make them. 

501
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,080
Homemade chocolate teacakes, 

502
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,040
combining a delicate dome of moulded chocolate 

503
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,600
filled with a light marshmallow meringue 

504
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,920
and supported by a firm biscuit base. 

505
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,480
Paul, quarterfinal technical challenge. 

506
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,240
Marshmallow teacakes. I think they're really tricky to make. 

507
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,280
They are unbelievably tricky. 

508
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,440
So we're going to start by melting the chocolate. 

509
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,440
Melt 200 grams of chocolate over a bain-marie, 

510
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,440
making sure that the bowl does not touch the boiling water. 

511
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,240
Here's our chocolate. Now, it's beginning to cool and set. 

512
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,920
Now, this is a good temperature to have it at. 

513
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,840
It's warm to the hands. 

514
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,440
As it comes into contact with the mould, 

515
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,760
it actually begins to cool very, very quickly. 

516
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,680
I'm just starting off with a blob in each one. 

517
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,160
Allow that to cool slightly. It'll help you then build up the walls. 

518
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,360
Begin to bring up the chocolate up the sides of the mould. 

519
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,880
Take your time doing this. Don't rush it. 

520
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,080
And you've got to get that just right 

521
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,080
- because if it was too hot it would run down the mould.
- Exactly. 

522
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,640
So you've just got to get it runny, so that it clings to the side. 

523
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,160
Exactly. You don't want to make it too thin 

524
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,760
because essentially it's going to be the cage that goes over the marshmallow. 

525
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,160
That looks pretty well covered now 

526
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,360
and you've got that slightly thicker layer at the top 

527
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,480
- which should make it turn out well. 
- Exactly. 

528
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,120
Put the moulds aside to set, but don't put them in the fridge 

529
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,280
or the chocolate will discolour and loose its shine. 

530
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,680
I need to get it done now, so the chocolate cools. 

531
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,120
If the chocolate doesn't hold, you won't have a teacake. 

532
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,120
You'll just have a big, messy thing on a plate. 

533
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,960
I'm just going to do it my way and it'll be fine. 

534
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,440
You're the Frank Sinatra of Bake Off. 

535
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,880
# I baked it my way. # 

536
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,480
I want it to be a slow pourer than that 

537
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,200
so that it will stick to the sides. 

538
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,200
I think it's a bit like if you make Easter eggs, 

539
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,240
the best thing to do is to put a thin layer on, let it dry, 

540
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,440
and if you don't think it's thick enough, just put another layer on. 

541
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,000
Gut feeling says don't put them in the fridge, 

542
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,680
unless I'm running out of time and they're not going to be hard, 

543
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,840
in which case I'll abandon my gut instinct and put them in the fridge. 

544
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,840
What I'm making now is a biscuit. 

545
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,960
A good, earthy, crispy biscuit to go at the bottom of the marshmallow. 

546
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,040
Measure out 50 grams of plain flour and 50 grams of whole-wheat flour. 

547
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,560
Then add 25 grams of caster sugar, 25 grams of butter 

548
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,280
and half a teaspoon of baking powder. 

549
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,360
- 25 and 25.
- Just be patient. I've got to take a little bit. That's it. 

550
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,440
- That's one thing I'm not good at. 
- I know. 

551
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,920
- Terribly impatient. It's one of my flaws.
- I have learned it. 

552
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,360
Could you put a little pinch of salt in there as well? 

553
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,320
Thank you. That's about right. Yeah. Lovely. 

554
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,880
I'm going to get my hands in there and begin to break up the butter. 

555
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,760
Now, I've got that crumbed quite well. 

556
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,000
The butter's gone into the flours very well. 

557
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,160
I just need that little bit of liquid now to bind that together. 

558
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,960
- One tablespoonful of milk. 
- This is quite a dry biscuit. 

559
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,200
So you begin to crush and pick up all the mixture together. 

560
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,600
Tip the mixture onto a surface and bring together into a ball 

561
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,840
before rolling it out to about half-a-centimetre thickness. 

562
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,040
Get your cutter. We obviously need six. 

563
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,560
You want them quite hard. You don't want that soft biscuit 

564
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,880
when you bite into a marshmallow. 

565
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,640
Put on a non-stick baking tray and into the oven 

566
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,960
for about 10 to 12 minutes at 150 degrees fan. 

567
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,120
Biscuits have been out now for a good 10, 15 minutes. 

568
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,320
Could you just trim the biscuits slightly with that? 

569
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,920
- Why am I doing that?
- Because you've got baking powder in there. 

570
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,760
So what's happened is the biscuit has grown just beyond 

571
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,920
the base of the teacake. So what will happen is 

572
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,960
it won't be able to go inside the mould. So it's a little trick. 

573
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,600
What do I do if I crack it now? 

574
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,400
If you break them, I'm just going to go 

575
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,200
and you're going to have to do them all over again. 

576
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,720
This is one of the most tricky things I've done, 

577
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,280
especially when you're standing over me. 

578
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,360
Now you know how they feel in the bake off. 

579
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,640
Don't you worry. I'm doing it really, really carefully. There. 

580
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,520
- It's good, that, Mary. 
- I can be quick now and do them all, 

581
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,080
- but I was nervous of that first one. 
- Now, while you've been doing that, 

582
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,400
I've been melting the remaining chocolate. 

583
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,800
You see how loose that is? I'm going to drop each biscuit into there, 

584
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,120
give it a bit of a coating. 

585
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,840
Slide it onto the wire. That's one biscuit. 

586
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,920
I can't resist tasting this cos it's beautifully short. 

587
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,160
- Could you patch up any little bits that have no chocolate on there? 
- Oh, I'm very good at patching up. 

588
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,000
All I'm trying to do is just put as much chocolate on, 

589
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,680
evenly as I can. 

590
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,520
Last one going in. 

591
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,560
OK, Mary. We've got our component parts. 

592
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,880
Now we've got to start the meringue. 

593
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,120
This technically is a Swiss meringue, 

594
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,920
but we're adding golden syrup to it. 

595
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,960
It'll thicken the whole thing up and give it a beautiful shine. 

596
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,200
Now, to start with, I need three egg whites. 

597
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,720
- I'm doing it the old-fashioned way with my hands.
- Making a right mess. 

598
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,360
- I love making a mess.
- Yeah(!) 

599
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,160
Now, while I'm doing this, could you weigh me up 150 grams of caster sugar, please? 

600
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,120
- Right.
- That'll do, Mary. Thank you very much. 

601
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,800
Pop this straight into the whites. 

602
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,080
I'm also going to add half the seeds of a vanilla pod, 

603
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,400
six tablespoons of golden syrup. One. 

604
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,360
Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. 

605
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,960
- Approximately.
- Approximately. 

606
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
And I need a pinch of salt, please, Mary. 

607
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,400
A little bit of salt in there will just dampen things down a bit 

608
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,760
so it's not too sweet. 

609
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,000
Whisk the mixture over a gentle heat of a bain-marie 

610
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,560
for about six minutes, making a very stable meringue... 

611
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,160
for most of the bakers, anyway. 

612
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,160
I've never made marshmallow before. 

613
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,120
I think it's some kind of Swiss meringue, by the looks of it. 

614
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,640
I think everyone's finding this quite tricky, aren't they? 

615
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,000
So I'm not on my own. 

616
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,960
Oh! Well, look, it's rather nice, actually. And it's quite stiff. 

617
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,920
My first encounter with marshmallow. 

618
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,680
But then it was time to put the whole thing together. 

619
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,800
Oh, lordy. Too much marshmallow. 

620
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,160
I need to spoon some out. 

621
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,320
If I pull off six teacakes, you know, that's all right. 

622
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,680
We have our domes, we have our biscuit base, we have our meringue 

623
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,480
and we have our chocolate that'll bind the whole thing together. 

624
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,280
Pipe in the meringue into the base. 

625
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,400
You want to take it about three-quarters of the way up. 

626
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,000
Don't overfill it. Otherwise, when the biscuit goes in, 

627
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,640
the meringue's just going to pour out. 

628
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,520
And the next stage is a little bit of chocolate just on the meringue. 

629
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,880
This will help the biscuit bind to the meringue. 

630
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,200
- That's just pure, melted chocolate. 
- It's just pure melted chocolate. 

631
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,920
What you've got to do is just run round the outside of each one, 

632
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,640
just putting a little bit of chocolate. 

633
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,000
This is actually where the bottom of the biscuit will bind 

634
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,880
with the dome of the chocolate. 

635
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,920
And the whole thing should become one. OK. There we go. 

636
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,480
Get each biscuit, pop it into there. 

637
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,080
And initially, just leave it in there for the second. 

638
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,960
Ideally, you don't want to put them in the fridge cos it'll oxidise 

639
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,600
and turn the chocolate, you know, that off colour. 

640
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,920
Put a bit of pressure on there cos you've got that bit of give... 

641
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,720
- Yep.
- ..where it hits the marshmallow. 

642
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,080
And it doesn't matter a bit that you've got fingerprints on there. 

643
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,560
- It'll be at the bottom. 
- It's underneath.
- Exactly. 

644
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,880
Bit of pressure... 

645
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,880
and there we have the bases finally in contact 

646
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,440
with the marshmallow. 

647
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,680
Leave your chocolate teacakes to set firmly in their mould 

648
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,440
before attempting to turn them out. 

649
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,400
SHE GASPS 

650
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,640
They're not ready! 

651
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,520
That's the way to do it. 

652
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,040
- SUE: Ooh, my word. You've made a teacake.
- I didn't think I'd ever make a teacake. 

653
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,360
I don't know whether to eat it or set up a shrine in honour of it. 

654
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,640
That's beautiful. 

655
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,960
SHE GASPS 

656
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,800
So, yes, so far, so good. 

657
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,840
- CATHRYN:
- Oh, no. Look! No. Oh, my giddy aunt. 

658
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,520
Oh, no. 

659
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,240
Well done. 

660
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,240
- Now we've got to release it from the mould.
- I'm glad it's you, not me! 

661
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,880
You've got to put a bit of pressure on the top. Lovely. 

662
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,040
And you shouldn't need to touch the actual dome. 

663
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,240
It's popping out really nicely. 

664
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,960
Yeah, lovely. 

665
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,240
That is sheer perfection. 

666
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,240
Wow. So beautifully formed, aren't they? 

667
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:54,040
Mmm. Honestly, when you look inside, rather soft marshmallow, 

668
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,560
lovely crisp biscuit 

669
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,920
and an ample share of chocolate on top. 

670
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,760
You've got it all over your moustache, young man. 

671
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,000
That's the way it should be. That's a proper chocolate teacake 

672
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,880
- and I hope everybody at least tries to make one.
- It's absolutely lovely. 

673
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,840
And now Mary's twist on piping the perfect meringues. 

674
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,040
For special occasions, you may well want to pipe meringue 

675
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,080
and there's a bit of a skill to it. When you ice a cake, you fold it, 

676
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,760
but when you're doing a lot of mixture like this, you twist it. 

677
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,920
You start with the bag like a soldier, upright. 

678
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,960
There's a huge tendency to have it like that 

679
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,000
and you'd get a one-sided meringue. So first of all squeeze the bag 

680
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,920
and go round in a circle. 

681
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,400
Then you get to that point and it's not coming up, you do down. 

682
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,960
Round the outside 

683
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,000
and down to finish. 

684
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,800
So, continue in that fashion. 

685
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,760
Keeping it upright, going round in a circle, then down at the end. 

686
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,040
Plenty of pressure in the bag. There we are. 

687
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,480
With only four bakers remaining and the final in sight, 

688
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,480
the bakers grappled with petit fours 

689
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,800
and with choux pastry gateaux. 

690
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,280
But it was Mary's technical challenge 

691
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,920
that brought a dose of French sophistication to the Bake Off tent. 

692
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,920
OK. Bakers, we can now reveal to you that we would like you, please, 

693
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:31,360
to cook the all-time classic French celebration cake, the Fraisier. 

694
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,800
Now, this has got to be visually stunning, OK? 

695
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,240
It's all about the layers of sponge, strawberry and creme patissiere. 

696
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,440
So, on your marks. 

697
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,760
Get set. 

698
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,920
- Bake.
- Bake. 

699
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,240
I'm looking forward to it. I'm going to do what I instinctively feel 

700
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,040
is right, but I need to go back and read the instructions for a start. 

701
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,160
I read through the recipe and I can't quite visualise it, 

702
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,840
which isn't really a good sign. 

703
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,680
I know what one should look like, but I don't actually know 

704
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,440
if I can do it, so let's see. 

705
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,680
A Genoese sponge, sliced thinly 

706
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,880
and layered with enriched creme patissiere, 

707
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,880
edged with a crown of sliced strawberries. 

708
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,240
Fraisier cake. I've never made one in my life. 

709
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,280
It is really, really special. It's tricky to make, 

710
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,400
but it is one of the most delicious cakes you'll ever make. 

711
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,960
Visually, it looks stunning. I'm going to show you 

712
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,080
- how to do it perfectly. 
- Go ahead, then. 

713
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,880
First of all, roll out a thin disc of marzipan 

714
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,400
and draw around the base of the cake tin 

715
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,080
so that the circle will perfectly fit on the top of your cake. 

716
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,920
Place on a baking tray and leave to chill in the fridge 

717
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,280
whilst you make the Genoese sponge. 

718
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:52,360
Now, a classic Genoese is just eggs with flour and sugar and butter 

719
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,760
and you make it over hot water. 

720
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,120
If you've got a powerful machine, you can do it just by whisking 

721
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,320
the eggs and sugar to start with. 

722
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,920
Crack four eggs into a bowl and get all the zest off two lemons. 

723
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,840
You will need their juice for the lemon syrup later. 

724
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,920
Measure out 125 grams of caster sugar and add to the eggs. 

725
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,560
Mix it on full power so that you get good volume. 

726
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,400
There they are. That's it. 

727
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,960
Now you can see it's lovely and thick. You can over-beat it. 

728
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,960
If you get it really firm, almost like meringue, 

729
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,360
you won't get the flour in. 

730
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,440
Sift in 125 grams of self-raising flour, a little bit at a time. 

731
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,640
If you add all the flour at once, 

732
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,720
it's likely to go in in pockets, 

733
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,720
so just a little like that. 

734
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,640
When I made this when I was trained, we used plain flour 

735
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,800
- and you used just the volume of the eggs to rise the sponge.
- Yeah. 

736
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,240
But I find now we all use self-raising flour, 

737
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,240
why not use it and get the extra rise 

738
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,080
and you know it works every time. 

739
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:01,480
Add the melted but slightly cooled butter to the sponge mixture. 

740
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,800
If added whilst hot, you'll lose the volume of the mix. 

741
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,040
It's melted, but it's not runny, not oily, just very, very soft. 

742
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,120
At this stage, it just looks like a normal, whisked sponge 

743
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,360
that you would use for a Swiss roll, 

744
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,320
but adding the butter makes it a Genoese. 

745
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,400
Gentle folding mixture to get all that in. 

746
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,840
This is the danger point because if you go on working in the butter, 

747
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,520
the volume will go down and you won't get such a good rise. 

748
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,800
Gently pour the mixture into a greased and lined cake tin. 

749
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,880
Don't pour the mixture into the tin from a great height 

750
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,840
because the air bubbles will be stretched and burst. 

751
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,960
Do it close to the tin. 

752
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,640
If you do see a little bit of flour in it, just give it a little stir. 

753
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,440
It goes in the oven at 160 fan, that's four gas, 

754
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,760
and it'll take about 35 minutes. 

755
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,360
Looks good, Mary. 

756
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,280
Oh, good. Sigh of relief. 

757
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,920
You can tell the cake is baked as it will shrink away 

758
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,400
from the sides of the tin and will spring back when pressed. 

759
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,040
And you expect that slightly roundedness with a Genoese. 

760
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,000
Leave the cake in the tin to cool whilst you make the lemon syrup. 

761
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,880
Juice the two lemons that were zested earlier 

762
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,440
and measure out 75 grams of caster sugar. 

763
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,160
Heat together in 70mls of water until it's all dissolved. 

764
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,040
Leave that to cool as you make your enriched creme patissiere. 

765
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:37,400
I'm going to start off by putting 600ml of milk into the pan here. 

766
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,240
Then I'm going to put a vanilla pod into the milk 

767
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,920
and those seeds are going to add flavour. 

768
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,800
Heat the milk until just below boiling point. 

769
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,120
Measure out 180 grams of caster sugar 

770
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,320
and 100 grams of cornflour to thicken it. 

771
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,040
I mean, I use a lot of creme patissiere 

772
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,160
when I'm making Danish pastries, you know. 

773
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,840
I think it tastes so good. 

774
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,880
Oh, I think it's lovely. 

775
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,880
And if you get the consistency right, it cuts through like a dream. 

776
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,160
Now, I've found that in order to get this beautifully smooth, 

777
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,840
it's a good idea to coat the cornflour in the sugar, 

778
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,640
otherwise the cornflour can go in lumps. 

779
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,320
So that's just mixing it together, like that, before the eggs go in. 

780
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,440
Then I'm going to add four eggs and two egg yolks. 

781
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,480
So there we've got the four eggs in there, 

782
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,560
two extra yolks. That's just to enrich it. 

783
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,720
And you just go on mixing until it's really, really smooth. 

784
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,720
That's really well mixed. There's no flecks of cornflour. 

785
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,760
- It does help to put that sugar and cornflour in first.
- Yeah. 

786
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,680
Pour the hot milk onto the cold egg mixture 

787
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,120
so that the eggs don't scramble. 

788
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,760
You can use a sieve to catch the vanilla pod and keep whisking. 

789
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,280
pour back into the saucepan and stir continuously 

790
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,680
so that it doesn't go lumpy. 

791
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,000
Even though there's a lot of egg in there, 

792
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,920
the cornflour is stabilising that and it will gradually thicken. 

793
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,800
Whilst Mary's creme patissiere might be thickening, 

794
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,360
the bakers' nerves were not so set. 

795
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,600
I might have to make this again. I don't want to take any risks with it. 

796
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,480
This is a really, really complicated recipe. 

797
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,400
It's curdled. I'm not using it. 

798
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,680
I'll keep it just in case the next one's worse. 

799
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,040
Normally with creme patissiere, 

800
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,880
you're looking for a medium thickness. 

801
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,840
But in this instance, because the strawberries are going to be 

802
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,880
set within it, it needs to be thicker. 

803
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,880
I'm sure, you know, a perfect baker wouldn't do what I've just done 

804
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,680
with mine, but I'm not perfect. I'm a human being. 

805
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,840
- I think it's there, Mary.
- Right. 

806
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,840
I've just got the addition of the 150 grams of butter 

807
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,560
that's slightly softened. Just drop that all in in one go. 

808
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,000
And then some kirsch, about a tablespoon. 

809
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
If you haven't got kirsch, you could use... 

810
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,920
Limoncello would be nice. Brandy. Whatever's in the cupboard. 

811
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,800
And now we need to take that out and put it to cool. 

812
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,320
I find it's better to put it in something shallow 

813
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,400
and then it cools quickly. 

814
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,520
So once that's cooled down a bit, we'll put it in the fridge 

815
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,160
to become really firm. 

816
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,400
Now the cake should be cooled. Shall we have it out of the tin? 

817
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,400
It certainly is cool. 

818
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,160
Right. Spring-form tin. 

819
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,520
Take off the paper from the bottom. 

820
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,440
Now for the exciting part. We're going to assemble the cake. 

821
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Grease your cake tin and line it with greaseproof paper or acetate. 

822
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,400
This is what will give the Fraisier cake its distinctive edges 

823
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,800
once assembled. 

824
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,080
Acetate is perfect for lining this, but not everybody's got it at home. 

825
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,040
I've tried it just lining the tin with cling film. 

826
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,480
That's absolutely fine. Or you can use foil that's lined with parchment. 

827
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,960
Now it's time to cut your cooled sponge in half. 

828
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,880
So you put your hand flat and get eye level... 

829
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,280
And then what I do is I turn the cake and move it round 

830
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,080
as I'm doing the knife 

831
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,000
and then go through to the middle a bit later. That's it. 

832
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,640
Put the bottom half of the sponge back in the lined cake tin 

833
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,240
and brush with half of the lemon syrup. 

834
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,800
I'm going to get a spoon 

835
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,600
and squash that down so that it really does get into the sides. 

836
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,360
Now we come to the strawberry part. 

837
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,480
It's essential to cut the bottom off and have a neat slice 

838
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,720
and this will go next to the acetate. 

839
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,280
- Yup.
- Pressing it firmly down onto the sponge. 

840
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,240
I'm absolutely squashing them as tightly as I can to each other. 

841
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,880
You notice how the very last one I squished in 

842
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,800
and they're very, very firm against the side. 

843
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,880
Put the chilled creme patissiere into a piping bag 

844
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,840
and pipe it onto the exposed layer of sponge in the tin 

845
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,040
- so that it is all completely covered.
- Can I have a go, Mary? 

846
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,040
- No, because you're going to show me up. You can do it ten times quicker. 
- I love piping.
- I know. 

847
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,440
Well, I'm going to let you pipe the top, the chocolate part. 

848
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,760
Right. That is completely covered. 

849
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,000
Now we're going to just go between the strawberries, 

850
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,280
sort of like that, all the way round. 

851
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,280
Now, the next move is to put the chopped strawberries 

852
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,640
into the middle here. 

853
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,560
- So the layers are building up. 
- They are. 

854
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,600
And now I'm going to put the rest of the creme patissiere 

855
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,960
all over the top of that. 

856
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,160
So that's perfect. And now we come to the final layer. 

857
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,160
So just turn that upside down onto the top there. 

858
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,720
- It gives you a nice flat top, doesn't it?
- It does. 

859
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,880
I'm pressing that down well. 

860
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,600
So we used half the sugar syrup on the first sponge 

861
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,000
and I'm now using half the lemon syrup on top. 

862
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,680
Then take a spoon and just press that down, 

863
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,280
just so as it's level, and then we need the marzipan. 

864
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,960
- Do you remember we put the marzipan in the fridge?
- Yup. 

865
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,840
I think I'll be able to lift that off in one piece cos it's so cold, 

866
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,840
like that, and slip it on the top. 

867
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,720
And that is a perfect fit. 

868
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,480
Now you want to put that back in the fridge 

869
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,600
to be really firm before we turn it out and decorate it. 

870
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,880
But without knowing what the finished cake looked like, 

871
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,320
the bakers found putting it together harder than expected. 

872
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,760
I can't do it. 

873
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,560
Ooh! 

874
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,720
So in France, it's nearly always decorated with chocolate. 

875
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,760
How about you having a go making some shapes? 

876
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,000
They don't have to be perfect, you know, 

877
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,960
but the spirals do look quite effective. 

878
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,360
It always looks better to use plain chocolate rather than milk chocolate. 

879
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,040
- It also holds up better. 
- It's your artistic flair 

880
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,160
coming out on top of a cake. 

881
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,240
Let the chocolate swirls harden quickly in the fridge 

882
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,000
whilst you release your cake from the tin and start to decorate. 

883
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,520
- It's important to pipe quite thick ones.
- Yeah. 

884
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:53,040
Now, this is the one cake that you must keep in the fridge all the time. 

885
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,200
That's it. 

886
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,960
Now all that's needed is a nice dusting of icing sugar 

887
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,640
and that would be wonderful for any celebration. 

888
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,120
Doesn't need any cream. Just as it is. 

889
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,320
Absolutely. 

890
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,760
- Looks great, that, Mary.
- I think we ought to try it, don't you? 

891
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,080
I think we should, Mary. 

892
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,200
It's a shame to cut into it. 

893
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,800
How about that? 

894
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,600
- We ought to share that. Can I just take a little?
- I don't think so! 

895
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,720
- OK. I'll take myself. 
- No, it's all right. It's all right. 

896
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,560
Do you want some of this, Mary? The strawberries, 

897
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,320
the creme patissiere and then the last thing you hit 

898
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,320
is that marzipan, which I think works really well. 

899
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,240
It's so beautiful when you've finished and, of course, 

900
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,400
it tastes absolutely wonderful. 

901
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,240
- I totally agree, Mary. It's gorgeous.
- Mmm. 

902
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,240
For the final week of the Bake Off, the bakers had to supply the food 

903
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,600
for the village fete, from perfect puff pastry pithiviers 

904
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,680
in the Signature Challenge to chiffon cake showstoppers. 

905
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,040
As the last technical challenge of the Bake Off, Mary and Paul 

906
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,360
chose to test the bakers' mettle with volume and consistency 

907
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,800
where size definitely mattered. 

908
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,680
What we're asking you to do is to make... 

909
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,240
and ice... 

910
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,840
25... 

911
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,960
fondant fancies, a square of delicate light sponge, 

912
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,480
a dome of butter cream, all encased in a glossy fondant. 

913
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,640
- On your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake.
- Bake. 

914
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,680
It's baking on the hoof while still producing a really good product. 

915
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,080
I'm really excited because I've always wanted to make fondant fancies, 

916
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,640
but I'm nervous because they are difficult little creatures to do. 

917
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,720
This is about really professional finish. 

918
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,520
Who would ever make a fondant fancy? Maybe I'll want to after this. 

919
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,920
A sweet treat of perfectly-shaped squares of cake, 

920
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,240
covered in runny, fondant icing and chocolate. 

921
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,920
Will you show us, Mary? Show us how to do your fancies. 

922
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,960
We're going to start off with a classic sponge base. 

923
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,480
Crack four eggs into a mixing bowl 

924
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,320
and measure 225 grams of caster sugar, 

925
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,320
225 grams of self-raising flour 

926
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,160
and 225 grams of baking spread or softened butter. 

927
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,200
Add the zest of one lemon and mix well. 

928
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,440
All the ingredients are the same weight 

929
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,360
so it's an easy recipe to remember. 

930
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,320
That's it. It couldn't really be easier. 

931
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:29,240
I'm going to put all that mixture into the prepared tin. 

932
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,880
And if you wanted to make a chocolate mixture, 

933
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:39,200
you would take away 25 grams of the flour and put in 25 grams of cocoa. 

934
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,520
Normally, I would level that off, if it was just a Victoria sandwich, 

935
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,000
but I want this to be absolutely level on top, 

936
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
so I've found that the best way to do that is to push the mixture 

937
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
into the corners with a slight dent in the middle, 

938
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,720
then it will level itself out. 

939
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:01,200
Put in a preheated oven at 140 fan and bake for about 40 minutes. 

940
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,880
Don't open the door whilst baking or your sponge may sink. 

941
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,920
- That's fine.
- There you go. 

942
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,880
It's shrinking from the side and it's springing back. 

943
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,560
Put it on top of the jar and it should come out. 

944
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,760
There we are. Turn that upside down 

945
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,520
in order to get a lovely, flat surface on the top. 

946
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,280
Put the cake aside to cool whilst you make your butter cream. 

947
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,520
Measure out 200 grams of icing sugar 

948
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,280
and 250 grams of unsalted butter and whisk together well. 

949
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,000
Move the bowl round and keep the beater still. 

950
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,960
Then the rest can go in there. 

951
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,320
Now you see that is a lovely light colour. 

952
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,360
It's well blended, no lumps in there and it'll be full of flavour. 

953
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,440
On to the marzipan on the top. 

954
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,080
Roll out 200 grams of marzipan thinly, 

955
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,840
using icing sugar to dust the surface instead of flour 

956
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,680
so that it adds to the flavour. 

957
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,200
So we're going to put that into the centre and cut it off. 

958
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,280
So that's the base from the cake you've used as a template. 

959
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,680
Brush the flat top of the cake with warmed and sieved apricot jam 

960
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,320
so that there are no lumps on the surface. 

961
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,720
Layer the thin square of marzipan on top of the cake, which should be 

962
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,400
the exact fit and perfectly smooth. 

963
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,880
Now we have to cut it into the squares. 

964
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,880
Take a sharp knife, make quite sure there are no crumbs on the knife 

965
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:40,000
and do it slowly. It's really precision to get every one identical. 

966
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,640
If at the edges there's a little bit of a tilt, turn them over 

967
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,400
and level it off with a sharp knife. 

968
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,520
When you've made 25 equal squares, 

969
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,440
you can butter cream the sides of each cake. 

970
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,120
So a little butter cream. 

971
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,120
It's just to give the smoothest edge, 

972
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:01,400
and it's got to come right up to the marzipan. 

973
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,360
So there's one done. 

974
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,000
Perhaps would you like to put the little blob on top? 

975
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,480
Yeah, tell me when. 

976
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,360
Just a neat small blob in the middle. 

977
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,320
- How's that?
- Perfect. 

978
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,200
The butter cream is important as it will act as a crumb barrier, 

979
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,760
stopping any crumbs from the sponge 

980
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,200
getting into the fondant icing later on. 

981
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,680
I shall put these in the fridge and when they have hardened up a bit, 

982
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,560
I will put a knife across the sides. 

983
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,040
- Just to smooth that right down. 
- And if they really have got a bit too cold, 

984
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:35,840
I dip the knife in hot water, dry it and then push it across, 

985
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,960
so that it's absolutely smooth. 

986
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,840
They're not perfect at the moment. 

987
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,160
- They will be by the time you've finished.
- I can tell you, they're going to be. 

988
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,960
Put the cakes in the fridge to chill whilst you prepare the fondant icing. 

989
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,120
This, I have to say, is a bit tricky. The fondant comes in a block. 

990
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,400
You can buy it in good supermarkets. 

991
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,440
But, of course, it's hard and stiff. 

992
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,400
We want it to pour over, or to dip the fancies into it. 

993
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,840
So I'm going to run that down with a little water. 

994
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,240
To make the hard fondant liquid and ready for dipping, 

995
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,520
cut up the block and put it into the mixer, using a beater, not a whisk. 

996
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,000
Mix at a slow speed whilst you add in the water, 

997
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,480
a tiny amount at a time. 

998
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,200
It's important to only add a little at a time 

999
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,240
so that you get the icing to the correct pouring consistency. 

1000
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,320
It wants to coat the back of a spoon. 

1001
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,680
That is just a little too thick. 

1002
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,960
It's nearly there. 

1003
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,000
If you do go too far, you can bring it back with a bit of icing sugar. 

1004
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,040
My recollection of this is that it's more a delicate pink 

1005
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,520
rather than a deep one. 

1006
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,080
So we're going to have a deep one! 

1007
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,960
HE LAUGHS 

1008
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,720
Oh, that's quite a bright pink from that tiny little drop. 

1009
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,280
I did not expect that. 

1010
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,880
That's not the only thing they didn't expect. The dipping fondant challenged 

1011
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,280
their baking skills to the max. 

1012
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,360
- Is this your pioneering tactics? 
- Yes. 

1013
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,800
The rest won't be as messy, I promise you. 

1014
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,680
A hand is always the best method. 

1015
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,640
- Plunge, quick.
- Plunge. 

1016
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,440
- Plunge, bang, out.
- Wow! 

1017
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,920
It's more Generation Game, this, 

1018
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,680
than sort of bijoux French patisserie, isn't it? 

1019
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,760
Bijoux is not what comes to mind. 

1020
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,840
- Is it dunking? 
- It's called a dunkage. 

1021
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,800
- Le dunkage. 
- Dunkage de fondant petit. 

1022
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,640
That looks just about right. 

1023
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,760
So I'm going to add a little rose water. 

1024
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,840
It's a lovely flavour but it should be used in moderation. 

1025
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,800
I'm just going to put a few drops in there 

1026
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,480
and that will be plenty. That's just a hint. 

1027
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,920
Then we come to the colouring and the smallest amount. 

1028
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,760
We could always add more. 

1029
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,760
That looks just about right to me. 

1030
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,440
So for ease of dipping I'm going to transfer it to this bowl, 

1031
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:03,640
and you can always thin this down if it isn't quite right. 

1032
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,680
Take the cakes from the fridge. They should be really chilled by now 

1033
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,080
so the sponge holds together when dipped in the fondant, 

1034
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,920
allowing no crumbs to come loose. 

1035
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,440
Take the fork and don't put it in straight, 

1036
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,040
put it in at a slight angle, 

1037
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:23,480
like that, and then that's ready to dip. So in it goes. 

1038
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,320
So why don't you pour it, Mary? 

1039
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,560
I think you get a smarter finish 

1040
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,640
and I found it easier to do it this way. 

1041
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,760
So in it goes, right down, then a little twist, 

1042
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:42,280
let it drain a bit, and then put it on there like that. 

1043
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,040
Once you've iced all 25 fondant fancies, 

1044
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,200
leave them to set before decorating with melted chocolate on top. 

1045
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,520
- Right, do I need to chill these? 
- "Leave the fondant to set." 

1046
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,560
Oh, that doesn't mean chill, I don't think. 

1047
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:01,000
Not bad, eh? You know, they look quite cute really. 

1048
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,240
It's just been a very stressful process. 

1049
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,720
Even though one's lost its nipple, you know, not a bad job. 

1050
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,160
- If I ever see another fondant fancy I'll...
- What will you do?
- Deck it. 

1051
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,480
So there they are, all set and firm. 

1052
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,840
We need the finishing touches. 

1053
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,720
So melted chocolate that's cool 

1054
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,360
and I put it into a piping bag. 

1055
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:29,080
A lot will go on the tray. That's what I expect. 

1056
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:34,680
You let it come out here and you go backwards and forwards like that. 

1057
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,080
- You see how quick you've got to be?
- Yeah. 

1058
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,000
And as you get going you can be much, much braver and quicker. 

1059
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,280
You see I'm getting the hang of it now. 

1060
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,520
Now it's your turn. 

1061
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:50,000
I expect you do 100 at a time. Do you, when you're doing them? 

1062
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,760
Er.. yeah. 

1063
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,320
Well it is a bit different you and me doing it. 

1064
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,400
I think you've done it much more often. I'm just dead careful. 

1065
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,000
I must admit, it's one of my favourite, little jobs. 

1066
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,560
We won't have an examination to see whose is best but I quite like mine, 

1067
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,000
a bit informal. 

1068
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,280
I think mine's a bit more elegant. 

1069
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,080
HE LAUGHS 

1070
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,400
A really tricky, technical challenge. 

1071
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,320
It really looks good when you cut inside. 

1072
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,600
They're delicious, you know. 

1073
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:30,000
We've now shown everybody how to make these properly at home. 

1074
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Well I've enjoyed doing it. 

1075
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,480
It's so nice to show how to make things. 

1076
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,840
You can just follow it, step by step, 

1077
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,280
to get a perfect finish. 

1078
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,520
Hopefully it encourages people to start trying it for themselves. 

1079
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,480
Next time, a first as Mary and Paul share five of their signature bakes. 

1080
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,920
I'm quite looking forward to putting my own personality into the signature challenges. 

1081
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,240
And we're able to do OUR special twists. 

1082
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,920
They'll take you through every step of their recipes in real detail... 

1083
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,640
I rather like turning things out. I like the surprise. 

1084
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,800
..offering all the hints and tips to get the perfect results at home, every time... 

1085
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,320
Tack a little bit down on the table. 

1086
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,360
When you roll that over you can pull it and get a bit of tension. 

1087
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,480
That's a very good tip. 

1088
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,760
..guaranteeing success, whatever the recipe. 

1089
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,760
What a beautiful bake. There we are. 

1090
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,040
May I eat it now, Mary? 

1091
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,560
Join us next time for the Great British Bake Off Masterclass. 

1092
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,080
- Dig in and see what you think. 
- That's wicked, that. 

1093
