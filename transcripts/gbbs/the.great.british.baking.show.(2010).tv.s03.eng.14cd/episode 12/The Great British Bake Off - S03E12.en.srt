1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Taking part in the Great British Bake Off is the dream

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,720
of thousands of home bakers across the country.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,520
Filling in the application form was that best thing that I ever did.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,200
Now we'll hear from those

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,120
whose skills got them to the Bake Off tent...

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,040
The adrenaline was amazing.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,840
..what it feels like to bake in a pressurised environment...

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:29,160
At home, I have never baked anything and thought about time, ever.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,880
..coping with the tough challenges...

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,520
The technical bakes, for me, were treacherous.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,160
..how they dealt with the stress of baking for Mary Berry...

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,320
She gives you that look that cuts right through you.

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,360
..how they survived being judged by Paul Hollywood...

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,800
He said to one person something they made was disgusting.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,720
It's disgusting!

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,000
And that, I mean, I don't know where you go from there!

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,680
..and how they recovered...

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,640
If you think you're fantastic, you are destined for a fall.

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,440
..from baking disasters.

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,120
I literally did not know what to do, I was going to just walk out.

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,720
They will also reveal what has happened since the Bake Off.

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,880
Holly Bell, in the BBC Radio Leicester radio car.

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,360
It is truly unbelievable.

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,480
I wake up in the night and think, "Is it real or did I dream it?"

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,840
Settle in...

26
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,640
On your marks, get set...

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,080
..for a special edition...

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,720
It never had long enough to kind of go wrong for me.

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,280
..of the Great British Bake Off...

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,680
I did not want my Bake Off time to end.

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,920
..Revisited.

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,840
And I cried. Over macaroons. I cried over macaroons.

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,200
A year ago, 12 home bakers from all over Britain

34
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
made a simple but life-changing decision.

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,240
I watched the first series in a state of permanent outrage, really,

36
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,080
that nobody had told me it was on.

37
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,840
I said to my husband, "Why hasn't anybody told me this was on?!"

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,440
For me, it always, it sounds bizarre,

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,240
but it always felt like a bit of an accident.

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,040
In that I entered

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,720
for a bit of fun.

42
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,560
I turned 40 a couple of years ago.

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,360
And I said to myself, I want to make sure I'm doing lots of new things

44
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,840
and experiencing lots of different things.

45
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,920
So I saw the Bake Off advertised and I thought, "Sod it, let's do it!"

46
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,040
Am I allowed to say "Sod it"?!

47
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,720
But while some made the decision alone...

48
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,720
I was reading Good Food magazine and there was an article and it said,

49
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,000
"We are looking for bakers."

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,040
So I said, "I am going for this!"

51
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,520
..for others it required that crucial ingredient

52
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,760
in all home baking - family.

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,480
My family were constantly telling me I should enter something.

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,960
"You're really good, you should go on this."

55
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,200
And then I watched the first series of the Bake Off,

56
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,680
and it was the first time I thought, that is something that I could do.

57
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,840
My wife basically said,

58
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,200
"I want to put you forward for this, you should do it."

59
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,080
I suppose when I hit 31, I reached a bit of a stage in my life

60
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,040
where every opportunity that comes my way,

61
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,160
I am kind of just going to go for it to see where it takes me.

62
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,560
I phoned my youngest daughter and said,

63
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,680
"Since I'm not working full time how about me entering the competition?"

64
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,480
And she said, "Why not? We love your cakes."

65
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,000
And I thought, in my simple way,

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,040
that would be all it was, really, making a few cakes!

67
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,680
In July 2010, my eldest son

68
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,040
was diagnosed with leukaemia.

69
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,080
I was working as a sales manager and had to give up full-time work.

70
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,760
And I think my wife wanted me out of the house

71
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,080
so she got an application form for the Bake Off.

72
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,520
She thrust in my face and said, "I think you should do this."

73
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,320
3,500 people had exactly the same idea.

74
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,920
"Are you sure?

75
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,600
"Is it really that many people we have had to fight our way through?!"

76
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,120
There were so many people applying, I never dreamt it would lead on

77
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,960
to actually going through.

78
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,280
Then I got through to the final 12, which, obviously,

79
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,480
I was totally thrilled with.

80
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,280
And before I knew it, there I was.

81
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,280
It is funny being back on the location without filming,

82
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,440
having had a decent night's sleep.

83
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,640
That particularly brings it back.

84
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,840
We used to line up right there against the bridge,

85
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,000
waiting to do our big walk into the marquee.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,400
Sometimes when we got it wrong, usually for laughing, in my case,

87
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,200
we had to do it over and over again.

88
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,680
Even then it was still stressful!

89
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,920
Just walking across earlier was quite strange,

90
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,480
not having an apron on, walking in line

91
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,200
with Mary-Anne or Janet stood next to me!

92
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,600
It just served to hype up those nerves a bit more.

93
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,760
You could see the marquee ahead of you then you had to go

94
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,600
back across and back across.

95
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,240
This prize at the end.

96
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,880
Then when you got in your nerves were in shreds.

97
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,360
So, the first day, got in and saw the actual competition I had,

98
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,160
and thought, "Damn!"

99
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,440
Some people came with some fairly startling array of equipment.

100
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,680
Little paint pots and things.

101
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,880
Other people turned up

102
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,120
with just enough clothes to get through the day.

103
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,560
The adrenaline, though, was amazing!

104
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,280
For the first time - you will hear this a lot over the next few days -

105
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,160
- on your marks, get set...
- Bake!

106
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,280
It did not take long for Britain's 12 best home bakers to realise...

107
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,080
It won't help me, panicking!

108
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,240
..they were no longer at home.

109
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,520
I don't really remember getting stressed.

110
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,640
Look at that! Magnificent!

111
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,080
- Probably did! 
- Oh, hang on, hang on!

112
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,000
My kitchen at home is where I go to relax.

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,720
Pastry can be a cruel mistress if you don't treat her well!

114
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,280
It is a bit of me time. But when you are doing it in a competition,

115
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,960
you have got the other bakers...

116
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,400
You feel like you have got to double-check absolutely everything.

117
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,600
I want every single roll to be the exact same shape.

118
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
It can become really... can I say...anal?

119
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,760
So, I am weighing out the dough.

120
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,360
You kind of go from this activity which is calm and relaxing

121
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,200
to this adrenaline rush.

122
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,560
Not wanting to stress anyone out remotely

123
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,640
but you do have ten minutes left, bakers.

124
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,920
At home, I have never baked anything and thought about time, ever.

125
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,800
You're like, panic, panic, running around. But I really enjoyed it.

126
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,200
I sat there before, thinking, I can't remember - four, five hours?

127
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,920
Thinking, "There is no way I need four or five hours!"

128
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,360
And then the time goes like that.

129
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,960
And I was right up against it at the end.

130
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,000
I used to bake muffins at home, really early,

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,440
and bring them in, because it just... I needed to bake something.

132
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,360
For just baking, rather than for competition.

133
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,160
Just to prove to myself that,

134
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,720
"Come on, you can do this.

135
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,480
"It's just what you do every day, basically."

136
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,000
But even in the first round of the competition...

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,720
I think it will be OK.

138
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,400
..some of the home bakers attempted cakes that were far from everyday.

139
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,360
We received this thing that said,

140
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,480
"You must produce a three-tiered celebration cake."

141
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,440
And I looked at that and I thought,

142
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,960
"Right, I know what I'm going to do for this,

143
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,320
"and it is going to be a 'Wow!' cake."

144
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,720
With Ben, he talked a lot about his bakes before the actual competition.

145
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,480
That was really unnerving.

146
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,000
I remember seeing a photo of Ben's cake that he had on his phone

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,760
from when he had been practising.

148
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,240
He gave us a preview of what he was going to make. We were like, "Whoa!"

149
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,320
I had in my head that it was for a 15 or 16-year-old girl for her birthday.

150
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,720
And he wheeled in a tool chest on what looked like a hostess trolley.

151
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,440
And it was laden with airbrushes and fine cake-decorating equipment.

152
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,080
That was quite unsettling.

153
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,680
All I had got was some training kit so I did not have to go to the gym!

154
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,440
I am trying to get it on and done.

155
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,200
You're the make-up artist to all the sponge cakes.

156
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,320
When they have an imperfection they always call for you!

157
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,960
This tower of a cake, and airbrushing, icing,

158
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,840
looking over, thinking, "Oh, my God, I am so going out, compared to that!"

159
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,280
But then...

160
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,680
If it is too pretty to eat,

161
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,360
then that is not a successful bake, I don't think.

162
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,040
The sponge is a little bit bland.

163
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,880
I think it is slightly overdone as well.

164
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,960
I think a bit more work on the sponge and a little less time on the finish.

165
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,240
Yes.

166
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,120
And in hindsight, that was totally wrong, because if I wanted to really

167
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,120
hit the judges, it would have been something they would have wanted.

168
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,680
But that would not have been me.

169
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,480
Having your home baking poked, prodded,

170
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,560
and chewed over by professional judges for the first time...

171
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,840
- They have lost some of their shape. 
- ..proved sensitive for everyone.

172
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,640
When you bake at home there is no stress.

173
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,920
Because you are baking for people who love you.

174
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,640
It is very rare that I get feedback other than, "It's yummy, Mummy!"

175
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,800
Unless I have done something really bad!

176
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,120
Appearance wise, too simple.

177
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,400
I got quite tearful with some of the negative feedback I got.

178
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,880
Because I was just so exhausted.

179
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,360
And all the nervous energy building up, so when somebody said

180
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,320
something negative, you really did feel like bursting into tears.

181
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,240
Which you did!

182
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,880
Which I did!

183
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,640
If I spoke to my husband now he would probably say,

184
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,160
"Look, you are there, you're good at this, you know you are,

185
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,440
"you just need to forget about what he said, the comments,

186
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,360
"just focus on what you need to do."

187
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,160
It is your efforts, your own work, your own time, love, and care

188
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,280
that has gone into making something,

189
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,560
and for a lot of others, learning from a parent or relative,

190
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,200
sometimes they have passed away,

191
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,320
it has got a strong emotional connection to them.

192
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,120
That's why a lot of people tend to get emotional about baking.

193
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,240
- I don't like it.
- I don't like it.

194
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,560
When the first programme aired, all my neighbours came round

195
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,880
to the house and I had whatever was on the programme baked

196
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,480
and we brought it out as it was shown on the TV.

197
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,760
The icing on it, it needs work, it needs to be smoother.

198
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,840
It was like 4D-TV, if you like, and they absolutely loved them.

199
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,200
I nailed the frosting.

200
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,320
They had to, they were in my house eating the food.

201
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,240
- It's sad, it's a bit of a disaster, really.
- Yes, I'm afraid so.

202
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,280
If you make something at home and it is slightly imperfect,

203
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,320
it doesn't matter.

204
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,160
But when it's for a competition, of course it really matters

205
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,480
when someone's going to press it hard and say,

206
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,680
"It's a little bit doughy on the bottom

207
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,240
"and it hasn't risen quite as much as it should have done."

208
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,360
The flavour is not very distinctive. The lemon icing needs more lemon.

209
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,120
It wasn't a good start. I thought my fate was sealed already.

210
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,720
But Janet needn't have worried.

211
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,640
The person who will not be joining us next week is Keith.

212
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,280
Commiserations, Keith.

213
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,360
He had a really bish-bash-bosh approach to baking.

214
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,840
If this thing is right, it says they're baked.

215
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,320
A really kind of earnest approach to baking.

216
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,680
I'm not used to all this origami effort, I tell you that much.

217
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,880
If it works, it works, if it doesn't, it doesn't.

218
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,560
Bung it all together. Bang.

219
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,000
He wasn't heartbroken, going out in the first round.

220
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,360
Talking to Keith in between filming...

221
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,000
- You winning?
- I hope so.

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,040
..he was more concerned about getting back for the Arsenal match.

223
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,400
Bingo-jingo.

224
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,160
The first home baker to leave the Bake Off tent went back to just that -

225
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,520
home baking.

226
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,320
It's weird when you go to the chemist to get something

227
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,920
for your boy and they are like, "I saw you on TV recently, didn't I?"

228
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,520
But for others, like since entering

229
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,880
and then leaving the Bake Off has seen a few changes.

230
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,600
When 19-year-old Jason White applied to take part in the Bake Off,

231
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,680
he was a civil engineering student.

232
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,160
He is still going to college but he is no longer studying.

233
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,280
You don't know what I'm making today?

234
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,120
Chocolate orange mini tarts.

235
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,320
So is going to be chocolate pastry with an orange creme patisserie.

236
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,160
I just say the English pastry cream. Because I always get wrong.

237
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,800
And then segmented oranges on top.

238
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,960
Jason's baking expertise has now been passed on to students

239
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,080
studying catering in West London.

240
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,560
I didn't really envisage myself doing this.

241
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,440
I always enjoy working with people who are interactive

242
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,240
and young people. Teaching. So that's why it's fun.

243
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,920
But I didn't think that after the Bake Off I would be here doing demos here as well.

244
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,720
So the pressure is on. I'm really happy I'm doing it.

245
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,560
Smell the chocolateyness.

246
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,200
I wasn't interested in bakery at all but when Jason came,

247
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,520
he made me want to bake as well.

248
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,400
He gets you motivated, definitely.

249
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,960
When you see someone your age doing that, you motivate yourself to do better.

250
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,160
Have you guys made pastry cream before?

251
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,280
- Yes.
- So you guys could tell me what to do then.

252
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,760
Doing this now feels very natural to me. It really does. It's different.

253
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,400
Something to still get used to and adjust to

254
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,920
and what I do is not the same thing day in and day out.

255
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,680
But in terms of being able to do food and do something I love and enjoy it is a great feeling.

256
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,160
We have some chocolate orange tartlets, guys. There we are.

257
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,800
He is like an inspiration to me because I love baking.

258
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,160
I have baked all my life so I would like to be like him one day.

259
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,440
As Jason begins to inspire the next generation of home bakers,

260
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,800
during the Bake Off for him and all his fellow contestants,

261
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,400
inspiration had a household name.

262
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,240
They look like they mean business today.

263
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,120
Mary Berry is dressed as a cowgirl. I think that means business.

264
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,440
She's got her hand in the wrong pocket, though. It should be in the front.

265
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,080
If you bake, you tend to know that

266
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,800
Mary Berry is the be all and end all of traditional baking.

267
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,880
I've always known about Mary, probably since when I was at school.

268
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,800
I did Home Economics and so Mary has always been a massive influence.

269
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,240
You feel you know them

270
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,920
because they are on the telly, in your cookbooks.

271
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,160
But, to meet them, that is the grand high priestess of baking.

272
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,360
My main motivation was to have Mary Berry taste my cooking.

273
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,280
I mean, how many people can say that?

274
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,640
I think it is absolutely lovely

275
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,400
and the pure alcohol is doing me a lot of good.

276
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:33,000
I think I described Mary Berry to a friend recently as a food ninja.

277
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,920
She knows everything, she sees everything

278
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,240
and she appears from nowhere because she is so small compared to me.

279
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,800
I thunder around in the marquee doing my baking

280
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,600
but Mary would just appear, look at something,

281
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,560
comment and then disappear again. It was terrifying.

282
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,160
She did used to get told off quite a bit for trying to help us.

283
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,480
She would come around and whisper, "Try doing it this way,"

284
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,200
and get told, "Mary, stop it!"

285
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,440
- You obviously want to make Mary proud.
- Like your mum, in a way.
- Yes.

286
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,480
- You want her to be proud of you for that.
- To not be disappointed.

287
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,000
Mary's disappointment is the worst thing.

288
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,640
Like a bucket of cold water.

289
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,000
Mary is absolutely lovely.

290
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,480
It feels like I'm cooking for my granny and she is trying to find compliments.

291
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,000
The middle is scrummy.

292
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,960
It feels like she'd never try to find fault.

293
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,080
This Victoria sponge is an absolute classic.

294
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,320
When Mary said my Victoria sponge was one of the finest

295
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,520
she had ever tasted, it was just one of those moments

296
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,920
that you'll never forget in your life.

297
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,960
It is one of the best that I have tasted

298
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,640
and it's rather nice to have it that size.

299
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,720
To have Mary look at your quiche, turn it over...

300
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,000
What we haven't done is turned it upside-down to see how the bottom is.

301
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,320
..and say, "No soggy bottom." And I remember Mary's words clearly. She said...

302
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,640
- Excellent. Not good - excellent. 
- Relief!
- That's perfect.

303
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,280
I think I will die a happy man with those words ringing in my ears.

304
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,920
Whatever we put in front of her,

305
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,480
she found something nice to say to begin with.

306
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
She wasn't all sweetness and light.

307
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,040
It's just not working, that lavender, is it?

308
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,960
These are not good enough.

309
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,200
She gives you that look and it cuts right through you.

310
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,240
It's very doughy. It is sticking to the roof of my mouth.

311
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,320
She could see the flaws and she wasn't prepared to say it was brilliant when it wasn't.

312
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,760
- It needed a little more cooking. 
- Nightmare. I'm sorry about that.

313
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,720
When Mary gives me a criticism, to be honest, it is a bigger criticism.

314
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,480
This one is very over-baked.

315
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,520
That's why it wasn't at the front.

316
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,240
So you basically tried to hide that one.

317
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,600
Yeah, that was just being covered up a bit.

318
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,880
This is Miss Marple you're dealing with here.

319
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,360
If she says something bad, you're like, "Damn, I let her down!"

320
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,480
Oh dear, you're capable of such great things, you know.

321
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,600
Whereas Paul would say, "I don't like it. That's my final word,"

322
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,480
Mary would be more sort of, "I'm not keen on it but, if you did this, it would be fantastic."

323
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,080
- Did you add baking powder to these? 
- I did.

324
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,760
Sometimes if you use too much baking powder it rises up

325
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,040
and then drops down again.

326
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,440
Mary was the voice of fairness.

327
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,040
She really understood the 12 of us that were in the thing

328
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,120
in the marquee were amateurs.

329
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,000
It doesn't tempt me to eat it. But once I get going, it's jolly good.

330
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,200
Therefore we were going to make some mistakes.

331
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,920
Things were going to go wrong and things were going to happen.

332
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,560
But if you're baking at home,

333
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,840
the occasional mistake is easily glossed over.

334
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,200
Let's not go there.

335
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,000
The pressure in the Bake Off tent, however...

336
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,760
You never know what's going to happen.

337
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,280
..can make the odd mishap...

338
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,720
Oh, no!

339
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,840
..feel like a monumental disaster.

340
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,800
Oh, my God, I've done something wrong.

341
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,280
No-one was immune.

342
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,480
I opened the proving drawer to have a look and see how it was doing...

343
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,920
I don't know if it is supposed to look like that.

344
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,560
..and the bread just flopped.

345
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,640
Oops! I have one macaroon or six long macaroons.

346
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,880
It has to be mind over matter and then just carry on.

347
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,560
You felt sorry for them but it made you feel like it could happen to any of you.

348
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,200
It has just not gone right today.

349
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,520
- If somebody has a disaster, you're like, yes!
- Oh, no! Oh, gosh!

350
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,280
Ian! Ian-Ian!

351
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,200
I managed to cut the end off my finger.

352
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,320
- It's happened again, hasn't it? 
- It's just flopped and dripped and...

353
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,560
Sad day.

354
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,040
The whole thing has collapsed. I'm really disappointed.

355
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,960
I don't think people want to watch perfection all the time.

356
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,840
I think they like the humanity of a mistake.

357
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Don't worry.

358
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,040
These things are sent to try us.

359
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,800
If you think you're fantastic, you're destined for a fall, aren't you?

360
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,160
Whereas if you think you are just OK,

361
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,040
you're pleased when things just go right.

362
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,920
It is an easier way to be.

363
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:02,520
Pesto-quiche-gate was week two. It wasn't my finest hour.

364
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,520
That's a big swamp of quiche.

365
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,880
Paul and Mary hated it. There's no other way to describe how they felt about it.

366
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,360
- I'm afraid I'm not mad about it.
- It doesn't work for me. It is too much.

367
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,240
It's too much on a quiche.

368
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,880
It has been suggested to me by Ian

369
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,480
that I should write a book - 1001 Ways With Pesto.

370
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,880
He is quite naughty.

371
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,720
You weren't pleased but it kind of made you feel like you weren't the only one.

372
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,160
One of the most talked about disasters in the Bake Off

373
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,480
occurred earlier than anyone expected.

374
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,920
Imagine it's the first week of the Bake Off,

375
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,040
I haven't been in the marquee before and don't know

376
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,480
any of the other people, so everybody's trying to impress.

377
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,720
I think it's going to be OK.

378
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,880
This is the week that everyone's just trying to get through and do all right and then...

379
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,640
My hands are shaking.

380
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,960
I think I was trying to build my tiers.

381
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,080
I was right at the back, he was right at the front, but I heard it.

382
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,880
HE GASPS >

383
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,440
At the point that it fell, I could see Rob with his head in his hands.

384
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,720
I think we all heard what he said, which was not for broadcast.

385
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,920
BLEEP.

386
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,920
When it's just sat there on the floor,

387
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,320
just in a puddle of cake, I literally did not know what to do.

388
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,160
I was going to just walk out.

389
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,160
Try and rescue one of those layers...

390
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,440
And then Paul said, "You can scoop that up. That bit's not touched the floor.

391
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,800
"Scoop it up, put it on, do it",

392
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,600
and walked off, and I was like, "Yeah".

393
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,200
That cake was the only thing that I ate that anyone baked

394
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,000
over that weekend, and it was absolutely lovely.

395
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,320
There was no secret Tim Henman-style air-punching,

396
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,760
like "Yes, that's one person out of the way", because he worked so hard.

397
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,320
I thought "Heavens above, that could have been me".

398
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,600
Poor Rob.

399
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,360
Did get him some airtime, though, so I must remember that one.

400
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,800
If I ever do it again, I've got to drop a cake.

401
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,440
There was one baker, however,

402
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,440
who managed to save the worst until last.

403
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,120
Ooh...

404
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,240
SHE GASPS

405
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,960
45-year-old housewife Mary-Anne Boermans

406
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,480
over-decorated her signature mille-feuille...

407
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,280
The great piping disaster of 2011.

408
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,720
No, it's all going!

409
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,320
..which then caused her to freeze in panic,

410
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,600
before having to pipe the word "Sacher"

411
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,400
on her Sachertorte during the final technical challenge.

412
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,240
I'm feeling positively nauseous.

413
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,080
All you need to do is write six letters on a piece of cake.

414
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,920
- You can do it.
- Yes.

415
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,680
What you don't want to do is have a moment where you misspell.

416
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,520
My daughter's called Sacha.

417
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,360
Or you could just misspell it

418
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,520
and say it's an ode. It's an ode to your daughter.

419
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,880
I think it's one of those things, Mary-Anne, where you just do it.

420
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,600
I'm going to stand back and let you go for it.

421
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,560
SHE GASPS

422
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,000
You wrote Sacha!

423
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,680
- That's your fault! 
- It's not my fault.

424
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,120
'Maybe if I hadn't written my daughter's name

425
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,280
'instead of Sacher on the Sachertorte',

426
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,680
maybe I'd have won.

427
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,560
But I thought that was hilarious, in the final,

428
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,240
to do something like that, especially

429
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,000
when Sue said just beforehand, "Don't make a spelling mistake".

430
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,560
I think we have a problem with the spelling on that one, don't we?

431
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,480
- It's actually written in Austrian. 
- Oh, well, that explains it.

432
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,760
What a klutz. Anyway.

433
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,680
After the Bake Off,

434
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,040
it was Mary-Anne's more successful bakes

435
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,480
that caught the attention of the owner

436
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,000
of a historic tea room in Cardiff.

437
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,760
David, what I've got here for you to try

438
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,080
is some suggestions for afternoon tea that might be a little bit different

439
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,720
and out of the ordinary.

440
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,720
David and I met over Twitter, when he got in touch

441
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,200
and said what a fan he was of the Bake Off programme.

442
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,360
I noticed from his blog that he had the aspiration

443
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,440
of opening a tea room in Cardiff.

444
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,760
So we got chatting and enthusing about baking

445
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,920
and recipes, and I've become kind of a consultant to him,

446
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,360
especially with the old-fashioned recipes,

447
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,400
trying to resurrect them and bring them into the 21st century.

448
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,640
This is a puff pastry case, with lemon cheesecake filling.

449
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,000
- These date from the Tudor times, allegedly.
- They are excellent.

450
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,440
'The thing about Mary-Anne'

451
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,800
is her passion for baking,

452
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,360
and her passion for history,

453
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,520
and the tradition of baking and the tradition of recipes.

454
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,840
That was inspirational. It was great to have that in my tea room. It's brilliant.

455
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,360
With a Bake Off finalist recreating his menu,

456
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,320
David has asked Mary-Anne and her daughter Sacha to attend

457
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,040
the tea room's grand reopening.

458
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,320
I'm very honoured to be asked to be here today.

459
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,000
Without further ado, let's get on with the cake. Good luck,

460
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,680
and happy dunking.

461
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,840
APPLAUSE

462
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,040
I've really enjoyed working alongside David

463
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,040
and watching his project move along,

464
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,400
and all the milestones that he's achieved,

465
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,280
and to see it come to fruition.

466
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,600
The Bake Off certainly has given me opportunities

467
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,440
I wouldn't have had normally. It's also given me the confidence,

468
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,800
having had feedback from Paul and Mary about the quality

469
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,640
of the things that I bake, to branch out

470
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,880
with these recipes that I'm going to resurrect

471
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,480
and present and hopefully encourage other people

472
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,960
to start baking them again.

473
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,560
Whatever challenges the bakers have faced since the Bake Off,

474
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,840
they've had excellent training,

475
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,920
facing one of life's most ominous situations during it...

476
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,600
Now, be afraid, be very afraid.

477
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,480
Hang on. 3 o'clock, mate.

478
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,080
Look as if you know what you're doing. You do know what you're doing.

479
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,800
..baking for Paul Hollywood.

480
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,480
I would probably describe Paul as, um...

481
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,560
Oh...

482
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,440
He's a silver fox. He hates that. Let's call him the silver fox.

483
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,960
You could almost look for a camera if you cut corners.

484
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,280
You think, "No, Paul wouldn't do that".

485
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,360
Someone's not been following my recipe.

486
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,440
With over 30 years of baking experience...

487
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,000
Wow, that is amazing.

488
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
..judgments ranged from the swift and merciless...

489
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,080
It's a mess. I don't like it.

490
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,000
Stodgy. Claggy.

491
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,120
- Very dry. What was in this pastry again?
- Just straightforward pastry.

492
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,200
Which you burnt.

493
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,120
..to forensically detailed deconstructions.

494
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,040
Never has pastry been so scrutinised.

495
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,360
- Coriander's not coming through. 
- It's more the smell you get from the coriander.

496
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,200
I won't eat a loaf if it smells nice. I expect to taste it as well.

497
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,160
I wouldn't describe Paul as cuddly.

498
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,480
- It's sadly lacking in flavour.
- OK.

499
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,640
'He's got steely blue eyes that stare at you,

500
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,760
'and it is really scary and daunting.'

501
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,480
He doesn't pull his punches. If he doesn't like it, he's going to say he doesn't like it.

502
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,520
He said to one person that something they made was disgusting.

503
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,440
It's disgusting.

504
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,760
And that, I mean, I don't know where you go from there.

505
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,480
The interior of that is revolting.

506
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,840
And some things, he liked, and some things he didn't like,

507
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,760
and that's allowed.

508
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,800
Is this the way you wanted them to look?

509
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,240
As long as you don't take it too personally, because it is very direct.

510
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,400
Just take it with a pinch of salt. Not too much salt.

511
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,920
- You've got too much salt in there. 
- Oh.

512
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,920
I did have a strange relationship with Paul.

513
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,080
From the feedback that I got, he was harsh on me and it was fine.

514
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:02,800
- I could have dropped that in from a 5ft height and ended up with that finish. Must try harder.
- Noted.

515
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,000
But then from watching the series, he said a lot of things,

516
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,120
kind of, behind my back.

517
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,480
I often feel like a schoolteacher with Rob.

518
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,760
He had two hours. Everybody else managed to do it. Just get it done.

519
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,640
Stop messing around and get it in the oven.

520
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,440
He's, you know, my dad, who is making me strive more.

521
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,680
I'm disappointed.

522
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,880
If he finds something he can say bad about it, he will, because it will make me better.

523
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,360
I think Paul and myself,

524
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,000
as personalities, would clash quite a lot.

525
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,040
- It looks a mess.
- Really?
- Yeah.

526
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,760
And it came across that obviously, when I believed in something, I would disagree.

527
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,040
Overwhelmed totally by the rosemary.

528
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,720
Really? Because I like the rosemary flavour.

529
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,920
- Then don't put raisins and walnut in, because they're pointless.
- OK.

530
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,080
But not everyone cowered behind their ovens.

531
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,360
I've met far scarier people in the air force than Paul Hollywood.

532
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,640
For some, a touch of Hollywood...

533
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,400
- Get back.
- ..was almost a pleasure.

534
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,440
- He may hate me for saying this. He's an absolute pussycat.
- Nice flavours.

535
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,360
Delicious. Absolutely spot-on.

536
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,480
I can't fault it, really.

537
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,680
It was quite daring, actually. As long as he gets that balance right,

538
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,920
he could create something magical.

539
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,000
There's definitely something about him that makes you pay attention,

540
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,640
because he's got so much experience.

541
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,000
The icing on it needs work. It needs to be smoother. It needs to be set.

542
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,280
Having somebody stood there and saying "If you just change this..."

543
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,080
Think about your flavour combinations. Guinness, use in one. Chocolate, use in another.

544
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,920
Chocolate and Guinness, you're on a hiding to nothing.

545
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,080
I've taken those things and gone away and changed how I bake,

546
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,520
and I've got good results.

547
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,760
So it's been beneficial to meet someone like him,

548
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,480
but he's certainly not the scariest person I've ever met.

549
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,080
Even if you weren't scared of Paul Hollywood...

550
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,720
Coming up now is possibly the moment that you've been dreading.

551
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,920
..every round of the Bake Off featured a challenge

552
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,560
that terrified everyone.

553
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,040
The technical bake is a controlled test

554
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,440
of both your intuition and your ability.

555
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,600
The technical bakes, for me, were treacherous.

556
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,240
Everybody was nervous beforehand, because you didn't have a clue. It could have been absolutely anything.

557
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,200
You're trying to second-guess from what you can see on your counter.

558
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,240
You can't possibly prepare for it.

559
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,160
You're almost willing your presenters to hurry up,

560
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,840
because you just want to open that drawer and find that piece of paper.

561
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,080
What's the recipe? What am I going to make?

562
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,520
It's a Battenberg cake.

563
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,360
Not just any old Battenberg cake,

564
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,160
but a coffee and walnut Battenberg cake.

565
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,560
As soon as you knew what it was,

566
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,560
your mind goes through this process of, "Where have I seen that before?"

567
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,720
I know what it is, because Dot in EastEnders makes them for Jim.

568
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,920
The only place that I could ever remember

569
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,720
at that particular moment in time

570
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,040
having seen Battenberg was on EastEnders.

571
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,840
And Dot Cotton came into my head,

572
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,880
so you have all of these visions in your mind of,

573
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,280
"What does it look like when Dot Cotton made it for Jim?",

574
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,760
which is completely ridiculous.

575
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,200
With only a very basic recipe to guide them...

576
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,080
It looks all right, but God, who knows?

577
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,880
There was just one way the bakers could

578
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,520
- check they were headed in the right direction?
- Let me see yours.

579
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,720
Yeah, some challenges, I did sort of look around, if I wasn't too sure

580
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,920
what I was doing, but it's a bit hard, because one minute you've

581
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,720
got a lot of time, and two, you're not sure, you might copy someone.

582
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,200
Are they doing it the correct way?

583
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,600
Moment of truth. I had no expertise, but I knew I'd cope,

584
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,320
because at the end of the day,

585
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,160
no-one's going to die if I get wrong.

586
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,960
Hopefully.

587
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,720
During one particular Technical Challenge...

588
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,400
We're looking for the perfect focaccia, and you've got three

589
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,240
and a half hours in which to bake it.

590
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,720
..trying to copy someone else proved a little pointless.

591
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,600
The focaccia was very difficult, because I don't think anyone,

592
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,120
and I certainly hadn't made it before,

593
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,560
and it was an unbelievably wet mixture.

594
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,160
It was like a liquid cement, or something.

595
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,560
- I've got no idea whether I'm getting it right.
- Strange.

596
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,040
- It is weird, isn't it?
- Oh, gosh.

597
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,240
The ratios on the recipe of water to flour were different

598
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,960
to any I'd ever made before. There was a lot more water.

599
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,720
- Will this make bread?
- You've got to have faith in the recipe.

600
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,480
You're kind of like, I've got to trust the recipe.

601
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,800
This guy knows what he's talking about."

602
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,520
For some reason, which will probably never be known to me,

603
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,080
I decided to deviate from Paul Hollywood's recipe.

604
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,640
- I've kind of done that. 
- Oh, so you are way...

605
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,160
Have you got any more water to add?

606
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,520
I've got a bit there, but the dough was wetter than I would have liked.

607
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,520
To this day, cannot tell you what I was thinking.

608
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,640
I thought, perhaps I could add a bit more flour,

609
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,760
because sometimes the ratios aren't strict.

610
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,440
Could you actually, Could you tip some flour in?

611
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,280
- Are you sure you should be adding more?
- I've got to try and salvage what I can.

612
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,640
So, I added a bit more flour, thinking it would be fine,

613
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,160
because the mixture was really wet and sloppy and gloopy,

614
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,560
but apparently that was wrong.

615
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,960
Now this...

616
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,560
I'll just go with it, and see what happens.

617
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,600
I didn't make Paul's focaccia recipe the way that he intended.

618
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,800
I decided that I knew better, never having made focaccia before,

619
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,120
I thought, I'll just wade in and change this recipe.

620
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,400
It's too wet, I'm going to throw some more flour in.

621
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,920
Sorry, can I just add a bit of flour?

622
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,520
Sorry, love. Yeah, yeah. Sorry.

623
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,640
I think I did probably add a bit to much flour.

624
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,800
Which I think was the temptation most of us had really.

625
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,400
I didn't trust the master baker's recipe, I think.

626
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,800
Someone's thought, "Paul doesn't know what he's doing.

627
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,920
"He's made a mistake here!" I don't think I'll add all the water!

628
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,120
I've practised at that damn focaccia that threw me out,

629
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,680
and I've worked my way through Paul's books, and actually

630
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,480
I think I've reached the standard that even Paul would be proud of.

631
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,120
Having survived all eight Technical Challenges,

632
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,000
one home baker has now traded her apron for a career where

633
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,320
being able to deal with the unexpected is crucial.

634
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,040
Karl Cooper here in the studio.

635
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,240
Holly Bell in the BBC Radio Leicester radio car.

636
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,200
This is a programme called - Clueless.

637
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,440
Holly Bell, in the radio car, whereabouts are you now?

638
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,520
It's very pretty, lots of fields at the moment,

639
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,560
so, Dale, I'm sure you know where you're going, don't you?

640
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,440
I never thought for a second that baking

641
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,320
would lead to radio presenting. I'm really glad it has.

642
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,560
And I did want to change my life, I guess,

643
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,280
I wanted to do something different for a living,

644
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,320
and I've certainly fulfilled that brief, and I'm loving it.

645
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,640
It's great fun. The people in radio are fantastic.

646
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,320
So, yeah, I feel very blessed.

647
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,840
OK, let's go and find some people.

648
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,840
My first encounter with Holly was hearing about her

649
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,920
involvement with the Great British Bake Off,

650
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,240
knowing that by nature of that, she was

651
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,040
immediately becoming a local celebrity.

652
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,600
So, she kept appearing on air,

653
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,960
in features about her progress in the show.

654
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,880
And we knew, as soon as we heard her, that there

655
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,480
was something quite special about her delivery.

656
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,520
You know, what you hear is exactly what you get.

657
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,720
She's actually a natural.

658
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,760
'Now, Holly, look, it's 9:57 now.'

659
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,520
I know, I'm running. OK.

660
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,400
- Karl, you're a bit of a slave driver.
- 'I am, aren't I?'
- Hang on.

661
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,280
Harder working than in the kitchen this?

662
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,000
Today we went out in the radio car,

663
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,640
and we were searching for treasure around Leicestershire, for a show

664
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,600
called Clueless, for BBC radio Leicester.

665
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,840
I've found it. I've got it.

666
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,520
You've got the clue! You've got the clue! Yes!

667
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,680
It's such a fun programme, I love it.

668
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,440
You're out in the radio car, and you're just yourself, basically.

669
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,480
It's great fun. And there's some food!

670
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,320
- 'Has somebody left a cake for you?' 
- Yes.
- Oh, this is brilliant!

671
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,400
Somebody's left a cake for the Great British Bake Off lady.

672
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,720
'Have a little nibble,

673
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,920
'and here's Christina, going through the clue for you.'

674
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,800
- Mmm!
- Holly's biggest challenge was probably sitting in this

675
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,280
very studio, presenting a two-hour radio show.

676
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,840
A completely new challenge, a blank canvas, where she was

677
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,920
doing all the same sort of stuff that presenters that have been doing

678
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,000
this job for like 10-20 years have been doing.

679
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,920
And again, great listener reaction, and it sounded great on air.

680
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,560
How does that compare with the glare of telly lights

681
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,000
and the pressure of having to create the most fantastic culinary staff?

682
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,640
Well, do you know what?

683
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,560
The main thing they have in common is that

684
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,200
you are both against the clock.

685
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,520
Right, so I think doing the Bake Off was probably good preparation,

686
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,600
but the really lovely thing about doing radio is that

687
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,680
I don't have to worry about wearing make up!

688
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,360
- Brilliant!
- It's less stressful than baking for the judges,

689
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,560
because you don't get the Paul Hollywood stare

690
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,280
when you do something wrong.

691
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,040
Karl is a lot nicer. He doesn't get annoyed with me when I get it wrong.

692
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,600
If, like Holly, baking for Paul and Mary got a bit too stressful,

693
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,000
inside the marquee, there was another duo on hand to try

694
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,600
and help relieve the baker's tension.

695
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,720
Oh, hello sailor! Look at that.

696
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,680
Janet, I've been admiring your buns from afar, and quite frankly,

697
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,000
they're so large, you can be

698
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,520
at any point of the tent, and be aware of their beauty.

699
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,360
Oh, that's good. Look, that's good!

700
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,240
Mel and Sue were absolutely brilliant.

701
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,560
If I'm honest, before the competition started,

702
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,440
I was a little bit worried.

703
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,720
I thought they might get in my way, and annoy me, buzzing around.

704
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,240
It's quite a manly quiche.

705
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,120
Now, surely that is a contradiction in terms. A manly quiche?

706
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,360
- You would think. 
- You need to embrace the femininity.

707
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,760
No, I'm doing a walnut pastry, with a bit of paprika in it.

708
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,160
- You're trying to butch it up? 
- I'm trying to butch it up.

709
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,480
But actually, they offer really genuine moral support,

710
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,160
and you did feel like you were in your kitchen,

711
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,880
having a bit of a chat to them.

712
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,600
Are you going to have to do the whole challenge one-handed?

713
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,560
No, I'm hoping that the bleeding will be stemmed enough.

714
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,240
Yeah, do you like your elbow support, as well?

715
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,200
It's lovely, I think I might ask that permanently.

716
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,680
They were just light relief, whenever you needed them.

717
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,160
There's a small knobble here which I really like.

718
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,400
It's just a sort of sitting on the filling.

719
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,560
It's like a turban, isn't it? It's sort of a meringue turban!

720
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,760
They were always there to give you a hug when you needed it.

721
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,200
If something was going wrong, they came over

722
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,080
and patted your shoulder, and said everything was going to be OK.

723
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,560
I just want to cry.

724
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,360
Well, you can't help it, it's an unstable thing, isn't it?

725
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,240
It's all right. It's difficult.

726
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,560
And for a minute, you do think that you're

727
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,400
just baking for a village fair.

728
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,440
- So, how are you feeling? Did you sleep last night?
- I didn't, no.

729
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,840
- I've still lots of nerves. 
- Quiche-related nightmares?

730
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,400
Quiche-related nightmares. Like Paul Hollywood coming out of my quiche.

731
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,320
That's a mighty quiche, if Paul Hollywood can get out of it,

732
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,040
I tell you!

733
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,200
- They're not very dainty.
- Iced fingers aren't supposed to be dainty.

734
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,240
You've got to stuff your face with them!

735
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,800
They were on our side when it came to judging.

736
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,840
If Paul or Mary was being a bit too harsh...

737
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,640
No, Mary's never harsh, if Paul was being a bit harsh, they would step in

738
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,120
- Keep this for research purposes.
- OK.

739
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,960
When you've had bad feedback, they're there to pick you up.

740
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,360
I'm in the camp, I hate it.

741
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,320
- Paul hates it. 
- I wondered if you'd be in the camp.

742
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,000
To be honest with you, it's just like a bitterness on my tongue.

743
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,120
- I'm a fan of the Pernod, Rob. 
- And they're funny, they're so funny.

744
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,040
Just half an hour until I can eat five cheesecakes!

745
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,920
Sorry, that was my internal monologue there.

746
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,560
Half an hour, please. Half an hour.

747
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,480
While not baking experts...

748
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,960
This basket is a thing of beauty,

749
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,040
- I don't know whether to put bread in it, or wear it as a hat.
- Yeah!

750
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,880
..they often reveal their potential as baking therapists.

751
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,200
Got it, got it, got it. That was tense. That was tense.

752
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,840
Yes, with you standing there!

753
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,320
Is there anyone you're thinking about?

754
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,760
Oh, I can name a few people. Yeah!

755
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,800
I was getting really, really stressed, and Sue came over...

756
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,000
Hold your hands out.

757
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,120
Oh, no, no. We need to do some work on it.

758
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,840
I just couldn't stop shaking, I don't know what it was.

759
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,640
I've never really been that stressed before,

760
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,200
and I don't even think it was stress, I think it was fear!

761
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,600
I need to find some sort of mantra for something.

762
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,640
Or we need to workshop. Would an expressive dance help? Some song?

763
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,200
You know, I need to do just find a way of just calming...

764
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,320
- Of calming me down!
- Just calm the central nervous system down.

765
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,400
I don't think I appreciated how much support like that I needed.

766
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,320
Truth be told, I couldn't have done without them.

767
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,800
Bakers, time is very much up now.

768
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,760
There is a mousse loose around this house!

769
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,120
- And we're going to eat it!
- Yeah.

770
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,520
But it was Mel and Sue that always had to deliver the news

771
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,600
that none of the bakers ever wanted to hear.

772
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,600
- I've got someone in mind. 
- I have, too.

773
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,760
Oh, my heart just started going then.

774
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,040
- It's not you, Mel. It's not you. 
- Sorry.

775
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,640
- You're not scheduled to go until next week.
- OK.

776
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,040
Each week they had to tell someone that their Bake Off was over.

777
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,920
I just thought, "If I can just get through to next week."

778
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,520
It was always, with me, I'd go home and really, really practice,

779
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,440
so that I could just make it through to the next week,

780
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,520
and that was my strategy really, if you can call that a strategy.

781
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,200
I thought if you look too far ahead,

782
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,840
you might take your eye off the ball for the week you were in.

783
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:13,400
You could tell that the atmosphere was getting

784
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,560
more and more serious as the weeks went on.

785
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,280
And the person who will be leaving us this week is...

786
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,200
I didn't want my Bake-Off experience to ever end

787
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,920
because it was really enjoyable, really fun,

788
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,000
and it helped me to improve my baking

789
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,720
and meet people who love baking, to share tips and to just have a laugh.

790
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,320
Cos we all got on really well.

791
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,520
Commiserations, Keith. Round of applause.

792
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,360
- Well done, well done.
- Thank you very much. I've had a great time.

793
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,080
I wasn't surprised, no, when it came to the final judging.

794
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,120
I was like, there's good money placed on me here to kind of go out,

795
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,560
so it wasn't really a surprise.

796
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,440
I was just pleased I was able to walk away having really enjoyed myself,

797
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,920
which was really what I went in it for.

798
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,520
The saddest thing of all is that we have to lose one person.

799
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,280
I have to say, this was extremely close.

800
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,000
The person who will be leaving us this week is...

801
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,920
Simon.

802
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,760
I'm so sorry, mate.

803
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,080
I did think I was unlucky to go out,

804
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,200
considering things like Robert dropped his cake in the previous round.

805
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,000
I know it's not supposed to be cumulative,

806
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,760
it's supposed to be judged on the day,

807
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,440
but you can't help but think about these things as you go along.

808
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,480
And because he'd had problems with his quiche, his tart,

809
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,360
I was actually feeling quite confident

810
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,280
and looking forward to the third round.

811
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,800
So to go out, there was an initial,

812
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,880
"Oh. I'm not coming back next week, I'm quite upset about that."

813
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,200
Pull your finger out.

814
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,040
I had a word with Rob after the judge's decision, I said something like,

815
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,200
"Pull your finger out or I'm going to come and visit you."

816
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,120
Someone was leaving each week,

817
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,160
so the numbers started cutting down

818
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,480
and it felt a bit different around the tent and stuff, so that was quite hard.

819
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,880
There is a person, or maybe two people...

820
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,360
..that have failed to make the grade this week.

821
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,240
And those two people are...

822
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,160
Ian...

823
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,720
..and Urvashi.

824
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,800
When I did leave, it did make me question

825
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,000
some of the things I was baking,

826
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,760
and it has pushed me to try different things

827
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,440
that I would not have looked at before.

828
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,360
'So I'm really kind of grateful that I went through the whole process,'

829
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,640
and now I'm much better at some of the things

830
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,840
that I thought I was good at before.

831
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,360
As much as I wouldn't say I am overly competitive, to walk away

832
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:59,040
and know that you're one of the top 12 amateur bakers

833
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,160
in the country,

834
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,280
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't really proud of myself for that.

835
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,040
I got on really well with Ian, I really like Ian a lot.

836
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,480
- You've got to be proud of that. 
- I am quite proud of that.

837
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,880
I think he's one of the funniest people I've ever met.

838
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,920
I just enjoyed his company immensely.

839
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,760
And when he left, on a very personal, selfish level,

840
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,480
I was absolutely gutted for ME, because I thought, "Oh no,

841
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,200
"I've lost this buddy who's great fun,"

842
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,480
and the Bake Off felt like a much less colourful place for me.

843
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,240
I'd like to think I left with my dignity intact -

844
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,440
cutting my finger aside, of course.

845
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,200
My downfall was biscuit week.

846
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,520
The ginger nuts, Paul felt they were too spicy.

847
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,280
- For my taste, I think it is slightly over-gingered.
- But I like ginger.

848
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,560
My ginger nuts are always hotter. My grandmother's ginger nuts were always hotter,

849
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,160
- so I've put quite a bit of ginger in.
- I like the flavour ginger, but the burn that comes is,

850
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,400
- for me, too much.
- OK.

851
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,840
We then went on to brandy snaps.

852
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,560
- They were judged too dark, too thick.
- They are very thick.

853
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,120
I think they're two big, and slightly overdone.

854
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,560
The colour is very dark.

855
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,120
And then we were onto the macaroons. And we know what happened there.

856
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,520
- They are all different sizes. 
- They're horrendous.
- It's a disaster.

857
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,000
- It's all crashed.
- It's a disaster.

858
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,360
I swore I wasn't going to cry, and I cried.

859
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,640
Over macaroons. I cried over macaroons.

860
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,480
I'm just disappointed.

861
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,040
'I think some people got emotional because they felt'

862
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,040
this was an opportunity to have a whole new life afterwards,

863
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,040
if they were to do well.

864
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,400
And I think as time went on, people thought, "Goodness me,

865
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,040
"if I can do really well in this, it could be a life-changing thing."

866
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:56,080
I am proud, and I know friends and family will be proud of me as well.

867
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:03,800
I think that in that respect it was a shame because when people were sent

868
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:11,840
home they felt devastated because their dream was not going to be realised.

869
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,440
That was sad.

870
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,800
I think the common denominator for everyone

871
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,240
in the competition was that they were passionate about what they did.

872
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,280
My biggest disaster was leaving in week five.

873
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,640
You know the drill.

874
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,160
We can't take all of you on to our next Bake Off.

875
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,080
So today we are going to be saying goodbye...

876
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,400
..to Jason.

877
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,960
It was just really sad.

878
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,280
Generally, all three rounds were quite bad

879
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,200
so that was a low time.

880
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,600
And then of course having to go home from that's the was no more

881
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,880
fun times in the marquee.

882
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,600
It was quite sad.

883
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,520
And to Rob.

884
00:45:54,520 --> 00:46:00,240
I think I went out because I used up all of my cards.

885
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,960
I had played the cake-dropping card which no-one else had.

886
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,720
Then it kind of got down the line and I had messed up quite a lot

887
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,240
and had annoyed Paul too much and tried his patience.

888
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,920
So they kicked me out.

889
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,880
I mean, it was fair for me and Rob to have left because we did the worst.

890
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,920
Well, I did.

891
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,880
But in terms of having to leave the competition

892
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,760
and having had such a good time and having had done so well in the past,

893
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,600
it was really sad and really hard.

894
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,600
I still don't like the fact that I left that week

895
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,120
cos I didn't want my Bake Off time to end.

896
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,960
I was ready to leave. I had had fun

897
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,160
and it was getting to the point where I was just too tired.

898
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,520
It is so hard not to burn your fingers.

899
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,360
SHE WINCES IN PAIN

900
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:47,480
I really didn't want to do laminated pastries.

901
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,640
I was definitely ready to leave when I went.

902
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,880
This week was a very tough call.

903
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,800
It was the closest call we have ever had.

904
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,880
In fact, two people were

905
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,760
so sharply in contention that Paul and Mary have had to go back

906
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,080
and look at the results of all of the technical bakes this series.

907
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,680
That is how tight it was.

908
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:14,360
And so after reviewing all that, the person that very sadly will be leaving us...

909
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,440
..is Yasmin.

910
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:26,520
The rest of you, congratulations, you're semi-finalists.

911
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:31,720
- Well done.
- Sorry. 
- Don't be sorry. I'm relieved.

912
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,640
'I felt quite privileged because I didn't always feel that

913
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,880
'I should have been there.'

914
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,200
The quarterfinal...

915
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,200
I didn't really feel like I should have stayed in.

916
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:47,200
I felt huge amounts of guilt towards Yasmin. I still do actually. It is a funny feeling.

917
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,240
I feel terrible.

918
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,320
You live and learn. I'm really lucky to be here next week. Really lucky.

919
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,520
It wasn't a nice week. I didn't feel like, yeah, I am in.

920
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,840
I felt like, God, I'm in and I shouldn't be.

921
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,360
The thing is, this is all so serious, isn't it?

922
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,920
It's baking and we should all just get a grip

923
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,120
and this is the thing but when you're in it...

924
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,760
I think there was a shot of me crying like some kind of madwoman

925
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:19,000
and I remember watching it and thinking I look like a nutter.

926
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,960
I didn't have huge expectations of myself

927
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,640
because I don't rate myself too highly.

928
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,080
When I went through to the next round,

929
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,960
I was probably more surprised to get through

930
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,120
than I would have been to go home.

931
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:41,040
We can't take all four of you with us to next week's final.

932
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,680
I didn't ever feel disappointed, except when I was sent home.

933
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,960
Paul and Mary have decided that the person not coming with us

934
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,160
is Janet.

935
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,360
That's fine.

936
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,640
Can I just say, I have had a great time.

937
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,800
Thanks to everyone for your generosity, your kindness

938
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,160
and everything.

939
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,400
You are brilliant.

940
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,360
I think it's rather fun that people call you by your first name.

941
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,680
Even people you have never clapped eyes on

942
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,120
shout across the road to you.

943
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,440
It is quite fun. It is nice that people are happy really, isn't it?

944
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:27,200
Janet only just missed out on a place in the Bake Off grand final.

945
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,560
It was clear from really early on that Mary-Anne was going to be strong, Jo and Holly.

946
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,320
They were going to be the three that were there or thereabouts.

947
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,360
I think I was a bit slow to wake up to the fact that it was a competition.

948
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,760
Although that sounds strange.

949
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,360
My approach was, does it taste nice

950
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,840
and if it looks enticing, then that is a bonus.

951
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,840
I'd completed the journey so to be with Holly

952
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,040
and Mary-Anne in the final, if I didn't come first,

953
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,760
it wasn't a reflection on my baking because they were both so brilliant.

954
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,040
Do you know, there was a point probably about Pie Week

955
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,800
where I think I got a bit ahead of myself and thought, "I'm doing quite well here."

956
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,400
And, actually, the next week I was like, no, you're not going to win.

957
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,200
Holly's standard was so high from the start,

958
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,000
so things like measuring out the precision with which she decorated

959
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,280
all of her cakes or whatever it was she was doing, it was just so high

960
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,800
that it was clear she was going to go a long way, if not win it.

961
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:34,000
She struck me as one of those people that, before it came to baking,

962
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,080
she was probably, that I observed, the most stressed person there,

963
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:42,040
like proper bricking it, and sometimes when people are like that,

964
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:46,200
they have all this nervous energy and once they get in and release it,

965
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,680
they really kind of come to the fore.

966
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,160
And I say to anyone who's in this year's, don't look forward,

967
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,400
just keep your eye on that week, don't even dare to dream.

968
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,800
Just keep focused.

969
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:06,000
The winner of the 2011...

970
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,120
Great British Bake Off is...

971
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,280
I was always conscious that I wasn't the favourite.

972
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,840
I literally felt that I was probably the least favourite every week.

973
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,400
Jo!

974
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,400
CHEERING

975
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,880
I knew it.

976
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,480
'Me winning the Bake Off hasn't particularly changed home life.'

977
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:39,080
My boys are still my priority, they still mark my food out of ten

978
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:43,600
and still purposely give me low marks and constantly ribbing me.

979
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,240
- SUE:
- Three's a crowd, sorry.

980
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,840
Since winning the Bake Off,

981
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,440
Jo's boys have been seeing a little less of their mum.

982
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,240
In between running a baking school in her kitchen...

983
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,320
Give it a good, hard squeeze and then... That's it, there you go.

984
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,080
..she's also been having to find time to teach at larger venues.

985
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,760
Wow, I'm on there.

986
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,320
That's funny, isn't it?

987
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,560
Yeah, it is really a bit overwhelming to see that.

988
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,080
I'm at the Good Food Show today.

989
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,120
We're going to do a demo this afternoon in the VIP lounge,

990
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,440
so I've been doing two of these a day at Good Food.

991
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,720
Hi, everyone. Nice to meet you.

992
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,520
It's been really good fun. I've had lots of people come up for a chat.

993
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,800
'It's been really lovely.'

994
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,920
Give a bit more pressure, yeah.

995
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,240
I watch the show and she's very nice,

996
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,960
easy to talk to, and I like her demonstrations.

997
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,000
Seeing the different cutters and stuff and how easy they are to use.

998
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,400
- Techniques she showed.
- It's all very simple but all looked really good.

999
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,080
Made it all look very professional.

1000
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,080
It's all quite funny, really, that people think

1001
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,560
that I'm qualified to tell them different things.

1002
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,960
It's amazing the things that you do know

1003
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,800
and you can help people with, but you don't realise.

1004
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,120
You'd never realise that that was the case.

1005
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,680
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

1006
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,920
Jo Wheatley!

1007
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,920
APPLAUSE

1008
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,960
Do you have a top tip, a top baking tip that you could share with us?

1009
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,400
- Just always use the best ingredients. 
- Always use the best ingredients?

1010
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,640
And take time. Because if you rush things,

1011
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,240
they genuinely don't work as well.

1012
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,200
I think the reason that my baking was so good,

1013
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,320
when the boys were little, to get away from them

1014
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,320
I used to wash my kitchen floor, wash myself into the corner

1015
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,600
- and tell them they couldn't come in and just bake.
- Fantastic!

1016
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,080
- What's the next year got in store? 
- I don't know. Watch this space.

1017
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,760
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Jo Wheatley.

1018
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,320
Thanks, everybody. Thank you.

1019
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:53,480
Jo has also found a way of spreading her baking knowledge even further.

1020
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:02,880
- Hi, Jo.
- Hiya. How are you? 
- I'm good, thanks.
- Good, good.

1021
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,680
Oh, it's nice and warm. Fantastic.

1022
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,960
I was so excited when I was told that I was going in Bake Off

1023
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,800
because I was going to have a recipe in a cookery book, you know,

1024
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,560
It was like, "I'm going to get a recipe in a cookery book!"

1025
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,000
And now I'm going to have 120 recipes in a cookery book.

1026
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,960
And it's mine. And I'm going to be on the front and, you know,

1027
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:29,280
I never, ever dreamt that I'd be able to have my own cookery book.

1028
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,720
I'm here today because we're photographing the food

1029
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,160
and then we're going to go over the measurements and things,

1030
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:39,200
then they'll be photographed for the book. It's really exciting.

1031
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,000
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, fantastic.
- That is...

1032
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,800
It looks stunning. Put paper underneath it.

1033
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,640
She's still very, very humble and she said to me yesterday,

1034
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,640
"I can't believe this happened. I still keep pinching myself, going,

1035
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,520
"When am I going to wake up from this? Surely this isn't my life."

1036
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,080
We were looking around yesterday and she was all dressed up

1037
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,320
and she just looked really comfortable and natural

1038
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,720
and I think she's slipped into this role without getting

1039
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,640
any kind of ego or big ideas. She's really lovely to work with.

1040
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,840
I sort of thought I'd get a baking school from doing Bake Off

1041
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,520
if I did OK in it,

1042
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,240
and all of a sudden I've got the baking school,

1043
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,000
I've got personal appearances that I'm doing.

1044
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,840
Now it's the book. It's just...

1045
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,680
It is truly unbelievable.

1046
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,480
I literally wake up in the middle of the night and think,

1047
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,240
"Is it really real or did I dream it?"

1048
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,720
Honestly and truthfully,

1049
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:34,000
I can't tell you how much of a wonderful experience it's all been.

1050
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,440
- It looks amazing. 
- It's now about that big.

1051
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,200
THEY LAUGH

1052
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,600
I thought we were going to just eat our way through 120 recipes!

1053
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,760
It was really a learning experience for me.

1054
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,120
Every week, I felt that I was learning something.

1055
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,440
And in life, I think that you should try different things and learn,

1056
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,720
you know, there's always a different learning experience out there,

1057
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,280
and if you don't take that chance,

1058
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,200
then you can just be safe all your life

1059
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,960
but never have these amazing experiences.

1060
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,480
It's really just taught me to be a bit more risk-taking

1061
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,240
and adventurous and go for things that you really enjoy.

1062
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,520
Cos I really enjoy baking.

1063
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,880
APPLAUSE

1064
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,960
It was quite an emotional experience,

1065
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,760
I think because it's something that we love so much

1066
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,400
and we want to share with people.

1067
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:34,200
I was so amazed to get through and taking part every week

1068
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,320
and competing with people who are seriously talented,

1069
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,200
I was so proud. It was stressful

1070
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,760
and it was emotional, of course it was.

1071
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,040
But, overall, it was just such a laugh as well.

1072
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:53,320
Taking part in the Great British Bake Off was a fantastic experience.

1073
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,360
It really was. It's hard to put into words.

1074
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:00,640
I do highly recommend that people sign up for anything like this,

1075
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:05,360
even if it's a local fair or a fete or a food festival.

1076
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,880
Just have a go. Go and try and get a rosette.

1077
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,320
Every single person in that top 12 should pat themselves on the back,

1078
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,600
because we all did phenomenally well.

1079
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,840
We have come into this competition...

1080
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:22,840
good bakers and I think hopefully we've left far, far better bakers.

1081
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,760
Entering the Bake Off, right back at the beginning,

1082
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,560
filling in the application form was the best thing that I ever did.

1083
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:35,720
Taking part was exciting, intense, exhilarating, funny.

1084
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:41,840
There were highs and lows. But I wouldn't have changed a minute of it.

1085
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,600
I think I learned a lot about myself as a person

1086
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:52,200
and it's gone down as part of who I am, part of life's experience.

1087
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,480
I think it has probably made me a bit stronger.

1088
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,480
And a bit heavier as well!

1089
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,600
