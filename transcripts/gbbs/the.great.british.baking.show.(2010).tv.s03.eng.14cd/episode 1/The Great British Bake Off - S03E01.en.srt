1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,600
It's the moment every cake, bread and pie lover has been waiting for. 

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,960
The tent's up, the ovens are pre-heated 

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,200
and 12 of Britain's finest amateur bakers are ready to do battle. 

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,040
This year, the challenges are tougher 

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,400
than Ross Kemp on a paintballing weekend 

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,520
plus the portions are even larger, matron. 

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,960
Welcome to The Great British Bake Off. 

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,720
From thousands of entries, 

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,360
a fresh batch of 12 hugely talented home bakers from all over Britain 

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,440
have made it to the Bake Off tent. 

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,680
Winning's definitely the top of my mind. I just want to beat everybody, 

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,720
really, and just say that I'm the best, as cocky as that sounds. 

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,600
They've been practising for months 

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,760
to tackle a totally new set of challenges 

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,640
that will push their skills, 

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,400
creativity and determination to the limit. 

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,840
My kids haven't seen me without being covered in flour and with an apron on 

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,400
and meringue in my hair and stuff for a very long time. 

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Their battle for bake off survival... 

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,600
- Ow!
- Argh! 

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,800
..will be judged by the king and queen of British baking... 

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,200
Go on, say something nice. 

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,760
..legendary cookery writer, Mary Berry, 

24
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,760
and master baker, Paul Hollywood. 

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,880
I hope they know that things are advancing now, 

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,200
techniques are moving on. 

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,000
They're going to have to really raise the game. 

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,480
If all else fails, I can say I've built the Coliseum. 

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,160
All the challenges this year are considerably harder. 

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,800
Right, this could go horribly, horribly wrong. 

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,600
Don't kid yourself, we'll be on their backs from the very first off. 

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,040
You respect Mary, but you fear the Wood, yeah 

33
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,680
Those piercing blue eyes, it's quite scary. 

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,360
Those that fall short... 

35
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,440
Stop dripping. 

36
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,520
..will have to leave. 

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,800
You're cutting through my heart. 

38
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,400
And only one... 

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,240
- There's no going back! 
- ..can be crowned the winner... 

40
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,160
- Yes!
- Yes! 
- ..of the Great British Bake Off. 

41
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,280
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands. 

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,720
CLAPS HANDS Yay! 

43
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,280
Honestly, I've completely lost it. 

44
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,520
The Bake Off has travelled west to Harptree Court, 

45
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,800
deep in the Somerset countryside, 

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,880
for this year's search for Britain's best home baker. 

47
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,680
Up until last year, 

48
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,640
the word "chicken" was the most searched for term on the internet. 

49
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,320
- Really?
- Food term, anyway.
- OK. 

50
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,560
But it's now it's been usurped with the word "cake", 

51
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,160
which is useful because today's episode's all about cake. 

52
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,920
- Mmm.
- Yeah? 
- And it doesn't taste like chicken. 

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,760
Which is strange, cos it's actually a giblet sponge. 

54
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,680
Tastes like cake. 

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,880
The bakers face two days of baking. 

56
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,360
After three challenges, one will be crowned this week's star baker 

57
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,720
and another will have to leave the Bake Off. 

58
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,800
A very warm welcome, bakers, to our Bake Off tent 

59
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,560
and to this, your signature challenge. 

60
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,600
This is your opportunity to demonstrate 

61
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,200
one of your tried and tested home recipes. 

62
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,240
So what we're looking for is your own personal spin 

63
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,400
on an absolute classic, the upside down cake. 

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,360
Or, as the Australians call it, cake. 

65
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,960
So this is a simple sponge, just topped with a fruit of your choice. 

66
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,080
You've got two hours to bake and present your cake, 

67
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,640
so for the first time... 

68
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,000
On your marks... 

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,680
- Get set...
- Bake.
- Bake. 

70
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,240
A classic British upside down cake traditionally features 

71
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,480
a sponge baked on top of a layer of fruit. 

72
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,640
It's flipped once it comes out of the oven 

73
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,200
so the fruit bottom becomes the top. 

74
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,760
They could do all sorts of things with different fruits, 

75
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,920
different flavours, and the fruit must hold its shape, 

76
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,920
it mustn't all fall apart and become mushy. 

77
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,520
The bake is crucial. 

78
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,840
You're adding liquid to a batter and baking it so the top roasts 

79
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,160
and cooks properly and the sponge bakes properly, 

80
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,480
creating an upside down cake that's moist, light and full of flavour. 

81
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,480
Really nerve-wracking. I haven't had any breakfast this morning. 

82
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,160
My hands are still a bit shaky, 

83
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,120
but I'm just trying to be calm and...methodical, 

84
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,320
which is not me at all. 

85
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,760
27-year-old mum of two Cathryn works at a motorway service station 

86
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,080
near the village where she lives in Sussex. 

87
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,480
If she manages to find any free time, 

88
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,080
she bakes with seven-year-old Maisy and three-year-old Ambrose. 

89
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,240
Her signature upside down cake features apple, vanilla, 

90
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,800
calvados, hazelnut and caramel. 

91
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,920
- That's a very busy cake.
- Oh! 

92
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,440
- Have you had any problems with it before?
- No. 

93
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,280
- You can be honest with us. 
- Not really. I don't know! 

94
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,760
- He's just trying to put the wind up you.
- It's working! 

95
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,800
Just make sure that your timing is perfect. All about timing. 

96
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,640
I feel the need just to reach across very briefly. 

97
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,560
- Unclench your hands. There we go. 
- Thanks.
- Breathe.
- Thank you. 

98
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,920
- And relax.
- Thank you.
- Good luck. 
- Thank you. 

99
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,880
Normally, I mean, you can eat kumquats with the pips, 

100
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,560
but for a competition, I'll go that extra bit 

101
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,960
and just take the pips out. 

102
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,960
38-year-old Ryan lives in Bristol with his wife and two children. 

103
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,520
Coo-ee! 

104
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,880
Now a photographer, he grew up in kitchens 

105
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,920
honing his skills in his parents' Chinese takeaway. 

106
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,400
He's the only baker not using a traditional sponge mix 

107
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,280
for his kumquat upside down cake. 

108
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,760
I make this with polenta and it's very crumbly. 

109
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,760
It's nice in the mouth, the texture's very nice, 

110
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,040
but there's a risk that, as I turn it over, it'll just fall apart. 

111
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,320
It's dangerous, using polenta on a cake that you will have to turn out. 

112
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,240
But I'm looking forward to this 

113
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,600
cos that sourness coming from the kumquats is fantastic, 

114
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,000
it should come through well. 

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,640
Most bakers are using a simple caramel made of sugar and butter 

116
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,320
to help keep their fruit in place at the bottom of their tins. 

117
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,200
I think a lot of people are going to do round, 

118
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,640
so I thought I'd do a square one because, you know, 

119
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,080
it's a bit more pleasing to the eye, really, these days. 

120
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,680
It's a bit more modern. 

121
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,200
So it's 10.30, 11.30, 11, 12.30. 

122
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,600
But, worried about time, Manisha is using a caramel substitute. 

123
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
So you're having golden syrup underneath, yeah? 

124
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,160
When I turn it over, it'll look golden brown. 

125
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,400
That's quite unusual to use golden syrup underneath it. 

126
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,600
- It'll make it very sweet, won't it? 
- Yeah. 

127
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,240
- Are you going to be lining that at all?
- No. 

128
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,160
- Have you had any problems with using golden syrup?
- So far, no. 

129
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,320
After work at a nursery in Leicester, Manisha rushes home 

130
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,160
to cook all the family meals for her dad and brothers. 

131
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,520
Her quick and easy golden syrup topped sponge also features 

132
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,080
fresh raspberries and peaches. 

133
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,480
I've tried this recipe out with my dad and my two brothers. 

134
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,840
They seemed to love it, so... I'm really nervous now, a little bit. 

135
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,000
Unlike Manisha, Victoria isn't taking any short cuts. 

136
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,440
Roasting her own pecans and making pear rings by hand. 

137
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,680
I think it's very easy, because you're cooking fruit or vegetables, 

138
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,920
for them to sort of mush, and I thought, 

139
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,000
if I at least attempt to have some structure, 

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,120
then that adds a visual component that perhaps will make it 

141
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,720
attractive when it's tipped out. 

142
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,000
Career-driven Victoria has risen to CEO of a charity 

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,840
dedicated to preserving wild plant life in Britain. 

144
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,240
Baking at home in Somerset 

145
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,720
is a welcome break from her huge responsibilities. 

146
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,560
She's aiming to impress the judges 

147
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,720
by giving her upside down cake bite, 

148
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,520
by adding finely chopped stem ginger. 

149
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,600
Normally baking is something I do in private 

150
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,200
and then what I really want to do is share it with people, 

151
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,960
take it into work and then that's the bit I get tense usually, 

152
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
cos I go, "Oh golly, I thought this was great, 

153
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,840
"but what did other people think?" 

154
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,920
Whereas this is the other way round in a way, 

155
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,520
because it's all about, you know, how you actually prepare it 

156
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,640
so definitely a different experience, 

157
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,200
but baking's still in there somewhere. 

158
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,400
While some are hoping to succeed with traditional ingredients... 

159
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,520
Everyone associates pineapple when they think of upside-down pudding, 

160
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,160
but I've put a Caribbean twist on. 

161
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,560
..others are aiming higher. 

162
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,480
I'm going for a tomato upside down cake. 

163
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,240
So it sounds a bit odd, I know, 

164
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,840
but it does work, I've tried it, so...yeah. 

165
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,000
26-year-old PE teacher Stuart works and lives in Staffordshire. 

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,160
He was taught how to bake from just four years old 

167
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,240
by his grandmother, a domestic science teacher. 

168
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,040
His tomato upside down cake also features a ginger sponge. 

169
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,920
Can we have a look at what you've done with the tomatoes? 

170
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,960
Yeah, so at the moment it's an unfortunate colour 

171
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,920
cos of the type of ingredients like the black treacle, for example, 

172
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,960
so it comes out looking a bit dark. 

173
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,600
I've tweaked it by making it a little bit more tomatoey, 

174
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,080
by adding some tomato jam with it as well. 

175
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,080
- Well, he's original anyway. We're waiting.
- He's a maverick. 

176
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,400
But there's more than one maverick in this year's Bake Off. 

177
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,520
It's maybe slightly surprising, parsnip. 

178
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,600
Like a carrot cake, 

179
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,680
it doesn't actually taste too radical. 

180
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,440
Everyone has loved it so far. 

181
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,800
I just need to keep that up. 

182
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,800
21-year-old medical student James grew up in the Shetland Isles 

183
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,840
and is the youngest baker in the competition. 

184
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,040
He treats his kitchen like a laboratory 

185
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,320
and his experiment with parsnips 

186
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,080
also involves comice pears and pecans. 

187
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,440
I've just added the parsnips and the pecans and I'm just folding them in. 

188
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,080
I've already added the flour so I don't want to over mix. 

189
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,000
I hope they all blend together and work. 

190
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,840
Just check my recipe. 

191
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,960
Yep, I think we're ready to rock and roll. 

192
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,240
Dirty dozen, you are halfway through your first signature bake. 

193
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,680
You have one hour to go. 

194
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,560
The bakers have faced the point of no return. 

195
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,880
Once the sponge mix goes on top of their fruit, 

196
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,600
the fate of their upside down cake is sealed. 

197
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm quite worried, actually. I'm the first one in. 

198
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,760
TIMERS BLEEP 

199
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,640
Praying, I think, is the next stage. 

200
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,480
Fingers crossed, people, fingers crossed. 

201
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,120
I forgot to put my tomato jam in. 

202
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,600
- What?! 
- Yeah. Gutted. Stupid error. 

203
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,840
I kind of made a bit of an error, it's kind of a major one, I think. 

204
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,880
In a blind panic, 

205
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,840
I put the cake in the oven before putting the tomato jam on. 

206
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,400
It adds to the flavour of it. 

207
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,480
Other than that, it's just a cake with just tomato decorations on top. 

208
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,240
They're quite tricky to cook all the way through, upside down cakes, 

209
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,480
cos you don't want to overcook it so the sponge is dry, 

210
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,520
but you need to cook it enough so the fruit is cooked. 

211
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,000
At home, all the numbers are worn off around my dial, 

212
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,240
so it's always a guess as to whether anything's going to cook or not! 

213
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,400
28-year-old mum of two Sarah-Jane is a vicar's wife 

214
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,880
and regularly bakes for her husband David's congregation in West Sussex. 

215
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,040
Her pear, chocolate and hazelnut upside down cake 

216
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,600
is a parish favourite. 

217
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,120
- TIMER BLEEPS 
- That's my timer. I'm just going to check. 

218
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,920
Oh, we came at the right moment. 

219
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,280
It might need a little bit longer. 

220
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,480
We'll have a look and see. 

221
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,560
How are you judging when it's ready? 

222
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,120
It's still got a little shake in the middle at the moment. 

223
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,440
I don't want it to collapse when I turn it out. 

224
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,600
So you'll know when it's ready when it doesn't shake? 

225
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,720
Yeah. 

226
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,800
Oven timing is critical. 

227
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,440
Still feels a little bit undercooked in the middle. 

228
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,560
One or two minutes can mean the difference 

229
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,560
between a burnt fruit topping or a liquid, underdone sponge. 

230
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,600
It's not supposed to leak. 

231
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,000
It's bubbling over like a volcano 

232
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,520
and all the golden syrup is coming out. 

233
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Oh, golden syrup, why you have to leak for? 

234
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,600
Maybe I should take it out, I don't know. 

235
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,360
Don't underestimate this lady. 

236
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,440
She keeps on saying how nervous she is, 

237
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,400
but actually she's very determined. 

238
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,760
TIMER BLEEPS 

239
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,440
Oh, heavens. I've got too much going on now, look. 

240
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,520
I'm making the spiky hazelnut decorations. 

241
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,440
Oh! Hopefully it will look nice when they're done. 

242
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,880
OK, bakers, that's just ten minutes on the upside downs. 

243
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,120
Ten minutes, please. 

244
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,840
The bakers need to factor in 

245
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,560
not just enough time for their cakes to bake 

246
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,760
but also for the delicate process of turning out. 

247
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,240
OK, let's do it now. Help. 

248
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,280
Kind of got a bit stuck at the moment. 

249
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,640
Fingers crossed, everybody. 

250
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,600
Yep, happy with that. 

251
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,520
Very pleased, absolutely. Went to plan. 

252
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,480
Oop. Yes. 

253
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,840
Messy, isn't it? 

254
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,560
Pretty happy...apart from the one component, obviously. 

255
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,560
Just spread it on top. 

256
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,760
It turned over. I'm not complaining. I won't tempt fate, you know. 

257
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,040
It's a disaster. 

258
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,960
We can save this. 

259
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,280
11 signature cakes are upside down 

260
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:24,080
but James' parsnip sponge experiment is still in progress. 

261
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,240
- Oh, keep it in there.
- Normally it's well cooked by this time. 

262
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,000
So do you think the fruit is just a little bit more juicy? 

263
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,840
A little bit more moisture's gone in? 

264
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,280
Yeah. I've got absolutely no idea, to be honest. 

265
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,040
- Bakers dozen, you've got five minutes to go.
- Five now? That's good. 

266
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,600
- Five minutes.
- You've got three minutes in the oven 

267
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,000
- and then two minutes to turn it. 
- Four minutes in the oven. 

268
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,880
- That's a speedy turn, isn't it? 
- Yeah.
- It's going to be, "boom!" 

269
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,000
It's all going to be good, it's all going to be good. 

270
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,280
This could be...horrific. 

271
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,480
I'm going to take it out at the very last minute and pray. 

272
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,800
Bakers, this is your 60-second countdown. 

273
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,640
Not great. 

274
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Countdown is complete. 

275
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,760
Move your cakes to the end of the benches. 

276
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,840
Time to leave the cakes well alone. No more touching. 

277
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,400
It's judgment time. 

278
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,960
- Hiya.
- Right, so remind us of the topping of this. 

279
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Well, the topping is kumquats, but it's a polenta cake. 

280
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,040
The idea is all about texture, really. 

281
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,760
- It's a little solid for me. 
- It's far too dry. 

282
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,480
The texture of an upside down cake should be moist and hold moisture. 

283
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,600
As soon as you add polenta, it's going to dry, 

284
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,480
because that's the nature of the beast. 

285
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,080
The decoration has worked. You've done what you told us you'd do. 

286
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,480
I rather like the way that you've coarsely chopped the nuts 

287
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,360
round the outside 

288
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,600
and then we have the nut with its spike at the top. 

289
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,920
It's really lovely. 

290
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,400
The texture, the flavour, the crunch...are gorgeous. 

291
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,400
- I think it's a beautiful cake. 
- Thank you.
- It's scrummy. 

292
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,480
The decoration I think is lovely, 

293
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,920
but that ginger cake to me is slightly over baked. 

294
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,280
- At least there are no soggy bottoms. 
- Yes, thank you very much for that! 

295
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,680
You don't want one of those. 

296
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,240
He lives in fear of that. 

297
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,040
- It's over-baked.
- Is it?
- Yeah. 

298
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,920
But you can really taste the pears, which is a good thing. 

299
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,000
That's good, I'm pleased. 

300
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,560
The chocolate cake is delicious, but I can't taste the pear. 

301
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,720
The pear doesn't have a very strong flavour anyway. 

302
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,760
- That's why I poached it in the wine. 
- Unfortunately, we've lost the wine. 

303
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,520
Sure you didn't have a little tipple before you started? 

304
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,520
I love the way you've built the structure of the pears on there. 

305
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,560
Very professional when you look at it. 

306
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,120
- You've actually managed to hold the pear flavour.
- Oh, really? 

307
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,440
- It's so delicious.
- Oh, good. 

308
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,640
The decoration you've managed to get is quite even and well structured. 

309
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,400
I had a worry that it would be too sweet. 

310
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,040
- It's not at all too sweet. 
- Thank you. 

311
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,560
- Doesn't it look tempting? 
- I love that. 

312
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,320
The passion fruit you put in at the beginning? 

313
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,960
Well, I just made a syrup with the passion fruit, 

314
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,920
then I did the pineapple. 

315
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,080
Pretty unusual to have passion fruit heated. 

316
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,080
- It loses some of its flavour. 
- Yeah, it's not as intense, is it? 

317
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,720
It does look so inviting. 

318
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,080
Everything is in the right proportion. 

319
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,520
That's delicious. 

320
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,080
- It tastes really good.
- I'm actually struggling to find something 

321
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,720
to have a go at - flavour, texture, colour, well done. 

322
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,400
I'm going to bundle him out before he can say anything negative. 

323
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,160
I think it looks... I think it could be better. 

324
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,240
- Looks can be deceiving. 
- It's a very, very close texture. 

325
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,600
The tomato has added moisture, but hasn't added any taste. 

326
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,880
It's almost immaterial that it's there. 

327
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,160
That's what the jam was there for, but I forgot to put it in. 

328
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,040
That's probably why the taste isn't there. 

329
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,880
- It's just predominately a very dense ginger cake.
- Yeah. 

330
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,400
So how do you think it went then, Professor Cake Maker? 

331
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,520
- It might be under-baked. 
- Why do you think that? 

332
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,040
Because it was raw five minutes before I took it out! 

333
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,840
It's fine underneath. 

334
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,400
I think it's actually baked all right. 

335
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,680
I don't think there's a problem with that. 

336
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,760
- Actually, the parsnip is not coming through strongly as parsnip.
- No. 

337
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,640
But very brave to put that parsnip in, even though we can't find it. 

338
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,000
- I just got a lovely bit of parsnip. 
- Did you?
- It was really nice. 

339
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,400
Mmm. It's tasty. 

340
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,560
It was cooked. It was cooked! Who'd have thought? 

341
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,680
I just thought, it being the first bake, try and push the boat out. 

342
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,400
Unfortunately, this time it's not gone according to plan. 

343
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,720
They didn't have any criticisms, which just blew me away. 

344
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,160
A real fillip, as one might say. 

345
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,200
Mary Berry said it was scrummy, 

346
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,360
which is amazing. Really properly amazing. 

347
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,000
The worst our bakers can expect 

348
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,960
is a dressing down from the baking silverback Paul Hollywood 

349
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,200
or a frown from Mary Berry, 

350
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,840
so spare a thought for the 13th century baker who, 

351
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,920
if they produced a sub-standard loaf, 

352
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,240
would face imprisonment or being pelted with rotten fruit. 

353
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,760
800 years ago, ordinary people didn't have ovens at home 

354
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,040
and were at the mercy of bakers for their daily bread. 

355
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,840
In 1266, the government introduced a new law 

356
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,280
called the Assize of Bread and Ale 

357
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,280
and any baker seen to be flouting this would be sent here, 

358
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,160
to the Bakers' Hall, to face trial at the Court of Halimote. 

359
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,880
The law spelled out exactly what a loaf should weigh, cost, 

360
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,120
and the quality of bread expected. 

361
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,680
So, if you were a medieval baker, 

362
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,920
this would've been the last place you wanted to end up. 

363
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,760
The court beadle was in charge of tracking down the culprits and bringing them to justice. 

364
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,400
The position still exists today, but his role is now purely ceremonial. 

365
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,800
So, Neil, I'm a bad baker. 

366
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,400
My scones are scandalous, my cottage loaf is a crime against gluten, 

367
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,360
but it's my first offence. What's going to happen to me? 

368
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,640
Well, the Beadle of the day would have summoned 

369
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,200
a man with a horse and a stretcher, 

370
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,640
or a hurdle, and they would have been tied to the hurdle 

371
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,080
by their wrists and feet 

372
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,800
and dragged through the city 

373
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,640
so everyone can see that you've been caught producing illicit bread. 

374
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,600
Just one duff loaf and suddenly 

375
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,560
you're strapped to a gurney and being paraded around...? 

376
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,840
You are, but the fact of the matter 

377
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,720
was that people were putting things like cobwebs and sand 

378
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,640
and all sorts of illicit products in the bread, which could kill someone. 

379
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,640
For bakers that continually flouted the law, 

380
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,160
being dragged through the streets of medieval London 

381
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,600
was just the beginning. 

382
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,280
Neil, why have you brought me here? 

383
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,240
This would be the place where, for the second offence, 

384
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,560
they would be brought, 

385
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,440
where the pillory would be set - at the Royal Exchange - 

386
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,760
and a pillory always had to be on a junction. 

387
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,880
You could come from north, south, east or west. 

388
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,440
To get the maximum amount of people to stare and laugh? 

389
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,200
No, just to throw the rotten fruit. 

390
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,800
So we know that the second offence you basically get a face smoothie. 

391
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,560
But the third offence, what happens then? 

392
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,520
The third is the most extreme and that would be myself 

393
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,320
and a bailiff going round to the errant baker 

394
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,920
and smashing their ovens 

395
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,200
so they were no longer able to operate in the city. 

396
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,880
- How many ovens do you smash nowadays?
- None. 

397
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,520
- There's real disappointment there, isn't there?
- There is. 

398
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,400
It wasn't until the 19th century that the law was repealed, 

399
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
bringing an end to such punishments. 

400
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,800
Nowadays, an icy glare from Paul and Mary 

401
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,840
is more than enough to bring our bakers into line. 

402
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,720
For the second test, 

403
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,520
all the bakers will be given the same surprise recipe, 

404
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,720
allowing the judges to directly compare their results. 

405
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,040
Bakers, adopt the brace position, 

406
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,000
this is your first technical challenge. 

407
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,240
The challenge is judged blind, 

408
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,680
so Paul and Mary please retire to your secret tepee. 

409
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,960
Now, this technical challenge is actually Paul Hollywood's recipe - 

410
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,840
no pressure - and this recipe is for a classic 1970s' staple, 

411
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,960
rum baba, OK? 

412
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,960
So what we're looking for are four perfect babas 

413
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,760
with cream in the middle and perfectly sliced fruit on top. 

414
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,640
So you've got three hours to bake and present your babas. 

415
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,160
- On your marks... 
- Get set...
- Bake.
- Bake. 

416
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,920
All the bakers have the same ingredients 

417
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,320
and the same very basic recipe, so they'll have to rely 

418
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,280
on their baking instincts 

419
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,840
to produce baba perfection. 

420
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,160
Could be hit and a miss with this. 

421
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,200
The baba is believed to be a descendant of a cake called babka, 

422
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,840
Polish for "grandmother". 

423
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,600
It's unusual, as it uses yeast as a raising agent. 

424
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,280
I'm quite afraid of this recipe. 

425
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,680
The bakers should be used to working with yeast in bread making. 

426
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,200
I've got no idea what I'm doing! 

427
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,400
But applying these techniques to a cake mix 

428
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,120
could be a step into the unknown. 

429
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,640
It's a tricky one. It's basically a yeasted cake. 

430
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,920
We've filled it with Chantilly cream and then topped it with fresh fruit. 

431
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,160
Those are absolute perfection. Where could they go wrong? 

432
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,240
I reckon there's going to be a few heads scratching on this one. 

433
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,240
It is a hybrid between bread and cake 

434
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,840
and the batter/soft dough is extremely difficult to make. 

435
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,120
So this is quite confusing for our bakers. 

436
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,880
I think a lot of them will be perplexed 

437
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,440
and I'm sure that most of them 

438
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,800
wouldn't have made anything quite like this before. 

439
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,240
And I hope you've given them lots of instruction. 

440
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,440
I've given them some. 

441
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,800
Once the ingredients of flour, yeast, eggs, 

442
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,520
sugar and butter are combined, the mixture requires kneading. 

443
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,960
It's just, like, strange really. 

444
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,720
But the high liquid content from the beaten egg means 

445
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,040
the texture of this thick dough might be unfamiliar. 

446
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,400
Oh, my God, get off. Oh, my God. 

447
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,960
This is not going to go well, is it? 

448
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,360
The dough is so delicate that 16th century pastry chefs 

449
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,120
were said to rest it on an eiderdown before baking. 

450
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,240
One of my favourite cookbooks is an old dairy cookbook of Mum's 

451
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,800
back from the '70s and there's a big glossy picture of rum babas 

452
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,920
so I instantly thought of that cookbook 

453
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,560
and thought, "Gosh, I wish I'd have read it now!" 

454
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,600
37-year-old Natasha is a midwife who lives and works 

455
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,560
in Tamworth in the West Midlands. 

456
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,920
Now her two daughters are teenagers, 

457
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,680
she aims to spend more time raising cakes. 

458
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,040
- Do you find it relaxing, working with dough?
- Yes. 

459
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,240
I suppose I've got to say that, Mr Hollywood might be listening. 

460
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,120
- Have you ever made one of these before?
- No, no. 

461
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,640
But are you good in a crisis? 

462
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,560
Ask me in an hour's time and I'll tell you. 

463
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,000
I was very happy to see this recipe come up. 

464
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,320
Can I explain how happy? 

465
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,480
I'm obviously setting myself up for a fall now, 

466
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,240
but I made a really big rum baba last week. 

467
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,680
Or actually, I used whisky, I didn't use rum, but I'm Scottish. 

468
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,240
Once kneaded, the dough has to prove... 

469
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,440
Good luck. 

470
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,040
..until it's doubled in size... 

471
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,480
..which gives the bakers time to line their baba tins. 

472
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,160
I covered my tins with butter and flour 

473
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:22,080
and it's meant to be butter and sugar, so... Completely stupid. 

474
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,440
Once proved, the dough should be soft enough 

475
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,200
to be piped into its mould and then proved for a second time. 

476
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,800
I have a firmer dough and so I'm rolling it, rather than pipe it. 

477
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,200
Maybe it should be more liquidy, I don't know. 

478
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,440
Now, I'm thinking, Brendan, that, like myself, 

479
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,600
- you might have been around in the '70s?
- I was. 

480
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,080
I made these about 25 whatever it was, years ago. 

481
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,360
You've actually made a baba? 

482
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,800
Oh yes, but it's so long ago, I don't think it counts! 

483
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,120
Were you a bit of a groovster? 

484
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,000
No. I mean, I liked Gloria Gaynor. 

485
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,560
I was very good with my dips at the discos, so... 

486
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,840
Show me a dip, please. 

487
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,600
- But I've been... 
- Brendan, dip for me, please. 

488
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,040
- There's a little wiggle you have to do!
- Oh, one of these? 

489
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,760
- Exactly.
- Like this. 
- You shimmy a bit.
- Yeah! 

490
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,720
63-year-old Brendan is a semi-retired recruitment consultant... 

491
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,920
but now has the time to indulge his passion for music and baking, 

492
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,880
which he first discovered as a child growing up in rural Ireland. 

493
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,160
You have a disaster. 

494
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,960
I put a damp towel over them to protect them and it's stuck to it. 

495
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,080
It's not going to plan, as it were. 

496
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,600
- Hi.
- Danny.
- Yes. 
- Two words.
- Yeah.
- Rum baba. 

497
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,680
Yeah. And a completely foreign language to me. 

498
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,480
Does this feel slightly exam-like? 

499
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,400
You know, when you wake up in the middle of the night sometimes 

500
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,160
- and you think, "I haven't revised"? 
- Or you have no pants on. 

501
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,920
- Yes, yes. This is everybody's looking at me and I'm naked.
- Yes. 

502
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,840
This is a no pants moment, Danny. 

503
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,160
Raised in Manchester, 45-year-old Danny 

504
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,640
is an intensive care consultant working in Sheffield. 

505
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,040
A keen traveller, she's researched baking from all over the world. 

506
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,280
I would try a new recipe, but this is different 

507
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,960
because somebody's going to judge it and I can't put it in the bin. 

508
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,320
So...here's hoping. 

509
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,400
Paul's recipe only states that babas should be baked in a hot oven, 

510
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,600
leaving some bakers room to experiment. 

511
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,960
I'm stuck. 

512
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,640
I don't know whether just to bake them or to do a bain marie, 

513
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,960
I'm just not sure. 

514
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,240
Something's telling me to do a bain marie, 

515
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,360
but it might be the wrong decision. 

516
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
It's a big decision, this is. 

517
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,280
It could all go wrong, couldn't it? If I take the wrong path. 

518
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,280
What the hell, I'm going to do the bain marie. 

519
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,000
I don't think it'll do any damage. 

520
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,520
All done now. I can't turn back. 

521
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,520
So you seem very, very relaxed. It's all under control? 

522
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,560
My mum always said that stress in baking tastes terrible, 

523
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,760
so I'm going to apply that principle 

524
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,520
and just try and be cool, calm and collected. 

525
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,080
But some people think maybe baking is, you know, 

526
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,600
- traditionally maybe as a more sedate, older person's thing?
- Yeah. 

527
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,120
So why are you so drawn to it? 

528
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,800
I think that baking is the biggest fashion there is at the minute. 

529
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,240
I still go out to clubs and I can come home and make a cake. 

530
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,840
What's wrong with that? 

531
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,360
Big sponge, little sponge. Big sponge, little sponge. 

532
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,760
Exactly, that's how we do it! 

533
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,920
22-year-old law student John left Oxford University 

534
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,920
to study in Manchester, so he could live nearer his family. 

535
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,280
He was taught to bake by his mum 

536
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,680
and has always relied on her advice when trying new recipes. 

537
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,800
I'm just worried cos I didn't put any sugar in the actual dough 

538
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,760
and I think a few people have, but it wasn't very clear. 

539
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,840
But...I should have known, I should have known. 

540
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,240
They're going quite brown quite quickly... 

541
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,120
so I turned it down. I don't want them to collapse. 

542
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,560
An enriched dough needs a high heat to rise, 

543
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,960
but the added sugar means they're more sensitive to burning. 

544
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,560
I think that's a bit of sugar 

545
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,560
that's perhaps caught around the edges there, 

546
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,960
you know, when I lined the tin? 

547
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,960
Mmm. 

548
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,720
One hour remaining. 

549
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,880
Always happens. 

550
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Hmm, how does one get this out? 

551
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,840
But this is just stuck fast. 

552
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,440
Removing a baba from its tin is a delicate operation. 

553
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,480
Come on, you beauty. 

554
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,360
Please come out. 

555
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,920
If the soft texture isn't treated with enough care, 

556
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,720
it's liable to rip. 

557
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,240
Uh-oh. 

558
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,280
Oh dear, that's not good. 

559
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,760
Oh, oh. 

560
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,440
Just kept it together. 

561
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,520
Oh. 

562
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,560
Oh, I've...messed up big style here. 

563
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,840
I've put salt in with the tin, rather than sugar. 

564
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,080
That is disgusting. 

565
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,320
That's going to put me in the bad books from the start, really. 

566
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,600
It's going, you know, John's the boy who...messed around with salt. 

567
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,600
Oh. It's all gone wrong! 

568
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,000
My gamble didn't pay off. 

569
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,680
They're all stuck into the dish. 

570
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,840
It's all gone wrong, Mel. It's all gone wrong. 

571
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,000
What's going on? Tell me. 

572
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,600
They're all rubbish. 

573
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Oh. 

574
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,560
I've made the wrong decision, haven't I? 

575
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,080
So, could be all over for me now, so... Oh, well! 

576
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,760
I'm just trying to slice off the saltiest part of the baba. 

577
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,400
I'm fighting for my place in the competition now. 

578
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,520
When everything goes right and everyone's getting along, 

579
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,320
it seems like it's not a competition. 

580
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,200
But as soon as something goes wrong, 

581
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,120
you realise that you could lose your place here. 

582
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,680
The syrup for the baba is made from sugar, water and rum. 

583
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,480
Quite a lot. 

584
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,960
It should be heated long enough to burn off the alcohol, whilst keeping 

585
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,440
the distinctive flavour that gives the baba its name. 

586
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,120
Most of the alcohol is going up into my face at the moment, 

587
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,200
so if I start to stop making sense, then stop me! 

588
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,480
This is just quite an easy way to soak a baba. 

589
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,080
I'll just chuck them back in the tins and they slowly soak up all this goo. 

590
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,120
Oh, dear! 

591
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,880
They're a mess. Oh, I'm embarrassed. 

592
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,680
I can't serve these. 

593
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,960
Natasha isn't the only baker concerned about presentation. 

594
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,720
I'm thinking that, if I can make a caramel cage to go over the top, 

595
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,920
it might look quite nice and I've got a bit of time. 

596
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,040
From a presentation perspective, it should look pretty good, 

597
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,280
but also it's going to give it some real nice crunch. 

598
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:56,000
43-year-old father of two, Peter, is a sales manager from Windsor. 

599
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,480
His cakes are in constant demand at meetings 

600
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,000
and at birthday parties 

601
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,840
for his son Harry's school friends. 

602
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,680
Now, that is what I call gilding the lily! 

603
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,880
We asked for rum babas, they're not difficult enough for you, are they? 

604
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,320
This is, what, you've had two minutes off? 

605
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,760
It hinges on the fact that I have not got a clue on what I'm doing 

606
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,040
in terms of making a rum baba. 

607
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,200
So it's smoke and mirrors? 

608
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,480
So I'm thinking, nice presentation may hide a multitude of sins. 

609
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:31,600
Bakers, five minutes to go. Time to primp and slightly panic. 

610
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,800
Each baba must be filled with a chantilly cream 

611
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,320
and topped with fresh fruit. 

612
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,160
I'm trying to...make them look presentable. 

613
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,840
Some kind of miracle. 

614
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:00,800
Barbapapas and Barbamamas, you have one minute left. 

615
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,360
I know this is not going to be good. 

616
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,200
I'm happy with that. 

617
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,680
It's a disappointment and even worse 

618
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,840
cos it's Mr Hollywood's recipe, so he's just going to annihilate me, 

619
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,640
you see, cos I've just destroyed it. 

620
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,400
Bakers, time is up, so if you'd all like to bring your babas over 

621
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,200
to the altar and place them behind the photograph of yourself. 

622
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,640
Technical challenges are judged blind, meaning that Mary and Paul 

623
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,800
will have no idea whose baba they are biting into. 

624
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,560
This particular recipe I've had for over 20 years 

625
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,720
and I'm very proud of it. 

626
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,440
OK, Mary, shall we try from this side? 

627
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,040
The colour's not bad, quite even. 

628
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,600
They look quite attractive. 

629
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,960
Taste isn't too bad. 

630
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,000
This one's had some serious issues. 

631
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,720
They've had problems with the dough. 

632
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,440
They probably haven't blended it together properly, worked it. 

633
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,760
I'll talk to this person later. 

634
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,240
This has been trimmed to fit. This has been over-proved. 

635
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,840
When you say over-proved, you can see there's a ridge here 

636
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,920
and that means that it's come above and it should be sort of level. 

637
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,240
Right, this one, someone's decided that my recipe wasn't quite 

638
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,240
good enough and decided to put a sugar cage on the top of it. 

639
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,480
It's well done, come on. 

640
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,520
No, you're covering up cos you're trying to hide something. 

641
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,800
Now, that really does taste of a rum baba. 

642
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,600
It's got a nice flavour there, the texture's good. 

643
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,280
Now, just don't. Isn't he unkind? 

644
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,000
Let's have a look at this one. 

645
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,760
This has had a good soaking. 

646
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,840
- That's what I like.
- It's got a bit of a ridge round the outside. 

647
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,160
That's over-proving again. 

648
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,520
It's over-proven again. 

649
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,600
This one's been over-proved again. 

650
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,920
Big fat bottom on that one as well. 

651
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,000
The structure's quite dense, but it's not bad, though. 

652
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,360
It tastes all right. 

653
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,720
This is an interesting one, cos it's all been cut, look. 

654
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,360
The tops have all been cut off. 

655
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,400
It's a bit dry here. 

656
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,360
The syrup has only got halfway down. 

657
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,840
- Oh, jeez.
- What is it, Paul? 

658
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,800
There's too much salt in there. 

659
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,560
- It is dead salty.
- Urgh. 

660
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,960
Oh! 

661
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,440
This one, there was a problem getting it out of the tin, 

662
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,240
- wasn't there?
- Mmm, that was stuck. 

663
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,760
The syrup has gone through. 

664
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,280
It's not bad. 

665
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,000
Oh, no. 

666
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,720
It's been over baked, this one. It's got such a dense crust on it. 

667
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,080
Let's move on to this thing. It's had a few issues, this one. 

668
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,880
I know he's not going to say nice things. 

669
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,240
They've stuck, they haven't risen, 

670
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,520
they haven't fermented it. They've had serious timing issues. 

671
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,560
This one isn't too bad. It's soaked, which is good. 

672
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,600
The cream's been kept in the middle. 

673
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,160
It's not over proved. Yeah, it's not too bad. 

674
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,800
But all of you, well done for trying it anyway. 

675
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,480
We're now going to mark you 12 to 1. 

676
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,280
That's that one, isn't it? 

677
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,560
This one? 

678
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,280
- That one's pretty bad. 
- That's pretty bad. 

679
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,280
This one here was very good. 

680
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,640
That one's quite nice. 

681
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:18,280
Right, the person in last place is... 

682
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,960
this one. 

683
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,840
This is me. 

684
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,440
Something drastic has gone wrong with the dough 

685
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,080
and it's been boiled to death. 

686
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,520
- And number 11 is here.
- That's me. 

687
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,880
Dusting the tins, I put salt in the tin instead of sugar. 

688
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,080
Tenth place is this one. What happened? 

689
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,720
I couldn't get it to pipe, 

690
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,400
so I put a cloth over it for the second prove and it stuck to it. 

691
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah. You'll know now for next time. 

692
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,600
Then we come to number nine and that was the one that was... 

693
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,560
Yeah. 

694
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,160
Ryan, Danny, Manisha, Cathryn and Victoria 

695
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,840
all produced decent enough babas to keep them out of the spotlight. 

696
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,880
And number three is right here. 

697
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,360
You got a really good ticking off for that, didn't you? 

698
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,160
But, you see, you came quite high up with your rum baba underneath. 

699
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,320
Number two is this one. 

700
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,240
And number one, in all its glory. 

701
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,880
SHE LAUGHS 

702
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,600
Oh, my God. 

703
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,520
But you've all done... 

704
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,520
not bad. Some better than others. 

705
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,280
But tomorrow's the big one. 

706
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,480
Do you know what? I know it's only four little cakes, 

707
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,000
but it's, like, monumental to me. It's amazing. 

708
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,920
I was just begging for the ground to open up 

709
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,400
and just swallow the babas down. 

710
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,200
The most important thing about this process is to learn things. 

711
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,160
That's what I'm going to say, anyway. 

712
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,840
I suppose I've wanted to play safe in this whole process 

713
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,200
and I thought, "Come on, take a bit of a risk." 

714
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,800
Look where it got me. 

715
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,320
In order to do well, tomorrow's got to go without a hitch. 

716
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,800
It's just got to be perfect. 

717
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,760
There's one cake challenge remaining, 

718
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,680
a last opportunity to claim the crown of this week's star baker. 

719
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,560
And a final chance to avoid having to leave the Bake Off. 

720
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,200
Victoria and Sarah-Jane really came out on top. 

721
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,040
These two have basically started to step away from the pack. 

722
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,680
This then causes a little bit of rift amongst all of them. They're all quite friendly at the beginning, 

723
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,080
- then this competition steps up. 
- He lives for this bit.
- He loves it. 

724
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,840
It's about the pressure and which one of them 

725
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,560
is going to really start pushing it. 

726
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,400
Who's not quite got the technical expertise? 

727
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,600
Ryan and Stuart are the two that I think are in a bit of trouble. 

728
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,440
Stuart's main problem was that tomato cake. 

729
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,640
He'd really tried to be original, but it just didn't work. 

730
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,200
And then, when you move to Ryan, that upside down cake, 

731
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
the textures were very, very wrong. 

732
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,400
I'd throw Natasha in there as being the lowest part 

733
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,000
- of the technical challenge. 
- She had totally the wrong method. 

734
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,640
The most spectacular fall from grace was John, 

735
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,320
who had that fabulous toffee apple upside-down cake 

736
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,560
and then put salt instead of sugar. 

737
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,880
You tasted first and your face. 

738
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,760
But the show stopper today is full of surprises 

739
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,080
and full of things that can go wrong. I can see trouble today. 

740
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,640
- You can see trouble ahead.
- I can. 

741
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,160
On that positive note, let's enjoy the show stopper. 

742
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,600
Morning, all. 

743
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,680
Now, today we're going to ask you to do a hidden design cake. 

744
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,360
So, when you slice into it, reveals a hidden design or pattern. 

745
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,680
Now, you've got five hours on the clock. So... 

746
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,000
- On your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake.
- Bake. 

747
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,920
To create a cake using different layers and shapes of coloured sponge 

748
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,120
that reveal a hidden design when it's cut 

749
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,920
requires meticulous planning. 

750
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,080
Divide by four. 

751
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,760
What is hidden inside must be something that, 

752
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,120
the very first time you see it, 

753
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,760
you think, "Oh gosh! Oh, isn't that special?" 

754
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,840
They won't know what it looks like until we cut into it, 

755
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,480
that's the tricky bit. 

756
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,600
They have to be well rehearsed. 

757
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,120
This has got to be perfection. 

758
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,320
Recipes are placed alongside blueprints 

759
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,680
and diagrams that the bakers have measured up at home. 

760
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,400
I'm not good at 3D. 

761
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,520
When I did mechanical and spatial awareness at school, 

762
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,640
I'm rubbish at it. 

763
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,800
It's a nice concept, but it's really a menacing task for us bakers, 

764
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,240
so whoever invented it, I'm cursing their name right now. 

765
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,840
Most of the bakers are using a basic Victoria sponge mix, 

766
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,120
then adding food colouring to create their hidden design. 

767
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,840
I'm trying to avoid using food colouring as much as I can, 

768
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,400
but this strawberry layer with the, kind of, natural red food colouring 

769
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,000
gives it a kind of orangey tint, which is quite nice 

770
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,120
but, if you use too much of it, you can get a beetroot flavour, 

771
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,920
which is what it's made from, partly. 

772
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,160
James is using all natural flavours and colourings 

773
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,080
to create a sunset ensconced inside his Simmer Dim Sunset Cake. 

774
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,280
So you've actually used proper flavours, 

775
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,560
- quite strong flavours in the Genoese?
- Yeah. 

776
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,600
- Impressive.
- Yeah, the only thing about it is it is very large. 

777
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,120
- It is extraordinarily large. 
- That's never an issue here. 

778
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,640
James, could you have a try at opening that for me? 

779
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,840
- Cos it's just...
- Yeah. 
- Would you mind? 

780
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,680
I'm going to start and colour the gradients of sponge now 

781
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,520
in different colours, so I'm starting with the light pink, 

782
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,360
then I'll put some more sponge batter back in, whisk it up 

783
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,880
and add more colouring, so I've got four different shades of colour. 

784
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,040
- No?
- No. 

785
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,360
Natasha's baking four different coloured sponges. 

786
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,000
She's going to soak them in rose syrup and hide them 

787
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,400
under butter icing, piped into the shape of roses. 

788
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,760
When I originally compiled the recipe, 

789
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,200
I wondered if it was too simple, 

790
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,920
but I think after my technical challenge yesterday, 

791
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,520
I'm glad to have something that's got less chance of failure 

792
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,960
and isn't too complicated. 

793
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,840
I played around with a few ideas and, 

794
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,560
cos it's the Jubilee year, go quite patriotic. 

795
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,160
It's the Queen's Jubilee, 

796
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,280
it's the Olympics in Great Britain, it's the Great British Bake Off. 

797
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,640
I'm going for a Union Jack cake. 

798
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,080
I'm doing a Union Jack hidden design cake. 

799
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,360
Peter and Stuart have to bake red, white and blue sponges, 

800
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,760
slice them into perfectly proportioned pieces 

801
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,960
that will reveal the Union Flag when the cake is cut. 

802
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,160
Peter's mix is simple, but Stuart's flavouring his with lemon 

803
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,280
and he's replacing some of the flour with almonds and pistachio nuts. 

804
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,320
It's all about the consistency of the sponge. 

805
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,280
At the end of the day, flavour's part of it. 

806
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,680
The construction is going to be difficult enough. 

807
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,960
Well, because of the nature of the cake, there's not much flour in it, 

808
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,480
so it's actually a bit tricky to kind of carve as well, 

809
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,480
- so that's going to be...
- I'm in agony already.
- ..the pressure point. 

810
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,920
Well, I'm looking forward to seeing how it turns out. 

811
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,120
Oh, good. Well, hopefully I'll give you something to behold. 

812
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,440
Timing is critical. The bakers will struggle to construct their designs 

813
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,440
without perfectly risen pieces of cake. 

814
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,680
Because the sponge is so thin, I'm only baking it for eight minutes. 

815
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,600
If you're half a minute out in the baking, 

816
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,000
it'll just crack and break up. 

817
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,560
Ryan's making an Italian meringue mousse set around pieces of sponge. 

818
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,880
When his cake is cut into, 

819
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,680
it should reveal multi-coloured and flavoured flowers. 

820
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,080
This one I can't use. This is a bit too bubbly. 

821
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,160
A little bit tense cos there's more pressure on today to get it right. 

822
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,040
They're done. 

823
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,000
It's sunk a little bit too much than I actually anticipated, 

824
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,640
so I'm going to struggle getting the bits off. 

825
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,640
I've taken the nursery rhyme Four And Twenty Blackbirds 

826
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,600
and so I'm making a pie and then when you cut into it there should, 

827
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:54,360
touch wood, be the blackbird's head and the beak and the maid's nose. 

828
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,440
You're making a pie with cake. 

829
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,880
Yes. 

830
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,680
Sing A Song Of Sixpence is the inspiration 

831
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,280
for Victoria's show stopper, 

832
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,720
where four different coloured sponges should reveal 

833
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,200
a blackbird holding a maid's nose. 

834
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,520
Here's the beak. 

835
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,840
And the nose. 

836
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,040
And the head. 

837
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,640
All looks a bit revolting, sort of like a Dr Who set, 

838
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,320
but in there lies a nursery rhyme. 

839
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,040
Whoa. 

840
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,600
I know it looks a bit messy, but it's all under control, 

841
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,400
even though it doesn't look like it. 

842
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,120
I'm going to have a image of a cupcake inside, 

843
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,560
which is going to be three different colours 

844
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,760
and three different berry flavours. 

845
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,600
Cathryn has to scoop out the centre of her sponge, 

846
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,040
colour it, flavour it and then replace it. 

847
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,000
I'm packing it in quite densely so that when it cuts, 

848
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,520
it doesn't all crumble away. 

849
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,040
Sarah-Jane is using little cakes to make a big cake 

850
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,440
with a crown in the middle. 

851
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,760
How you getting on? 

852
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,920
- The cake going up the side makes the edges.
- Yep. 

853
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,760
And then that makes the middle. 

854
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,280
I've only got one of these, so if I mess it up - a bit of a disaster. 

855
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,040
We've moved out of baking in a sense 

856
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,880
- and into kind of...
- Into joinery. 
- It's joinery, isn't it?
- Yeah. 

857
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,400
John's using a pastry cutter to cut a romantic design 

858
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,640
that should appear in every slice of his cake. 

859
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,880
I love this pink sponge. 

860
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:29,480
It's like the texture, and I mean this with all respect, of a muppet. 

861
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,520
- Let's hope it doesn't make a muppet out of me.
- No, it won't do. 

862
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,920
Mary, have you ever seen anything as precise as this in your life? 

863
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,240
It's a work of beauty. 

864
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,120
It's a work of precision. 

865
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,320
I'm having to, kind of, construct loosely a blue bit 

866
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,680
just from the remains, 

867
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,040
so it's a bit frustrating and a bit confusing at the moment. 

868
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,560
- Testing stuff, eh? 
- Yeah, making a mess as well. 

869
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,880
Bakers, you've got half an hour left for your insidey-outy cakes. 

870
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,760
Ah! You're kidding me! 

871
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,640
Right, OK, I'm on it, like a car bonnet. 

872
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,840
The saucepan's heavy and I just want some pressure on 

873
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,360
so that those layers will stick together. 

874
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,520
I need this to go right, so, yeah. 

875
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,920
Well, with classic British understatement, that's not too bad. 

876
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,240
Looking over at Peter's, 

877
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,840
just because it's a different type of cake. 

878
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,000
Mine's less, erm, sturdy is the correct word. 

879
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,000
Ryan's been waiting by the fridge for half an hour. 

880
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,640
He needs his mousse to be completely set 

881
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,400
before he can begin to decorate it. 

882
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,680
- Ryan.
- Yeah? 

883
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,400
How's yours coming along? 

884
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,640
Very long time, it's not cold enough. 

885
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,280
Oh, it's not cold enough? 

886
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,920
- What's that you've got? What's that? 
- It's a sort of spray.
- What for? 

887
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,800
- It's the colour, it's just a spray to make it red.
- Ooh. 

888
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,600
OK, everyone, there's ten minutes left. Just ten minutes now. 

889
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,480
Oh, my Lord. 

890
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,680
Getting a bit... I don't know if I'm going to finish. 

891
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,680
It's a bit patchy. 

892
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,120
Maybe the mousse is not cold enough. 

893
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,240
Ahh. 

894
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,600
If it was my last bake, I'd be pretty gutted. 

895
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,720
I don't think I've been able to show my full potential, really. 

896
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,920
I know how cliche that kind of sounds. 

897
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,560
The mousse is not set enough. 

898
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,320
That's one minute of hot piping action left. Just one minute. 

899
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,440
Oh, my goodness. 

900
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,280
This is the black bit. 

901
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,920
I want the outline before I run out of time. 

902
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,800
Five, four, three, two, one. Time is up. 

903
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,240
Please step away from your cakes. 

904
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,080
Time is up. 

905
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,360
From the outside, it's a bit messy because of the last minute rush. 

906
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,200
But inside, I think I made it very well. 

907
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,960
Hopefully, they'll like the taste and that'll get me through. 

908
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,160
I think Mary will probably like the roses, 

909
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,520
cos she's all pretty and delicate herself, 

910
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,120
but I just hope it's just as good inside as it looks on the outside. 

911
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,160
Maybe mine tells a story, but all I can see are the imperfections, 

912
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,600
so I think, basically they'll be saying it's a nice idea, 

913
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,240
but not executed well enough. 

914
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,560
To be brutally honest, 

915
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,120
all I was doing was focussing on what I had to do. 

916
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:09,040
I can't remember who was doing the Union Jack cake, 

917
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,120
but I think I did as well as I could with my design. 

918
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,720
Peter's just looked amazing compared to mine. 

919
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,440
Ah. # Memories. # 

920
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,280
The bakers have no idea how the cakes have turned out 

921
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,760
until the judges cut them open. 

922
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,480
What they reveal will decide their future in the Bake Off. 

923
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,920
It looks very smart. 

924
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,520
What is it going to reveal? 

925
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,480
Hopefully, a nice, pink heart in every single slice. 

926
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,440
I feel like you're cutting through my heart. 

927
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:54,480
Well, we've got two beautiful, pink hearts. 

928
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,560
It's moist. It's a nice cake. 

929
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,680
- Thank you so much. 
- I think it's a very clever concept. 

930
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,440
I don't think I can look when you do that. 

931
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,080
What? You worried? 

932
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,960
A very clever effect of that crown. 

933
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,520
The flavour, as it is, is not there, it's quite bland. 

934
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,000
You're a bit worried as that knife's going down. 

935
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,440
- Just massaging the temples in stress.
- Remind us what's inside. 

936
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,920
It should be an image of a cupcake. 

937
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,440
Yeah, it's a cupcake, excellent. 

938
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,280
And it looks a lovely and fruity cupcake, too. 

939
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,120
That flavour, the fruit really lifts it up. 

940
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,160
Cos if it wasn't there, it'd be quite bland. 

941
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,480
But overall, technically, that's a nice cake. 

942
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,720
- Thank you.
- Lovely. 

943
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:46,400
As a novelty cake which looks like a pie, 

944
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,960
- I think you've done extremely well. 
- Very clever. 

945
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,720
PAUL LAUGHS 

946
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,520
It tells a story. Anybody could guess what it is, couldn't you? 

947
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,640
Very impressed. 

948
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,880
I mean, the design inside the cake, that's got that little step further. 

949
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,240
Thank you very much, indeed. 

950
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,280
You've based it on the Union Jack, so if we cut it down the middle... 

951
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,000
- Goodness gracious. 
- That's impressive. 

952
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,560
Most impressive. It's very sweet, it's moist. 

953
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,680
You've got there. 

954
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,480
- Yeah, well done.
- Thank you. 
- Thank you, Peter. 

955
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,840
- Is that the Queen's head on top? 
- It was meant to be, 

956
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,960
- but I ran out of time, unfortunately.
- OK, OK. 

957
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,400
If you cut round about the neckline, 

958
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,440
- you'll probably get the best... 
- About there? 

959
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,400
- Off with her head.
- It's treasonous. It's pure treason. 

960
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,560
- Are you absolutely certain about this?
- Yes, yeah. 

961
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,200
It's gone a bit awry on the structure of it, technically. 

962
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,120
- The flavour's all right, actually. 
- Mmm, it's really good, the flavour. 

963
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:57,280
And we do take note of what things taste like as well as they look. 

964
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,800
You've had an issue with the mottling from the spray. 

965
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,440
- Yes. Whoa, whoa, it's this way, Paul, please.
- Right. 

966
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,880
- This way.
- I thought the raspberry line meant follow the raspberries. 

967
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,640
It was, but I put the rolls in the wrong way, it was a bit too late. 

968
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,560
OK. What are we expecting to see when we cut down the middle? 

969
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,680
Red and yellow flowers. 

970
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:24,640
- Ha-ha.
- It looks very, very pretty. 

971
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,280
They do look very good. It's very modern. 

972
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,680
- I think you've done really well, actually.
- Thank you. 

973
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:34,080
That is one monster of a cake, isn't it? 

974
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,480
It's very bold. 

975
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,560
I think I've got to be bold now, to be honest. 

976
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,240
Have you got a shovel or anything? I could just lift this up. 

977
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,520
Can you tell me what we're expecting to see inside? 

978
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,760
A sun. 

979
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,800
Well, we've got the sun in the bottom. 

980
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,200
- And this is Genoese?
- Yeah. 
- It is quite heavy. 

981
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,400
- No, I think what it is, is... 
- The weight of it crushing down. 

982
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,480
- There's so much weight, yeah.
- Yeah. 

983
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,040
Try and think a little bit smaller sometimes. 

984
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:02,040
It's the first cake we've ever had you can see from space as well. 

985
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,280
THEY LAUGH 

986
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,320
That looks so pretty. 

987
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,080
I haven't seen this double-tone filling a bag 

988
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,480
and it is so effective, isn't it? 

989
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,040
Ooh, it's heavy. 

990
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,880
You've got some under baked. 

991
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,480
It looks more like a paste than it does a sponge, 

992
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,920
because it's concertinaed up. 

993
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,120
It looks as though it has been over soaked as well. 

994
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,720
- Yeah, it might have been. 
- It looks absolutely solid. 

995
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,520
The texture is way, way out there. 

996
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,800
Technically, it's raw. 

997
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,600
Mary and Paul will look back over the weekend 

998
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,120
to decide who will be this week's star baker 

999
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,800
and who will leave. 

1000
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,000
Who do you think's really excelled? Who's in contention for star baker? 

1001
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,200
Cathryn has been pretty good. 

1002
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,080
Victoria, I thought, has done quite well. 

1003
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,760
- We have... 
- We have spoken about this 

1004
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,960
and one person has stepped away from the whole pack, substantially. 

1005
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,160
- You mean you agree?
- Yes. 

1006
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,200
- No!
- No! I'm amazed. 

1007
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,480
Well, that leaves us with people 

1008
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,080
who have performed badly and who are now facing 

1009
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,320
removal from the competition. 

1010
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,640
Both Natasha and Stuart have had issues. 

1011
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,800
Let's start with Natasha. 

1012
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,320
Having done an interesting finish on the top, 

1013
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:24,200
her cake is really solid and it's just gone into one mass. 

1014
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,040
Stuart's cake today, the decoration wasn't fantastic. 

1015
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,800
- Yeah.
- Peter's looks absolutely meticulous and perfect. 

1016
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,880
- Pristine.
- But Stuart's cake is not so pristine. 

1017
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,120
And when you look back at Stuart's upside-down cake 

1018
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,480
with the tomato, the tomato was sort of wasted. 

1019
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,200
It just created too much moisture, which made the cake very dense. 

1020
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,280
Stuart came ninth in the rum baba technical challenge. 

1021
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,640
But when you look at Natasha's, her baba was boiled to death 

1022
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,800
and, sort of, it had lack of colour, no flavour, 

1023
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,560
it needed a lot of sorting out. 

1024
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,360
It just comes down to you guys deciding what the cardinal error is. 

1025
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,920
Is it ketchup cake or is it boiled baba? 

1026
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,800
- And that's something that only you guys can really think about.
- Yep. 

1027
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,080
Bakers, huge congratulations. 

1028
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,160
It's been an immense weekend 

1029
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:22,240
and you've shown the judges stamina, style and skill. 

1030
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,960
And you've also given us the largest cake ever seen 

1031
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,240
by the naked human eye. 

1032
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:33,400
Now, we'd like to focus on the person that has really shone out. 

1033
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,480
Our star baker this week is... 

1034
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,560
Victoria. 

1035
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,440
- Woo-hoo! 
- Well done. Congratulations. 

1036
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,520
Now, as you also know, 

1037
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,720
for one of you the journey is going to stop here. 

1038
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,400
And the person that is going to leave us this week is... 

1039
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,960
Natasha. I'm so sorry, darling. Thank you. 

1040
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,320
- I'm so sorry, sweetheart. 
- I think that's fair. 

1041
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,800
I hate to say it, I hate to see you go. 

1042
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,360
I think it was the right decision. I suppose I just didn't do my best. 

1043
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,160
It's been a wonderful experience. 

1044
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,240
Baking's a huge part of me, has been for years. 

1045
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,160
You know, I'll just return to baking how I enjoy it, 

1046
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,040
baking for the family, baking as a therapy, baking to relax, 

1047
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,240
baking to share, and that's what it's all about. 

1048
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,040
You pulled it back from the brink, mate. 

1049
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,320
- Thank you.
- That's what the Bake Off's all about. 

1050
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,520
HE LAUGHS 

1051
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:45,280
My God. I think I've barely scraped through. 

1052
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,000
I've got to just step up my game. 

1053
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,680
Well done, guys, all of you. 

1054
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,160
I was pretty thrilled to be staying, 

1055
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,600
so just still taking it in, actually. 

1056
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,040
I could be out next week, so I can just enjoy this moment. 

1057
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,440
PHONE RINGS 

1058
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,560
Guess what? 

1059
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:05,560
- 'What?'
- I got through to the next round, to the next episode. 

1060
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,640
Don't swear. Don't swear, because we're... 

1061
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,520
SHE LAUGHS 

1062
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,320
Next time. 

1063
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,480
It's sticking. 

1064
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,040
- It's Paul's passion.
- Get in there. 

1065
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,160
Bread. 

1066
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,960
That's brave. 

1067
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,360
With signature flatbreads. 

1068
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,840
There's no turning back now. 

1069
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,040
A twisted technical challenge. 

1070
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,560
I'm going again, I'm going again. 

1071
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,720
- And 24...
- Got it. Oop! 

1072
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,920
..show stopping bagels. 

1073
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,040
I think I'm in trouble today. 

1074
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,440
But who will be crowned star baker? 

1075
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,080
Like the curate's egg, good in part. 

1076
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,160
And who... 

1077
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,320
He's going to hate it. 

1078
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,880
..will be the next to leave... 

1079
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,120
Ha-ha-ha. I don't know. 

1080
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,600
..The Great British Bake Off? 

1081
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:47,000
- Done!
- Looks good to me. See? Perfect, no bother. 

1082
