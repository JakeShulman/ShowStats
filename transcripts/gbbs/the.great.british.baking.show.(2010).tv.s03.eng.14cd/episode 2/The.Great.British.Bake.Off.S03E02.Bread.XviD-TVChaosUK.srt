1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,480
So far on Bake Off,
we've seen a tomato ketchup
upside-down cake, a boiled baba


2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,320
and a sponge so massive, only Hagrid
could've polished it off.


3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,640
And it's only week two.


4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,520
What else could possibly happen
in that tent? Welcome...


5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,480
BOTH: To The Great British Bake Off.


6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,240
Last week, they tackled cakes.


7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,240
Very impressed.
And Victoria was crowned star baker.


8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,160
But for Natasha, it was one disaster
after another. It's all gone wrong!


9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
This has literally been
boiled to death.


10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,440
So she was the first to leave
The Great British Bake Off.


11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,640
This, week the remaining 11
are under extra pressure


12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,800
as they face bread.


13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,400
There's no turning back now.


14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,960
Understand bread, understand baking.


15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,880
But who will "rise to the occasion"?


16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,600
Amazing. I'm happy.


17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes. Oh, hello. Get in there.


18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,080
And who will fall flat? It's
recovery from disaster at the moment.


19
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,360
It's different.
I don't know that I like it.


20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,320
# If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands. #


21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,640
It's the second week in the search
to find Britain's best amateur baker.


22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,920
The 11 remaining bakers
have a weekend of bread-making


23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,760
before Mary and Paul decide
who will be this week's star baker


24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,080
and who will leave.


25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,640
Bakers, welcome to
the Bake Off tent again


26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,320
and this week, we've got
two days of bread-making,


27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,840
which of course is
Mr Hollywood's passion.


28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,960
Today, it's the Signature Bake


29
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,080
and what we're looking for
are flatbreads.


30
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,040
Now, these can be tortilla, naan,
roti, anything you like,


31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,800
just 12 flavoured breads,


32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,200
six with yeast and six without.


33
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,000
You can bake them anywhere you want.


34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,440
On the oven floor,
on the wall, on the griddle,


35
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,080
the choice is absolutely up to you.


36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,680
You've got two-and-a-half hours
to complete your flatbreads, so...


37
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,080
On your marks. Get set.


38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,320
BOTH: Bake!


39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,720
Flatbreads have been popular
for centuries all over the world.


40
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,640
Almost all cultures
have devised a type of flatbread


41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,840
based on modest ingredients and
cooking methods readily available.


42
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,400
This one's the trickiest one
cos it contains yeast


43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,480
so it's all about making sure


44
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,360
that I get the rise right,
the proving right,


45
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,920
so yeah, that's... Tricky one first.


46
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,800
We're going to learn a lot
about our bakers from this challenge


47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,600
because they are mostly used
to general baking,


48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,440
you know, cakes, biscuits
and puddings,


49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,240
and not all of them
are good at bread.


50
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,680
Flatbread shouldn't have
an envelope inside it.


51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,640
Traditionally, it's quite a sponge
dough all the way through it


52
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,800
and not too thick.


53
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,000
The key ingredients for most
flatbreads are flour, water and salt


54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
which when mixed into a dough,
is then rolled or flattened


55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,160
to give them
their distinctive shape.


56
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,960
Bread is a very satisfying
thing to make.


57
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,320
There's this lovely
tactile feel about it


58
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,240
as you're kneading and proving it,


59
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,960
and then you get this wonderful
flavour at the end of it.


60
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,080
Flatbreads don't need to prove
as long as a regular loaf


61
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,600
as they don't rise as much,


62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,280
so the main challenge
is to produce a flatbread


63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,520
which is soft and easy to tear
and not snap like a cracker.


64
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,600
Morning, James.


65
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,080
All right. How's it going?


66
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,840
Good. I'm captivated by
your yeast slapping. Yes.


67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,200
Your method you're using,


68
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,440
what yeast have you in there
to start with? I've got fresh yeast.


69
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,640
Medical student James
likens baking to medicine,


70
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,880
saying both involve
care and chemistry.


71
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,880
James is a keen
and experienced bread-baker


72
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,160
and today he's using
his own wild yeast


73
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,240
to leaven the tomato, garlic and
parmesan flatbread he's serving


74
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,160
alongside his tattie scones.


75
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,160
If you're in the Shetlands
they know how to make a sourdough,


76
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,720
so you won't need to buy yeast in.


77
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,680
Yep, well, this is
my Shetlandic sourdough.


78
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,040
Can I have a smell? Go for it.


79
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,800
It's eight years old, that one.
Eight years old? No way!


80
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,920
Yeah, that's nice, that,
it's nice and active.


81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,120
How did you start it? Started
originally in Islay in a distillery,


82
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,840
so it's started with brewer's yeast.


83
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,640
So you've got
totally different things for us


84
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,360
and we're going to have
these lovely tattie scones.


85
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,920
I'm interested to see how
they'll be - something different.


86
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,360
I'm doing some coriander
and lemon naan bread


87
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,760
and then some garlic, parsnip
and black cardamom chapatis.


88
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,520
Charity head Victoria


89
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,640
enjoys experimenting with
different flavour combinations


90
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,400
and turns to her large collection
of recipes for inspiration.


91
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,200
I don't make bread, so I feel
like I'm sort of an imposter,


92
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,560
but I do like Indian food


93
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,120
and I've never cooked it,


94
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,120
so it's been adding
to my repertoire.


95
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,760
Morning. Morning. How are you?


96
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,160
Not so bad, not so bad.
So what are you doing for us?


97
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,520
This is my coriander
and chilli rotis.


98
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,600
What's in that?


99
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,680
A bit of butter
and some natural yoghurt.


100
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,760
22-year-old law graduate John dreams
of being a pastry chef in Paris.


101
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,320
He's baking coriander
and chilli rotis


102
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,200
and garlic and pomegranate pittas
topped with potato.


103
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,280
The beauty of the potato
with the pomegranate molasses


104
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,640
is that it absorbs
the sweetness and the tanginess


105
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,840
but also, it absorbs
the ras el hanout


106
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,080
and it becomes almost meaty...
I love ras el hanout. ..the potato,


107
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,760
so it's a great dish,
you know, for vegetarians. Yeah.


108
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,920
Whenever my veggie mates come over,
I always do this, you know,


109
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,320
as a meze, because
the potatoes just go so meaty.


110
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,240
You make a meze for your vegetarian
friends? I do. I love you.


111
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,400
Nice action, by the way. Thank you.


112
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,680
Very nice action. Cheers.


113
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,280
It's very, very easy
to overwork dough


114
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,320
if you use the dough hook
on the blender,


115
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,720
whereas it's a lot more difficult
to do that


116
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,560
when you're doing it by hand.


117
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,360
Sales manager Peter likes to
collect recipes from magazines


118
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,320
to bake with his son Harry.


119
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,000
Yummy.


120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,240
A bread novice, he's baking
fennel and nigella seed naan


121
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,560
and a bannock bread
with a little something extra.


122
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,800
You've got a photograph
of Mel and Sue, is that right?


123
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,680
There's a very fine line here
between love and literally stalking.


124
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,120
I need to ask you a question.
Was it you


125
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,560
with the infrared night-vision
goggles by the bins last night?


126
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
I think he's seeking favour.
That'll be me.


127
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,680
He knows I'm not a judge. I'm just
there loving everything you bake,


128
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,400
eating everything you bake.
This will help you hugely.


129
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,360
I was young once. Tell everyone.


130
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,320
Tell your friends. And good-looking.
Thanks very much indeed. Thank you.


131
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,680
Many flatbreads are characterised
by their flavours


132
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,680
and Stuart is taking inspiration
from one of his favourite snacks.


133
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,400
One is going to be like Bombay bread


134
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,080
so if you've ever had Bombay Mix,
it's kind of the same flavour


135
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,040
and then the other one is chorizo
and spring onion naan bread.


136
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,480
Flavours that seem to work


137
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,640
and hopefully, Paul and Mary
will agree with that as well.


138
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,720
I'm doing a spiced mango naan bread


139
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,760
and a chill, lime and coriander


140
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,120
kind of soft flour tortilla
type flatbread.


141
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,320
Just making sure that I don't miss
any steps out of the recipe,


142
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,640
and keep an eye on the time.


143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,720
So, Sarah-Jane. Yes.


144
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,160
What have you chosen for us?


145
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,840
These are the toasted
coconut and lime rotis


146
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,320
and I've got the oat cakes
in the drawer at the moment.


147
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,280
They're bubbling up, getting ready
to pour into the frying pan.


148
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,880
Ah, you're doing it
like a batter pancake?


149
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,080
Yes, like a pancake.
Have you beer in there?


150
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,840
I have, just a really nice
sort of pale real ale.


151
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
I'm looking forward to that one


152
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,600
cos obviously there will be
a pint of beer for me.


153
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,200
I have actually got one underneath.


154
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,000
Fantastic! You'll go a long way!


155
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,040
This is my mum's recipe
that I'm using


156
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,240
and I've not changed anything


157
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,240
so hopefully it should still work,
fingers crossed.


158
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,320
27-year-old nursery nurse Manisha
lives in Leicester,


159
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,760
but spent five formative years
in India


160
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,000
So she's making her family's
favourite Indian flatbread


161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,400
with cumin and garlic,


162
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,640
as well as Italian flatbread
with sundried tomato and cheese.


163
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,000
What cheese have you got?


164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,800
Mature cheddar. Oh! Mature cheddar.


165
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,920
So not a mozzarella?
You've gone for a...


166
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,440
No, no. Or a dolcelatte?


167
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,880
Mature cheddar. OK. Always good.


168
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,600
And what about
your non-yeasted flatbread?


169
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,240
The non-yeast one
is an Indian dough...


170
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,520
You just going to keep it
on the griddle to bake it?


171
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,640
Yeah, cos I normally do cook it
on a tava at home. Lovely. Lovely.


172
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,600
So hopefully this should be OK.


173
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,320
Can't wait. Looking forward to it.
OK, thank you.


174
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,920
After proving
and shaping the flatbread,


175
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,720
the bakers now have the challenge
of baking them.


176
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,440
Flatbreads can be baked
in various ways,


177
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,000
but the key is to bake them quickly
and at a very high temperature.


178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,600
The intense heat
encourages the dough to expand,


179
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,440
turning moisture inside the dough to
steam, which helps the bread rise.


180
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,880
For the past two years,


181
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,320
I've been pursuing a project
of making breads of the world.


182
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,520
So far, I've achieved
about 90 of them.


183
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,080
Couple of hundred more to go.


184
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,280
63-year-old Brendan
is a keen gardener,


185
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,200
often helped by
his labradoodle Monty.


186
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,920
He has a huge bread repertoire,


187
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,120
and today is baking Middle Eastern
taboon bread and Indian roti


188
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,040
in a rather unconventional manner.


189
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,080
Brendan. They're calling you
"Hot Rocks" Brendan.


190
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,280
HE LAUGHS


191
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,480
Show me your hot rocks.


192
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,560
I'm trying to... Look at that!
What I'm trying to reproduce here,


193
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,320
I suppose it's a bit like
the equivalent of our stone bake.


194
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,960
Stone bake pizza? Yeah, exactly.


195
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,800
There's just an extra quality, isn't
there? An extra taste... Yeah, yeah.


196
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,400
It looks so nice. Thank you.


197
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,880
It's aesthetically
very pleasing, Brendan. Thank you.


198
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,280
Did you dig those up
from your garden, the rocks?


199
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,480
No, I went off to a certain DIY shop


200
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,120
and they're river-washed,


201
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,240
and I brought them home and washed
them and... River-washed hot rocks.


202
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,160
That's it! Only the best,
only the best for Brendan.


203
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,240
Bakers, you've got one hour to go.


204
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,000
Crikey. 60 minutes left
on your flatbreads.


205
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,720
Need to hurry up.


206
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,720
I've got six oat cakes to do and
they take about ten minutes each.


207
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,280
My maths is not great
but I think that's about right.


208
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,280
The griddle, or oven,
must be at optimum temperature.


209
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,920
Too high and the heat can burn
the outside of the bread


210
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,680
whilst the inside remains untouched.


211
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,000
Too low,
and the bread can be over-baked.


212
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,560
That's how it's meant to look,
sort of, isn't it?


213
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,280
A few sort of spots and things.


214
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,520
Perhaps that's a bit overdone.


215
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,200
The inspiration for the flatbreads
was thinking about


216
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,840
the sort of flavours I would like,
so I like Middle Eastern flavours


217
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,240
cos I've travelled a lot,


218
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,920
and the flour I'm using
is a kind called kamut flour


219
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,400
which, again, is
a Middle Eastern type flour.


220
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Intensive care consultant Danny
likes to keep herself fit


221
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,080
and regularly plays racketball
with her partner Richard.


222
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,520
She's hoping to hit the mark with
lime, coriander and coconut tortilla


223
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,120
and zaatar naan with dukkah.


224
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,760
If they puff up like they are doing
here, then they're cooked.


225
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,840
The puffing up is key, really,
you want to see them puff up.


226
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,480
With such a large batch
of flatbreads,


227
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,080
managing their time is crucial.
I'm trying to juggle lots of things.


228
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,000
I've got the griddle on the go


229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,520
and the pizza stone, and I'm trying
to remember which I put in first


230
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,800
and which needs to come out
or be turned over.


231
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,320
Keen runner Cathryn is affectionately
known at home as Last-Minute Larry


232
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,240
so she's meticulously planned
her time today.


233
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,200
She's making spiced mango naan and
lime, coriander and chilli tortillas.


234
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,120
Hello. She's on the griddle.


235
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,280
Cathryn's on the griddle. I am.


236
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,400
I think... I'm quite scared.
That's very damp.


237
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,640
That's quite unpleasant. I won't lean
on that. There's bread under there.


238
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,960
There's not bread... Oh, there is!
I'm so sorry, Cathryn. No, it's fine.


239
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,200
I was going... I'm so sorry. They
need to be flat, they're flatbreads.


240
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,880
You're just helping the process!
I'm really sorry.


241
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,640
No, that's fine, that's lovely.


242
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,440
30 minutes remaining, bakers.


243
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
Make sure it's done in 30 minutes


244
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,760
because Paul won't feel
any "pitta" for you.


245
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,880
Ohh!


246
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,520
LAUGHTER


247
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,200
Ohhh, come on.


248
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,920
I'm going to tell
your "naan" about you.


249
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,480
The grid I'm using now is meant to
recreate the clay pot of a tandoor,


250
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,800
and the blow torch,
I'm recreating the flames.


251
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,200
38-year-old photographer Ryan


252
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,640
takes his young family travelling
every year,


253
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,880
keen for them to experience
new cultures, sights and foods.


254
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,600
Oh! Molly!


255
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,400
He's making Shanghai paratha
and garlic and coriander naan.


256
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,720
Ooh, look at this!


257
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,960
So here I just give it
a charred effect.


258
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,880
Oh, dear! I charred it again.


259
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,920
At the moment it's a bit risky
because if it's too low,


260
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,040
I'll be cooking it longer,
then they go dry. Yeah.


261
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,120
And if it's too hot,
you can see what happens.


262
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,560
Oh! I'm reasonably happy.


263
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,160
Who'd have thought?


264
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,360
Usually I work with
three frying pans at a time at home,


265
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,520
whereas here I've only just got
one and I've got six to do,


266
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,760
so I've used one here,
two things at once.


267
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,120
Oh, hell's teeth.


268
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,600
All my tatties have come off.


269
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,880
The potatoes came off the pittas


270
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,120
and now they've got
bits of flour on them, but...


271
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,600
It'll be fine!


272
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,840
OK, time to slap those baps down!
Ten minutes.


273
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,120
Who is that?


274
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,040
Are you all done, Manisha?


275
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,080
Yep, just got to take these off.


276
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,600
It's sticking!


277
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,280
# If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands. #


278
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,200
They're not coming out great.


279
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,600
Come on. Done!


280
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,040
Looks good to me.
See, perfect, no bother.


281
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,640
The final countdown,
it's one minute to go, please.


282
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,640
OK, bakers, that's time. Step away.


283
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,920
Step away now from the flatbreads.


284
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Step away from the flatbreads.


285
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,960
Let's have a look at the texture.


286
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,120
Looks a nice texture.


287
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,800
I like the crunchy cheese
on the side.


288
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,120
I think I'd like
more seasoning in that. Mmm.


289
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,480
I really like the look
of these tattie scones.


290
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,200
It's a strange consistency,
isn't it? It needed longer. Mmm.


291
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,680
It's sort of a giveaway


292
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,600
when you feel it that
it is very dough-like.


293
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,720
But what a lovely flavour.
The flavour's lovely.


294
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,840
Absolutely lovely
and totally different.


295
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,960
The flavour's OK,
but it is quite bland. OK.


296
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,280
OK, your chapatis! Actually,
overall, the colour's not bad,


297
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,960
you expect this sort of colour.


298
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,080
Under-seasoned. OK.


299
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,080
Very salty.


300
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,280
Mmm. They are salty.
Taste that.


301
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,960
It should be half that.


302
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,360
I mean, really, really salty,
that is. Mmm.


303
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,960
They're tasty.
The flavours are good,


304
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,200
but I don't think you need
the salt on top. No.


305
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,440
These are my chilli
and coriander tortillas or rotis.


306
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,320
Pretty hot, pretty fiery, isn't it?


307
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,080
But I like them. Very good.
Thank you.


308
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,080
Good combination of flavours on
both of them. Thank you very much.


309
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,360
Well done. Thanks, guys.


310
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,080
They look inviting
with this nice colour.


311
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,440
I'm loving that. SUE: It's
delicious. It's got a great structure


312
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,120
and I love that garlic.
Comes through perfectly.


313
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,440
Good, good, thank you.
That's really tasty.


314
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,880
It's nice and thin.


315
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,840
They're fantastic, really good.
Very, very nice


316
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,680
and the flavour of that lime,
I adore.


317
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,480
It's a bit over-baked,
but it's a lovely texture inside.


318
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,160
OK. Thank you very much for that.


319
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,640
You have to really
find the chorizo in it,


320
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,360
because it's a shame
it's not coming through.


321
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,680
Every bite should contain
what you said has gone in there.


322
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,960
But the bake's good, you've got
a nice bake. They're nice and moist.


323
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,040
Thank you.


324
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,040
I think you've done it.


325
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,920
Really nice. Thank you.
I mean, really good.


326
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,680
I like this texture.


327
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,760
It makes it very moist. The colour
lets it down a little bit.


328
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,240
You should've blowtorched it
a bit more. Don't be afraid.


329
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,800
That blowtorch won't bake it.
Right. It'll colour it,


330
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,120
but it can't bake it. OK.


331
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,280
I like the structure,
I like the flavour.


332
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,320
It's unique, it's consistent.


333
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,120
Great flavour. Oh, good. Delicious.
Absolutely, it's balanced well,


334
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,960
the colour's good,
the texture's good.


335
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,920
It's full of flavour, it's lovely.
Yeah, you've got... Delicious.


336
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,320
..two great textures and some
unique flavours. Good, thank you.


337
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,840
Well done.
Thanks, Paul. Thank you, Mary.


338
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,320
Spicy mango.


339
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,840
Mmm, yes. Oh, hello. Get in there.


340
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,760
Oh, my goodness. That's great,
isn't it? Mmm. That's really nice.


341
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,400
Thank you. Really good. And pretty
unusual. Mmm. Thank you. Like that.


342
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,280
Your use of flavours are very good,
you've thought this through. And it
just works. Yeah, it does.


343
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,400
It could've been the other way
round, so that's good, isn't it?
Thank you.


344
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,480
Yeah, absolutely, well done.
Thanks. Good.


345
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,000
These are the oatcakes,


346
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,720
and these are the ones that have
beer in there.


347
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,560
I really enjoy it cos it's unique,
it's very different. Do you like it?
It's very adult.


348
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,040
They're very strong of beer
aren't they?


349
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,480
Is that going down in one?


350
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,040
Well done,
cos no one's thought of that,


351
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,760
and that for me
makes it a unique point.


352
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,400
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.


353
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,920
They really liked them.
I was really surprised.


354
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,240
I can't really complain.
I mean, get a positive from Paul
is like, amazing.


355
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,160
I don't think I've done
very well at all.


356
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,800
The question is have I done enough
to avoid being the worst?


357
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,000
I don't know that I have.


358
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,040
Was simply complimentary.
I just stood there and blushed.


359
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,600
It's good to know that I still can!


360
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,400
With the individual style
of the Signature Bake behind them,


361
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,040
the second challenge
is specifically designed


362
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,800
so their bread-making ability
can be directly compared.


363
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,160
So, bakers as you know,


364
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,360
next up is the technical challenge
and this one is judged blind.


365
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,200
So Paul and Mary, I'm going to ask
you now to leave the tent.


366
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,720
OK, now you all know that this
is the challenge where you all


367
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,240
bake from the same surprise recipe.


368
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,240
And this week no surprises,


369
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,920
Paul has chosen a particularly
complicated one.


370
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,960
We're asking you today to prepare


371
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,680
and bake an eight strand
plaited loaf.


372
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,440
Yep, we are calling this
the Rapunzel challenge.


373
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,280
OK, the deal with this is we want
each plait to be the even width


374
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,600
and length with a nice golden crust
and a soft crumb.


375
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,280
You've got two hours for this bake,
OK, so...


376
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,000
On your marks... Get set...


377
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,960
BOTH: Bake!


378
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,920
All the bakers have the same
ingredients and same basic recipe.


379
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
But the results
could vary dramatically.


380
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,040
What I'm looking for is
a nice equal plait running


381
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,240
right the way down the length
of the bread.


382
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,520
And what about the texture?


383
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,960
It's crispy. Lovely crisp.


384
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,760
This is a great thing to
make for a sort of festive occasion.


385
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,480
It's a skill which is dying off.


386
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,200
A good baker should be able
to do at least one plait.


387
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,000
Yes we've thrown them
in at the deep end,


388
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,040
but we are trying to find the best
amateur baker in this country.


389
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,680
To start, the bakers make a simple
bread mix of flour, water,


390
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,920
yeast and salt.


391
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,280
John, James and Brendan
are all keen breadmakers.


392
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,360
For others, bread presents
more of a challenge.


393
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,720
I heard a plait and then heard eight


394
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,840
and I didn't even know
there was such a thing.


395
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,760
The added element of plaiting,
and the strong bread flour


396
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,880
used in this bake makes it tougher
for the dough to rise,


397
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,640
and requires a longer kneading
period to make it soft and flexible.


398
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,760
Well, it's nice to take the sort
of disappointment of the morning


399
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,640
and just get into a physical
rhythm by kneading the dough.


400
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,080
Ah, as I was kneading that it
accidentally stuck a little bit


401
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,680
too much to my wrist and it fell on
the floor, so had to start again.


402
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,720
I'll prove it for one hour,
shape it...


403
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,080
Well, I say shape it,
I'll be, like, knitting it.


404
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,680
TIMER BEEPS


405
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,400
Ever made an eight strand plait
before? Never in my life.


406
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,040
I am a constant source
of disappointment to my daughter


407
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,760
that I cannot plait her hair.


408
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,040
Not even a three plait?
Not even a three plait.


409
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,240
Mum to Poppy and Jacob,


410
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,720
28 year old Sarah-Jane
is very comfortable baking cakes,


411
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,480
biscuits and desserts,


412
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,400
but is a novice
when it comes to bread.


413
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,320
We've give you a slight
pattern here...


414
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,920
Yeah, but what does this mean?
AO52U3O8?


415
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,960
You've run ahead with yourself.


416
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,240
Look, for the following sequence O
equals over and U equals under...


417
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,840
Oh, OK. So place the eighth under
the seventh,


418
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,760
and then over the first.


419
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,960
What, the seventh...


420
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,400
I can tell you no more than that.
And the eighth?


421
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,440
What does it mean?
I don't understand.


422
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,440
I'm just going to end up
with a lump.


423
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,840
While their dough is proving,


424
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,520
so called because the reaction
of the dough rising proves


425
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,840
the yeast is working, the bakers
practise the plaiting technique.


426
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,400
And six, seven over one.


427
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,480
This is complicated.


428
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,000
How come you've got extra dough
with which to practise


429
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,480
this fiendish plait?
Because I accidentally dropped it
on the floor. However...


430
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,320
Was that accidentally on the floor?
"Oh, I've dropped it,


431
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,120
"I'll have to use
to experiment with!"


432
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,800
It's kind of gone to my favour
really, so... It has, yeah.


433
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,680
When he's not teaching PE,


434
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,040
26-year-old Stuart hits the recipe
books to come up


435
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,320
with new flavour combinations


436
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,120
to test out on his fellow teachers
in the staff room.


437
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
Ever plaited anything before?


438
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,000
Big plaiter? I've done
a three plaited loaf before...


439
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,400
Yeah?
..but never an eight.


440
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,080
Eight's quite an ask isn't it?
It is.


441
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,320
This to me...


442
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,200
..looks like a knitting pattern.


443
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,520
I can't knit either. Nor can I. No.


444
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,640
Stu might be a knitter, look,
he's done quite a neat job.


445
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,600
I think Stu might be a knitter,
I think you're absolutely right.
Secret knitter Stu.


446
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,280
Hobbies include PE and knitting.


447
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,080
When happy that the dough is proved,
the bakers focus on the most
technical -


448
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,600
and, for most, unfamiliar -
part of the recipe.


449
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,000
To achieve an even plait,


450
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,960
each strand should be exactly
the same length


451
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,560
and width before attempting the
complicated plaiting instructions.


452
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,960
It's 106 grams per portion.


453
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,080
OK, that's pretty precise, yep.
So this is per strand is it?


454
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,480
Per strand.
Right, to make the octopus.


455
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,520
Per strand,
and it needs to be that long.


456
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,160
I haven't done any of the kind
of fancy weighing out,


457
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,240
but I figure if they're all roughly
the same thickness,


458
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,320
but I might've completely
stuffed it up.


459
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,640
I'm feeling like this could go
horribly, horribly wrong.


460
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,320
Eight under seven over one.


461
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,880
Eight over five,


462
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,000
two...under three.


463
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,720
Eight under seven...


464
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,520
..and then seven...over one.


465
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,120
Don't know.


466
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,800
Seven goes over one
which is over here, no,


467
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,360
is that right?


468
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,200
How can I mess that up?


469
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,160
Six over one.


470
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,800
What I love about this particular
challenge is after a while


471
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,720
everyone sounds like Rain Man.


472
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,680
OK!


473
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,840
Eight over five, five over two.


474
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Two under three.
Over eight. That's it.


475
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,800
One, two, three, four, five.


476
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,880
SHE LAUGHS


477
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,600
Oh, dear. This is like the
Generation Game gone bad. Oh, no.


478
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,920
Look at everybody. I'm going again.
Look at the state of my tentacles.


479
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,720
Poor tentacles!


480
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,200
It's a long time
since I've seen tentacles like that.


481
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,680
Two under three. Over eight.


482
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,120
Two under three.


483
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,680
I don't know if it's right or not.
I kind of free-styled
a bit towards the end.


484
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,120
Really disappointed,
it's a disaster.


485
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,560
Oh, look at James's.
It's really long.


486
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,640
The final part does look
reasonably plait-esque.


487
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,520
Not as pretty as John's,
but it'll do the job.


488
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,760
I'm a bit worried. This is where
I scrunched it together
to start it off.


489
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,320
If I give it a quick
Paul Hollywood nip and tuck,


490
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,520
it should be all right.


491
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,640
'Once complete, the plait should be
proved again for at least 30 minutes
and for some, time is tight.'


492
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,200
Two under three.
I'm running out of time.


493
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,720
I just did a bit of guesswork, more
than following the instructions.


494
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:51,680
'Before going into the oven, the egg
the bread should be egg washed
to give the crust colour and shine.'


495
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,960
There's no turning back now.


496
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,040
As long as one of the plaits
don't un-ping and the
whole thing will unravel.


497
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,080
Oh, go in!


498
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,240
Just hoping that taste, texture,


499
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,880
will overcome
the shortcomings in presentation.


500
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,280
Ladies and gentlemen
of the baking community,


501
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,520
you have got ten minutes left
on your plaited technical challenge.


502
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,920
Technically,
this is absolutely rubbish.


503
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,720
There is nothing good about
this loaf. He's going to hate it.


504
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,280
'The recipe requires the loaf
to be baked until ready,


505
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,600
'which could be anything
between 20 and 30 minutes.'


506
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,200
It should be done, but I just do not
know. Getting the oven glove ready!


507
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,760
Right.


508
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,320
Oh, hello!


509
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,120
Bring her over. Done.


510
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,200
Oh! Lovely. Good sound. Yes.


511
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,720
Very good, Brendan.


512
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,120
I'm not convinced it's the best
looking plait in the world.


513
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,600
Get off, get off! Argh!
It's got stuck.


514
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,960
Got a bit of a hole in it there,
but it's all right.


515
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,200
Oh, my giddy aunt!


516
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,080
Let's present it.


517
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,200
Honestly, it's really not bad.
What's wrong with that?


518
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,240
Sounds hollow.


519
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,720
Oh, dear!


520
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,880
Worked! Yay!


521
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,200
Come on, you beauty!


522
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,080
OK, bakers, the bread braiding
tournament is now over.


523
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,360
If you'd like to bring up your
loaves


524
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,800
and place them behind the picture
of yourself on the altar. Thank you.


525
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,440
'Mary and Paul are looking
for a rich colour on top,


526
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,760
'an even plait and a crumb structure
that springs back into shape.'


527
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,200
There's a spread of varying
grades of plaiting.


528
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
We'll start with this one.


529
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,480
It's not too bad, this one. But you
can see it's ruined at the bottom.


530
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,320
It's good flavour. Tastes OK.


531
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,600
This one seems to have got rather
a large bit at the end.


532
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,800
It's got a nice crust.
Now this one...


533
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,440
It's dancing about a bit,
isn't it? Yes.


534
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,000
The plait's lost its way
pretty much from the start.


535
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,960
There's been a little mouse
underneath here, a little hole.


536
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,840
A little rat's boring in there.
This one is not too bad.


537
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,400
See how straight it is
down the middle? Not bad at all.


538
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,680
Nice crust on it.
I'm quite impressed with that one.


539
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,520
It's not bad at all.


540
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,480
And, again, good flavour.


541
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,840
This one's gone awry again.
It needed longer baking.


542
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,000
Tastes OK, but no crust
and that's down to the bake.


543
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,680
What do you reckon on that one,
Mary? I think it's unusual. But
they got it right down the middle.


544
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,560
Yeah, they started off poorly.
The middle was pretty good and
then tailed off badly at the end.


545
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,320
A lot of flour's been used on this.
See the line.


546
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,600
Yes, it's quite divided there.
Now... Nice glaze on it.


547
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,920
Go on, say something nice.


548
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,080
It's got a nice glaze on it, but
it's like raw dough in the middle.


549
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,280
That is dough. The plait is...


550
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:02,080
To say it was a disaster would
be a humiliation to disaster.


551
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,760
It just looks a little bit informal,
not quite what we're asking for.


552
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,840
Let's have a look inside.
It's barely baked.


553
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,200
I know that if you squeeze it like
that, it's sticking in a ball.


554
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,960
It's going back to dough. Yeah.


555
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,560
Um...


556
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,600
Not bad.
It's quite uniform, the shape.


557
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,600
It's pretty good in the middle.


558
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:31,720
Tastes OK. This one looks as though
it hasn't been kneaded long enough,
or it's been rushed.


559
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,000
It's breaking up far too easily.


560
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,400
Yeah, it's had a few problems,
this one. Very dense inside.


561
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:47,440
Bordering on raw. It's underdone,
isn't it? It actually tastes OK.
It's lovely.


562
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,000
Now...


563
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,320
Oh, dear. What happened there?
It stuck to the tray, basically.


564
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,680
It's probably going
to be quite raw inside.


565
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,240
Yeah.


566
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,880
Which moves me onto this one,
which is near perfect. Nice colour.


567
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,720
There's a bit of folding underneath.
It's got a nice crust to it.


568
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,160
The plait should look like wood.
Lovely crust on it, good flavour.


569
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,600
It's the best looking.
Very good-looking bread.


570
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,560
'Paul and Mary will now reveal
how the bakers have fared.'


571
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,440
In last place is this person here.


572
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,640
That's me.


573
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,120
Obviously, you know the problems
that you had. OK.


574
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,880
In tenth place is this one.


575
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,280
That's me. What happened to
the bottom? It got stuck?


576
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,440
It got stuck on the baking tray.
OK, just be careful
with your plaits as well.


577
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,800
In ninth place is Stuart,
followed by Cathryn in eighth,
Victoria is seventh


578
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,600
and for the second week in a row,
Manisha is sixth.


579
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
In fifth place is Ryan.


580
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,360
A little bit under-baked.
Yeah, the dough needed
a little bit more working.


581
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,080
And in fourth is Brendan
and in third place is Danny.


582
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,520
In second place is this one.
It's pretty good. Well done.


583
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,840
So, we all know who is number one.


584
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,600
APPLAUSE


585
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,080
That went phenomenally well,
amazingly well. Yeah.


586
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,840
It didn't look perfect,
but it was a plait.


587
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,600
You would look at it and say,
"That's a plaited loaf."


588
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,480
Paul just said it was
pretty disastrous and it was.


589
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm going in tomorrow
with the attitude that I'm going
to be relaxed about it


590
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,720
and I hope that dough
feels the love!


591
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,280
'With just one challenge to go,
before Mary and Paul's decision,
how are the bakers faring?'


592
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,840
Who's doing well, Mary?
Brendan is doing rather well.
His flatbreads were good.


593
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:07,320
And also Ryan. He did very well.
He did.


594
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,120
And also, we should perhaps
point out John,


595
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,400
who came first in the plait.


596
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,960
He really got the plait right.


597
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,760
Looking at the other end
of the group, who do we think
is in danger this week?


598
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,640
Peter. His plait was under proved
and inside, a bit doughy.


599
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,440
I'd throw Victoria in there.
Ironically, star baker
from last week.


600
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,800
I think the winner of Bake Off will
be somebody who is consistent.


601
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,080
They've got a bagel challenge now.
I've think that will separate
the wheat from the chaff,


602
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:41,680
if you'll excuse the pun.
And by your face, you won't.
And I accept that.


603
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,520
Bakers, welcome back for
the final challenge of this weekend,
the Showstopper Challenge.


604
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,800
We're asking you to attempt
a technique that has never
been done on this show before,


605
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,480
icing a cupcake
whilst bungee jumping.


606
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,040
I jest. Of course,
it's bread week.


607
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:02,840
We're asking you to use poaching
techniques, as well as baking.


608
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:08,600
We're asking you today
to bake and present 24 bagels,


609
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,040
12 savoury and 12 sweet.


610
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,440
And you can work your own special
flavours into the dough


611
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,520
or you can bake them on the top,
or you can do both.


612
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,680
Just remains to say...
On your marks... Get set...


613
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,840
BOTH: Bake.


614
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,720
'Bagels are a type of bread,
but their unique chewy texture


615
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,320
'presents the bakers
with a new challenge.


616
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,520
'The bagels are poached
before they go into the oven.'


617
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,120
'The texture of a bagel
should be chewy,'


618
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,360
soft, good skin on the outside,
a beautiful golden brown.


619
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,320
More importantly,
have a hole in the middle.


620
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,480
All the bakers start off
in the same way,


621
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,480
by preparing a basic dough,
containing a strong wheat flour.


622
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,920
It's always good to get going.


623
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,240
Glad to be in the final straight,
as it were. All to play for still.


624
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,400
Both of these recipes
in their current manifestations,


625
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,240
these are the first times
I am making both of them.


626
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,040
Paul and Mary are going to be the
guinea pigs for these recipes, yeah.


627
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,520
That's a bit scary actually.
Probably should have practised.


628
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,480
James's sweet offering is flavoured
with orange, mint and chocolate.


629
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,120
And for his savoury Millers' bagels,
he's attempting a tricky
and time-consuming sourdough.


630
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:28,400
A sourdough bagel with no yeast in
it at all. No yeast in it at all.
That's brave.


631
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,160
In four hours, yeah! It is, very.


632
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,600
Some of my sours will take up to
eight or nine hours throughout,
some of the bigger ones.


633
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,960
To do it in four,
and sweet ones as well...


634
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,840
You're the first one on Bake Off
to actually use sours in this way.
So well done.


635
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,960
'By adding different flavours
to their bagels,


636
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,080
'the bakers must adjust
their recipes to prevent
any reactions that may occur


637
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,680
'whilst they prove, boil and bake.'


638
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,280
I had a sticky situation whereby
I soaked the dates overnight,


639
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,440
made sure it's moist, but then
over-soaked too much liquid.


640
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,840
As soon as I put the dates into
the dough, it went too wet.
It's really sticky dough.


641
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,560
Ryan's sweet bagels are made
with cinnamon and dates.


642
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,240
And his savoury bagels
with tarragon and rosemary.


643
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,120
Can I have a look at it?
Do you mind? Of course.


644
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,680
It's quite soft. Is that the date
one? Yes, I was a bit worried.


645
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:31,600
It stuck and it would affect
the texture of the dough. It can.


646
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,560
It might be denser.
I'm worried, but it's done now.


647
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,200
- Good luck with it all.
- Thank you.


648
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,320
< See you in a bit.


649
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,040
'After the dough has proved,
the bagels are ready to take shape.


650
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,240
'There are various methods
to achieve this and Brendan is
adding an unconventional twist.'


651
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,560
You simply pinch the ends


652
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,640
and then you gently rock backwards
and forwards.


653
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,200
For my savoury bagels,
I'm going to shape them


654
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,760
in the modern way of piercing
the thumb and that way.


655
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,000
I thought one traditional,
one modern.


656
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,920
To complement his chocolate
and vanilla sweet bagels,


657
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,480
Brendan's savoury bagels are
flavoured with cumin and Gruyere.


658
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,840
What inspired this?


659
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,480
You could have done just a classic
one flavour plain bagel, but no.


660
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,880
I thought I might as well learn
how to make a bagel twist
at the same time.


661
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,800
That sounds like the beginning of
joke, how do you make a bagel twist?


662
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,120
I'll come back to you
with a punchline!


663
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,800
The best way of doing it
is the most traditional.


664
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,960
Traditional ways are often the best
and they can often be forgotten.


665
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,240
This way, although it doesn't
give the most even of rings,


666
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,360
I think I quite like it.
It looks quite rustic, homely,


667
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,560
sign of a home-made bagel.


668
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,480
It's important to get
a nice even ring, I think,


669
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,440
just for the look factor.
It's that finesse they do look for.
And they do mark you on that.


670
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,840
John's savoury fig bagels
will be topped with walnut
and Gruyere cheese


671
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,400
and his blueberry bagels will be
lightly covered in white chocolate.


672
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,200
Hello, John. Hello.


673
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,480
I want to talk about your action.
You're using the middle finger spin,
I noticed.


674
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,240
It's more of a spin and squeeze,
so you can try and get uneven
consistency all the way round.


675
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,800
- And then I just sort of...
- The double-hander.


676
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,960
Just so you can try
and get an even consistency.


677
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,920
'Poaching the dough before baking


678
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,000
'gives the bagels their dense, chewy
texture


679
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,680
'and creates a skin that
will brown and crisp when baked.


680
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,600
'Over boiling will result in the
crust being too thick and too chewy,


681
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,600
'but if the dough is not solidified,


682
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,720
'it will rise in the oven and
produce bread rolls, not bagels.'


683
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,560
If you're not careful in putting it
in the water, it's got a tendency


684
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,120
to actually collapse on itself.


685
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,560
They don't puff
up as much as they should.


686
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,760
So, bagels, how confident
are you feeling? Not very. ..three.


687
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,200
Count again. Four, five. Six, seven.
Sorry, eight. Welcome to technology.


688
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:26,200
Does that do seconds? Yes.
Let's reset. There you go, poppet.


689
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,600
What are you on now? 20.
Ten seconds. We'll do the next one.


690
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,600
So this is the part cooking
and puffing of the bagel. Yes.


691
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,800
Can we press that? One, two.


692
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,920
There you go, excellent.


693
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:45,120
I can... Relax. Relax, yeah.
Let technology take the strain now.


694
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,120
It's because they're so soft,
I'm worried that when I boil them


695
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,480
and mess around with them,
they'll break up.


696
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,160
I'm not... Oops!


697
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,960
Oh, my God!


698
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,000
Once in the oven, it's a nervous
wait, as the bake will reveal


699
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,480
whether the bagels will hold their
shape or rise like regular bread.


700
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,520
I don't know. The holes have closed
up loads. They look like rolls.


701
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,600
It's impossible to know what they're
like until you cut into them.


702
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,920
And they're probably going
to be completely wrong.


703
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,640
I am worried that I'm always last.


704
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,360
I haven't messed around today
though.


705
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,240
I've done what I needed to do,


706
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,240
but obviously I needed
all the time that I had.


707
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,040
It's not exactly going to plan.


708
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,040
It's more like a recovery
from disaster at the moment.


709
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,960
They're as synonymous with
New York as yellow taxi cabs,


710
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:00,240
Andy Warhol and loud, short,
bad-tempered comedians.


711
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,360
But we Brits have actually been
brunching on the bagels


712
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,240
for a lot longer
than our Stateside cousins.


713
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,000
So where do bagels actually
come from? Tell me, already!


714
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,680
'The earliest recorded bagels
were baked by the Jewish communities
in 17th century Poland.


715
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,880
'Given as gifts at circumcisions
and funerals,


716
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,480
'their shape was said to represent
the circle of life.'


717
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,720
So when did bagels first
go international?


718
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,280
In the late 19th century, millions
of Jews left Eastern Europe.


719
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,960
They were escaping persecution
and economic hardship.


720
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,040
For many, the first port of call
was London.


721
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,800
Jewish communities sprang up,


722
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,080
particularly in the East End
of London and in Manchester.


723
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,440
What do we know about the early
British bagel traders?


724
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,560
They tended to be street-sellers.


725
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,920
They were a cheap bread
that was sold in the street,
usually by women.


726
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,240
They became known as
the Bagel Queens of the Lane.


727
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,280
The lane being Petticoat Lane
in the East End.


728
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,600
There's one rather wonderful
description of the bagels themselves


729
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,920
as being always oven-fresh,
geometric in their roundness


730
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,720
and shining like a good deed
in an iniquitous world.


731
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,960
'These bagels were made to be
kosher,


732
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,560
'made in strict accordance
to Jewish dietary laws.


733
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,400
'A procedure that's still
followed today.


734
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,760
'A local rabbi closely monitors
this bakery in North London.'


735
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,160
Rabbi Conway,
how do you ensure the bagels


736
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,640
are being made in a kosher way?


737
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,560
Well, first of all,
we have an inspector


738
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,120
who comes in at least once a day.


739
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:42,440
First thing he does is he has to
make sure that all the ingredients,


740
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,120
all the products,
everything being used here


741
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,520
is firstly not of animal origin
and secondly not of dairy origin.


742
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,400
And how does Sabbath affect
the bagel making process?


743
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,680
It doesn't affect it at all,


744
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,440
because there's no baking of kosher
bagels on the Sabbath.


745
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,280
This bakery, for example, they have
to close at sundown on the Friday


746
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,960
and they have to stay closed
until Saturday night


747
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,080
when three stars can be seen
in the sky.


748
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,320
So for 25 hours, there is no baking.


749
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,600
'By the mid-20th century, the bagel
in Britain was still largely


750
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,560
'the preserve of Jewish communities,


751
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,480
'but over in New York,
had become mainstream.'


752
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,720
When the bagel making machine
was invented in 1963,


753
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,960
this meant that American bakers
could mass produce


754
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,400
and distribute
their bagels nationwide.


755
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,920
Their popularity increased.


756
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,880
These new American-style bagels
were bigger and sweeter


757
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,320
and available in a huge variety
of different flavours.


758
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,040
They were soon rebranded
and marketed back to us


759
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,640
as an American speciality.


760
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,560
The '80s and '90s


761
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,960
saw a bagel boom in the UK.


762
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,960
So if you asked a New York cabbie
to follow that bagel home,


763
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,640
he might have a bigger fare
than he expected.


764
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,960
Well, some are split on the top.
They've risen up a bit.


765
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,200
They've got not a bad crust,
slightly over-cooked there.


766
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,600
Like the curate's egg -
good in parts.


767
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,840
SHE SIGHS


768
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,920
They look lovely.
Ah, that smells great!


769
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,560
Oh, I don't know!


770
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,120
To be honest,
there's so many issues with these.


771
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,040
I think I'm in trouble today, yes.


772
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,200
Amazing. I'm happy.
I'm really happy with them.


773
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,160
Paul just gave them a little
bit of a glance. I know, I saw that.


774
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,120
Doesn't give anything away though.


775
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,680
Really unnerving, yeah.


776
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,600
OK, bakers. That's ten minutes left,
please. Ten minutes remaining.


777
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,640
String 'em up!


778
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,240
Like a bagel-y washing line.


779
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,560
I think that's marvellous.


780
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,480
That's the best use I've seen for
a mug tree since mugs went on it.


781
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,720
Do you think quite a lot
about your presentation, James? No.


782
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,720
Just put them on a board?
Put them on a board.


783
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,920
I'm not sure what it looks like.


784
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,320
It looks like twelve beautiful
bagels on a board, James.


785
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,280
OK, bagels shmagels.
This challenge is over.


786
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,440
'Each baker's offering
will be individually judged


787
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,440
'before Mary and Paul make
the decision as to who is leaving


788
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,680
'The Great British Bake-Off.'


789
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,720
The porcini mushroom flavour is
coming through and the cheese too.


790
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,280
The way they look is a bit...


791
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,600
They're a bit weak, a bit flat.


792
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,680
But the taste and texture
is all right.


793
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,640
And your sweet one.


794
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,000
I like the flavour of those.


795
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,800
The shape of those are better
than your savoury ones.


796
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,160
They're more like bread rolls
than they are a bagel.


797
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,560
You overbaked them.


798
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,600
It's a very close texture


799
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,040
and a rather hard crust.


800
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,040
It's a bread roll
with salt and herbs on top,


801
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,880
not a bagel unfortunately.


802
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,920
They've all been over-proved.
They all look...


803
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,920
You've got a very bread-like...
and it's quite flat.


804
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,240
And you've lost the shape. Yeah.


805
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,280
These are the cranberry ones.


806
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,680
I'm not getting strong cinnamon.


807
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,160
If you get a bit of a cranberry,
it kind of...


808
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,280
I've got a lot of cranberry.
Oh, OK. Fair enough.


809
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,560
They're both over-proved.
They look...not like bagels.


810
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,680
You've got a very good batch,
all matching.


811
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,320
You rather like that, don't you? Mm.
Gruyere's lovely, and the cumin.


812
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,080
If we move onto your sweet "bagels".


813
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,840
In inverted commas, because that
to me is like a bread ring.


814
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,760
It's not a bagel. Right.
It's different. Mm.


815
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,880
I don't know that I like it. It just
needed some added sweetness for me.


816
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,640
The sour and the bitterness
of the chocolate...


817
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,280
You could class that as a savoury,
if you pushed it. Oh, right.


818
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,360
Great idea, but needs to be
thought through a little bit more.


819
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,880
Worked on.


820
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,680
I felt the dough and I thought
it was a bit soft.


821
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,160
It's pretty much what's gone wrong.


822
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,560
It's just concertinaed up
into a flatbread, which was earlier.


823
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,040
You're very good with your flavours.
I like that.


824
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,160
It's an interesting flavour,
but it's not exactly a bagel.


825
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,960
It's a new bread you've invented.
A flagel!


826
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,120
The crunch is lovely
from walnuts and cheese.


827
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,720
I like the idea
of the white chocolate on top.


828
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,200
Did you have sugar with that dough?
No, just honey. It's overbaked then.


829
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,080
Overbaked? OK. But the flavours
are lovely. Absolutely lovely.


830
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,640
The fact that you've managed
to come up with something


831
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,040
related to sour in four hours
is admirable.


832
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,800
That's interesting.


833
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,000
Yeah, well done.


834
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,920
LAUGHTER


835
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,920
He finds it painful to say that!


836
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,920
Very tricky to do.


837
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,760
I think out of all of them, it was
probably the hardest one to make.


838
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,000
Now, orange and mint?


839
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,360
Yeah. Overbaked.
Yeah. Too much colour underneath.


840
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,360
You had an awful
lot of orange in here.


841
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,080
I can certainly taste it,
and I like it.


842
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,040
And the mint is now coming through.


843
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,760
The overall flavour, I think
it's good. It's a nice bagel.


844
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,520
They look great,
but I'm more impressed with them.


845
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,440
Well done. Thank you.


846
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,080
That went absolutely fantastic.


847
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,800
Better than I could have
possibly hoped.


848
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,120
It was absolutely brilliant.
Yeah, there are no words.


849
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,040
Oh dear, oh dear! Disaster!


850
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,520
'Paul thought my bread rolls
were really good,'


851
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,200
but unfortunately
we were doing bagels this afternoon.


852
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:48,480
I think I'm probably
the one to go today.


853
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,520
I really do think
it could be anybody.


854
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,840
So, Paul and Mary,
who is in the arena this week


855
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,560
for star baker, do you think?


856
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,280
John has got to have a mention.


857
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,920
In the technical challenge,
he made a beautiful loaf.


858
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,440
And good bagels, good texture,
good toppings. Yeah.


859
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,920
I actually think James
has done exceptionally well.


860
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,240
These sour bagels are really
difficult to do.


861
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,080
Brendan delivered certainly
one extremely good bagel.


862
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,880
The only issue I did have
was with the chocolate one.


863
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,160
It was far too bitter.


864
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,720
Let's talk about people who haven't
done quite so well this week.


865
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,640
Stuart is in a bit of trouble.


866
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,600
Didn't really do well
in the technical challenge.


867
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,000
Look at the bagels,
they're quite flat.


868
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,160
And then Peter didn't do
so well with his flatbreads.


869
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,160
We had that problem with salt.
He was last in the technical
challenge yesterday.


870
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,680
Which automatically puts you
in a very precarious position.


871
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,000
But, I mean, Victoria. They're not
the best bagels in the world.


872
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,040
You've got three in contention
for Star Baker


873
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,480
and three very much in contention
for the drop zone. Yeah.


874
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,440
We'll leave it to you to figure
it out. Go decide, Paul and Mary.


875
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,520
Bakers,
an exceptionally busy weekend


876
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,320
and you've all excelled yourself.
You should be very proud.


877
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,800
Of course, every week,


878
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,600
we like to award one of you
with the accolade of Star Baker.


879
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,840
This week, that accolade goes to...


880
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,560
..John. Well done, John.


881
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,720
Thank you.


882
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,320
And, of course,
sadly we have to announce


883
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,680
who will not be joining us


884
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,160
for next week's Bake Off.


885
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,760
And I'm sorry to say that
the person is...


886
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,920
..Peter.


887
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,160
Can we give you a massive
Mel and Sue sandwich,


888
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,880
the like of which you could only
have in your worst nightmare?


889
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,400
It's been fantastic.
I've had a great time, thank you.


890
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,400
I'm going home
and I'm absolutely gutted.


891
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,960
Everybody has to be experimental
and it has to be sheer perfection,


892
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,680
and he didn't quite reach that.


893
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,680
I feel very lucky. Very lucky.


894
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:35,480
I just want to show what I can do
and instead of being at the bottom,
be at the top.


895
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,840
Completely elated. I feel amazing.


896
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,000
A massive shock, to be honest.
I'm chuffed to bits.


897
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,760
All past winners of Bake Off
have done well on the bread week,


898
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,000
so I'll be watching John
very closely.


899
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,680
I'm going to come away from this
and it's going to be my challenge


900
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,080
in the next few months
to become a better bread baker.


901
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,680
'Next time, the bakers
take on tarts...'


902
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,440
You need biceps for that. Puff
the magic pastry, here it comes.


903
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,960
'..with a Signature Challenge that
turns everything upside down...'


904
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,240
Look at that!


905
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,880
'..a technical treacle tart
that gets them in a twist.'


906
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,600
If you don't get it right,
it could be the end of it.


907
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:24,560
'..and a fruity Showstopper
that pushes their pastry limits.'


908
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,640
It's the one who can keep
their nerves in check who will win.


909
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:30,000
Arrgh!


910
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,000
