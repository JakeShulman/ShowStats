1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,360
Ah, it's botanicals week,
celebrating everything botanical -

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,200
flavours, spices and edible floral
displays.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,240
So, Noel, have a taste of that.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,480
I'm not tasting that, it looks like
it won first prize

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,680
at the Chelsea Flower Show.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,360
Well, it's all edible.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,160
The whole thing? The whole thing.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,200
OK...

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,560
What are you doing?! What? You're
not supposed to eat the plate!

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,600
{\an1}SHE SIGHS

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,880
Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,920
It's not bad actually.
It's got a nice crunch.

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,200
Are you all right?
I'm going to eat the table next.

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,520
Last time...
We're off to a really good start.

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,000
..the bakers felt the
pressure in pastry week.

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,240
Oh, no.

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,360
While Josh's sunflower shone...

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
I can't fault that. Thank you.

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,480
..it was Cristy who won Star Baker.

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,080
They're three very good pies.

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,840
Things were absolutely less
fabulous for Rowan...

22
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,440
Look, it's broke. Oh, God.

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,480
..and Nicky...
It's not risen, has it?

24
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,000
..and they became the latest
bakers to leave the competition.

25
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,040
It was like a bag of pants
this week.

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,200
Saying goodbye is
the worst part about this.

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,480
Now...

28
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,720
Go, girl!

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,960
..it's botanicals week.
Dandelion syrup.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
..and the bakers spice up
the Signature...

31
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,720
Come here. Yeah.
Just lean on these buns. Come on.

32
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,160
..are living on borrowed
time in the technical...

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,360
Out of sight, out of mind.

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,160
..and take on a blooming
ambitious Showstopper.

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,560
This is crazy.

36
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,440
Who will come up smelling of roses?

37
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,080
It's absolutely heavenly.

38
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,720
And who will be rooted out of
the competition?

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,520
That was t'wrong thing
to do, weren't it?

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,680
Week six. I can't believe it.

41
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,040
There's only seven of us.

42
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,040
It's a big change,
going from nine to seven.

43
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,320
Good luck, good luck, good luck.

44
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,120
Botanical week is quite different.

45
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,040
I had to ask Lara what botanicals
was and then google it, but...

46
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Tsh, tsh, tsh, tsh.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,480
Botanicals is sort of like flavours
that have come from plants,

48
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,800
like flowers and the roots or the
bark.

49
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,240
It's not something that
I usually work with

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,720
because you can't go foraging really
in London.

51
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,120
Because we're coming closer

52
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,960
and closer to the end, I'd like
to get at least a handshake,

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,440
come first in Technical or
Star Baker.

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,920
One of them and I'll be happy.

55
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,960
{\an1}NOEL CHUCKLES

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,560
Welcome to botanicals week,
everybody.

57
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,520
Now, this is a chance for you
to get your botties out

58
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,920
and show us what they can do.

59
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,440
For your botty Signature Challenge,

60
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,440
the judges would love you
to celebrate spice by making

61
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,760
a batch of 12 perfectly
fragrant spiced buns.

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,640
You have two hours
and 45 minutes before Prue

63
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,760
and Paul want to see your buns.

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
Paul already checked mine out
this morning.

65
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,680
He did, didn't he? I saw him.

66
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,080
He was disappointed!

67
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,480
On your marks... Get set...

68
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Bake!

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,160
Here we go.

70
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,720
I have made spiced buns at home,

71
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,840
but just got to get 'em identical
today.

72
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,480
Bread week went well
so I'm using what I know.

73
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,240
Oh, my God, I forgot the egg,
hang on.

74
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,800
It's botanicals week
and we're celebrating spice,

75
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,520
herbs and lots of floral hints.

76
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,400
In life, I would say I'm quite
spicy. Probably not in baking.

77
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,360
So the Signature Challenge
is 12 spiced buns.

78
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,440
Spice is the hero so we
want to taste it.

79
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,760
Don't want it to be too much, do ya?

80
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,360
I don't want to offend them with it.

81
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,760
And you know what Paul is like -

82
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,480
they have to be
absolutely identical.

83
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,120
It's about keeping it consistent,

84
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:49,200
to create 12 beautifully
sweet, spiced, sticky buns.

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,040
Hello, Saku. Hello, hello.

86
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,720
Tell us all about your spiced buns.

87
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,480
I'm making Swedish cinnamon buns
with lots of cardamon.

88
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,280
Saku... I'm not trying
to confuse you!

89
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,880
Well, I'm confused because I'm so
used to you bringing Sri Lanka
into this.

90
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,840
Yes. Cinnamon and cardamon from
Sri Lanka.

91
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,360
This is international affair.

92
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,640
Swedish bun with the Sri Lankan
cinnamon and cardamon.

93
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,040
For her take on Swedish
cinnamon buns,

94
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,640
Saku will add cardamon to both
the dough

95
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,240
and cinnamon filling before creating
its intricate shape.

96
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,480
I swirl it and then I shape it
into a kind of little knot.

97
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,760
And they'll all be identical?
Exactly?

98
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,080
I hope it will be identical.
They will be.

99
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,480
Well, good luck, Saku, I think it
sounds delicious.

100
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,600
Thank you very much. Good luck.

101
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,640
That's looking pretty groovy.

102
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,040
All the bakers are making
an enriched bread dough.

103
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,360
It's got butter in it so it's got
the extra fat.

104
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,080
Kind of soften it, just makes it a
bit more flavourful as well.

105
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,240
Adding spices at this stage will not
only boost the flavour of their
cake...

106
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,760
Smells nice.

107
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,800
..but also lend it
an enticing colour.

108
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,280
Saffron goes into the buns, gives
'em a nice yellow summery colour.

109
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,760
That's all the spice in, yeah,

110
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,000
so it's got, like, that
gorgeous brown colour to it.

111
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,120
..or not.

112
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,720
That is disgusting. You're not
putting this in your bake.

113
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,880
It's in there. When you
add mulled wine to egg,

114
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,120
it just goes really grey.

115
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,920
That is absolutely vile, babes.

116
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,880
Thank you.

117
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,680
They may currently be grey,

118
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,280
but Tasha's hoping her buns will
bring some festive cheer to the tent

119
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,400
with cinnamon, nutmeg
and cloves in her fillings,

120
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,360
and mulled wine in her eggwash
and glaze as well as her dough.

121
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,480
The mulled wine is the liquid that
goes into the dough, is it?

122
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,120
So it replaces half the milk
and water.

123
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,040
Quite a dangerous thing to do.

124
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,240
Thank you. Do you find that
the dough can be quite tight?

125
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,480
No comment.

126
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,880
Paul, she's playing you at your
own game. This is like poker!

127
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,920
I'm meant to say "no comment",
not you!

128
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,240
While Tasha tackles Christmas...

129
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,360
The flavours are always nice.
Famous last words.

130
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,280
..Matty's embracing Easter.

131
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,040
I'm making a spiced hot cross bun.

132
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,440
I done a practice,
but they weren't very good.

133
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,640
But I think I was trying to get 'em
done before the West Ham game.

134
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,440
To ensure his flavours hit
the back of the net,

135
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,040
as the only baker not to use

136
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,080
a filling, Matty is packing his
dough with cinnamon,

137
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,920
nutmeg and ginger along with dried
fruits he's soaked in ginger rum.

138
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,400
Hot cross buns, recently,

139
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,360
the bought ones,
have got worse and worse.

140
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,440
Don't hold back, Prue!

141
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,920
You need to show the nation what
a really good hot cross bun can be.

142
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,200
Don't put that pressure on me!

143
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,320
Looking forward to this, mate.
Thank you, cheers. Thank you.

144
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,600
Good luck. Thank you.

145
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,000
The nation are dependent.
I don't even like hot cross buns!

146
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,600
I reckon that looks lovely.
I'm happy.

147
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,600
Looking for it to be really soft
and smooth and stretchy,

148
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,280
ready for its first prove.

149
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,480
A bit tack, but Paul said to me in

150
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,240
the technical of bread week
it was underproved.

151
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,160
You don't want to be told
the same negative thing twice.

152
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,480
Flying. Here we go.

153
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,680
In the drawer.

154
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,480
With their dough rising...

155
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,000
Do you want me to open it?
No, no, don't.

156
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,840
Don't want to be responsible
for lack of rise.

157
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,280
..the bakers can turn
to their fillings.

158
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,720
This is the cinnamon. I know they
like a punchy flavour, don't they?

159
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,520
I hope I get it just right.

160
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,800
As well as incorporating cinnamon
into her pecan filling

161
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,920
and dough, Cristy's also adding it

162
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,560
to her glaze, which she'll drizzle
on with maple syrup.

163
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,720
This is going to be good.

164
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,960
Can I just say something?

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,280
Go on. Star Baker. Handshake.

166
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,760
What the hell? No tears in this tent
today, is there? No.

167
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,120
Let's be honest. I don't know,
we've got to see how these go.

168
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
Go, girl!

169
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,600
While Cristy's
supersizing her spice...

170
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,560
Might need a bit more cinnamon,
you know.

171
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,720
..Dana is dialling hers down.

172
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,240
Last time I used cardamon, you said
it was medicinal,

173
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,240
so I'm reining it back a bit.

174
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,520
How are you bringing these
flavours into the bun?

175
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,480
The dough's plain and then the
cardamon comes in in the filling.

176
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,400
With no flavouring in her dough,

177
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,400
Dana's relying on her other
elements to pack a punch.

178
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,160
She's using cardamon, pistachio
and orange in her fillings,

179
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,680
glazes and toppings.

180
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,560
And to finish, she'll sprinkle rose
petals on her knotted creations.

181
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,760
Interesting shape. Lovely flavours.

182
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,680
I think it sounds really delicious.

183
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,200
It's about uniformity and it's about
getting all those flavours through

184
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,040
as well. Yeah, I hope so. And
getting the cardamon levels just
right.

185
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,720
Um... Yes.

186
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,120
{\an1}LAUGHTER

187
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,680
Just a tiny bit of maple.
I don't want it to be oversweet.

188
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,600
Ensuring the perfect balance...
More cardamon.

189
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,160
..with the spices dominant
but not overwhelming...

190
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,720
Just fine-tuning.

191
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,720
..becomes even trickier when they're
paired with other strong flavours.

192
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,960
Because it's going to be nice
and spiced,

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,120
I wanted something else
to just cut through that

194
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,920
so I'm going to inject a lemon curd
into the centre of the buns.

195
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,560
In addition to his tangy lemon curd
filling,

196
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,160
Josh is giving his cinnamon buns
a further fruity frisson

197
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,920
with fresh and dried blueberries.

198
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,560
Are we going to think this is
a lemon and blueberry bun or are we

199
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,000
going to think this is a spiced bun?

200
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,720
The dried ones I've soaked in
a cinnamon tea overnight.

201
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,080
Does it stop the blueberry
being a blueberry?

202
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,440
No, no, it still holds the taste.

203
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,760
Paul's worried about blueberries,
I can see it.

204
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,680
Good luck.

205
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,400
Dan is also adding fruity
flavours to his spiced buns.

206
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,240
Lemon, I've got some orange,
I'm going to top it with some figs.

207
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,960
These are the type of buns
you'd like to eat outside

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
a Greek taverna with a lovely
little mug of espresso.

209
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,680
{\an8}To capture the spirit of the Aegean,

210
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,320
{\an8}as well as his figs
and citrus fruits,

211
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
{\an8}Dan will use saffron, cinnamon

212
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,240
{\an8}and star anise in his
Chelsea bun-style creations.

213
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,400
Can't go wrong with buns, can you?

214
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,320
No, no, hopefully not, no.

215
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,840
I probably can, but...we shall see.

216
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,200
I feel like.

217
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,440
So sorry, darlings.

218
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,800
Who's this? It's my stalker.
Don't worry.

219
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,280
The dame can appear anywhere.

220
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,600
It's like Rentaghost,
she can just pop up anywhere. Yeah.

221
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,920
Occasionally when I wake up in the
morning, she's there at the end of
my bed. Is she, yeah?

222
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,600
That's...quite scary.
That sounded weird, didn't it?

223
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,880
It did, pretty weird, yeah.

224
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,880
Suppose it's better than Paul
being there, I suppose, isn't it?

225
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,960
Bakers, you are halfway through.

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,560
It's quite hot in there.
I don't want them to overprove.

227
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,280
The extra fat in an
enriched dough as well as

228
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,360
the addition of the fruit and
spices can mean a slower rise.

229
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,560
Let me just check.

230
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,000
But if the bakers remove their
dough before it's fully proved...

231
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,160
I've still got five more minutes.

232
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,600
Please, prove!

233
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,040
..they risk a tight texture
in their finished buns.

234
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,960
I don't know. It's got another prove
yet anyway so we'll go with it.

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,360
I'd say go a bit longer cos he
always says it's not proved enough,
remember? He does, yeah.

236
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,640
Just do it a little bit longer.

237
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,600
Watch him say it's overproved this
week. Oh, don't say that!

238
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,760
If he says that, I'll just
look the other way!

239
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,520
I'm just going to get it out.

240
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,800
It's huge.

241
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,040
Pretty good. Um, it's nice and
proved. Perfect.

242
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,320
I'm just going to mix in all
of this filling.

243
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,560
I don't think blueberry is that
strong a fruit.

244
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,360
It's just a nice blend, I think.

245
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,360
Need to put a very thin layer.

246
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,560
I hope Paul loves these nuts,
these fine nuts.

247
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,360
If I can make sure that they're even
weight, it should mean that they end

248
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,040
up looking somewhat the same.

249
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,000
The judges are expecting
12 identical spiced buns...

250
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,880
It's always a bit thinner at
one end, it's so annoying.

251
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,200
..but the more complicated
the shape of the buns...

252
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,360
I'm cutting into 12 equal pieces
then twisting.

253
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,440
..the trickier that
will be to achieve.

254
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,160
Pinch it and roll.

255
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,120
One done. It looks quite pretty.

256
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,280
Silly me.

257
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,880
Measured in inches and
then cut into centimetres.

258
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,680
These are quite big.

259
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,600
I've got a feeling they're
just going to go waah,

260
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,200
like Yorkshire puddings.

261
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,840
Looks identical in shape,
isn't it? Happy, happy, happy.

262
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,040
Think a couple are a
bit higher than the others,

263
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,720
but the second prove, they'll all
sort of start joining together.

264
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,760
I'm happy with them. At the moment,
they all look quite identical,

265
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,480
apart from that one. I'm hoping
we'll have twins and not sisters.

266
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,840
Ready, in.

267
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,120
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

268
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,640
Prove is definitely done.

269
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
Think they look all right.

270
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,680
I'm just putting an eggwash on
there so it'll get nice

271
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,920
and brown when baked.

272
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,480
It's like this grey sludge.

273
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,720
Don't know if this is good.
It's very, very gloopy.

274
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,400
The figs are really nice on top

275
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
and I'm just going to baste it in
some of the honey and butter.

276
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,880
Turns into jam, pretty much.

277
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,400
We're going in.

278
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,920
195, 20 minutes.

279
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,720
12 minutes, 200.

280
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,680
They're looking quite nice actually,
yeah, nice and golden in colour.

281
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,360
Little bit longer.

282
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,000
Few more minutes.

283
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,920
They look beautiful, look at that.
Are you happy?

284
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,560
I am happy. You don't look happy.

285
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,040
But, you know, it's sticking out.

286
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,360
Oh, it's all right.
It's fine, it's fine. Come here.

287
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,600
Yeah. Just lean on these buns.
Come on.

288
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,680
Lean on these buns,
have a little sleep.

289
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,840
SAKU SNORES
Let me rub your head.

290
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,880
I don't think the cross has worked.
It's, like, really faint.

291
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,320
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

292
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,720
Oh, flippin' heck. Ten minutes
to get your buns out the oven.

293
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,480
Yeah, I'm quite impressed.

294
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,640
They're not identical at all.

295
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,520
All look very even.

296
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,680
Oh, these are not identical.

297
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,440
Pretty good. Nice and hollow.

298
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,600
I'm just going to give it
a nice glaze.

299
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,800
Quite pleased with that colour.

300
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,400
Maybe just they're not
quite identical.

301
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,560
Lemon curd in the middle.

302
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,680
I've got my mulled wine glaze

303
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,640
and it'll kind of melt
into the pastry.

304
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,240
And it's not grey!

305
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,880
Glaze on, going to get it all in my
nooks and crannies.

306
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,480
Lovely bakers,
you have one minute left.

307
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,120
Finishing touches, I've just
sprinkled some cinnamon.

308
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,360
I've never done that before so let's
see how that one turns out.

309
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,360
Add a bit of glitter. I wanted the
two-tone so you know they're lemon
and blueberry.

310
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,880
So let's get 'em on, then.

311
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,960
Sprinkling some rose petals on
the top.

312
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,680
After all, it is botanical week.

313
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,920
Oh, my word, two more to go.
Not enough space.

314
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,720
Don't think it's going to fit on
my tray.

315
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,200
I hope they live up to
everyone's expectations.

316
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,040
Oh, mine are all misshapen.

317
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,760
Bakers, your time is up.

318
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,880
Step away-a from ya buns.

319
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,320
Stop.

320
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,160
Come on, let's have a group hug.

321
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,960
{\an8}I don't want anyone to touch me.

322
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,520
{\an8}You smashed it, guys. Well done.

323
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,040
The bakers' spiced buns will now be
judged by Paul and Prue.

324
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,920
Hello, Tasha. Hello.

325
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,160
Hello, Tasha.

326
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,440
I like the colour. It's unusual.
It's quite festive.

327
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,080
I think, if anything,
they're a bit big.

328
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,200
But there's a lot of consistency
there, which I quite like.

329
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,120
Wow, that's quite an open structure
in there. Surprising.

330
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
Worth the risk.

331
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
It's Christmas. Phew.

332
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,920
I love the flavour.
I like the texture.

333
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,800
It is beautifully balanced between
all the flavours.

334
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,440
And you've created something that is
really pleasant in the mouth.

335
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,920
Well done. Terrific, Tasha.
Thank you. Thank you.

336
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,280
{\an1}SHE EXHALES

337
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,120
I love the shine on them.

338
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,320
I think they look really
tempting and delicious,

339
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,680
but they're very uneven.

340
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,280
They're dramatically uneven.

341
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,600
You do get the saffron,
you get the spices coming through

342
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,960
and at a nice level as well.
It's not overpowering.

343
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,680
My only big issue is the consistency
and the shape and size. Yeah.

344
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,920
You know, what I think is the
crowning glory

345
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,680
is the fresh figs on top. Yeah.

346
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,080
I think that's a real piece
of genius, it's lovely.

347
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,360
It does work well. Thank you.
Brilliant. That's great, thank you.

348
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,000
Thank you, darl.
Thank you very much, nice one.

349
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,680
The issue is the consistency or
inconsistency

350
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,000
of the shape and colour. Yeah.

351
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,120
There's not two alike.
It's a shame.

352
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,800
Not a lot of cardamon. OK.

353
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,440
You get the orange
and the pistachio.

354
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,440
Cardamon, barely getting that.

355
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,200
Actually get more of
the rose coming in.

356
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,320
Oh, do you? Yeah.
We'll just change the title of it!

357
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,040
They're rose buns. Yeah.

358
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,280
There we go. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

359
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,200
{\an8}I think they look very nice.
I like the colour.

360
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,040
Bit of an unusual size difference.

361
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,520
My maths went wrong.

362
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,920
Don't you work in accountancy?

363
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,440
Shh! I will lose my job now!

364
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,680
Um, the knot works quite nicely.

365
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,040
Yes, yes, I love the twisting,
it's lovely.

366
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,560
Quite a tight texture.

367
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,560
Mmm...

368
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,040
I think your balance
of cardamon is just lovely.

369
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,120
The flavour combination
between the cardamon

370
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,320
and the cinnamon is
absolutely spot-on.

371
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,120
Well done, Saku.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

372
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,400
Well, they look very unusual.

373
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,600
Looks like a cartoon character
with the eyes, you know?

374
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,160
"Look into my eyes!"

375
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,240
Nice colour,
it's got a lovely colour.

376
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,440
You don't get the blueberry.

377
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,280
The blueberry's become a
carrier for the cinnamon. Yeah.

378
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,360
I actually quite like it.

379
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,480
It reminds me of an iced bun with
the lemon running through it.

380
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,600
Iced buns are one of
my favourite things ever.

381
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,760
I do think the bread is beautiful.

382
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,080
The glaze is beautiful
and I like the look of them.

383
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,520
Wonderful. Thank you.
So it's a pretty good bun.

384
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,480
I think they're pretty
consistent, these.

385
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,840
Wow. They look impressive inside,
I'll tell you that now.

386
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,080
Oh, good. To get that even
all the way through.

387
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,560
You've rolled the dough really

388
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,800
thinly so that you get a lot of
filling... Yeah. ..and I like that.

389
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,160
Flavour is lovely.

390
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,960
Maple syrup's there. It's not too
sweet. Very nice. That's delicious.

391
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,680
It is absolutely delicious and
I'm trying not to eat any more.

392
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,240
Thank you. Well done.

393
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,520
Well, I think they
look lovely and shiny.

394
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,680
They're very even.
You've managed the cross.

395
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,160
Cross looks good.
I do like the colour.

396
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,840
There's some nice consistency there
as well. What is it again?

397
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,800
Hot cross. Hot cross bun? Yeah.

398
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,320
I'll judge you as a hot cross bun.

399
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,280
If it's better,
it's just a spiced bun.

400
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,320
{\an1}LAUGHTER

401
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,760
Right answer!

402
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,120
It is too dense. OK.

403
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,960
I've had cakes that are
more open than that.

404
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,040
I think it's just underproved.
A little bit more proving just

405
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,720
would've opened that up a little
bit. I'm not really getting the
ginger. There's not enough of it.

406
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,480
You need more fruit. If you're going
to put fruit in it, put fruit in it.

407
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,680
Yeah. I still think
it's very delicious.

408
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,160
Thank you very much, Matty. Cheers,
thank you. Ah, thanks, Matty.

409
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,360
Erm, Matty, I told you to prove it
a bit longer, didn't I?

410
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,560
You did! Yeah...

411
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,640
I think I impressed Prue a little
bit more than I did Paul.

412
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,520
I'm Team Prue for now!

413
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,160
I'm happy that the flavours worked.

414
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Yeah. It's Christmas in a bun.

415
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,440
It could've gone better,
but it's fine.

416
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,000
We've still got the technical to do

417
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,400
so hopefully I can just kind
of smash that one out.

418
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,800
{\an1}SCREECHES

419
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,960
The bakers could practice
their spicy signature bakes,

420
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,320
but the Technical Challenge is
a mystery.

421
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,240
It's time for your
Technical Challenge.

422
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,600
This one has been set for you
by the delightful Prue.

423
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,560
Prue, any words of wisdom?

424
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,880
Yes, be bold with the botanicals.

425
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,440
I actually found that quite moving.

426
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,520
Ah, you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right, yeah.

427
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,520
Talking of moving, it's time for you
guys to move on out. Thank you.

428
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,920
We're going to miss you guys.
We are.

429
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,560
Prue would like you to make

430
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,560
a beautifully decorated lemon
and thyme drizzle cake.

431
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,320
They're looking for a light moist
sponge that is soaked

432
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,480
with lemon and thyme syrup,

433
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,360
and a sprinkling of
crystalised lemon and thyme.

434
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,600
How much time have we got?

435
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,040
1 hour and 30.

436
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,000
On your marks... Get set...

437
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,560
Bake!

438
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,960
Oh, my God. Right.

439
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,040
Interesting cake!

440
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,880
I imagine it's going to take a bit
of time, that. No pun intended.

441
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,160
Hey, this challenge will be right up
your street - you've actually come
as a lemon!

442
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,320
Ha!

443
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,440
I just want to point out at this
moment in time

444
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,720
that you've come as thyme.

445
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,360
So, Prue, tell us all about your
lemon and thyme drizzle cake.

446
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,760
It is just a cream sponge baked in
a fancy tin,

447
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,360
but the difference is it
has a lot of thyme in it.

448
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,840
What I'm worried about most is I
think the bakers won't put enough in
it.

449
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,320
If you only put a bit in, it'll just
be a lemon drizzle cake.

450
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,080
I mean, obviously, they've got
the tin.

451
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,800
If they don't grease it properly,
Paul, as you know,

452
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,280
that cake will stick.

453
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,200
Come on, I'm dribbling now.

454
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,800
I need a bite.
My goodness, that's a fair slice.

455
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,560
That big enough? Yes.

456
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,720
Ooh, yeah.

457
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,520
This is very moist from
the drizzle, and the lemon

458
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,440
and thyme work beautifully
well together.

459
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,600
It is absolutely lovely.

460
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,880
Mmm. For me, it's all going to come
down to the flavour

461
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,840
and the balance between
the thyme and the lemon.

462
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,120
Are they going to get it right?

463
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,760
Got to have lots of thyme.

464
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,440
What's ironic is we've only given
them an hour-and-a-half.

465
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,840
I know!

466
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,760
Instruction number one,
"Make the cake mixture." Fabulous.

467
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,680
It's been so long since
I've made a sponge cake.

468
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,840
I haven't made one in yonks.

469
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm creaming the butter

470
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,520
and the sugar together,
adding the lemon.

471
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,680
Self-raising flour.

472
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,400
Get that mixed in. I'm going to do
that on a low speed.

473
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,760
Think this'll be enough.

474
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,400
It's a light, fluffy sponge.

475
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,920
Have you ever made one
of these before?

476
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,040
I've made lemon drizzle cake.
You have?

477
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,320
But not with thyme.
Do you know what I mean?

478
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,440
Yeah, thyme for roast, not for the
cake. It's normally in food,

479
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
isn't it? It's not
normally in a bake.

480
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,160
Maybe it will taste
like roast dinner.

481
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,080
They've told us how much lemon to
use, but they just haven't told us

482
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,400
how much thyme to use.

483
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,880
What I would normally do is just add
only a little.

484
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,240
Baker's instinct.

485
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,040
Prue said be bold.
Prue, I'm with you, sister.

486
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,960
Try and get the thyme really in
there, you know.

487
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Couple of heaped tablespoons.

488
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,040
I did not measure the amount of
thyme I was putting in. Risky.

489
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,880
It does smell strong.

490
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,840
I can't smell anything.

491
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,960
Bit more thyme.

492
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,920
Just preparing the cake tin with
some butter so it doesn't stick.

493
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,400
Really hard to do.

494
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,800
There's a risk of things catching

495
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,760
so obviously you want it
to come out.

496
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,720
I'm going to give it
a little dusting with some flour.

497
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,240
I've put more thyme into it.

498
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,800
You can easily see all the green
specks so I'm hoping it'll be fine.

499
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,760
Slap it down so it gets into all
those crevices.

500
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,680
Get it in.

501
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,040
Has she been kind with
the method and everything?

502
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,600
No. Not really. Oh, just, "Bake."

503
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh, my gosh. "Just bake it!"

504
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,960
It's going to take a while in the
oven, that. It's quite a big cake.

505
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,440
It's definitely 40 minutes.

506
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,640
I'm going to set a timer
for 40 minutes.

507
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,640
Bakers, you are halfway through.

508
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,640
{\an1}HE HUMS CIRCUS MUSIC

509
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,640
Oh, God.

510
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,760
Need to get a move on.

511
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,640
Make the lemon and thyme syrup.

512
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,480
Juice of two lemons,
sugar and thyme, right.

513
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,680
This is where Prue was also saying,
"Be bold."

514
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,160
I'm going to give her thyme.

515
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,120
I'm just going to let that infuse.

516
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,040
Feel like that's ready to rock
and roll.

517
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,840
Number four, we crystallise
the lemon peel and thyme.

518
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,280
There's an eggwhite in it?

519
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
Eggwhite, dip the thyme leaves in

520
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,480
and then just covering it all in
sugar.

521
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,000
Why is there an eggwhite in it?!

522
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,600
It looks crystallised.

523
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,960
I'm just going to put enough sugar
onto it and then get it to dry out.

524
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,480
Oh...

525
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,440
Honestly, I haven't a clue if I'm
doing this the right way.

526
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,200
What the hell is this?

527
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,640
What is that?

528
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,200
{\an1}LAUGHTER

529
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,840
Somehow it's going to crystallise!

530
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,680
Is that in the recipe?

531
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,840
Out of sight, out of mind.

532
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,600
Saku? Yes.

533
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,160
How many keepy-uppies can you do
with a lemon?

534
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,960
None. None? None.

535
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,600
Look, one - boom.

536
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,840
Ugh!

537
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,040
{\an1}LAUGHTER

538
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,440
Any good? Amazing. See?

539
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,080
Do you reckon I could hit one of
those saucepans, look, with this
lemon?

540
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,280
No!

541
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,600
{\an1}SHATTERING

542
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
{\an1}BLEEP

543
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,000
It's fine, nothing broke.

544
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,280
Never a dull moment in here,
is there?

545
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,360
BOTH: Bakers, you have
15 minutes left.

546
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,880
Oh, my goodness me.

547
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,800
Nervous, I'm nervous.
I'm not doing it.

548
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,760
Skewer's coming out clean, so...

549
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,520
Just going to go for it.

550
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,280
I hope it is ready.

551
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,880
Smells nice.
Can't smell any thyme, but...

552
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,560
It's definitely baked.

553
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,640
Ah! OK, yeah, it's coming out.

554
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,760
Er, little bit overdone,
but it's better to overbake it

555
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,240
and then cover any problems
with the syrup.

556
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,480
The problem is turning it
upside down.

557
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,920
Oh, I'm so scared.

558
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,560
Flippin' heck.

559
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,600
Worst thing would be for it not
to come out.

560
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Phew!

561
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Bad, bad, bad, really bad.

562
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,800
Trying to find the good side.

563
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,160
It looks OK. It's come out neat.

564
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,680
Ahh! The bottom is ugly.

565
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,000
Oh, flippin' heck.

566
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,600
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

567
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,520
Come on, Josh. Come on.

568
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,000
Number five,
soak the cake with syrup.

569
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,600
Just going to give it little holes.

570
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,440
Right, just get that in.

571
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,760
There's not too much dripping off

572
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,360
so that indicates that it is
actually going in.

573
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,680
Oh, that smells like thyme.

574
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,600
I think. Maybe too much.

575
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,880
Made my icing.

576
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,800
Drizzly consistency.

577
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,680
Just could've done with
it being a bit thicker.

578
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,240
Control, control.

579
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,720
I just don't know what it's supposed
to look like, that's the thing.

580
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,040
Bakers, you've got one minute left.

581
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,240
Last bit. All right, let's
make this look pretty.

582
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,720
Lemon and thyme.

583
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,480
Oh, come on!

584
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,240
Going to use this very sparingly.

585
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,440
Just going to try and
make it look nice.

586
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,160
It's not that pretty,
but it's fine.

587
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,720
Quite rustic. That seems
to be my kind of thing.

588
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,280
OK, bakers, your time is up.

589
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,360
Please bring your lemon and thyme
drizzle cakes

590
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,200
up to the gingham table

591
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,840
and place them behind
your pictures.

592
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,440
My word! It was a race.

593
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,080
It's judgment time for

594
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,880
the bakers' lemon
and thyme drizzle cakes.

595
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,200
Prue and Paul are looking for
a light,

596
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,240
moist, aromatic cake decorated
with glace icing

597
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,600
and crystallised lemon and thyme.

598
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,800
And they have no idea
whose is whose.

599
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,120
PAUL: Interesting array.

600
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,280
The definition on this one is pretty
good.

601
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,240
It's got a strong colour. Very good.

602
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,520
Icing could've been a little thicker
or not allowed to run right off.

603
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,520
The crystallising looks OK,
doesn't it? Yeah.

604
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,400
There's a lot of drizzle.

605
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,680
The texture's very good
because it's very light.

606
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,440
It's not got enough thyme in it.

607
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,440
Moving on, little bit weird with
the colouring on this one.

608
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,600
See how light, dark, it's...

609
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,640
..it's like it hasn't
been mixed properly.

610
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,440
Quite an open-looking cake.

611
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,360
Far more lemon than thyme.

612
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,440
Which I don't mind.

613
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,600
I quite like the sharpness of
the lemon against the hint of thyme.

614
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,040
Hmm, yeah. I think I'd have put

615
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,120
a little bit more crystallised
lemon and thyme on top,

616
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,840
but it's very nice. Yeah, it is.

617
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,400
I like the decoration of this.
This is a thicker icing.

618
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,880
There's a few little marks here,
like it's caught. It's stuck.

619
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,160
Half the cake's probably
been left on the mould.

620
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,920
I can tell you now there's
not enough thyme in there.

621
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,680
Not a lot of lemon or thyme.

622
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,920
I think that texture's
a bit coarse too.

623
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
Hmm. A bit dark, this one.

624
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,200
It's almost overflowed on the top.
Overflowed.

625
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,720
And I really think the icing is
a bit clumsy.

626
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,560
Definitely getting the
thyme and the lemon.

627
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,800
A lot more thyme.

628
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,640
I do think it's slightly overbaked.

629
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,760
The icing on this is quite neat into
the grooves as well.

630
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,760
Quite clever because
the baker has put thyme in one

631
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,840
and lemon in the other. Yeah.

632
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,240
It's very neat.

633
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,240
Hmm, definitely getting the thyme
and the lemon, nice balance.

634
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,960
I think it's very good.

635
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,480
Moving on to this one,
bit irregular on colour. Hmm.

636
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,440
Darker on one side than
it is on another.

637
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,240
It's broken a bit here in
the mould.

638
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,640
The lemon isn't properly
crystallised. No. It's very raw.

639
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,680
I got more thyme than I did lemon.

640
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,760
Moving on to the last one.
I like the look of this.

641
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,280
Pretty neat on the baking as well.

642
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,400
I like the way the icing is confined
to small ribbons down the runnels.

643
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,320
I can see the thyme,
but I can't really taste it.

644
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,960
It could have a bit more.
It could have a bit more.

645
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,160
The lemon's tangy enough
and the bake's good.

646
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,440
The lemon and thyme drizzle cakes
will now be ranked from last

647
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,040
to first place.

648
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,720
In seventh place, we have this one.

649
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,320
Tasha, bit clumsy on the icing
and you had trouble with it,

650
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
getting out of a tin, didn't you?

651
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,240
In sixth spot, we have this one.

652
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,080
This is very irregular with
the colours.

653
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,240
Inside, it's too pale.

654
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,320
I don't know whether you had
problems with it sticking

655
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,440
to the tin or was it the bake?

656
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,920
No, I don't know! Hmm.

657
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,600
Saku is in fifth place,

658
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,680
Matty is fourth and Dan comes third.

659
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,640
In second, we have this one.
Whose is this?

660
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,400
Very nice, Josh. I like the icing,
I like the decoration,

661
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,480
I love the colour.

662
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,560
It needed a little bit more thyme,
but it's a nice one.

663
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,960
Which means...

664
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,760
..Cristy, I loved your decoration,
it's very elegant.

665
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,240
Lots of thyme, lots of lemon -
perfect. Thank you.

666
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,440
Well done! Well done.

667
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,920
Well done, bakers.

668
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,760
You've done so well.
Go home, have a little rest

669
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,680
and we'll see you tomorrow for the
Showstopper. Well done, kids.

670
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,280
I genuinely never thought I'd
get first in the Technical,

671
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,720
so, yeah, I'm over the moon! Ah!

672
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,240
I was hoping for a good technical,
but second to last, it's not last.

673
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,880
{\an1}SHE SIGHS

674
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,320
That was really bad.

675
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,800
Yeah, I can't lie, I feel
a bit sick about tomorrow.

676
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,400
I'm not ready to go home.

677
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,160
It's botanicals week so
did anybody really shine?

678
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,120
I think Cristy's in
a very strong position

679
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,160
for Star Baker again this week.

680
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,400
What about Tasha?

681
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,040
She did not do a good Technical,

682
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,800
but she did a tremendously good
Signature. She did.

683
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,560
Josh is doing quite well again,
isn't he?

684
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,160
Josh has done all right, which puts
him in line with Cristy,

685
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,920
but the likes of Dana, Matty are in
worse trouble than the rest.

686
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,960
Matty, why did he do so bad in
the Signature?

687
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,600
A bit boring. There
was not enough fruit in it. OK.

688
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,840
I didn't like Dana's signature.

689
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,360
The shapes were all wrong.

690
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,600
We wanted consistency
and we just didn't get it.

691
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,840
You've got to look at all of it -
texture, appearance, flavour,

692
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,200
technical prowess.

693
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,080
Any mistakes, you could go home.

694
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,520
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

695
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,600
It's time for your
Showstopper Challenge.

696
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,880
The judges would like you
to bake a beautiful

697
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,760
and imaginative floral dessert.

698
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,640
You can choose any style of dessert,

699
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,040
but it must include a significant
baked element

700
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,080
and you should celebrate florals
through your flavours and design.

701
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,320
Floral really is the key word.
It is.

702
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,160
Something you could serve at
a picnic or wear as

703
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,800
a headdress at Glastonbury.

704
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,480
You have four-and-a-half hours.

705
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,320
On your marks... Get set...

706
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,880
Bake!

707
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,040
Experimenting with different
floral flavours,

708
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,040
not really my comfort zone.

709
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,640
Anything that I can mess up on,
I tend to stay clear.

710
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,920
When you put elderflower in,
it sounds quite, like, potiony,

711
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,040
know what I mean? Harry Potter.

712
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,440
So we're asking the bakers
for a layered dessert.

713
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,880
We're talking jellies,
ganaches, bavarois,

714
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,240
mousse, biscuits,
anything they wish,

715
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,840
but we want it all to be
beautifully holding together.

716
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,800
Ah, stressful.

717
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,760
The overall flavour is floral.

718
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,680
The trouble with flowers is one
second, there's not enough flavour

719
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,040
and then you go over the top
and then they taste like soap.

720
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,240
Dandelion syrup.

721
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,080
It should taste incredible

722
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,680
and, of course, look like
a Bake Off Showstopper.

723
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,560
Hello, Dan. Good morning. Tell us
about your floral Showstopper.

724
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,280
It's a wild-flower meadow theme

725
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,640
and then I'm doing an opera-style
floral dessert.

726
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,000
When you say opera, how many layers
are you using there? Seven?

727
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,440
No, four layers of joconde.

728
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,480
So it's opera-style. Right. Are you
using chocolate at the top?

729
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,200
No, I'm putting, meadowsweet butter.

730
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,120
When you say opera... Yeah.

731
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,040
It's a layered dessert, how's that?
Yeah, that's it, that's better!

732
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,160
Dan's wild-flower meadow layered
dessert will include joconde sponges

733
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,560
flavoured with elderflower,

734
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,120
a dandelion jelly pond

735
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,640
with choux swans
and meadowsweet buttercream.

736
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,280
Meadowsweet. I've never heard of
that. Yeah, it's just like a local

737
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,360
foraged plant, sort of grows around
bogs, marshes. So you made this?

738
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,240
I've made that, yeah, yeah. You made
this? Oh, it's recognisable.

739
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,240
Yeah, it is, yeah. Like cat pee.

740
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,320
Yeah, that's the one, yeah.

741
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,800
I'm very impressed that you guys
know what cat pee tastes like.

742
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,880
Matty's taking his inspiration not
from wildlife...

743
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,160
I've got one of those shot things,

744
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,720
I don't know why I didn't think
to bring it. ..but nightlife.

745
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,960
More of a drink, innit?

746
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,600
When you put elderflower in
prosecco or something like that

747
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,680
with some blackberries in it,

748
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,640
it's a real masculine
drink I find as well,

749
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,920
so people look scared
when you're drinking it.

750
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,240
"I'll leave him alone."

751
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,920
Taking his cue from his favourite
summer tipple,

752
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,560
Matty's adding elderflower
into nearly every element

753
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,480
of his dessert, including his
blackberry mousse,

754
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,640
lemon cremeux, Genoise sponge
and blackberry mirror glaze.

755
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,560
Is it true about blackberries?

756
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,240
Being? The blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice? Is it true?

757
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,880
Is it true?

758
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,040
You tell me!

759
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,680
It's true.

760
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,440
Whatever complementary flavours
the bakers are using...

761
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,680
I am making cheesecake base
with ginger biscuit.

762
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,800
..their florals need to be
the star of the show.

763
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,680
Floral flavours are quite subtle

764
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,480
so I will use more hibiscus
to bring hibiscus flavour.

765
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,400
Want to get that tangy thing.

766
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,800
Hibiscus will flavour the mousse
and buttercream

767
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,040
of Saku's Earl Grey cheesecake,
which will sit on

768
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,560
a ginger biscuit base

769
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,160
and be topped with an
intricate 3D jelly flower.

770
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,640
I'm really worried about the jelly
art. I don't have artistic skills.

771
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,240
You say that.
You are really artistic.

772
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,520
Thank you very much. Baking's art.
Are you artistic?

773
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,640
Of course you are.

774
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,040
Who's your favourite artist?

775
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,920
Do you know Banksy? Yes, the one who
is painting, uh, buildings.

776
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,240
He sent me a letter once.

777
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,120
Really? Hmm. You're joking.

778
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,560
It just said "stop" in it.
Just "stop".

779
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,000
One baker who doesn't know when

780
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,280
to curb their artistic
ambitions is Tasha.

781
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,040
Hello, Tash. Hi, Tash.

782
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,600
Tell us all about your
floral Showstopper.

783
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,240
OK.

784
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,240
Ten layers. Ten.

785
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,880
Right, that's a bit ambitious.

786
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,280
OK. Here we go.

787
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,720
Amongst Tasha's ten layers will be
a palet Breton biscuit,

788
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,480
a bavarois, two sponges,

789
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,360
three different jellies
and a ruby chocolate mousse,

790
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,000
all flavoured with hibiscus
or elderflower.

791
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,920
These will be wrapped in
a hibiscus joconde sponge

792
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,760
and topped with jelly art.

793
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,480
Tasha, this is crazy.

794
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,720
Have you practised this?

795
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,360
If you pull it off,
it will be fantastic.

796
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,880
I'm really looking forward to this.

797
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,960
Yeah. Thank you.

798
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,240
Amongst their layers must be
a substantial baked element.

799
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,840
I'm going to rattle through four
joconde sponges.

800
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,120
And the bakers won't be able

801
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,960
to begin assembling their
spectacular Showstoppers...

802
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Oh, come on, Josh.

803
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,040
..until their sponges and biscuits
are baked and completely cool.

804
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,840
It's like the flipping
Baking Olympics today.

805
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,200
Trying to get the ginger biscuit
base sorted.

806
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,840
These are going in.

807
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,040
That's good and spongy
so I'm happy with that.

808
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,240
This is a really nice,
light trifle sponge.

809
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,120
So I am doing a russe,
like Charlotte russe,

810
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,160
so it's going to have sponge
fingers round the outside

811
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,560
and it's going to have two sponge
layers in the actual cake as well.

812
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,480
As well as his sponges,
Josh's russe will contain

813
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,200
a compote, jellies and two bavarois,

814
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,840
flavoured with combinations of

815
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,800
raspberry, rhubarb and hibiscus.

816
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,280
Hibiscus is one of those flowers
that I used to grow with my nan.

817
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,760
We used to do competitions actually.

818
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,720
We'd have hibiscus plants
in our conservatories

819
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,040
and we'd see who could grow the
most hibiscus flowers on there.

820
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,280
Usually, she'd get up to 12 or 15
all on at once. It's amazing.

821
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,240
Dana's also using hibiscus,

822
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,440
but is pairing it with
floral powerhouse, rose.

823
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,240
Rose has actually got quite
a strong taste to it.

824
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,800
I just want the full-on flavour.

825
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,000
I don't want any criticism that
they can't taste the components.

826
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,520
{\an8}Rose will feature in
her raspberry bavarois

827
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,680
{\an8}and white chocolate mousse,
which she'll complement with

828
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,760
{\an8}a hibiscus jelly and coconut sponge.

829
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,960
Her finished dessert will sit inside
an ambitious sugarwork box.

830
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,880
I am just layering this up
with edible flowers

831
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,520
and then I'm putting
isomalt over the top.

832
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,000
I do like this. Do ya?
Yeah, I love it.

833
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,320
I actually went out with a girl who
put flowers in resin. Yeah.

834
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,840
It's reminding me of that. Well,
that's kind of like the inspiration

835
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,920
I went off. You know when you see
so many videos on TikTok

836
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,720
of it all going through? Yeah. So
are you endlessly watching baking?

837
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,640
Do you know what? I start off
watching baking stuff

838
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,040
and then somehow I've ended up

839
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,440
watching, like, shark attacks
or something like that.

840
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,120
I get loads of shark stuff! Do you?

841
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,240
What is it about me and you
that they went... What is it?

842
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,800
.."These guys are going to
love shark attacks"? Yeah!

843
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,800
One baker who could be heading
into deep water is Cristy,

844
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,120
who's the only one to
use an intricate mould

845
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,480
for her floral dessert.

846
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,120
So this is my mould.

847
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,240
It's risky cos it's
very textured.

848
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,080
If I get it right,
the pay-off, I think, will be nice.

849
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,720
It's so effective.

850
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,320
Cristy's moulded entremets
will contain lemon

851
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,440
and elderflower Genoise sponge,

852
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,800
creme diplomat and two jellies -

853
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,200
strawberry and elderflower,

854
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,520
and rhubarb and basil -

855
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,640
all encased in a

856
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,520
white chocolate ganache.

857
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,080
White chocolate? Yeah.

858
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,040
Does it work? You look worried.

859
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,480
It's quite warm today.

860
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,120
It's really hot. And you're using a
white chocolate ganache... Yeah.

861
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,360
..moulded on the top. If you get
that chocolate ganache out of

862
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,160
the mould intact, it'll look very
pretty. I think it sounds good.

863
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,520
Good. Good luck. Thank you!
Good luck, Cristy.

864
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,200
Bakers, you are halfway through
this mamm-ooth challenge.

865
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,560
Beautiful. No messing around.

866
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
{\an1}SHE SIGHS

867
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,880
Let me just check.

868
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,000
I'll take it out. Looks all right.

869
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,400
Sponge fingers.

870
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,880
Yeah, they're good. Very good.

871
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,240
Ow.

872
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,480
{\an1}BLEEP

873
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,880
Ahh...

874
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,600
That was t'wrong thing
to do, weren't it?

875
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,040
Now it's going to the fridge.

876
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,680
With their baked elements cooling...

877
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,320
Shouldn't be tough.
If it's tough, it's game over.

878
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,720
..or being remade...

879
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,920
I love making things twice, yeah.

880
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,600
..the bakers can finish making
the other elements of their dessert.

881
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,760
I've got my strawberry
jelly started.

882
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,600
But whether they're
making jellies...

883
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,520
My pond jelly, that needs
two gelatine leaves going in.

884
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,720
..mousses...

885
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,720
Hibiscus mousse.
It needs lots of setting.

886
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,840
..or custards...

887
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,240
This is the elderflower cremeux.

888
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,000
..the amount of setting agent
will be crucial to ensure

889
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,760
a melt-in-the-mouth texture
and clearly defined layers.

890
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,040
Just mixed in my gelatine.

891
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,000
Don't want it to taste
unpleasant, like rubber.

892
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,480
It could act as a bouncy ball.

893
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,440
Some of the layers are going to be
a little bit looser than

894
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,960
the rest, but as well, at the
same time, I want everything,

895
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,240
when you cut into it,
nothing's oozing out.

896
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,320
I feel like you need
another seven benches

897
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,920
with all these ingredients.
What's going on?

898
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,040
Why have you created
something so elaborate?

899
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,600
I'm the person that I shout
at when I watch it on TV.

900
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,360
As we were.

901
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,280
I might do another one actually!

902
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,200
Bakers, you have one hour left.

903
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,400
{\an1}SHE SIGHS

904
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,600
Going to start building.

905
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,760
Supposed to look like an
entremet so, like, layers

906
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,920
so there's a lot of setting.

907
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,760
Building their floral
masterpieces...

908
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,360
I just need a really thin layer.

909
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,320
Oh, sugar!

910
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,920
Right, happy with that.

911
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,200
..will require expert use of
the fridge and freezer.

912
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,600
Might have to break this mould.
It's just set so firm.

913
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,440
Too long at low temperatures

914
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,840
and their delicate sponges
could dry out.

915
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,720
Think it's frozen solid.

916
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,000
But not enough time chilling,
and their jellies and creams

917
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,200
could fail to set,
resulting in a sloppy mess.

918
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,000
Oh, I don't want to make
a mess for everybody.

919
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,760
Just basically leaked.

920
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,000
That looks amazing. Yes, well...

921
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,240
What are you going to do with that?
Put it in the freezer?

922
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,320
You just pop that baby in
the freezer.

923
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,480
Not a baby.
No-one puts baby in the freezer!

924
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,920
That's a joke for
Patrick Swayze fans.

925
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,560
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

926
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,560
Just half an hour.

927
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,640
Oh, man.

928
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,680
Half an hour, hopefully might just
make it.

929
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,560
Right, next step, next step. Fab.

930
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,760
Nice and even layers.

931
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,480
It's set. I mean, I could probably
leave it in for longer.

932
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,440
I don't know why I'm not.

933
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,720
Could you just hold it steady
while I just peel off this?

934
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
Yeah, course I can.
Thank you. I just need to peel this.

935
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,320
Jelly just basically leaked.
It's going to crack.

936
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,640
Got my cream sorted
for my choux buns.

937
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,640
This is the cooled-down
mirror glaze

938
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,040
so it just covers it a bit better.

939
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,960
I don't know if it's set enough.

940
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,520
I can feel something not good.

941
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,560
Really?
SHE SIGHS

942
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,640
Breathe. Trust your instincts.

943
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,080
I sound like Obi-Wan now. I'm Yoda.

944
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,800
{\an8}It is lifting off. Hmm, trust
your instincts, young Jedi!

945
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,120
{\an8}Oh! Yes?

946
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,640
{\an8}It's broken. It's broken? It's
broken. You can fix that, can't you?

947
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,560
{\an8}I'm going to...
No, it's broken everywhere.

948
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,960
{\an8}Oh, my gosh.

949
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,800
{\an8}I'm going to have to redo it.

950
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,840
I mean, literally, freeze it
and remake it. You can do it.

951
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,200
I'm just going to have to.

952
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,960
Oh, I'm going to cry my eyes out.

953
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,240
OK, just breathe.

954
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,800
Oh, bless her.

955
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,080
Babes, don't worry.

956
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,480
Babe, you've got Star Baker.

957
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,200
I just... Hello? I'm really hot,

958
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,400
I'm really hot. I know.

959
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,080
All right, cool down, cool down.

960
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,160
I'm really upset.

961
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,600
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

962
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,800
I'll be all right.

963
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,960
All right, do you need any help?

964
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,160
No, no, no, I'm all right.
Thank you, Dan.

965
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,120
All right.I'm fine, I'm fine.
SHE SNIFFS

966
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,040
Now, the next nervous task is
the jelly domes.

967
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,560
I'm going to do my
jelly art in these.

968
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,720
They're actually crystallisation
dishes that I'd have in

969
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,840
the chemistry lab.

970
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,360
I'm super nervous for this.

971
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,320
Choux swans haven't turned out
as choux swans unfortunately.

972
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,400
Come on.

973
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,160
Oh, it's wobbling, just like jelly.

974
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,280
{\an1}SHE GASPS

975
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,480
I don't know if it's right.

976
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,040
Something might be right
with the mixture.

977
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,960
Oh, my gosh,
I can't even look at that.

978
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,240
When I did this in practice,
it collapsed.

979
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,520
{\an1}SHE GASPS

980
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,920
I screwed up the first jelly
so I need to do another one.

981
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,720
This is not good.

982
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,040
Wouldn't really imagine that
I'd be standing here talking

983
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,960
to you while you make delicate
pink rose flowers.

984
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,800
No, at the turn of the year,

985
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,600
I didn't think this would
be a thing either.

986
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,240
Nothing's going to set...

987
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,800
It's just not...

988
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,080
It's just too...
It's just too, erm... Oh...

989
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,920
{\an8}I'm just trying to think of this
gap. Yeah. Is that stuck on already?

990
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,160
{\an8}Oh. See, now that's cracked. Yeah.

991
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,320
{\an7}SHE GASPS

992
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,120
{\an8}Holy mackerel. Oh, my God.

993
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,800
I'm going to take the top off.

994
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,240
This is such a disaster. Oh...

995
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,600
How long have we got left?

996
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,160
BOTH: Bakers, you have five minutes
left.

997
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,080
Need to dig deep now, gear six.

998
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,640
Oh, my goodness me, perfection.

999
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,880
Can't have 'em eating this.
They can't...

1000
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,560
HE SIGHS
Right, I'm going to slide it.

1001
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,240
Gentle, gentle movements.

1002
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,680
This is where you could with being

1003
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,520
artistic and I am far from.

1004
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,480
Just going to have to risk it,
aren't we?

1005
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,320
Please don't split, please don't
split, please don't split.

1006
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,720
Oh, my God.

1007
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,680
Don't know if it's going to slide.

1008
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,840
Oh, dear.

1009
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,440
I don't have steady hands.

1010
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,680
Oh, I broke it.

1011
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,760
{\an1}SHE MOANS

1012
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,240
Bakers, you have one minute left.
One minute.

1013
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,320
I'm just going to try...
Don't break.

1014
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,280
I just can't believe it.

1015
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,200
{\an1}SHE EXHALES

1016
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,520
I've got something out.

1017
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,160
That's great! You did it!

1018
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,000
It's better than it was, isn't it?

1019
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,280
Come on, Josh.

1020
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,920
Oh, I just feel like
the top looks a bit cack.

1021
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,160
OK, just breathe.

1022
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,440
I feel like if it moves,
it's going to break.

1023
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,720
I don't know what I could do.

1024
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,480
Anything I do now'd
just look random.

1025
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,160
It looks beautiful,
but I broke a little bit.

1026
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,560
Oh, my God.

1027
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,240
Bakers, your time is up.

1028
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,880
Please step away from
your Showstoppers.

1029
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,760
Just don't think...

1030
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,720
It just looks a bit like...
I don't know.

1031
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,360
The whole thing bloody cracked

1032
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,040
and I got it done in, like, two
minutes to go. No, it's fine.

1033
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,480
It's time for the bakers'
show-stopping floral desserts

1034
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,160
to face judgment.

1035
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,280
Tasha, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

1036
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,360
I love the look of this.
It's so professional,

1037
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,120
I love the jelly on the top.

1038
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,920
The line down there's not the best
thing,

1039
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,120
but you're always going to get that

1040
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,520
and there's always going to be a
break.

1041
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,400
And there's occasionally a bit of
jelly runs out. A bit of leakage.

1042
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,440
Yeah.

1043
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,120
That jelly looks lovely.
It doesn't look too rubbery.

1044
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,480
It looks really as if it's
collapsing, which is lovely.

1045
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,960
Wow.

1046
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,000
Hmm, it's absolutely heavenly.

1047
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,480
Raspberry and hibiscus - you know,
that is the most delicious flavour.

1048
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,840
Really good elderflower.

1049
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,200
The bitterness that you initially
get probably from

1050
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,200
the hibiscus balances beautifully
with everything else.

1051
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,040
If you can manage to
fit it all in your mouth -

1052
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,040
and fortunately I have a large
mouth - it means you get all

1053
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,280
the flavours together, which is what
you wanted to achieve,

1054
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,600
and you end up with something
that's beautiful so well done.

1055
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,640
It's a triumph. Well done, Tasha.

1056
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,760
Thank you.

1057
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,040
It's very pretty.

1058
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,640
It's very Bake Off in the
sense of it's very pastel,

1059
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,680
which suits the tent beautifully.

1060
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,920
Your flowers and your jelly work is
really beautiful.

1061
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,360
Distinctive lines,
distinctive colour.

1062
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,600
Very good texture.

1063
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,320
Just set, which is what you want.

1064
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,640
Thank you.

1065
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,200
The ginger is the
overwhelming flavour.

1066
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,200
I'm not getting much
flavour in anything else.

1067
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,560
I mean, I'm hunting for anything.

1068
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,880
Is this raspberry?

1069
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,280
That is hibiscus.

1070
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,720
Hmm. Hmm.

1071
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,160
It's so mild. You need to
carry a big punch in this

1072
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,320
to make it work. OK.

1073
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:33,480
All your textures are spot-on,
but your flavours are lacking.

1074
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,240
I'm so sorry.

1075
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,600
Thank you, Saku. Thank you, Saku.

1076
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,840
It's certainly imaginative!

1077
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,560
It left the edges exposed,
which I quite like cos that...

1078
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,280
Oh, do you? I think that's where
you are, like an opera cake.

1079
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,880
Very nice, even layers.

1080
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,560
I never thought I'd say this,

1081
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,360
but I think there's actually
too much floral.

1082
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,600
OK. It's very perfumed.

1083
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,320
It's mostly elderflower that's
the strongest, isn't it? Yeah.

1084
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,720
Hmm, that's really sharp.

1085
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,280
Probably too sharp for what this is.

1086
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,440
I get the meadowsweet as well.

1087
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,680
It's a bit like freshly cut grass,
you know? Yeah.

1088
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,160
It's got that flavour.

1089
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,640
There is certainly a strong
botanical feel to this,

1090
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,960
which is what we wanted.
Very good choux too.

1091
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,440
Yeah, well done. Overall, I
think you've done a decent job.

1092
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,840
Brilliant, thank you. Thank you.

1093
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,080
Thank you very much, cheers.
Well done, Dan.

1094
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,000
Whether it's a Showstopper,
I'm not sure.

1095
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,320
Yeah. I'm not so sure.

1096
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,480
The flowers actually would've been
better if you'd done

1097
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,200
a pile and then sort
of cascaded it down.

1098
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,880
Yeah, they're a little
like soldiers in a row.

1099
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,160
Let's have a look and see
what it's like inside.

1100
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,880
Aha.

1101
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,720
Ooh!

1102
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,480
You've got your layers
nicely separated.

1103
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,640
Yeah, the lemon, has that got
elderflower with it as well?

1104
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,920
Yeah. It's not very strong.

1105
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,200
It doesn't quite meet
the botanical brief.

1106
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,000
One feels it's a lemon cake.

1107
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,600
I think your custard layer is too
stodgy and a bit rubbery.

1108
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,680
It's very rubbery.

1109
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,280
It is delicious,
but it isn't a Showstopper.

1110
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,200
Thank you. Thank you. Cheers.

1111
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,360
Well done, Matty. Well done, Matty.
Thank you.

1112
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,520
It's beautiful. It looks great.

1113
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,520
Oh, thank you. It has split, that's
the only thing on the outside.

1114
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,680
It does look very pretty.

1115
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,080
I love the work here on the top.

1116
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,520
Very skilful injecting.

1117
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,600
Come on, come on. Wobble, wobble.

1118
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,160
Look at that.

1119
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,280
The setting of this is spot-on.

1120
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,920
You've managed to get each of
the layers there without too much

1121
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,720
rubber in each layer so they've held
together, just about.

1122
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,200
The flavours are spot-on.

1123
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,320
And I think the compote
is beautiful.

1124
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,400
Great flavours, great textures,
great overall look.

1125
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,680
Shame it's split, but...
Just needed a ribbon.

1126
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,640
I think, overall, you've done
a great job. Well done.

1127
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,800
Lovely. Thank you.

1128
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,400
Well, Dana, you've certainly got
something of

1129
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,840
a Showstopper just in the box.

1130
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,320
It looks amazing. All those flowers
are beautifully done,

1131
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,400
but the main thing is the dessert.

1132
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,280
Let's have a quick
look inside this.

1133
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,440
Oh, wow.

1134
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,320
Wow, look at those.

1135
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,200
Pretty stark colours, them.

1136
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,440
I'm not sure I'm getting the floral.

1137
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,280
OK. Not getting the rose.
A bit of a hibiscus. Hmm.

1138
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,360
The raspberry comes through
more than the hibiscus.

1139
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,440
Hibiscus. Yeah.

1140
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,920
The sponge has dried out like it's
been sitting there for three days...

1141
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,360
Mm-hm. ..because you've been putting
that in the fridge for so long.

1142
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,760
The cake is pretty solid
and the layers are too thick.

1143
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,200
Overall, your appearance
is exceptional,

1144
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,840
but is it style above substance?

1145
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,080
Thank you.

1146
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,920
Be honest, I... It was all going
well, everything was set...

1147
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,480
Stop. OK.

1148
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,320
I think it's quite effective.
I like the colour.

1149
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,360
These are quite nice.
There's a couple of little splodges.

1150
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,120
Obviously you've had issues with it.

1151
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,400
I am getting strong strawberry

1152
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,040
and I am getting a decent amount
of tang coming from the elderflower,

1153
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,840
which is your saving grace because
then it makes it floral.

1154
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,360
The sponge is all right as well.

1155
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,200
Setting, it's just a little bit
messy, that's all. OK.

1156
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,400
I feel really sorry for you

1157
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,560
because you were obviously nearly
into something perfect,

1158
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,360
but I think with
your second attempt,

1159
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,840
your chocolate ganache is
too much and too thick,

1160
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,040
and the layers are
a bit all over the place,

1161
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,880
but it's still very delicious.

1162
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,960
Thank God, it's over!

1163
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,040
I've seen people throw stuff in
the bin before.

1164
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,760
I was determined I wasn't
going to be one of 'em!

1165
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,760
I'm relieved.

1166
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,400
I'll take that any day over what
could've been an absolute nightmare.

1167
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,680
I do think I'm in
the bottom side of things,

1168
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,960
but even if some of
the inside fillings weren't

1169
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,440
the best, I'm beyond proud of it.

1170
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,160
I fell right at the last hurdle in
terms of making it look like

1171
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,120
the Showstopper it was meant to be.

1172
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,280
They couldn't taste anything.

1173
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,760
Look at my face for the last time -
I'm going home tonight.

1174
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,800
So, Prue and Paul,

1175
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,000
botanicals week - how do you think
it went?

1176
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,640
Surprisingly well.
It's actually been quite successful.

1177
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,680
I think the bakes have all been
pretty good

1178
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,560
so when it comes to judging, it
comes down to little things.

1179
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,120
Who were the stand-out people
for you?

1180
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,360
Josh - the textures were right, the
flavours were terrific, the whole

1181
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,200
thing was quite imaginative and
it was beautifully executed. Hmm.

1182
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,400
I have to say, I was blown away
by Tasha.

1183
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,680
I think Tasha started well this
week actually.

1184
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,120
She didn't do too well in the
technical,

1185
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,280
she was seventh, but she has bounced
back in a big way today

1186
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,720
so it puts her in line
for Star Baker as well.

1187
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,640
And then you look at Cristy - she
had a bit of a mess-up with this,

1188
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,920
but, nevertheless, it did taste good
and it looked good.

1189
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,280
At least she carried on.

1190
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,000
Exactly, she never gave up.
I love that.

1191
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,320
I think three people struggled.

1192
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,560
I think Matty struggled.

1193
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,720
It wasn't quite polished enough
and finished,

1194
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,800
and a little bit simple,
but then you look at Dana.

1195
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,240
I mean, the box was OK...

1196
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,480
I thought it was amazing.

1197
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,480
It was a Showstopper, but then the
dessert inside had to be perfect.

1198
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,800
Is what it was all about, yeah.

1199
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,120
The cake was too thick, a bit dry.

1200
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,920
Yeah. And then Saku.

1201
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,680
Hardly any flavour. Such a shame,
isn't it? Oh, heartbreaking.

1202
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,680
But that's not like her either,
which is strange. No. No.

1203
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,360
No. I think it's going
to be really tight,

1204
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,000
whoever we choose to go home today.

1205
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,680
It's only one today though,
isn't it?

1206
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,240
Yeah, only one today.

1207
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,400
Paul wants to send
three people home!

1208
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,520
{\an1}LAUGHTER

1209
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,760
Well done, bakers. You did
fantastic in botanicals week.

1210
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,680
I've got the great job this
week of announcing Star Baker.

1211
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,800
And this week's Star Baker is...

1212
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,520
..Josh.

1213
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,080
And unfortunately,
I've got the job that no-one wants

1214
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,320
and I've got to say,

1215
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,560
this has been one of the hardest
decisions of the competition so far.

1216
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:29,120
So, the baker leaving
the tent today is...

1217
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,800
..Dana.

1218
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,360
Thank you.

1219
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,080
Sorry, Dana. No, it's OK.
It was not your week.

1220
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,160
I feel like I've smashed it.
Week six.

1221
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,120
Dana, you've been amazing.
Oh, thanks, pal.

1222
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,440
I'm going to miss you so much.

1223
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,160
I'm just kind of thinking of all
the fun that I've had throughout

1224
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,720
the whole six weeks and that's
what I'm going to be remembering.

1225
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,560
Oh, my God, Josh, well done.

1226
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,960
You did so, so well.

1227
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,360
I don't even know what to say.
It's incredible.

1228
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,360
Yeah. I can't wait to tell my mum.

1229
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,840
Well done, pal. You deserve that.

1230
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,880
You've been knocking on
the door for it. Crazy.

1231
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,240
Well done, pal. Well done.

1232
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,640
I've got some news to
share with you. Yeah?

1233
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,800
I'm Star Baker for this week.

1234
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,240
Yes!

1235
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,760
{\an1}SHE CHEERS AND LAUGHS

1236
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,000
Oh, thank you so much.

1237
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,240
Through, yeah.

1238
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,000
Probably a little bit by the
skin of the teeth...but through.

1239
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,520
Phew.

1240
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,720
And now I'm going to have to ask
for annual leave from my manager.

1241
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,400
That's my worry!

1242
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,920
Tomorrow morning, email,
"Charlotte, I want more time off."

1243
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,480
Charlotte will climb walls!

1244
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,440
Next time, it's dessert week...

1245
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,680
I'm pooing myself. ..and the bakers
face a wobbly Signature Bake...

1246
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,000
It's jiggly. She's jiggly.

1247
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,880
..the sloppiest technical
the tent has ever seen...

1248
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,200
My gosh, they can't eat this.
They're going to get ill.

1249
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,360
..and it's bombs away
in the Showstopper.

1250
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,120
It lives up to its name of a bomb.

1251
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,800
Who will be the queen
or the king of puddings?

1252
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,600
That is a proper dessert inside.

1253
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,880
And who will get
their just deserts?

1254
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,840
Oh, my gosh, what have I done?

1255
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,320
This is a car crash!

1256
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,360
