1
00:00:02,163 --> 00:00:04,458
I think we've nailed this.
Hey, Paul check this out.

2
00:00:04,483 --> 00:00:06,418
Listen, for biscuit week Noel and |

3
00:00:06,443 --> 00:00:09,618
have created this digestive that you
can keep dunking in your cuppa

4
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:11,498
and it don't break off!
Look at that!

5
00:00:11,523 --> 00:00:13,818
Incredible.
We're taking it to Dragons' Den.

6
00:00:13,843 --> 00:00:15,578
We've been doing this for 45 minutes

7
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:17,378
and it's still holding strong,
innit?

8
00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:19,258
That's amazing. But what's in it?

9
00:00:19,283 --> 00:00:22,658
The usual - flour, sugar
and a secret ingredient.

10
00:00:22,683 --> 00:00:24,938
A very thin layer of concrete.

11
00:00:24,963 --> 00:00:26,058
God!

12
00:00:27,483 --> 00:00:29,378
Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

13
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:30,858
Do you think we'll get a handshake?

14
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:32,298
I'm not so sure, let's go. Ruined.

15
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,258
Last time...

16
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:37,698
Why this is doing to me?

17
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:40,738
our 12 new bakers went wild
for cake...

18
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:43,098
I don't know if that's going to
freak out the judges.

19
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:45,658
"Hi, Rowan, what have you made?"
"A dead lobster."

20
00:00:45,683 --> 00:00:47,938
whilst Cristy and Abbi impressed.

21
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:49,578
You've done a really good job, Abbi.

22
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:51,178
Thank you very much.

23
00:00:51,203 --> 00:00:53,938
Dan's family dog Bruno fetched him
Star Baker...

24
00:00:53,963 --> 00:00:55,658
Nice one, Bruno!

25
00:00:55,683 --> 00:00:57,138
Here we go, Norman.

26
00:00:57,163 --> 00:00:59,458
and although Nicky and Tasha
faced extinction...

27
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:01,738
I don't like that, Tasha.

28
00:01:01,763 --> 00:01:03,338
I love it!

29
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,698
it was Amos...

30
00:01:04,723 --> 00:01:06,098
Piece of poo.

31
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:07,658
who had to leave the tent.

32
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:08,818
This time...

33
00:01:09,923 --> 00:01:11,578
the bakers battle biscuits...

34
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:13,498
Abbi, get a bit closer.

35
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:15,778
with a nostalgic signature...

36
00:01:15,803 --> 00:01:16,818
Marshmallow time.

37
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,338
a tricky technical...

38
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:20,138
I'm probably doing it wrong.

39
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,938
and show stopping
illusion biscuit banquets.

40
00:01:22,963 --> 00:01:24,418
Chuff tog heck.

41
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:26,338
Everybody's is so realistic.

42
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:28,898
Who will bask in biscuit brilliance?

43
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:31,218
That is fantastic.
It's so good!

44
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:32,378
And whose cookie...

45
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:33,538
Cristy?

46
00:01:33,563 --> 00:01:34,738
has finally crumbled?

47
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:36,738
Have you used my biscuit dough?

48
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,858
You have.

49
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:01,218
I'm well buzzing.

50
00:02:01,243 --> 00:02:03,218
It's proper nice, innit,
just to get back?

51
00:02:03,243 --> 00:02:05,538
I saw those three peaks
and I thought,

52
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:07,818
I'm happy I'm at home. It's nice.

53
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:09,098
Here we go again.

54
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:12,258
Last week was very stressful
but it's a new week,

55
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:14,178
it's a new day, it's a new dawn.

56
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:15,978
Biscuits is completely different
to cakes.

57
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:18,058
I make shortbread quite a lot.

58
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,778
It's one of those recipes where you
get quite a lot of plaudits

59
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:23,578
compared to the amount of effort
that you put in.

60
00:02:26,243 --> 00:02:29,578
Good to see you, bakers.
Welcome to Biscuit Week.

61
00:02:29,603 --> 00:02:32,578
Now, for your Signature Challenge
the judges would like you to make

62
00:02:32,603 --> 00:02:36,378
a batch of 12 identical
marshmallow biscuits.

63
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:38,778
Inspired by childhood favourites

64
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:41,298
like the tea cake
or the Wagon Wheel,

65
00:02:41,323 --> 00:02:44,058
the judges are looking for
delicious biscuits

66
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,938
either topped or sandwiched
with perfectly set marshmallow.

67
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:50,298
Now, you've probably noticed that
these biscuits,

68
00:02:50,323 --> 00:02:52,858
they're a lot smaller than they
used to be when we were kids.

69
00:02:52,883 --> 00:02:55,458
Well, this is your chance
to right that wrong.

70
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:58,258
There's nothing stopping you from
making your biscuit

71
00:02:58,283 --> 00:03:00,138
absolutely massive,
like Noel's head.

72
00:03:01,843 --> 00:03:03,578
We're looking for dustbin lids, OK?

73
00:03:03,603 --> 00:03:08,818
Now, the shape, the flavours and
the design is entirely up to you.

74
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:10,338
You've got two and a half hours.

75
00:03:10,363 --> 00:03:12,098
On your marks... Get set...

76
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:13,218
Bake!

77
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:19,978
Marshmallow biscuits isn't something
I've had for a really long time.

78
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:23,218
There's only one marshmallow biscuit
as far as I'm concerned

79
00:03:23,243 --> 00:03:26,778
and it's a Tunnock's tea cake.
My days.

80
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:30,378
Marshmallow biscuits. Now,
this goes back to our childhood.

81
00:03:30,403 --> 00:03:32,978
For me, it was the Wagon Wheel.
It was just the best thing ever.

82
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:36,338
Marshmallow is quite mild in flavour
and sweet.

83
00:03:36,363 --> 00:03:39,338
So you need something that lifts it,
like citrusy jam

84
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:41,858
or something with a bit of acidity
will help.

85
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:43,418
It's about decoration, as well,

86
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:46,058
because although it should be
relatively simple

87
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,658
to create the biscuits and the
marshmallow, it's about decoration.

88
00:03:49,683 --> 00:03:52,978
It's got to look good,
it's got to look shop made.

89
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:57,058
Good morning, Dana. Hello, good
morning. How are you? Hello, Dana.

90
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,778
Dana, tell us about your
signature marshmallow biscuit.

91
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:03,218
I am doing a speculoos.

92
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,658
Lovely. Marshmallow biscuit

93
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:07,498
that's got a lot of ginger, cloves,
mixed spice, a bit of everything.

94
00:04:07,523 --> 00:04:08,658
Lovely.

95
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:10,498
Dana's love of spices comes from

96
00:04:10,523 --> 00:04:13,378
the Indian dishes her mum Chhaya
taught her growing up.

97
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:15,658
That's a lovely golden colour.

98
00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:17,138
Almost burnt colour.

99
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:19,058
It's not burnt, Mum!

100
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,458
Sitting on top of her
spiced biscuit,

101
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:25,178
Dana's vanilla marshmallow and
speculoos biscuit butter cream

102
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:26,978
will be set in an intricate mould.

103
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:28,298
They're beautiful.

104
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:30,658
It's been a bit of a challenge
demoulding it. Yeah.

105
00:04:30,683 --> 00:04:32,979
But as long as I've got enough time
to get it in the fridge

106
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:34,258
for a good half hour.

107
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:36,579
It needs to be rock solid for me
to get it out of the mould.

108
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:37,938
So that's what I'm hoping for.

109
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:39,338
I'm looking forward to this one.

110
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,658
Me, too!
Can't wait to have one myself.

111
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:42,978
That's perfect. Right...

112
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:45,018
Those who have chosen
to make teacakes

113
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:48,178
will be using moulds to create
the classic chocolate dome

114
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:49,978
which will hold the marshmallow.

115
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:51,658
Let me just wiggle them around.

116
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:53,658
The outside will be nice and smooth

117
00:04:53,683 --> 00:04:56,538
because it's moulded into
the dome shape, thankfully.

118
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,418
I'm probably a little bit envious

119
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:00,778
of the people who have got moulds,
but hey-ho,

120
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:02,778
I made the decision to go
for Wagon Wheels

121
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,498
and when I've made them at home
people have liked it.

122
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:07,418
Keith likes to doorstep
his neighbours

123
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:09,258
looking for feedback on his bakes,

124
00:05:09,283 --> 00:05:11,578
which has earned him the nickname
Needy Ned.

125
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,778
That's delicious.

126
00:05:12,803 --> 00:05:15,258
I'm relieved.

127
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:17,938
Today he'll be recreating
the all-American

128
00:05:17,963 --> 00:05:21,378
peanut butter and jelly sandwich
in Wagon Wheel form.

129
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:24,058
Now, a little birdy told me
you was into stand-up.

130
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,178
I... I did a bit of stand-up for
a few years about 20 years ago.

131
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:28,538
And was you good?

132
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:30,858
I wasn't good enough to go...
to go full time.

133
00:05:30,883 --> 00:05:32,178
Give me your best gag. Come on.

134
00:05:32,203 --> 00:05:34,578
The best gag that you...
You've got to get me rolling.

135
00:05:34,603 --> 00:05:37,219
I can't. Because... Come on,
everyone wants to hear Alison's laugh!

136
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:39,098
Then you might find out
I'm funnier than Noel.

137
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:41,818
No, go on. And then what happens?
Go on, go on. It doesn't work!

138
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:43,018
What you got? Come on!

139
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,938
Buk-buk-buk-buk-buk!
Come on, you can...

140
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:46,818
BEEPING You've got something.

141
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:50,298
No. What's... what's the joke that
used to get everyone straight away?

142
00:05:50,323 --> 00:05:51,578
Shall I stop that, babe?

143
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:52,938
BEEPING STOPS
♪S

144
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:54,498
Um...
What's that timer for?

145
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:56,858
You... That's time for the
interview to end.

146
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:03,258
Morning Dan. Good morning.
Hello, Dan. How we doing? Hello.

147
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:04,738
Reigning Star Baker.

148
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:06,258
Yes, indeed.

149
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,578
Tell us about your signature.

150
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:11,178
Yes, so it's my son's
birthday tomorrow.

151
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:13,138
So these flavours are based
on the three things

152
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,138
that he basically lives on
every day,

153
00:06:15,163 --> 00:06:17,498
which is chocolate, bananas
and peanut butter. Wow.

154
00:06:17,523 --> 00:06:20,098
What a healthy diet for a child!
Perfect diet, yeah.

155
00:06:20,123 --> 00:06:22,618
Can I help? You can do, mate, yeah.
Yay!

156
00:06:22,643 --> 00:06:24,938
Four-year-old Sam
and his older brother Rory

157
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:26,898
love to help Dad in the kitchen,

158
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:29,658
especially when there are bowls
to be cleaned.

159
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:32,018
You've got it all down
the front of you already.

160
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:34,378
Covered in dark chocolate,
his peanut biscuits

161
00:06:34,403 --> 00:06:36,698
will sandwich layers
of peanut butter ganache

162
00:06:36,723 --> 00:06:38,058
and banana marshmallow.

163
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,538
Have you practised this a lot?

164
00:06:39,563 --> 00:06:41,258
Yeah, I've done it three times,
yeah.

165
00:06:41,283 --> 00:06:42,818
Where do you find the time?

166
00:06:42,843 --> 00:06:45,698
Soon as the kids are in bed, that's
when I start doing it. Really? Yeah.

167
00:06:45,723 --> 00:06:48,018
And you want to bake, the kids'I
never go to bed right?

168
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:49,298
No, they don't, no. No.

169
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:50,978
And they come in,
especially going...

170
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:53,338
"Can I help, dad?"
"Yeah, of course you can, mate!"

171
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:55,138
And then just, like,
knock a bowl over,

172
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:58,098
spill a load of flour all over the
place and clear off.

173
00:06:58,123 --> 00:07:00,658
Chimpanzees' tea party.
Totally, yeah.

174
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,538
I'm making rose teacakes
and these are for my nan.

175
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:07,858
My nanny June,
she's not with us any more

176
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:08,978
but she loved roses

177
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:13,618
and so they're going to have, like,
little roses painted into the shell.

178
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:17,578
Nanny June might be the
inspiration for Cristy's teacakes

179
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,258
but it's her youngest daughter
Sienna

180
00:07:19,283 --> 00:07:21,738
who's been helping Mum
perfect the recipe.

181
00:07:21,763 --> 00:07:23,658
Good girl. Keep going.

182
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:26,498
Cristy will layer rose water
flavoured marshmallow

183
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:28,938
and a mixed berry jam
atop a digestive biscuit,

184
00:07:28,963 --> 00:07:32,258
all encased in a delicate
floral white chocolate shell.

185
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:34,218
What do your kids think
of these biscuits?

186
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:36,618
Do they like these ones?
They're just like... Yeah, they do.

187
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:38,218
They're like,
"Why can't we touch 'em?"

188
00:07:38,243 --> 00:07:40,098
I'm like, "No, you can't touch 'em
now!"

189
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:41,938
But, yeah, no, they do.
They like 'em, yeah.

190
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:44,538
And have you explained to them,
you know, about Bake Off

191
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,498
and how it's going
and how exciting it is?

192
00:07:46,523 --> 00:07:49,098
The little ones don't know.
But my eldest,

193
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:51,498
yeah, but she's just, like,
living her life. She's like...

194
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:54,099
She's living her best life. Yeah.
The thing is, when you're a mum,

195
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:55,418
you've got so much mummy guilt

196
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:57,738
and the kids ain't even bothered,
are they? I know!

197
00:07:57,763 --> 00:07:58,898
They're not bothered!

198
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:00,778
"Mum's missing?" Yeah!
"Who cares?"

199
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:05,298
Going to roll 'em out,
aim to get even thickness.

200
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:07,779
It's a biscuit that I used to eat
a lot when I played football.

201
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:09,578
It's a half-time biscuit, almost.

202
00:08:09,603 --> 00:08:11,538
A well-known biscuit.
I've kind of, like,

203
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:14,938
taken the theme of that biscuit
and put it into a Wagon Wheel.

204
00:08:14,963 --> 00:08:17,458
Sports mad Matty
and his partner Lara

205
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:19,778
first locked eyes at the local gym.

206
00:08:19,803 --> 00:08:22,538
Eight years later they're busy
planning their wedding.

207
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:24,898
Which one are you thinking that
actually looks nice?

208
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:26,363
I don't know. They all look the
same.

209
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:29,698
He's chosen chocolate and orange
flavours

210
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:31,418
for his sandwich style biscuit.

211
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:35,138
He'll be assembling in a mould
for a sharp, elegant finish.

212
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:36,858
I like your tattoo. Thank you.

213
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,418
If you win, you've got to get
another tattoo, right? OK.

214
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:41,858
If you win, we'll both get one.
GBBO!

215
00:08:41,883 --> 00:08:44,418
I'll get one of you on my chest.

216
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:46,698
Not on your back?
Like that!

217
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:49,538
I've got one of Rahul on my bum.

218
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:53,858
Right, we're going in the oven.

219
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:56,618
The bakers will need to keep
a close eye on their biscuits...

220
00:08:56,643 --> 00:08:58,898
Ten minutes.

221
00:08:58,923 --> 00:09:00,618
We'll check 'em at eight.

222
00:09:00,643 --> 00:09:03,298
as they can go from under baked
and soft

223
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:05,738
to over baked and tough
in a matter of minutes.

224
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:07,658
12 minutes. 12 minutes in the oven.

225
00:09:07,683 --> 00:09:09,138
Calm exterior.

226
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:11,698
But I'm doing absolute somersaults
inside, yeah.

227
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:14,858
But also, they need to make
a start on any extra fillings,

228
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:18,258
curds or jams that will accompany
the marshmallow.

229
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:21,178
I'm just heating up my cream
for my ganache.

230
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:23,538
Raspberries,
I'm making raspberry jam.

231
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,618
Look at the colour, see?
It's beautiful.

232
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:29,298
So that's a rhubarb and ginger jam.

233
00:09:29,323 --> 00:09:31,938
This is going to be the flavour
kick to the marshmallow.

234
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:33,778
Smells amazing.

235
00:09:33,803 --> 00:09:36,418
Nicky and husband Rob
are both retired

236
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,898
but like to keep active,
whether it's out rambling

237
00:09:38,923 --> 00:09:40,658
with the dogs Haggis and Bracken

238
00:09:40,683 --> 00:09:42,498
or doing exercise classes together.

239
00:09:43,603 --> 00:09:44,698
THEY LAUGH

240
00:09:44,723 --> 00:09:46,978
He's got bright red cheeks now!

241
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,298
Nicky's ginger and rhubarb jam

242
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:52,698
will be the main attraction in
teacakes of pistachio shortbread

243
00:09:52,723 --> 00:09:54,058
and vanilla marshmallow.

244
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,899
So you've got rhubarb and ginger
as the hero flavours, really... Exactly.

245
00:09:56,923 --> 00:09:59,258
with a little hint of pistachio
in the biscuit. Exactly.

246
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:01,098
Very good.
Let's hope it works!

247
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:05,458
I'm doing Black Forest jam teacakes.
Blackberries and blackcurrants

248
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:07,138
are my favourite fruits
to make jam with.

249
00:10:07,163 --> 00:10:08,938
And they just work really
lovely together.

250
00:10:08,963 --> 00:10:10,938
I love to bake with fruit and stuff
off my garden

251
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:13,378
and I always want them to be
the star of the show.

252
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:15,778
Green fingered Josh
and his younger brother Jake

253
00:10:15,803 --> 00:10:18,578
love growing their own fruit
and vegetables.

254
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:21,538
They've even won prizes
for their enormous marrows.

255
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:23,538
Sitting in between his
vanilla marshmallow

256
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:25,218
and dried cherry biscuit base

257
00:10:25,243 --> 00:10:28,938
will be Black Forest jam made from
the spoils of his beloved garden.

258
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,458
Do you feel really relaxed there?

259
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:32,218
Yeah, I love it down there.
Cos it's calm.

260
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:34,618
Yeah, I do rugby from
September through till about now

261
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:38,018
and then we go switch
and it's on to... Calm world.

262
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:39,418
All the gardening stuff. Yeah.

263
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:41,818
I think you're living the way that
everyone wants to live.

264
00:10:41,843 --> 00:10:43,458
Growing and then baking.
Yeah.

265
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:48,058
Rugby, not so sure about.
Just getting pounded in the cold!

266
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,618
Good luck. Thank you.

267
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:54,058
Thought I was your biggest fan?

268
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,978
Ha! That's good, that is!

269
00:10:57,003 --> 00:11:00,418
Bakers... You are halfway through!

270
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:02,298
Taking these out now.

271
00:11:02,323 --> 00:11:05,938
Yes, they look nice. Very good.

272
00:11:05,963 --> 00:11:10,298
Yeah, they look like they did
at home, which is... a good thing.

273
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:12,338
I think it's all right.

274
00:11:12,363 --> 00:11:14,338
Just a little brown,

275
00:11:14,363 --> 00:11:15,658
so I'm happy with that.

276
00:11:15,683 --> 00:11:18,018
Saku. Hello, how are you?
How you doing? You all right?

277
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:19,578
Good, thank you very much. Yes, yes.

278
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:21,898
Now, do you bake biscuits often?

279
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:24,658
Not very often.
At least once a week.

280
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,218
That's often! If you're baking
biscuits every single week...

281
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:28,898
Every day is often, I think.

282
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:31,258
Every week is really often.
OK. Yes.

283
00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:34,178
So you're good at biscuit making,
then. I hope so!

284
00:11:34,203 --> 00:11:37,258
Every Sri Lankan New Year,
instead of baking biscuits,

285
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:40,738
Saku and her family celebrate
by boiling over milk,

286
00:11:40,763 --> 00:11:43,338
a tradition that symbolises
prosperity.

287
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:44,938
It run everywhere!

288
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,258
Today she'll be serving up

289
00:11:49,283 --> 00:11:53,138
an elegant sandwiched pistachio and
raspberry jam marshmallow biscuit

290
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:56,418
inspired by a flavour she
fell in love with in Sicily.

291
00:11:56,443 --> 00:12:00,338
So whenever we go there
I try pistachio granita.

292
00:12:00,363 --> 00:12:03,978
It's heavenly! I love pistachio.

293
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:06,698
While Saku is bringing
a taste of Sicily into the tent,

294
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:08,338
Tasha is taking us down under.

295
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:12,178
I'm making a malted
chocolate biscuit.

296
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:14,618
Um, it's like a chocolate drink

297
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:17,458
that I used to have in Australia.

298
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:20,698
Was this called Milo? Yes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

299
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:23,858
I used to have that in South Africa.
Can you get it here?

300
00:12:23,883 --> 00:12:25,378
I can get... I need to know where.

301
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:26,938
Don't tell her. Don't tell her!

302
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:29,458
I'll tell you after.

303
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:33,818
Tasha moved to Australia with her
mum and brother aged nine,

304
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:36,178
where she got a taste
of the outdoors

305
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:38,098
and for the malted chocolate
milk drink

306
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:40,538
she would enjoy at the end
of every school day.

307
00:12:40,563 --> 00:12:42,378
She'll be flavouring every element

308
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:44,938
of her elegantly decorated
marshmallow biscuits

309
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:47,258
with this popular powdered drink.

310
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:51,338
He flavours are very much, like,
childhood flavours

311
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:53,658
so I'll be very sad
if they don't like it!

312
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:55,218
Tasha isn't the only baker...

313
00:12:55,243 --> 00:12:56,658
Oopsie boopsie!

314
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:59,618
who spent some of her
childhood in sunnier climes.

315
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:01,058
I used to live in Tunisia

316
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,778
and we didn't... they don't
have teacakes there

317
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:06,138
so they're not like
a big childhood thing for me,

318
00:13:06,163 --> 00:13:08,498
so I was like, I'll use
the other thing from my childhood

319
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:11,098
that significantly impacted it,
which was living in Tunisia.

320
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,418
Abbi spent seven years in
Tunisia before returning

321
00:13:14,443 --> 00:13:18,258
to rural Cumbria, where she took up
a gravity defying fitness class.

322
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:19,738
Whee!

323
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:22,018
Her Tunisian inspired teacakes

324
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:23,498
will see a zesty orange curd

325
00:13:23,523 --> 00:13:25,978
in between her pistachio
and cardamom biscuit

326
00:13:26,003 --> 00:13:27,578
and saffron marshmallow.

327
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:29,458
Why do you bake?

328
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:30,938
Why? Yeah.

329
00:13:30,963 --> 00:13:32,618
I like it cos it's like a
creative outlet.

330
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:34,058
Do you do other creative things?

331
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,938
I do aerial hoop.
What's that?

332
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:37,458
It's like... it's like a...

333
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,378
a hoop that hangs down
from the ceiling

334
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:41,818
and you go, like, upside down in it
and stuff. What?!

335
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:44,138
Where do they have these?
Where does this happen?

336
00:13:44,163 --> 00:13:45,338
It's in a barn on a farm.

337
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:46,818
What, so you drive to a barn...

338
00:13:46,843 --> 00:13:48,658
I drive to a barn
and then I get there...

339
00:13:48,683 --> 00:13:50,218
You get in an aerial hoop.

340
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:51,938
And then I get in a hoop.
Make shapes.

341
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:53,298
Yeah, and then I go home.

342
00:13:54,603 --> 00:13:56,898
Rowan, good morning.
Good morning. How are you?

343
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:58,338
Morning, Rowan. Right, Rowan,

344
00:13:58,363 --> 00:14:00,698
tell us all about your
marshmallow biscuits.

345
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:03,058
So I'm doing lemon and rosemary
shortbread

346
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,858
with a Parma violet marshmallow.

347
00:14:05,883 --> 00:14:07,458
Parma violet?

348
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:09,378
Yeah. My nan used to like Parma
violets.

349
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:10,818
They are absolutely disgusting.

350
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:12,578
Wonderful!

351
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,298
This is a vote of confidence.

352
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:17,058
Yorkshire lad Rowan loves to
go for long walks in the Dales

353
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,458
with his dad John and mum Moira.

354
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,578
WATER FLOWS

355
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:21,179
That's making me want to wee,
that noise!

356
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:22,498
THEY LAUGH

357
00:14:22,523 --> 00:14:24,098
His flavour packed teacakes

358
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:26,498
will feature a lemon
and rosemary shortbread

359
00:14:26,523 --> 00:14:30,378
and raspberry gel to complement his
Parma violet marshmallow.

360
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,738
But I don't know if you like
Parma violet but I told...

361
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:34,378
I love it!
Is it those purple sweets?

362
00:14:34,403 --> 00:14:36,338
Yes! OK, someone likes it.
I LOVE those sweets.

363
00:14:36,363 --> 00:14:37,938
OK, so you love Parma violet.
Yeah.

364
00:14:37,963 --> 00:14:40,978
Paul and Prue do not.
They said it's a bit vile, actually.

365
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:42,858
So I'm whipping up...
What are you going to do?

366
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,218
Well, when life gives you
lemons, Alison...

367
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:47,618
Make Parma violet.
Make Parma violet, yeah!

368
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:52,258
Just make sure there's the right
amount of air in these shoulder pads.

369
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:54,538
HE IMITATES AN AIR PUMP

370
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:56,858
Bakers, you have one hour left.

371
00:14:56,883 --> 00:14:58,138
Marshmallow time.

372
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:02,418
Do you know what? before
the competition

373
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,219
I've not made
a great deal of it to be honest,

374
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:06,578
but it's a bit like
a Swiss meringue, basically.

375
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:09,259
And then just with the addition of
loads of gelatine to help it set.

376
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,338
Key to a marshmallow's pillowy
but firm form

377
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:14,978
lies in the gelatine and sugar
syrup.

378
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:19,378
I'm making the sugar syrup with
the caster sugar and golden syrup.

379
00:15:19,403 --> 00:15:20,779
Then I will add that to
the egg whites

380
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:22,578
and get it whipped for
a good ten minutes

381
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:24,898
and then it should get you creamy
marshmallow fluff

382
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,658
just like, chef's kiss!

383
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:30,218
But bringing this mix to the
right temperature is crucial.

384
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:33,658
So this has to get to
114 to 116 degrees C.

385
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,978
Hurry up!

386
00:15:36,763 --> 00:15:40,538
Too hot and their marshmallow
will be tough and chewy.

387
00:15:40,563 --> 00:15:43,338
Too cold and it won't set.

388
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:44,858
Here we go.

389
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:48,298
So now that gets poured into
the egg whites.

390
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:52,218
And then gradually it will turn into
a marshmallow fluff.

391
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,898
And for those adding flavours...

392
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:58,258
there's an additional balance
to be struck.

393
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:00,738
Going with some extract into
the marshmallow.

394
00:16:00,763 --> 00:16:03,258
Only, like, a cap.
Extract can be quite offensive

395
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:04,858
if you use too much of it.

396
00:16:04,883 --> 00:16:07,178
It was always going to be
a couple of drops.

397
00:16:07,203 --> 00:16:08,459
But now I've spoke to the judges

398
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,858
I think it's going to be maybe
one drop, if that.

399
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:12,898
Might just do lemon. Sod it.

400
00:16:12,923 --> 00:16:16,058
But while most have
their marshmallows made, Keith...

401
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,298
BLEEP

402
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:19,298
is struggling with
his sugar syrup.

403
00:16:19,323 --> 00:16:23,178
It's taking a little bit longer
than I expected for the, um,

404
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:25,898
sugar to start to come up
to temperature.

405
00:16:25,923 --> 00:16:28,578
I'm a little bit concerned about
the time

406
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:30,218
but we shall see.

407
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:35,258
Bakers, you've got 30 minutes left.

408
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:38,258
Time goes quick.
That's gone really quick.

409
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:41,938
Right. And that's as good
as it will do for me.

410
00:16:41,963 --> 00:16:44,578
As Keith races to make
his marshmallow...

411
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,898
Right, we're ready.

412
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,258
the rest of the bakers have begun
to build.

413
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:51,538
Smells very Parma violety.

414
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:53,338
I'm feeling stressed!

415
00:16:53,363 --> 00:16:54,778
But with so much marshmallow,

416
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:57,138
it's essential
the bakers' other elements

417
00:16:57,163 --> 00:16:59,458
are able to punch through
the sweetness.

418
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:00,818
Just putting the jam

419
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:03,778
on top of the biscuits.

420
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:08,178
Not too much. Just a wee layer
that'll just sort of sit.

421
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:10,778
And while many of the bakers
are relying on moulds

422
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:12,818
to achieve a flawless finish...

423
00:17:12,843 --> 00:17:15,418
So now it'll set in the fridge
until I demould it.

424
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:18,098
That's if I can get it demoulded.

425
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:21,258
others are preparing for
a freehand finish.

426
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:24,218
I'm going to have to get
dipping. Time is against me now.

427
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,058
I just have to go really quickly.

428
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,938
Please work,
please work, please work.

429
00:17:29,763 --> 00:17:32,178
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

430
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:35,058
I really wanted to take my time
on this but... Whoopsy daisy!

431
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,298
So now I can start
doing the marshmallow.

432
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,698
As Keith's biscuits finally
start coming together,

433
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:43,378
for the teacake contingent,
it's time to demould.

434
00:17:43,403 --> 00:17:45,058
Moment of truth, here we go.

435
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,378
Once they come out, they're done.

436
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:49,938
But it's just getting them out
that's the tricky bit.

437
00:17:49,963 --> 00:17:52,298
I mean, they're coming out
and they're not snapping.

438
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:54,618
I was expecting a breakage,
with my luck today.

439
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:56,218
Right, that one's broken.

440
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,578
That was challenge, though,
with this mould.

441
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:00,898
I need to get the chocolate
round the edges

442
00:18:00,923 --> 00:18:03,218
but you do have to be very delicate

443
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:06,538
and delicacy's not really
in my skill set.

444
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:10,538
They're just so messy underneath.
Going to trim round carefully.

445
00:18:10,563 --> 00:18:12,978
Gentle, gentle, gentle...

446
00:18:13,003 --> 00:18:14,618
I need to decorate the top...

447
00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:15,938
as best I can.

448
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:20,298
Yeah, just jazz it up a bit.

449
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:21,898
I'll put some peanuts on.

450
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,938
I can, like, hide a lot of stuff
with glitter.

451
00:18:25,963 --> 00:18:27,298
That's what I'm hoping for!

452
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:30,738
They're just sort of like dodgy
alloy wheels from, like, the 1990s.

453
00:18:30,763 --> 00:18:33,218
They look messy!

454
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:35,578
Sorry, kangaroo.
You're going to get a messy bum.

455
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:38,338
Perfect!

456
00:18:38,363 --> 00:18:42,178
OK, bakers, your time is up.

457
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:44,738
Please step away from
your biscuits.

458
00:18:44,763 --> 00:18:47,178
We got 12. That's the main thing.

459
00:18:47,203 --> 00:18:48,498
God. That was stressful.

460
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:51,658
They look beautiful. Thank you.

461
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:56,498
Mine looks a bag of BLEEP
compared to everybody else's.

462
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:04,858
11 batches of marshmallow biscuits

463
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:08,018
now face the judgment of
Prue and Paul.

464
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,058
Did you drop three of them?

465
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,739
Um, I don't know what
you're on about, Prue!

466
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:14,818
LAUGHTER

467
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:16,579
There's nothing there,
there's nothing to see!

468
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:18,938
I mean, they look amazing
bar these broken ones.

469
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:20,898
Let's have a look
and see what it's like inside.

470
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:24,818
Thank you. It's a lovely interior.
I think the balance

471
00:19:24,843 --> 00:19:27,098
between the marshmallow
and the biscuit is good.

472
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:30,738
It's delicious.
Thank you.

473
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:31,898
Very spicy.

474
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:33,578
The topping I like,

475
00:19:33,603 --> 00:19:35,898
but it's totally overwhelmed
by the biscuit.

476
00:19:35,923 --> 00:19:37,458
It's so potent

477
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:39,418
that a delicate thing like
a marshmallow's

478
00:19:39,443 --> 00:19:40,978
never going to stand a chance.

479
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:42,538
Do you know, I don't really agree

480
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:46,138
Because, frankly, marshmallow
deserves to be overridden.

481
00:19:46,163 --> 00:19:47,618
I think it works beautifully.

482
00:19:47,643 --> 00:19:49,898
Thank you very much.
That's OK. Thank you, thank you.

483
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:56,418
OK, let's have a look.

484
00:19:57,603 --> 00:19:59,858
My goodness.
That's neat as a pin, isn't it?

485
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:03,298
Um, the Parma violet,

486
00:20:03,323 --> 00:20:04,858
I'm not getting too much of that,

487
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:06,898
which for me is a good thing. OK.

488
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:08,818
You do get that lemon
coming through.

489
00:20:08,843 --> 00:20:12,458
So you end up with a pretty
decent marshmallow biscuit.

490
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:14,778
Do you know, I think it's amazing.

491
00:20:14,803 --> 00:20:16,618
I think you've got
so many flavours in there

492
00:20:16,643 --> 00:20:18,938
but you get them one after another.
It's perfect.

493
00:20:18,963 --> 00:20:20,178
Thank you.

494
00:20:20,203 --> 00:20:22,938
Well done. I was so nervous.
Thank you. Well done. Thank you.

495
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:27,018
Very pretty.

496
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:28,458
Yeah.

497
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:32,058
I baked a pistachio and vanilla
marshmallow biscuit.

498
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,058
I think your flavours
are really good.

499
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,818
The jam comes through, the biscuit,
you do get that pistachio flavour.

500
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:39,418
My only comment would be

501
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:42,218
the biscuit needed a little bit
longer in the oven.

502
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:48,338
You could've spun the chocolate

503
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:50,778
a little bit neater than that,
but I do like them.

504
00:20:50,803 --> 00:20:52,178
I think they do look pretty nice.

505
00:20:52,203 --> 00:20:53,458
Ooh. Wow.

506
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:55,058
Ooh, hello.

507
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,378
I think your chocolate's
a bit thick down at the bottom.

508
00:20:57,403 --> 00:20:58,898
That should've been paper thin.

509
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:02,418
Your orange jam is delicious.

510
00:21:02,443 --> 00:21:03,538
Yeah.

511
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:06,418
I think if, instead of putting
a blob of jam in the middle,

512
00:21:06,443 --> 00:21:08,218
you'd put a layer of jam... Yeah.

513
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:10,498
then every mouthful
would've been perfect.

514
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:16,018
Well, they all look neat as a pin

515
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:17,578
and they're certainly identical.

516
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:19,258
Let's cut one of these open.

517
00:21:21,723 --> 00:21:23,298
Good crack on the chocolate.

518
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,778
Looks lovely inside, Josh.

519
00:21:25,803 --> 00:21:28,898
Nice and thin.
Chocolate's beautifully done.

520
00:21:28,923 --> 00:21:32,138
I like the balance between the
sweet and the tartness...

521
00:21:32,163 --> 00:21:33,618
Yeah... which comes from the jam.

522
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:36,218
You've got the nice fruits
coming through in there.

523
00:21:36,243 --> 00:21:37,938
Pretty, pretty spot-on.

524
00:21:41,403 --> 00:21:44,498
Well, your roses worked, didn't
they? Yeah, they did. Perfect.

525
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:48,298
The rose flavour's definitely there.

526
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:50,178
But I don't think it's too much.

527
00:21:50,203 --> 00:21:51,738
I think, yeah, I think you're right.

528
00:21:51,763 --> 00:21:53,378
I think the rose level
is about right.

529
00:21:53,403 --> 00:21:57,178
The berry in there needed to be a
little bit stronger and more of it,

530
00:21:57,203 --> 00:21:59,723
but I think it's very neat and
I think you've done a decent job.

531
00:22:02,563 --> 00:22:06,618
They are a bit messy but I do think
they're exciting and attractive.

532
00:22:06,643 --> 00:22:08,378
Yeah, they look like crowns,
don't they?

533
00:22:08,403 --> 00:22:10,178
ABBI LAUGHS

534
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,098
There's a lot of orange in there.

535
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,018
Yes, I think probably
a little bit too much.

536
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:15,458
The biscuit is lovely and crispy

537
00:22:15,483 --> 00:22:17,818
but the orange is really punching.

538
00:22:17,843 --> 00:22:22,218
And be careful to allow yourself
time to finish off your bakes...

539
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:24,098
Yeah... with a little bit more
finesse. Yeah.

540
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:28,218
Well, at first glance
they look pretty good.

541
00:22:28,243 --> 00:22:30,698
When you look a bit closer,
they're a little bit messy.

542
00:22:30,723 --> 00:22:33,698
Interesting inside. I mean, you've
got a lot going on in there

543
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:35,138
when it comes to the layers.

544
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:38,778
These are a peanut biscuit
with white chocolate

545
00:22:38,803 --> 00:22:41,458
and peanut butter ganache
and a banana marshmallow.

546
00:22:41,483 --> 00:22:43,138
I don't quite know what
I think about that

547
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:45,618
Because I think technically
it's perfect.

548
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:47,938
Maybe I don't quite share your
four-year-old's tastes.

549
00:22:47,963 --> 00:22:49,898
Yeah, possibly so, yeah, yeah!

550
00:22:49,923 --> 00:22:51,858
Texture wise it's spot-on.

551
00:22:51,883 --> 00:22:54,218
And not a big thick layer
of chocolate. Yeah.

552
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:55,859
It's paper thin and that's how
it should be.

553
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:57,658
If you hadn't put the cartwheel on,

554
00:22:57,683 --> 00:23:00,258
they would've looked ten times
better. Yeah. I know.

555
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:07,618
Bit messy, aren't they?

556
00:23:07,643 --> 00:23:10,298
Well, I knew they weren't gonna be

557
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:12,658
the most attractive offering
in the tent.

558
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,018
I, I wasn't planning on them being
quite so messy.

559
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:17,378
They're probably gonna
taste amazing.

560
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:19,098
Keith, you're looking really
worried.

561
00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:25,938
Keith the truth is, it really
is delicious.

562
00:23:25,963 --> 00:23:27,938
The, erm, marshmallow's holding
its shape.

563
00:23:27,963 --> 00:23:30,378
The raspberry jam is terrific.

564
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:32,978
This is the nicest,
crispest biscuit.

565
00:23:33,003 --> 00:23:35,018
So is it ugly but nice?

566
00:23:35,043 --> 00:23:36,938
It's beauty and
the beast, that's what it is.

567
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:39,418
Beauty's on the inside.
But look at it. I'll take that.

568
00:23:39,443 --> 00:23:41,018
Thank you very much, Keith.
Cheers.

569
00:23:45,363 --> 00:23:48,578
So these are biscuit
with ground pistachios,

570
00:23:48,603 --> 00:23:52,298
rhubarb and ginger jam
and then chocolate on the top.

571
00:23:52,323 --> 00:23:54,338
Where's the, where's the ginger?

572
00:23:54,363 --> 00:23:56,738
The jam. It was, it was there.
Where is it?

573
00:23:56,763 --> 00:23:58,498
I, I think it ran a wee bit.

574
00:23:58,523 --> 00:24:00,818
Well, it ran out
the tent that's what it's done.

575
00:24:00,843 --> 00:24:02,178
There's nothing here. Never mind.

576
00:24:02,203 --> 00:24:04,538
He's trying to find some.
Stop it!

577
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:06,138
He's trying to see...
No.

578
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:09,818
No. There's gotta be some somewhere.

579
00:24:09,843 --> 00:24:12,338
There is.
I just put a wee thin layer on.

580
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:14,978
Why? Why? Because I didn't want it
to overpower it.

581
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:17,258
See, you've got a wee bit there.

582
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:19,658
Dearie me, never mind.

583
00:24:19,683 --> 00:24:22,658
It is, it is dearie me because
otherwise it's nicely constructed.

584
00:24:22,683 --> 00:24:25,338
The biscuit is beautiful,
the chocolate's nice and thin.

585
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,938
You've done a good job
but we needed the jam.

586
00:24:35,563 --> 00:24:38,498
Well, they look very sophisticated
and beautifully piped

587
00:24:38,523 --> 00:24:42,178
and the spinning is just so thin
and lovely.

588
00:24:42,203 --> 00:24:44,618
My instinct is that
the biscuits are too thick.

589
00:24:44,643 --> 00:24:46,898
Because I think that's quite
a mouthful.

590
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:51,338
I think they're,
the biscuit, you think it's thick

591
00:24:51,363 --> 00:24:53,058
but it's not because it crumbles

592
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,778
and it's so delicate,

593
00:24:54,803 --> 00:24:57,138
and the chocolate comes through -
not dark chocolate,

594
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:00,698
but it has a beautiful malted
aftertaste in the mouth.

595
00:25:00,723 --> 00:25:02,378
I think they're delicate,

596
00:25:02,403 --> 00:25:04,018
I think they're pretty and I have
to...

597
00:25:04,043 --> 00:25:06,538
Good for you.
Yeah!

598
00:25:07,963 --> 00:25:10,258
Thank you. I tell you what,

599
00:25:10,283 --> 00:25:13,978
that pleases me as much as it
pleases you.

600
00:25:14,003 --> 00:25:16,978
Ooh, that's a handshake. I'll have
two of those. Thanks.

601
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:26,538
I got a Hollywood handshake.

602
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:29,778
I was not expecting that at all.

603
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:33,658
Yes!

604
00:25:33,683 --> 00:25:35,658
I'm so proud.

605
00:25:35,683 --> 00:25:38,978
I don't think I could've got any
better than that.

606
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:42,138
Because the judges aren't blind,

607
00:25:42,163 --> 00:25:45,978
they could see that it looked
like a flipping mess.

608
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:49,498
You can't be worried about these
things cos it's done.

609
00:25:49,523 --> 00:25:52,458
And I can't do anything about it.

610
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:55,658
And so, yeah, you've just got
to enjoy the moment,

611
00:25:55,683 --> 00:25:59,378
keep smiling cos that's what
life's all about, isn't it?

612
00:26:03,523 --> 00:26:06,898
While the bakers could practise
their marshmallow biscuits

613
00:26:06,923 --> 00:26:09,578
the next challenge is a mystery.

614
00:26:09,603 --> 00:26:11,978
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

615
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:15,218
It's time for your Technical
Challenge which today has been set

616
00:26:15,243 --> 00:26:17,658
for you by the lovely Prue.
Any words of wisdom?

617
00:26:17,683 --> 00:26:20,738
I've only got one piece of advice
for you guys,

618
00:26:20,763 --> 00:26:23,978
and that is use your time wisely.

619
00:26:24,003 --> 00:26:28,538
Now, as always, this challenge is
gonna be judged blind

620
00:26:28,563 --> 00:26:30,338
so, guys, off you go.

621
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:32,258
Off you pop and when we say go we
mean go,

622
00:26:32,283 --> 00:26:35,418
don't skulk back pretending
to look for your phone charger.

623
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:37,418
OK, Prue would like you to make

624
00:26:37,443 --> 00:26:42,938
a batch of 12 perfectly baked
custard creams.

625
00:26:42,963 --> 00:26:44,738
Your custard creams should be

626
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:47,578
made with a short buttery biscuit

627
00:26:47,603 --> 00:26:49,978
and imprinted with that classic
custard cream design

628
00:26:50,003 --> 00:26:53,218
and they should be filled with
a custard butter cream.

629
00:26:53,243 --> 00:26:56,938
Sounds delicious. You've got one and
a half hours for this.

630
00:26:56,963 --> 00:26:59,618
That does not sound long enough.
On your marks.

631
00:26:59,643 --> 00:27:01,018
Get set. Bake!

632
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:03,378
My gosh.

633
00:27:03,403 --> 00:27:07,378
I've never made custard creams.
I've eaten them. But never made one.

634
00:27:07,403 --> 00:27:10,058
It's good because you know what they
look and taste like.

635
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:12,618
It's bad because you know what they
look and taste like.

636
00:27:12,643 --> 00:27:16,098
Custard creams. I have no idea.

637
00:27:16,123 --> 00:27:18,858
I'm a huge fan of custard so I'm
looking forward to all of this.

638
00:27:18,883 --> 00:27:22,298
Huge custard man, yeah. I'm from the
North, mate, have it for breakfast.

639
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,738
Custard creams, Prue, I think this
is a great Technical Challenge.

640
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:29,538
But do you think it's too simple?

641
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:33,098
It's not that simple.
It's actually easy to go wrong.

642
00:27:33,123 --> 00:27:35,858
I think the most common problem
will be people not chilling their

643
00:27:35,883 --> 00:27:37,538
biscuit dough enough.

644
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:40,658
It needs to go into the oven
really, really cold.

645
00:27:40,683 --> 00:27:42,378
If it's a slightest bit warm,

646
00:27:42,403 --> 00:27:45,378
the butter will start to melt and
you'll lose the definition

647
00:27:45,403 --> 00:27:48,338
and the shape and the next most
common problem will be not getting

648
00:27:48,363 --> 00:27:51,138
the creme au beurre
properly chilled.

649
00:27:51,163 --> 00:27:53,178
It's all about chilling and timing.

650
00:27:53,203 --> 00:27:54,738
Choose your, biscuit Prue.

651
00:27:58,283 --> 00:28:00,578
It holds together beautifully.

652
00:28:00,603 --> 00:28:02,098
Beautiful custard flavour.

653
00:28:02,123 --> 00:28:04,938
But there's a lovely snap to
it as well in the mouth.

654
00:28:04,963 --> 00:28:07,458
I tell you what these
taste a whole heap better

655
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:09,018
than the ones in the packet.

656
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:14,258
First instruction - make biscuit
dough, chill in freezer.

657
00:28:14,283 --> 00:28:18,098
Just says make the biscuit dough.
Which is really helpful.

658
00:28:18,123 --> 00:28:19,498
Thanks, Prue.

659
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:22,738
I actually looked up a custard
cream recipe last night. Shh.

660
00:28:22,763 --> 00:28:26,338
You cream together your butter
and sugar and then add in your egg

661
00:28:26,363 --> 00:28:28,658
and then you add in your flour

662
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:31,178
and then I've put the custard
powder in with the flour.

663
00:28:31,203 --> 00:28:32,978
Hey, Dana. Hi, Alison.

664
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,498
You look like you're ahead.

665
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:36,858
Don't say that.
You're doing good.

666
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:39,579
Cos that's how it was last week and
I came last, didn't 1?7 But, erm...

667
00:28:39,603 --> 00:28:42,178
Well, no, listen, don't
put no pressure on yourself.

668
00:28:42,203 --> 00:28:43,658
Yeah. Have you done this before?

669
00:28:43,683 --> 00:28:46,498
No. It's just biscuit, isn't it?
It's just, just biscuit.

670
00:28:46,523 --> 00:28:49,458
It's just biscuit. It's not
just biscuit, it's a custard cream.

671
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:51,858
Get it straight in the freezer.

672
00:28:51,883 --> 00:28:55,098
I get the impression from how Prue
was describing it that you

673
00:28:55,123 --> 00:28:57,578
haven't got a great
deal of time to mess around.

674
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:59,938
Whole thing about this
is freezing

675
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:02,298
cos you've got a stamp
and you wanna be able to stamp it

676
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,658
and see it, don't you? Cos
if you don't, what's the point?

677
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:06,458
It's not a custard cream.

678
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:09,339
It's kind of amazing. I know I'd love that.
Did you know that existed until today? No.

679
00:29:09,363 --> 00:29:11,218
It, it's brilliant. No, me neither.

680
00:29:11,243 --> 00:29:15,818
It's almost like a game. Where we've
got to be the quickest to the button.

681
00:29:15,843 --> 00:29:18,178
To the buzzer? Yeah.

682
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:20,858
Who's got the baking? Paul or Prue?

683
00:29:20,883 --> 00:29:22,858
Paul.

684
00:29:22,883 --> 00:29:25,658
Who's gonna win the Bake Off
this year? Don't... Keith.

685
00:29:29,283 --> 00:29:33,218
So step number two is for the
custard butter cream, make

686
00:29:33,243 --> 00:29:35,738
a sugar syrup in a small pan
and boil to 121 Celsius.

687
00:29:35,763 --> 00:29:38,898
It's getting very technical now.

688
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:40,258
Dissolve.

689
00:29:40,283 --> 00:29:42,618
It's made like a French
meringue butter cream

690
00:29:42,643 --> 00:29:44,419
and I have made one already.
So I know what I'm doing.

691
00:29:44,443 --> 00:29:47,058
So this is gonna heat up and then
I'm gonna pour it into my egg

692
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:49,578
yolks and whisk it
until they're really big and fluffy.

693
00:29:49,603 --> 00:29:52,858
Well, we've just zoomed past 121 so
I'll just leave it there for a sec.

694
00:29:52,883 --> 00:29:54,698
It's fine.

695
00:29:55,843 --> 00:29:58,378
I've just
got this to 121 degrees.

696
00:29:58,403 --> 00:30:01,258
And I shall be plonking it in here
now with the egg yolks.

697
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:03,658
I know you've gotta do
this really slowly.

698
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:05,498
If you chuck it all in it
will like split.

699
00:30:07,283 --> 00:30:09,058
The eggs haven't whisked up,

700
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:12,618
the butter cream has all gone to pot
and I need to start again.

701
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:17,818
So it's getting nice
and thick. Which is what we want.

702
00:30:17,843 --> 00:30:20,178
Sieve custard powder then
whisk again.

703
00:30:20,203 --> 00:30:24,498
Get as much of that as possible.
And give it another whisk.

704
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:30,098
The buttercream's looking better.
I'm still a lot behind though.

705
00:30:32,403 --> 00:30:35,778
When ready, whisk the butter into
the butter cream.

706
00:30:35,803 --> 00:30:37,538
And once you incorporate
the butter into it,

707
00:30:37,563 --> 00:30:39,898
it will obviously increase in
volume, thicken up.

708
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:42,339
I'm just gonna keep on whisking it
and then it gets nice and fluffy.

709
00:30:42,363 --> 00:30:44,739
If it's too loose it's just gonna
splodge out the side everywhere.

710
00:30:44,763 --> 00:30:46,298
Plaafff, it's never good.

711
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:47,778
This is pretty terrible.

712
00:30:47,803 --> 00:30:51,738
I can see flecks of yellow but I
can't get it to whisk any more.

713
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:54,178
I'm not sure about
the consistency...

714
00:30:55,243 --> 00:30:57,458
but I will go with this.

715
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:03,458
Right, roll out the biscuit dough
and chill in the freezer.

716
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:06,138
It's a lot of chilling.
We need to make 12.

717
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:09,778
That is 24 biscuits.
So it needs to be thin.

718
00:31:09,803 --> 00:31:13,538
Custard creams,
about three mil thick, I reckon.

719
00:31:13,563 --> 00:31:16,898
We're rolling, it's looking all
right, yeah, the dough's nice.

720
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:21,778
Cristy.
Have you used my biscuit dough?

721
00:31:23,363 --> 00:31:25,898
You have.
My God, I'm so sorry.

722
00:31:25,923 --> 00:31:27,458
That's my biscuit dough.

723
00:31:29,363 --> 00:31:32,618
Rowan! There you go.
I'm so sorry, Rowan.

724
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:33,978
No, it's fine. I thought...

725
00:31:34,003 --> 00:31:36,458
Are you swapping dough, you kids?

726
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:38,418
Rowan, what really happened?

727
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:39,578
I found my dough missing.

728
00:31:39,603 --> 00:31:42,098
Sabotage? Sabotage, no.
Cristy, you've done a great job.

729
00:31:42,123 --> 00:31:44,818
Do you feel like you rolled his out
better than you're doing yours?

730
00:31:44,843 --> 00:31:46,818
Yeah, for sure.
No, what's going on here?

731
00:31:46,843 --> 00:31:47,938
Don't.

732
00:31:47,963 --> 00:31:51,938
Feel like this is a bit sticky.
Need a bit more of this. Sorry.

733
00:31:51,963 --> 00:31:55,378
Before their dough is ready
to be cut and stamped...

734
00:31:55,403 --> 00:31:57,378
I think that'll do.

735
00:31:57,403 --> 00:31:59,698
it must be chilled thoroughly.

736
00:31:59,723 --> 00:32:02,058
The longer it chills
the better definition it'll be

737
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,418
but the less time it will have
to bake and then cool down.

738
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:06,778
But it's a process that
can't be rushed.

739
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:11,578
It's not working. Sticking.
More time in the fridge.

740
00:32:11,603 --> 00:32:16,058
You've got 45 minutes left,
everyone, 45 minutes.

741
00:32:18,523 --> 00:32:20,818
Please be ready, please be ready,
please be ready.

742
00:32:20,843 --> 00:32:22,098
So I'm hoping these are set

743
00:32:22,123 --> 00:32:24,578
and they'll push out of this mould

744
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:28,138
but we're gonna find out in
a moment, aren't we? Stamp.

745
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:30,458
I don't know how hard to push.

746
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:33,258
Am I gonna go all the way through?
See, look, it's getting stuck.

747
00:32:33,283 --> 00:32:35,538
Is this happening for other people?

748
00:32:35,563 --> 00:32:37,578
I'm probably doing it wrong.

749
00:32:37,603 --> 00:32:39,978
Give it a bit of welly.

750
00:32:40,003 --> 00:32:41,858
Yeah, looks all right.

751
00:32:41,883 --> 00:32:45,378
Come on, out you come.
It is a pretty little pattern.

752
00:32:45,403 --> 00:32:46,858
It's quite sweet, I think.

753
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:49,178
It's not a uniform custard cream
but she's the first,

754
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:50,978
it's like the first pancake.

755
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:54,458
It's always the worst one
but we go uphill from here.

756
00:32:54,483 --> 00:32:57,778
They're not looking too bad at
the moment.

757
00:32:57,803 --> 00:32:59,658
Can I press the button?

758
00:32:59,683 --> 00:33:01,058
You can do.

759
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:02,818
Hey, presto.

760
00:33:02,843 --> 00:33:04,098
So I'm gonna go as far

761
00:33:04,123 --> 00:33:05,858
and say that was the best one.

762
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,498
Some of us have just got the touch.

763
00:33:07,523 --> 00:33:10,378
You do. It won't stop sticking
so it's go back in the freezer

764
00:33:10,403 --> 00:33:12,698
with a layer of flour.

765
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:16,018
Nightmare, aren't they? After you.
Thank you.

766
00:33:16,043 --> 00:33:19,938
It's sticking to the... Agh!
..cutter.

767
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:22,418
Not at all neat.

768
00:33:22,443 --> 00:33:26,018
I'm very concerned about this.

769
00:33:26,043 --> 00:33:30,018
This dough has gone too soft
to manipulate. Freezer.

770
00:33:30,043 --> 00:33:32,778
Bakers, you've got half
an hour left.

771
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,098
Running out of time.

772
00:33:35,123 --> 00:33:39,658
That's not very long.
I need to get mine in the oven.

773
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:43,098
It just says bake.
13 to start with.

774
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:45,018
Eight minutes.

775
00:33:45,043 --> 00:33:46,978
So I'm gonna go
for about 12 minutes.

776
00:33:47,003 --> 00:33:49,018
They're quite pale, aren't they?

777
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:50,938
Quite insipid actually, like me in
the winter.

778
00:33:52,283 --> 00:33:54,258
Come on, custard cream.

779
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:56,218
Abbi, get a bit closer.

780
00:33:57,803 --> 00:33:59,298
It's already melting.

781
00:33:59,323 --> 00:34:01,058
I think the design's just gonna
be lost.

782
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,338
I didn't chill them long enough,
I know I didn't.

783
00:34:04,483 --> 00:34:07,098
So I've put a batch of 12 in.

784
00:34:07,123 --> 00:34:09,818
It's gonna be tough to go again.

785
00:34:09,843 --> 00:34:11,698
I had timing issues this morning.

786
00:34:11,723 --> 00:34:14,858
Bakers, you've got ten minutes left,
ten minutes.

787
00:34:14,883 --> 00:34:16,858
I don't know when they're gonna
be ready.

788
00:34:16,883 --> 00:34:19,258
I don't know, I don't know.
It's hard to call, isn't it?

789
00:34:19,283 --> 00:34:21,819
As soon as I start seeing them
getting brown then they're coming out.

790
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:22,898
I love a custard cream

791
00:34:22,923 --> 00:34:25,938
and I'm gonna be mentally scarred by
them now, aren't I, forever?

792
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:28,298
I'm never gonna be able
to eat one again, am 17

793
00:34:28,323 --> 00:34:30,618
I'm coming out.
Mine look a bit ropey.

794
00:34:30,643 --> 00:34:31,899
But they're coming out whatever.

795
00:34:31,923 --> 00:34:35,338
They're looking all right I think
actually, yeah. Looking custard cream-ish.

796
00:34:35,363 --> 00:34:36,738
That one's nice.

797
00:34:36,763 --> 00:34:37,858
This one's gonna be a top.

798
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:40,538
This one's gonna be a bottom.
I'm a man with a plan.

799
00:34:40,563 --> 00:34:43,138
I'm gonna take these out cos
they've gotta cool down.

800
00:34:43,163 --> 00:34:44,938
I will put it in the freezer.

801
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:51,658
I dropped.

802
00:34:51,683 --> 00:34:55,138
Rowan, what you doing? I'm warming
my cream. Rowan.

803
00:34:57,883 --> 00:35:00,218
I don't think my buttercream's as
nice as I would like.

804
00:35:00,243 --> 00:35:03,618
I've probably overfilled them
but it doesn't matter.

805
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:07,138
I'm shaking. This is ridiculous.
I can't do it.

806
00:35:07,163 --> 00:35:09,058
Bakers, you've got one minute left.

807
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:12,938
If I can't get 12 out at least
I'm-a get six out.

808
00:35:12,963 --> 00:35:14,658
I don't know what they're gonna say.

809
00:35:14,683 --> 00:35:16,938
They don't look perfect to me.

810
00:35:16,963 --> 00:35:18,498
So ugly.

811
00:35:19,923 --> 00:35:22,178
OK, bakers, your time is up.

812
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,498
Please come and bring your bakes

813
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:27,418
and place them behind your
beautiful photos.

814
00:35:27,443 --> 00:35:30,738
They are so ugly.
They look absolutely...

815
00:35:32,123 --> 00:35:34,418
rubbish.
I've got custard on my trainers.

816
00:35:34,443 --> 00:35:37,018
On your meggings? On my megging?

817
00:35:37,043 --> 00:35:39,298
Yeah. What's that?
Your megging, trainers.

818
00:35:42,163 --> 00:35:45,098
OK, bakers, let's welcome back
our judges.

819
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:46,698
We missed you guys.

820
00:35:46,723 --> 00:35:49,778
Paul and Prue are looking
for 12 identical custard creams

821
00:35:49,803 --> 00:35:52,538
with their iconic pattern well
defined and filled

822
00:35:52,563 --> 00:35:54,618
with a smooth custard butter cream

823
00:35:54,643 --> 00:35:57,258
and they have no idea
whose are whose.

824
00:35:57,283 --> 00:36:00,858
Not very easy, but you seem
to have more or less managed it.

825
00:36:00,883 --> 00:36:01,883
More or less!

826
00:36:03,603 --> 00:36:05,458
Shall we start over here, Prue?

827
00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:07,778
They look a bit pale,
is my first thought.

828
00:36:07,803 --> 00:36:08,978
They do look a bit pale.

829
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:11,658
There is a bit of definition
there... Yes, it's good.

830
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:12,938
and they are pretty neat.

831
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,418
And they're not overfilled.

832
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:15,458
Nice snap.

833
00:36:17,923 --> 00:36:20,618
That biscuit just needs
a bit longer in the oven.

834
00:36:20,643 --> 00:36:22,578
It's got a slightly floury taste.

835
00:36:23,923 --> 00:36:25,098
Moving on to number two.

836
00:36:25,123 --> 00:36:27,018
Now these lost a little bit of
definition here.

837
00:36:27,043 --> 00:36:30,258
The filling inside is a bit sparse.

838
00:36:30,283 --> 00:36:33,338
Also it's not quite set.

839
00:36:33,363 --> 00:36:36,018
Still very soft.
And so's the biscuit actually.

840
00:36:36,043 --> 00:36:37,418
Not much snap to that.

841
00:36:37,443 --> 00:36:41,018
Again, I think it needs a little
longer in the oven. Yeah, it does.

842
00:36:41,043 --> 00:36:44,058
This one unfortunately
has very little definition.

843
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:46,538
You can't read "custard cream"
on it. Yeah.

844
00:36:46,563 --> 00:36:49,498
Well, filled though.
Difference in thickness and thin.

845
00:36:49,523 --> 00:36:52,538
They're just not rolled enough
because the dough was quite soft.

846
00:36:55,203 --> 00:36:57,178
The custard is
better than the biscuit.

847
00:36:57,203 --> 00:36:58,938
Yeah, it is.

848
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:01,458
This has got a bit of colour
to it, which I quite like.

849
00:37:01,483 --> 00:37:04,098
We expect a little bit more
definition, but it's not bad.

850
00:37:04,123 --> 00:37:06,738
The piping's pretty good. Yeah.

851
00:37:07,883 --> 00:37:09,538
And tastes properly baked.

852
00:37:10,763 --> 00:37:14,298
Moving on. Lovely colour,
pretty even on the top and bottom.

853
00:37:14,323 --> 00:37:17,458
Very, very good. Well filled.

854
00:37:17,483 --> 00:37:19,818
Needed a little bit longer
in the oven.

855
00:37:19,843 --> 00:37:21,538
It's a pity because,
apart from that,

856
00:37:21,563 --> 00:37:25,258
I would've said that's pretty
faultless. They look wonderful.

857
00:37:25,283 --> 00:37:27,578
Now, this one's got a little bit
more colour on it.

858
00:37:27,603 --> 00:37:29,338
There's a bit of definition here,

859
00:37:29,363 --> 00:37:31,978
although it's washed out on
a few of them. Well filled.

860
00:37:33,563 --> 00:37:36,418
The custard comes through really
nicely in it. Good flavour.

861
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:40,138
Same old problem.
A little bit under baked.

862
00:37:40,163 --> 00:37:41,578
THUNDER RUMBLES

863
00:37:41,603 --> 00:37:43,578
Lost a bit of definition in places.

864
00:37:43,603 --> 00:37:46,138
Yeah, and a little unevenly filled.
Yeah.

865
00:37:48,443 --> 00:37:50,778
There is actually a little bit
of a crunch to that.

866
00:37:50,803 --> 00:37:53,058
It's not bad, but it's a
bit... thick.

867
00:37:54,003 --> 00:37:55,738
This one, a lot of them,
are misshapen.

868
00:37:55,763 --> 00:37:58,098
That one's thin at one end
and fat at the other.

869
00:37:58,123 --> 00:38:00,658
That one there's got no definition
on it at all.

870
00:38:00,683 --> 00:38:02,578
That custard actually curdled.

871
00:38:03,763 --> 00:38:05,418
It's a shame.

872
00:38:05,443 --> 00:38:08,178
This has got nice definition.
Beautiful. Nice and equal.

873
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,578
Colour's right. It's got the
slight brown hue to it.

874
00:38:10,603 --> 00:38:13,098
That looks really good.
Nice and thin.

875
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:15,858
Yeah. Now you're talking,
really crispy.

876
00:38:15,883 --> 00:38:18,498
That's a custard cream.
In fact that's a lot better

877
00:38:18,523 --> 00:38:21,938
than a commercial custard cream.
Very, very good.

878
00:38:21,963 --> 00:38:25,138
These are a bit messy.
Uneven, no definition, the dough

879
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:27,738
was obviously very soft, very
difficult to cut.

880
00:38:30,123 --> 00:38:33,458
It's like rubber.
Not a success, sadly.

881
00:38:35,043 --> 00:38:37,338
Now these look great.
Don't they look good?

882
00:38:37,363 --> 00:38:39,018
Even, they look very professional.

883
00:38:40,203 --> 00:38:44,218
Sadly, slightly under baked. You know
why, it's cos they're too thick.

884
00:38:44,243 --> 00:38:47,698
Another couple of minutes
that would've been perfect.

885
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:49,458
It's a real shame.

886
00:38:49,483 --> 00:38:51,778
Paul and Prue will now rank
the custard creams

887
00:38:51,803 --> 00:38:53,418
from worst to best.

888
00:38:53,443 --> 00:38:56,618
In 11th place, we have this one.

889
00:38:56,643 --> 00:38:59,378
Keith, they're a bit of a mess.
Bit misshapen.

890
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,698
They look like they were done
in a rush.

891
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:04,298
In 10th spot, we have this one.

892
00:39:04,323 --> 00:39:07,858
Saku, a real mess and too soft,
slightly under baked.

893
00:39:08,923 --> 00:39:10,738
In ninth place, we have this one.

894
00:39:10,763 --> 00:39:12,658
Cristy, they're a bit uneven.

895
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,418
And so, you don't get
the definition.

896
00:39:14,443 --> 00:39:16,018
Tasha's in eighth place,

897
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:17,218
Dana seventh,

898
00:39:17,243 --> 00:39:18,258
Josh sixth,

899
00:39:18,283 --> 00:39:19,418
Matty fifth

900
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:21,018
and Nicky in fourth.

901
00:39:21,043 --> 00:39:23,338
And in third place,
we have this one.

902
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:25,298
Rowan, they're really nice,

903
00:39:25,323 --> 00:39:26,978
they're just a little bit soft.

904
00:39:28,203 --> 00:39:29,818
In second, we have this one.

905
00:39:29,843 --> 00:39:30,843
Whose is this?

906
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:34,258
To be honest,
these were pretty good,

907
00:39:34,283 --> 00:39:35,618
just not as good as number one.

908
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:36,858
Well done.

909
00:39:36,883 --> 00:39:39,578
Which means the winner is this one.

910
00:39:39,603 --> 00:39:43,138
Abbi! Pretty well perfect
custard creams, well done.

911
00:39:47,923 --> 00:39:50,258
I'm just so, so relieved!

912
00:39:50,283 --> 00:39:53,018
I mean, "Better than a commercial
custard cream.”

913
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:55,538
That's high praise.
I'm really pleased about that.

914
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:57,338
I pulled that out the bag,
didn't I, really.

915
00:39:57,363 --> 00:40:00,338
That is so much better than last
week when I came 12th.

916
00:40:00,363 --> 00:40:02,058
I can have a drink tonight now!

917
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:03,418
Seventh place!

918
00:40:05,963 --> 00:40:08,938
Just the Showstopper remains
before Paul and Prue decide

919
00:40:08,963 --> 00:40:10,778
who will be leaving the tent

920
00:40:10,803 --> 00:40:13,298
and who will be crowned
this week's Star Baker.

921
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:15,618
I'm really enjoying biscuit week.

922
00:40:15,643 --> 00:40:19,618
For me, highlight, Tasha's
handshake. That was incredible.

923
00:40:19,643 --> 00:40:22,778
I missed it. It was my first one,
it was amazing. Well deserved.

924
00:40:22,803 --> 00:40:25,858
It was well deserved. She dropped
a little bit in the Tech.

925
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:29,258
I'd like to see her do really
well in the Showstopper. Yes.

926
00:40:29,283 --> 00:40:32,898
So who do you think is in danger of
going? I think Keith is in trouble.

927
00:40:32,923 --> 00:40:36,578
The actual marshmallow biscuit
he created looked awful.

928
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:39,338
I mean, really big lumps
of nuts on the top.

929
00:40:39,363 --> 00:40:41,338
But the taste was very good.

930
00:40:41,363 --> 00:40:43,898
I think Dana is in
a little bit of trouble.

931
00:40:43,923 --> 00:40:47,098
Struggled in the Sig and she
was seventh in the Technical.

932
00:40:47,123 --> 00:40:50,018
What about No Jam Nicky?
That was the funniest.

933
00:40:50,043 --> 00:40:53,018
No Jam Nicky!
She had literally no jam whatsoever.

934
00:40:53,043 --> 00:40:56,818
She picked two flavours, rhubarb
and ginger, which really bring a flavour.

935
00:40:56,843 --> 00:40:59,458
Beautiful flavours
and then hardly put them in.

936
00:40:59,483 --> 00:41:02,058
Who is in line for Star Baker
at the moment?

937
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:04,098
Rowan. Tash.

938
00:41:04,123 --> 00:41:07,378
I can't call it. I can't call it,
can you call it? Nobody can.

939
00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:10,138
Not even the god of baking,
Paul Hollywood!

940
00:41:10,163 --> 00:41:12,058
No, not even Paul Hollywood.

941
00:41:16,363 --> 00:41:17,938
Morning, bakers.

942
00:41:17,963 --> 00:41:20,298
For your Showstopper challenge,

943
00:41:20,323 --> 00:41:25,938
Prue and Paul would like you to make
an amazing illusion biscuit display,

944
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,978
which is depicting
your favourite meal.

945
00:41:29,003 --> 00:41:31,578
What if their favourite meal
is a plate of biscuits?

946
00:41:31,603 --> 00:41:33,938
You didn't think about that,
did you, Paul?

947
00:41:33,963 --> 00:41:37,738
Now, you can choose any style of
biscuit. It's completely up to you.

948
00:41:37,763 --> 00:41:41,578
But it's got a taste amazing
and look visually realistic.

949
00:41:41,603 --> 00:41:45,098
You have four hours,
which seems a hell of a lot of time.

950
00:41:45,123 --> 00:41:47,698
On your marks. Get set. Bake.

951
00:41:50,403 --> 00:41:53,658
I'm looking forward to the challenge
today. It's a bit different, isn't it?

952
00:41:53,683 --> 00:41:57,258
It's like something you never think
of doing basically, so it's pretty cool.

953
00:41:57,283 --> 00:41:59,578
I feel like I'm a very
creative person,

954
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:01,498
so I love coming up with new ideas.

955
00:42:01,523 --> 00:42:04,738
So it's kind of like my way,
I can finally get inventive.

956
00:42:04,763 --> 00:42:07,058
I'm very excited, I really am.

957
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:12,858
We've asked them to make a meal or
a banquet scene out of biscuits.

958
00:42:12,883 --> 00:42:17,298
It could be burgers, it could be pizzas, it
could be anything. Mine personally? Pizza.

959
00:42:17,323 --> 00:42:19,978
They really have to be a little
bit artistic with this

960
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:23,378
and certainly a little bit of
sculpting knowledge would be useful.

961
00:42:23,403 --> 00:42:26,258
Nearly all the biscuits they bake
are going to have to be a very

962
00:42:26,283 --> 00:42:29,938
specific shape, so there is a real
danger of overworking the dough.

963
00:42:29,963 --> 00:42:33,458
And we all know that if you
overwork the dough it gets tough

964
00:42:33,483 --> 00:42:37,378
and loses its crumbly texture
and its crack.

965
00:42:37,403 --> 00:42:39,938
We want the biscuits
to taste good, look good,

966
00:42:39,963 --> 00:42:42,018
but look like something else.

967
00:42:42,043 --> 00:42:44,418
I want it to really have
that wow factor

968
00:42:44,443 --> 00:42:46,418
because it is the Showstopper

969
00:42:46,443 --> 00:42:48,898
and certainly for one baker
it's their last bake.

970
00:42:50,523 --> 00:42:54,058
Hello, Josh. Hello. Hello, Josh.
Right, Josh, illusion bake.

971
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:56,898
What are you doing?
I am doing burger and fries.

972
00:42:56,923 --> 00:42:59,258
I've got five different
types of biscuit.

973
00:42:59,283 --> 00:43:01,618
I've got a gingerbread
for the chopping board

974
00:43:01,643 --> 00:43:03,658
and then the burger
is going to be a Florentine.

975
00:43:03,683 --> 00:43:07,058
Florentine, that's a very good idea.
It looks so realistic as well.

976
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:10,578
Josh's gingerbread board will
display his orange shortbread fries

977
00:43:10,603 --> 00:43:14,138
and his towering burger complete
with his Florentine patties,

978
00:43:14,163 --> 00:43:16,178
almond flavoured burger buns

979
00:43:16,203 --> 00:43:19,138
and salad made from strawberry
flavoured sugar biscuits.

980
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,698
I love this idea. You've thought
this through really well.

981
00:43:21,723 --> 00:43:23,698
Do you know what would
really help you?

982
00:43:23,723 --> 00:43:26,298
If you get a real burger and chips
and put it to the side,

983
00:43:26,323 --> 00:43:29,458
just so we've got something to look
at the difference between the two.

984
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:32,058
Shall we order it now? Yes.
You might lose it though.

985
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:35,578
It might disappear down Paul's neck!
See you, Josh. Well done.

986
00:43:36,643 --> 00:43:41,058
Josh isn't the only baker recreating
their favourite fast food feast.

987
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,338
So I am making pizza.

988
00:43:43,363 --> 00:43:45,418
It was an absolute no-brainer.

989
00:43:45,443 --> 00:43:48,418
I literally probably have pizza
every Friday night.

990
00:43:48,443 --> 00:43:50,738
Dana's gravity defined pizza

991
00:43:50,763 --> 00:43:53,818
will comprise a maple pecan
shortbread base,

992
00:43:53,843 --> 00:43:56,578
date rolled stuffed crust
and a tuile pepperoni.

993
00:43:56,603 --> 00:43:59,978
What happened in the Signature?
Paul said he did like it.

994
00:44:00,003 --> 00:44:02,978
He literally said those words.
What about Prue? Prue liked it.

995
00:44:03,003 --> 00:44:05,778
It's not enough though, is it?
It was very good cop, bad cop.

996
00:44:05,803 --> 00:44:09,018
You need blue eyes to like it,
don't you? Are you slightly angry?

997
00:44:09,043 --> 00:44:10,338
Livid.

998
00:44:11,643 --> 00:44:13,218
First batch in.

999
00:44:13,243 --> 00:44:15,178
With multiple batches to bake

1000
00:44:15,203 --> 00:44:18,298
in various shapes, sizes,
thicknesses and doughs...

1001
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,898
That's going to go in the oven
for 36 minutes.

1002
00:44:20,923 --> 00:44:24,298
the bakers will need to work
as efficiently as possible...

1003
00:44:24,323 --> 00:44:26,618
Right, behave yourselves.

1004
00:44:26,643 --> 00:44:30,138
if they are to keep their biscuit
production line running smoothly.

1005
00:44:30,163 --> 00:44:31,858
There is just so much to do.

1006
00:44:31,883 --> 00:44:34,618
I've selected things and done them
at the right thickness,

1007
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:38,578
so the oven temperature doesn't really need to
change much at all throughout the whole bake.

1008
00:44:38,603 --> 00:44:41,338
I bake these, then they come out.
Then I bake my steamer basket.

1009
00:44:41,363 --> 00:44:43,698
Then I bake the other half
of my steamer basket.

1010
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,178
Then I bake my dumplings.
Then I bake my other dumplings.

1011
00:44:46,203 --> 00:44:48,218
Then I do the batter ones
towards the end.

1012
00:44:48,243 --> 00:44:51,498
Just got to tick everything off to
make sure I don't miss anything.

1013
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,418
I'm going to do like a cheeseboard.

1014
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:57,458
I've made marzipan to go on top of the
biscotti to give you the cured meat illusion.

1015
00:44:57,483 --> 00:45:00,018
What's happening here?
Is that bacon?

1016
00:45:00,043 --> 00:45:03,498
I knew it looked like bacon, but it's not.
What is it? It's supposed to be Parma ham.

1017
00:45:03,523 --> 00:45:06,978
Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, it does
look like Parma ham. Does it? Yeah.

1018
00:45:07,003 --> 00:45:09,898
Alongside her marzipan ham
covered biscotti,

1019
00:45:09,923 --> 00:45:13,898
Cristy's grazing board will feature
fondant-topped ginger biscuits

1020
00:45:13,923 --> 00:45:16,458
masquerading as slices of cheese,

1021
00:45:16,483 --> 00:45:19,018
and chorizo and orange
and pistachio biscuits

1022
00:45:19,043 --> 00:45:21,698
that will be stacked to make
an array of cheeses.

1023
00:45:21,723 --> 00:45:23,018
Look at the bacon!

1024
00:45:23,043 --> 00:45:24,338
It's Parma ham.

1025
00:45:24,363 --> 00:45:26,418
It's Parma ham. It's not bacon.

1026
00:45:26,443 --> 00:45:28,298
Same thing, innit?
That's what I said!

1027
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:31,938
It does look like bacon. All right,
don't laugh at me.

1028
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:34,778
Cristy's not the only baker counting
on cured meat

1029
00:45:34,803 --> 00:45:36,218
to make an impression.

1030
00:45:36,243 --> 00:45:38,698
This is sugar cookie prosciutto.

1031
00:45:38,723 --> 00:45:40,738
I love a charcuterie night
with my mates.

1032
00:45:40,763 --> 00:45:43,098
It's quite nice to get everyone
around the dinner table,

1033
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:46,058
and you can just kind of chill out,
talk to people,

1034
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:48,698
eat some really smelly cheese,

1035
00:45:48,723 --> 00:45:51,538
and gorge on crackers and down
the wine. It's great.

1036
00:45:51,563 --> 00:45:54,938
Featuring prosciutto sugar biscuits,
and slices of bread

1037
00:45:54,963 --> 00:45:57,658
and cheese made from Polish
gingerbread,

1038
00:45:57,683 --> 00:46:01,658
Rowan's attempting a recreation of
his favourite student night in.

1039
00:46:01,683 --> 00:46:03,458
So you've got a cupboard full
of Pinot

1040
00:46:03,483 --> 00:46:05,778
and a load of charcuterie in
the fridge? Yeah.

1041
00:46:05,803 --> 00:46:07,338
And that's your university life?

1042
00:46:07,363 --> 00:46:09,938
That's me, yeah. Question, how do
you afford all this?

1043
00:46:09,963 --> 00:46:12,298
This is like...
You're at university.

1044
00:46:12,323 --> 00:46:14,658
I'm at uni. Yet you're having
one of these boards?

1045
00:46:14,683 --> 00:46:18,498
You don't want to see my overdraft,
Alison. You don't. I don't.

1046
00:46:18,523 --> 00:46:21,498
The battle of the grazing boards has
a third contender.

1047
00:46:21,523 --> 00:46:23,418
It's like a cheese board is
what I'm going for.

1048
00:46:23,443 --> 00:46:26,298
There's going to be a brie,
camembert, Swiss,

1049
00:46:26,323 --> 00:46:29,698
some crackers. Yeah, I've got
tonnes to do.

1050
00:46:29,723 --> 00:46:32,138
Yeah, maybe too much. We'll see.

1051
00:46:32,163 --> 00:46:34,538
Matty's ambitious cheese board
will be made up

1052
00:46:34,563 --> 00:46:37,298
of six different biscuits,
including two shortbreads,

1053
00:46:37,323 --> 00:46:40,418
macaron grapes,
and garibaldi crackers.

1054
00:46:40,443 --> 00:46:42,378
Who do you think your toughest

1055
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:45,178
competition is?
Anyone you're scared of?

1056
00:46:45,203 --> 00:46:47,938
Abbi. Abbi. It's so nerve-racking
being behind

1057
00:46:47,963 --> 00:46:50,898
Abbi as well, cos I can see
everything she's doing.

1058
00:46:50,923 --> 00:46:52,458
This is my steamer basket.

1059
00:46:52,483 --> 00:46:54,378
This is the lattice part of it.

1060
00:46:54,403 --> 00:46:57,778
So for my Showstopper, I am making
a dim sum brunch

1061
00:46:57,803 --> 00:47:00,338
because I love Chinese food.

1062
00:47:00,363 --> 00:47:02,298
And I like cooking it a lot,

1063
00:47:02,323 --> 00:47:04,058
it's like my favourite thing
to cook.

1064
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:05,779
So I thought, you know what,
I'll give it a go,

1065
00:47:05,803 --> 00:47:07,098
make it out of biscuit.

1066
00:47:07,123 --> 00:47:09,138
Abbi's dim sum feast will
see marzipan

1067
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:11,658
and cherry-filled brandy snap spring
rolls,

1068
00:47:11,683 --> 00:47:14,338
alongside a lemon and Earl Grey
biscuit steamer

1069
00:47:14,363 --> 00:47:17,738
and apricot and pistachio filled
biscuit dumplings.

1070
00:47:17,763 --> 00:47:21,018
And I'm also making fortune cookies,
which aren't technically an illusion

1071
00:47:21,043 --> 00:47:24,738
but it feels like it wouldn't be
complete without fortune cookies.

1072
00:47:24,763 --> 00:47:28,298
So, I've written some
little fortunes.

1073
00:47:28,323 --> 00:47:31,778
One says - Watch out, things are
getting "in tents".

1074
00:47:31,803 --> 00:47:33,058
Cos we're in a tent.

1075
00:47:34,403 --> 00:47:38,738
Also trying to impress with
an East Asian theme is Tasha.

1076
00:47:38,763 --> 00:47:42,338
I'm making a Japanese katsu.

1077
00:47:42,363 --> 00:47:43,698
When my friends and I go to

1078
00:47:43,723 --> 00:47:47,298
a new Japanese restaurant we always
kind of base

1079
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:51,938
our judgment of the restaurant on
how well they do the katsu.

1080
00:47:53,243 --> 00:47:56,978
Tasha's biscuity take on her
benchmark meal will see orange

1081
00:47:57,003 --> 00:47:59,298
and almond biscotti chicken,

1082
00:47:59,323 --> 00:48:02,098
an intricately painted Palet Breton
biscuit bowl

1083
00:48:02,123 --> 00:48:04,458
and match a Viennese cups.

1084
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:06,738
You had an up and down day
yesterday.

1085
00:48:08,563 --> 00:48:11,058
I think in the technical you did OK,

1086
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:13,498
but in the signature you smashed it
out the park.

1087
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:16,218
I expect today to be as good as
your signature.

1088
00:48:16,243 --> 00:48:20,218
No pressure. No pressure. See you
later, Tash. Thank you.

1089
00:48:20,243 --> 00:48:21,978
My God.

1090
00:48:22,003 --> 00:48:25,218
While Tasha toils to recreate
yesterday's success,

1091
00:48:25,243 --> 00:48:29,218
one baker is hoping history won't be
repeating itself today.

1092
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:31,778
I'm hoping to present you
with something that looks

1093
00:48:31,803 --> 00:48:34,098
a bit better than the two dog's
breakfasts

1094
00:48:34,123 --> 00:48:35,898
that I presented you with yesterday.

1095
00:48:35,923 --> 00:48:37,458
Well, they tasted great.

1096
00:48:37,483 --> 00:48:40,698
I've called it my Lee on
Solent lunchtime meal deal.

1097
00:48:42,163 --> 00:48:45,578
I work from home and I live near
the seaside,

1098
00:48:45,603 --> 00:48:48,378
so quite often when I make my lunch,
I'll go down to

1099
00:48:48,403 --> 00:48:51,098
the seaside and sit on the beach
for half an hour. That's lovely.

1100
00:48:51,123 --> 00:48:53,619
And eat your meal deal. See the
waves coming in, eat my meal deal.

1101
00:48:53,643 --> 00:48:55,098
And if I've been a good boy

1102
00:48:55,123 --> 00:48:57,658
and I've worked hard in
the morning, I treat myself to

1103
00:48:57,683 --> 00:48:59,658
a pink and white squirty ice cream.

1104
00:48:59,683 --> 00:49:01,138
Keith's Viennese biscuit

1105
00:49:01,163 --> 00:49:04,738
and raspberry butter cream ice cream
cone will sit beside his shortbread

1106
00:49:04,763 --> 00:49:08,378
ham and tomato sandwich with
a spiced biscuit crust,

1107
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:12,738
and a portion of almond tuile crisps
contained within their cylindrical

1108
00:49:12,763 --> 00:49:13,978
gingerbread packaging.

1109
00:49:14,003 --> 00:49:17,898
I'm creating the two halves
of my Pringles tube.

1110
00:49:17,923 --> 00:49:21,138
But of course as soon as
the heat hits it,

1111
00:49:21,163 --> 00:49:23,458
it all flops down to the bottom
of the oven,

1112
00:49:23,483 --> 00:49:24,938
so I've got to really watch them.

1113
00:49:26,043 --> 00:49:27,258
So that goes in.

1114
00:49:28,763 --> 00:49:33,658
There's two things I've got to put
on - the timer and glasses.

1115
00:49:33,683 --> 00:49:35,978
So I can see what's going on.

1116
00:49:36,003 --> 00:49:39,218
I'm just going to brush
the garibaldi with some egg white.

1117
00:49:39,243 --> 00:49:41,538
I think it gives it a glaze.

1118
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:45,298
That I'm then going to hide with
fondant. So why are we bothering?

1119
00:49:45,323 --> 00:49:47,899
These are the burger buns. They've
kept their shape really nicely.

1120
00:49:47,923 --> 00:49:50,538
While it's important
the bakers' biscuits showcase

1121
00:49:50,563 --> 00:49:53,138
a variety of tastes and textures...

1122
00:49:53,163 --> 00:49:54,618
Biscotti in.

1123
00:49:54,643 --> 00:49:56,378
This is the burger

1124
00:49:56,403 --> 00:49:57,818
and it's a Florentine burger,

1125
00:49:57,843 --> 00:50:00,298
so I've got walnuts, pecans
and almonds in there.

1126
00:50:00,323 --> 00:50:03,818
Paul and Prue are expecting
convincing illusion biscuits...

1127
00:50:03,843 --> 00:50:05,138
These are the gingerbread cups.

1128
00:50:05,163 --> 00:50:07,858
so the bakers need to get creative
with their moulds.

1129
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:09,658
This is the steamer basket.

1130
00:50:09,683 --> 00:50:11,018
This basically is just

1131
00:50:11,043 --> 00:50:13,458
to hold everything in place
while it bakes.

1132
00:50:13,483 --> 00:50:16,578
And hope their choice
of biscuit is robust enough.

1133
00:50:16,603 --> 00:50:21,178
Trying to make a bowl.
This is the Palet Breton.

1134
00:50:21,203 --> 00:50:23,898
It's really strong. I tried
different doughs

1135
00:50:23,923 --> 00:50:26,258
and they just kind of melted in
the oven.

1136
00:50:26,283 --> 00:50:28,138
And Keith's gingerbread
crisp tubes...

1137
00:50:28,163 --> 00:50:29,458
BLEEP.

1138
00:50:29,483 --> 00:50:31,258
have done just that.

1139
00:50:31,283 --> 00:50:32,938
I can't believe the state of this.

1140
00:50:34,403 --> 00:50:37,418
The two halves of the cylinder,
they've both slid off.

1141
00:50:37,443 --> 00:50:38,458
Yeah, a bit panicky.

1142
00:50:40,283 --> 00:50:42,898
I made sure I made plenty of
gingerbread

1143
00:50:42,923 --> 00:50:45,578
for fear of this happening.

1144
00:50:47,203 --> 00:50:50,018
But I can't afford
to get it wrong twice.

1145
00:50:54,403 --> 00:50:56,738
Bakers, you have halfway left.

1146
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:57,898
Halfway left?

1147
00:50:57,923 --> 00:50:59,818
You're halfway left.

1148
00:50:59,843 --> 00:51:00,978
Halfway there.

1149
00:51:01,003 --> 00:51:03,818
I've got my next try at
the gingerbread cylinder.

1150
00:51:03,843 --> 00:51:06,778
I would say it's slightly better.
I just...

1151
00:51:06,803 --> 00:51:09,818
I'm really desperate for this
to happen.

1152
00:51:09,843 --> 00:51:13,138
As Keith's crisp tube takes
a second shot in the oven,

1153
00:51:13,163 --> 00:51:16,178
the other bakers' illusions are
starting to take shape.

1154
00:51:16,203 --> 00:51:21,338
Now I'm just assembling the little
pizza and the stuffed crust.

1155
00:51:21,363 --> 00:51:23,258
This is the camembert.

1156
00:51:23,283 --> 00:51:25,818
This is one of my two different
shapes of dumplings,

1157
00:51:25,843 --> 00:51:28,858
and I'm just filling it with
apricot and pistachio filling.

1158
00:51:28,883 --> 00:51:31,218
I've got my tomato rings
with the strawberry biscuit.

1159
00:51:31,243 --> 00:51:32,938
I've put some crushed
boiled sweets,

1160
00:51:32,963 --> 00:51:34,458
into there and they're going to
melt,

1161
00:51:34,483 --> 00:51:36,978
and they'll form the watery bit
inside a tomato.

1162
00:51:37,003 --> 00:51:39,538
Saku, is that real onions?
Yeah, that's real onion.

1163
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,898
But you're not supposed
to do real onions, babe.

1164
00:51:41,923 --> 00:51:45,178
You're supposed to make it look like
onion. It is a side dish.

1165
00:51:45,203 --> 00:51:46,498
But it's real onions?

1166
00:51:49,763 --> 00:51:50,898
Really?

1167
00:51:50,923 --> 00:51:54,058
Alongside Saku's onions will be
a biscuit rendering of

1168
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:57,218
a traditional Sri Lankan breakfast,
featuring coconut

1169
00:51:57,243 --> 00:51:59,018
and cardamom biscuit hoppers,

1170
00:51:59,043 --> 00:52:01,858
rotis of cheddar, rosemary and black
pepper,

1171
00:52:01,883 --> 00:52:05,018
and a chocolate and coffee
biscuit chicken curry.

1172
00:52:05,043 --> 00:52:07,658
Sri Lankan breakfast is
very filling.

1173
00:52:07,683 --> 00:52:10,978
So you can hold on for
the whole day until dinner time,

1174
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:15,298
maybe lunch time for me, after
having that breakfast.

1175
00:52:17,603 --> 00:52:20,458
Of course Sri Lankan food is
the best in the world!

1176
00:52:22,203 --> 00:52:23,978
Without a doubt.

1177
00:52:24,003 --> 00:52:25,898
Saku might be trying to recreate

1178
00:52:25,923 --> 00:52:27,858
a traditional Sri Lankan breakfast,

1179
00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:30,458
but Nicky has some traditions
of her own.

1180
00:52:30,483 --> 00:52:32,938
I'm just sandwiching
the biscuits together now

1181
00:52:32,963 --> 00:52:35,418
to sort of resemble a wee bit
of steak.

1182
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,218
So I'm doing a steak pie

1183
00:52:37,243 --> 00:52:40,618
because even now when I go home,

1184
00:52:40,643 --> 00:52:42,338
Mum always cooks a steak pie.

1185
00:52:43,483 --> 00:52:45,778
Beneath her shortbread pie crust,

1186
00:52:45,803 --> 00:52:48,138
Nicky's chocolate steak biscuits
will be sandwiched with

1187
00:52:48,163 --> 00:52:50,058
a hazelnut and orange ganache.

1188
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,818
Rosehip marzipan peas and shortbread
chips will sit alongside on

1189
00:52:53,843 --> 00:52:56,298
a plate of decorated gingerbread.

1190
00:52:56,323 --> 00:52:59,538
I believe Dan is doing
a pie as well.

1191
00:52:59,563 --> 00:53:01,338
No pressure again. Just seems

1192
00:53:01,363 --> 00:53:04,298
to be all I ever do is get
under pressure, doesn't it?

1193
00:53:04,323 --> 00:53:06,578
Yeah, cos Dan's pretty good.

1194
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:09,178
So, I don't know how I'll get on.

1195
00:53:10,403 --> 00:53:13,578
So I am doing a cheese
and onion pie.

1196
00:53:13,603 --> 00:53:15,379
When I shout from the kitchen,
"What pie do you

1197
00:53:15,403 --> 00:53:17,298
"want for tea this weekend?",
it's always cheese

1198
00:53:17,323 --> 00:53:19,978
and onion pie.
Yeah, so it's a firm favourite.

1199
00:53:20,003 --> 00:53:21,818
Sat on gingerbread plates,

1200
00:53:21,843 --> 00:53:24,738
Dan's shortbread pie pastry
will be sliced

1201
00:53:24,763 --> 00:53:27,218
to reveal pistachio
shortbread onions

1202
00:53:27,243 --> 00:53:29,498
and an orange curd cheese sauce.

1203
00:53:29,523 --> 00:53:31,018
Nestled next to his pie will be

1204
00:53:31,043 --> 00:53:35,418
a generous portion of shortbread
peas and vanilla biscuit chips.

1205
00:53:35,443 --> 00:53:38,218
Quite a mess, your work station.
It's giving me a panic attack.

1206
00:53:38,243 --> 00:53:41,498
I know. I'm in the process of
clearing my decks at the moment.

1207
00:53:41,523 --> 00:53:44,578
You know who loves that? Paul
Hollywood.

1208
00:53:44,603 --> 00:53:46,058
Like, this would freak him out.

1209
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:48,418
Yeah, I know. He'd just be like,
"Argh!" That's why he

1210
00:53:48,443 --> 00:53:50,859
was just like tutting and shaking
his head walking past me before.

1211
00:53:50,883 --> 00:53:52,858
Have you ever seen one
of his work stations?

1212
00:53:52,883 --> 00:53:54,378
No. Denim.

1213
00:53:55,843 --> 00:53:56,898
Starched denim.

1214
00:53:59,843 --> 00:54:02,258
Bakers, you have one hour left.

1215
00:54:02,283 --> 00:54:04,578
It's so exciting, just one hour.

1216
00:54:04,603 --> 00:54:09,738
Ooh. Cannot begin to tell you how
relieved I am with that.

1217
00:54:11,523 --> 00:54:14,978
With his crisp tube trauma in
the past, Keith is free

1218
00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:16,818
to finish his final batches...

1219
00:54:16,843 --> 00:54:19,818
I'm making these things called tuile
biscuits

1220
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:22,338
to represent crisps.

1221
00:54:22,363 --> 00:54:25,218
and the rest of the bakers can
start bringing their illusions

1222
00:54:25,243 --> 00:54:26,898
to life with decoration.

1223
00:54:26,923 --> 00:54:29,218
So, yeah, I love this bit.

1224
00:54:29,243 --> 00:54:32,978
I'm just painting up
the gingerbread plate.

1225
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,978
It's quite hard cos the icing's
not set.

1226
00:54:36,003 --> 00:54:38,858
This is what makes it look
like bamboo.

1227
00:54:38,883 --> 00:54:41,378
Doing some lattice work here
to achieve the red

1228
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,138
and white chequered parchment you
usually get your burger served on.

1229
00:54:45,363 --> 00:54:46,898
Cut this, cut this.

1230
00:54:46,923 --> 00:54:48,738
Chuff tog heck. I'm looking around

1231
00:54:48,763 --> 00:54:52,738
and everybody's is so good
and realistic.

1232
00:54:52,763 --> 00:54:53,763
This is shocking.

1233
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:59,818
Bakers, you have 30 minutes left.

1234
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:02,138
I'm putting melted chocolate onto
these florentines just

1235
00:55:02,163 --> 00:55:03,419
to make them look like the burgers.

1236
00:55:03,443 --> 00:55:05,738
Is there anything I can do
to help you? No.

1237
00:55:05,763 --> 00:55:07,019
Do you want to get on my shoulders?

1238
00:55:07,043 --> 00:55:08,818
No. OK, maybe later.

1239
00:55:08,843 --> 00:55:09,978
But thank you.

1240
00:55:12,323 --> 00:55:15,818
This is royal icing which is
the tomato sauce.

1241
00:55:15,843 --> 00:55:18,138
My favourite bit actually is
the tomato rings.

1242
00:55:18,163 --> 00:55:19,618
They look really, really pretty.

1243
00:55:20,923 --> 00:55:24,738
This is meant to represent the seeds
of the tomato.

1244
00:55:24,763 --> 00:55:27,218
The top of the camembert,
I've just torched it.

1245
00:55:27,243 --> 00:55:28,738
This is white chocolate

1246
00:55:28,763 --> 00:55:32,098
and this is creating
the cheese pull for the pizza.

1247
00:55:32,123 --> 00:55:34,778
Just got to make the brie look like
the brie.

1248
00:55:34,803 --> 00:55:36,299
Yeah, we're getting there now,
aren't we?

1249
00:55:36,323 --> 00:55:38,738
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

1250
00:55:38,763 --> 00:55:40,738
Scissors, scissors, scissors!

1251
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:44,538
Get some chips on,
let's see how they look.

1252
00:55:44,563 --> 00:55:46,898
I do like my chips on
the darker side.

1253
00:55:46,923 --> 00:55:50,418
Just piping the grapes
and the olives.

1254
00:55:50,443 --> 00:55:51,658
How long do we have?

1255
00:55:51,683 --> 00:55:53,898
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1256
00:55:57,163 --> 00:55:59,178
Tuile pepperoni.

1257
00:55:59,203 --> 00:56:00,898
Taking it to the wire.

1258
00:56:03,643 --> 00:56:05,098
They're little gherkins.

1259
00:56:05,123 --> 00:56:06,778
Right.

1260
00:56:06,803 --> 00:56:09,418
Bakers, that is time up.

1261
00:56:09,443 --> 00:56:11,698
Please step away from
your Showstoppers.

1262
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,418
It's so bad.

1263
00:56:15,443 --> 00:56:19,778
First time in three things I haven't
had an absolutely mad panic.

1264
00:56:19,803 --> 00:56:21,218
Have I forgotten anything?

1265
00:56:21,243 --> 00:56:22,858
Josh's is BLEEP outrageous.

1266
00:56:22,883 --> 00:56:24,618
Yeah, that's sick, innit?

1267
00:56:29,923 --> 00:56:34,298
It's judgment time for the bakers'
biscuit illusion banquets.

1268
00:56:34,323 --> 00:56:37,578
Tasha, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

1269
00:56:45,483 --> 00:56:47,298
I think it looks good.

1270
00:56:47,323 --> 00:56:49,618
Thank you.

1271
00:56:49,643 --> 00:56:51,378
It's very pretty.

1272
00:56:51,403 --> 00:56:54,618
It does give the illusion of being
a chicken katsu.

1273
00:56:54,643 --> 00:56:56,938
Um, I'll take a little bit of the...

1274
00:56:56,963 --> 00:57:00,218
It is a Palet Breton lemon-flavoured
bowl.

1275
00:57:00,243 --> 00:57:02,618
Good, isn't it?

1276
00:57:02,643 --> 00:57:04,938
That biscuit is nice
and sharp with flavour.

1277
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,738
Limoncello comes through nicely.

1278
00:57:06,763 --> 00:57:08,458
Let's have some of the chicken.

1279
00:57:08,483 --> 00:57:12,378
This one is an orange and almond
biscotti coated in white chocolate.

1280
00:57:12,403 --> 00:57:14,138
That biscotti's delicious.

1281
00:57:15,483 --> 00:57:18,218
I love the crunch, the flavour.

1282
00:57:18,243 --> 00:57:20,858
The texture's spot on.
Really good.

1283
00:57:20,883 --> 00:57:23,538
Both of those biscuits are perfect.

1284
00:57:23,563 --> 00:57:26,538
You have set a bar that's
a little bit high.

1285
00:57:26,563 --> 00:57:27,898
Well done.

1286
00:57:27,923 --> 00:57:29,378
Thank you so much.

1287
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,978
Well, I think that it looks
wonderful.

1288
00:57:34,003 --> 00:57:36,258
Let's have a look at this.
That's the ginger.

1289
00:57:39,563 --> 00:57:42,858
Ginger's got a good flavour,
nice and warm.

1290
00:57:42,883 --> 00:57:44,338
Is this a biscotti? Yeah.

1291
00:57:44,363 --> 00:57:46,698
Almond and dried cherry.

1292
00:57:46,723 --> 00:57:49,018
Biscotti's very nice,
it's nice and tangy.

1293
00:57:49,043 --> 00:57:50,338
I think you've done well.

1294
00:57:50,363 --> 00:57:51,858
It's smart, it's neat. Well done.

1295
00:57:51,883 --> 00:57:53,218
Thank you, guys.

1296
00:57:55,523 --> 00:57:57,139
We'll start...
we'll have a look at these.

1297
00:57:57,163 --> 00:57:58,378
These are...

1298
00:57:58,403 --> 00:58:01,538
It's a spiced black pepper
gingerbread type thing.

1299
00:58:01,563 --> 00:58:02,898
Good flavour.

1300
00:58:02,923 --> 00:58:04,738
Texture's softened slightly,

1301
00:58:04,763 --> 00:58:06,778
because of the topping on it.

1302
00:58:06,803 --> 00:58:08,738
The illusion bit doesn't work
all that well.

1303
00:58:08,763 --> 00:58:11,258
After a while, you realise that's
maybe salami on top.

1304
00:58:11,283 --> 00:58:12,698
Is that right? Yeah.

1305
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:15,738
But I do like the flavours,
your flavours are good.

1306
00:58:15,763 --> 00:58:17,178
Yeah.

1307
00:58:20,523 --> 00:58:22,859
It's a terrific illusion. I mean,
as soon as you look at it,

1308
00:58:22,883 --> 00:58:25,378
it really looks like a cheeseboard.

1309
00:58:25,403 --> 00:58:27,818
These sort of crackers,
this is the one I want to try.

1310
00:58:27,843 --> 00:58:29,418
I saw you making these.

1311
00:58:29,443 --> 00:58:32,378
Yeah, they looked as if they were
stuffed with cranberries.

1312
00:58:32,403 --> 00:58:35,018
Very crumbly shortbread.

1313
00:58:35,043 --> 00:58:36,418
It's lovely. Yeah.

1314
00:58:36,443 --> 00:58:37,978
Well done, Matty. Thank you, Matty.

1315
00:58:38,003 --> 00:58:39,018
Thank you, cheers.

1316
00:58:42,123 --> 00:58:44,098
I think it's clever.

1317
00:58:44,123 --> 00:58:47,018
I'm not quite sure I've seen
many tomatoes...

1318
00:58:47,043 --> 00:58:48,818
like that. No.

1319
00:58:48,843 --> 00:58:51,098
They're from the south coast. We...

1320
00:58:51,123 --> 00:58:53,018
We have very good...

1321
00:58:53,043 --> 00:58:55,378
We have very good growing
conditions,

1322
00:58:55,403 --> 00:58:57,058
and you get that redness.
That's amazing.

1323
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:59,698
I do like the way you've done
the bread. Dear.

1324
00:58:59,723 --> 00:59:01,298
It's very soft.

1325
00:59:01,323 --> 00:59:02,498
Great flavour.

1326
00:59:02,523 --> 00:59:04,818
Your flavours are always good.

1327
00:59:04,843 --> 00:59:08,498
The issue is, I shouldn't be able to
push my finger in like that. No.

1328
00:59:08,523 --> 00:59:10,018
It's too soft.

1329
00:59:10,043 --> 00:59:12,338
The ham slice in the middle,
is that the same?

1330
00:59:12,363 --> 00:59:13,298
Yes.

1331
00:59:13,323 --> 00:59:14,898
That is much better baked.

1332
00:59:14,923 --> 00:59:16,658
Right, the ice cream.

1333
00:59:16,683 --> 00:59:19,858
It's vanilla-flavoured Viennese
and raspberry butter cream.

1334
00:59:19,883 --> 00:59:22,378
Slightly raw inside the biscuit.

1335
00:59:22,403 --> 00:59:24,898
You struggled on this one a bit,
Keith.

1336
00:59:29,643 --> 00:59:32,218
I have to say, I've never seen
a pizza that deep.

1337
00:59:32,243 --> 00:59:34,498
Neither have I, to be honest!

1338
00:59:34,523 --> 00:59:36,218
But that's the dream.

1339
00:59:36,243 --> 00:59:38,938
So, the bottom two are the
shortbread,

1340
00:59:38,963 --> 00:59:43,258
and the top is just a vanilla
biscuit with the date filling.

1341
00:59:44,123 --> 00:59:45,858
Well, I enjoyed all that a lot.

1342
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:47,458
You've done a really good job
with that.

1343
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,298
I think the flavours and textures
are clever.

1344
00:59:49,323 --> 00:59:50,938
And it's so original.

1345
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:52,538
I mean, I love the date-stuffed
crust.

1346
00:59:52,563 --> 00:59:54,298
Thank you, Dana. Thank you.

1347
00:59:56,963 --> 00:59:59,298
I like the look of this,
this is clever.

1348
00:59:59,323 --> 01:00:01,619
Love the steam basket. Very nice,
steamer basket, it's beautiful.

1349
01:00:01,643 --> 01:00:02,938
Absolutely perfect.

1350
01:00:02,963 --> 01:00:04,178
And what's in these?

1351
01:00:04,203 --> 01:00:06,778
So, it's an apricot, pistachio
and thyme filling.

1352
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,218
Filling is very strong,
but it's delicious.

1353
01:00:11,243 --> 01:00:15,618
And the biscuit is crisp
and flavoursome.

1354
01:00:15,643 --> 01:00:18,458
It looks like a dim sum.
This looks lovely.

1355
01:00:18,483 --> 01:00:20,219
So, I think you've done a decent job
with this.

1356
01:00:20,243 --> 01:00:21,578
The illusion works.

1357
01:00:21,603 --> 01:00:23,338
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Well done.

1358
01:00:26,803 --> 01:00:28,818
These are the rotis?
Very delicious.

1359
01:00:28,843 --> 01:00:31,418
That is fantastic.
They're so good.

1360
01:00:31,443 --> 01:00:35,098
That in its own right should be
a well-known Sri Lankan delicacy.

1361
01:00:35,123 --> 01:00:36,898
OK. Let's try a hopper.

1362
01:00:38,403 --> 01:00:40,098
The spices in there are good,

1363
01:00:40,123 --> 01:00:41,739
but I think you could've done
more with that.

1364
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,618
Perhaps if you'd have made the egg
a little bigger

1365
01:00:44,643 --> 01:00:47,258
and done it with spring onion,
a bit of chilli,

1366
01:00:47,283 --> 01:00:49,538
so that it looked more colourful.
Yes.

1367
01:00:53,003 --> 01:00:55,378
It's just beautiful. Amazing.

1368
01:00:56,483 --> 01:00:58,378
Are these chips shortbread?

1369
01:00:58,403 --> 01:01:01,298
Just vanilla,
like a sable biscuit.

1370
01:01:01,323 --> 01:01:03,698
They taste nice,
but they are a little bit burnt.

1371
01:01:03,723 --> 01:01:05,578
Let's have a look at this pie.

1372
01:01:05,603 --> 01:01:07,538
What is the biscuit here?
This is...

1373
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:09,978
It's, like, a pistachio shortbread
in there, as well.

1374
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:12,338
Do you know, I think it's
absolutely delicious. It is.

1375
01:01:12,363 --> 01:01:14,698
I think it's a triumph,
I really do.

1376
01:01:14,723 --> 01:01:17,218
I think you've done a great job
on the biscuits,

1377
01:01:17,243 --> 01:01:20,178
except for the over baking slightly.

1378
01:01:20,203 --> 01:01:21,978
And the filling is wonderful.

1379
01:01:22,003 --> 01:01:23,898
Well done. Excellent.
Well done, Dan.

1380
01:01:23,923 --> 01:01:25,338
Thank you very much. Thanks.

1381
01:01:29,163 --> 01:01:31,498
It's a good looking thing.
I mean, it's...

1382
01:01:31,523 --> 01:01:33,938
It's neat. It's quite well detailed,
and it is neat.

1383
01:01:33,963 --> 01:01:35,618
Right, let's try the shortbread.

1384
01:01:36,803 --> 01:01:39,498
To be honest, your chips do look
more like shortbread fingers

1385
01:01:39,523 --> 01:01:41,818
than chips.
They do, don't they?

1386
01:01:41,843 --> 01:01:43,098
They do, don't they?

1387
01:01:43,123 --> 01:01:44,938
What is the beef?

1388
01:01:44,963 --> 01:01:49,338
The beef is a chocolate biscuit
with chocolate ganache,

1389
01:01:49,363 --> 01:01:51,338
with orange and hazelnuts
through it.

1390
01:01:51,363 --> 01:01:53,698
The chocolate and hazelnut
are beautiful.

1391
01:01:53,723 --> 01:01:55,458
The texture falls apart
in the mouth.

1392
01:01:55,483 --> 01:01:57,178
And the ganache just tops it off.

1393
01:01:57,203 --> 01:01:59,498
It's a good sandwich biscuit.

1394
01:01:59,523 --> 01:02:00,698
And what's the bowl made of?

1395
01:02:00,723 --> 01:02:01,858
Gingerbread.

1396
01:02:01,883 --> 01:02:03,098
Gingerbread. Gingerbread.

1397
01:02:03,123 --> 01:02:05,779
The flavour of the ginger's very
gingery. It's too thick and under baked.

1398
01:02:05,803 --> 01:02:07,418
Just needed longer in the oven...
Yeah.

1399
01:02:07,443 --> 01:02:09,898
and thinner, and it would've
been better. Yeah.

1400
01:02:15,003 --> 01:02:17,858
Josh, it is so neat,

1401
01:02:17,883 --> 01:02:20,378
and so clearly what it is.

1402
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,138
I think it's a little triumph.

1403
01:02:22,163 --> 01:02:23,978
I think it's a big triumph.

1404
01:02:24,003 --> 01:02:26,298
This is the orange shortbread,
isn't it? Yeah.

1405
01:02:26,323 --> 01:02:27,898
That's beautiful. Beautiful.

1406
01:02:27,923 --> 01:02:29,298
Delicate. Light.

1407
01:02:30,443 --> 01:02:32,258
Look at that.
Look at that tomato.

1408
01:02:32,283 --> 01:02:35,498
Look at that tomato. Let me hold
it up. That's clever.

1409
01:02:35,523 --> 01:02:38,098
You can see through it.

1410
01:02:38,123 --> 01:02:39,938
Isn't that amazing?

1411
01:02:39,963 --> 01:02:42,258
Let's try this chocolate one.

1412
01:02:42,283 --> 01:02:43,899
There's walnuts, pecans
and almonds in there,

1413
01:02:43,923 --> 01:02:45,739
and then some currants
and some cherries, as well.

1414
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:48,018
It's chewy, it's crispy, it's zingy,

1415
01:02:48,043 --> 01:02:49,418
it's full of flavour.

1416
01:02:49,443 --> 01:02:53,298
I think overall you've created...
something a little bit special.

1417
01:02:54,523 --> 01:02:57,658
You don't often get illusion stuff
that tastes

1418
01:02:57,683 --> 01:02:59,218
and looks as good as that.
Thank you.

1419
01:02:59,243 --> 01:03:01,923
That's amazing, mate. Yeah, well
done. Cheers, thank you. Well done.

1420
01:03:03,483 --> 01:03:04,898
That was incredible, wasn't it?

1421
01:03:04,923 --> 01:03:06,298
Wasn't expecting that at all.

1422
01:03:06,323 --> 01:03:07,578
Know what, mate?

1423
01:03:08,763 --> 01:03:09,898
Come on.

1424
01:03:09,923 --> 01:03:12,258
I'll come to you.
Thank you. Wow.

1425
01:03:12,283 --> 01:03:15,178
That was amazing.
Honestly, it was seriously good.

1426
01:03:15,203 --> 01:03:16,578
Amazing.

1427
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:20,098
I think Josh has pipped Star Baker.

1428
01:03:20,123 --> 01:03:21,538
But that's fine.

1429
01:03:21,563 --> 01:03:22,858
Another time.

1430
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:24,618
I was...

1431
01:03:24,643 --> 01:03:27,058
touching distance,
and then it was gone.

1432
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:30,098
I'm actually quite good at
making a real steak pie,

1433
01:03:30,123 --> 01:03:33,098
but maybe not so much out
of biscuit.

1434
01:03:33,123 --> 01:03:36,618
So, I've got a right to be
a bit concerned, I think.

1435
01:03:40,523 --> 01:03:43,218
It's decision time for
Paul and Prue.

1436
01:03:43,243 --> 01:03:45,498
Who will be crowned Star Baker

1437
01:03:45,523 --> 01:03:47,098
and who will be leaving the tent?

1438
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:49,418
What a Showstopper.
You got your handshake out.

1439
01:03:49,443 --> 01:03:51,098
Yeah, it was delayed.

1440
01:03:51,123 --> 01:03:54,138
It was, because I was so full
of biscuit.

1441
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,218
It... Everything was numb.

1442
01:03:56,243 --> 01:03:58,138
And then, eventually,
it hit me, and I went,

1443
01:03:58,163 --> 01:04:00,499
"Hang on a minute, I owe him
a handshake." That was so good.

1444
01:04:00,523 --> 01:04:03,018
Josh is definitely in the running
for Star Baker. Yeah.

1445
01:04:03,043 --> 01:04:07,578
I mean, he was sort midway,
but he's just escalated himself

1446
01:04:07,603 --> 01:04:10,298
into the position of challenging
for Star Baker.

1447
01:04:10,323 --> 01:04:13,178
I'm really thrilled about Tash,
cos I think she's up there, too.

1448
01:04:13,203 --> 01:04:16,178
I agree. I mean, she's hardly
put a foot wrong.

1449
01:04:16,203 --> 01:04:18,178
Who do you think's in danger
of going?

1450
01:04:18,203 --> 01:04:20,498
Keith. Yeah, Keith.

1451
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:24,858
The thing is with Keith, he's got
flavour, he's delivering good taste.

1452
01:04:24,883 --> 01:04:27,178
Nicky has struggled a bit, as well.

1453
01:04:27,203 --> 01:04:29,778
I mean, when you look at her bakes
and look at everybody else's,

1454
01:04:29,803 --> 01:04:32,098
you think, "Hang on a minute.

1455
01:04:32,123 --> 01:04:34,458
“It's not as good as we initially
thought it was."

1456
01:04:34,483 --> 01:04:36,898
Well, I'm glad I'm not in your
shoes, judges.

1457
01:04:36,923 --> 01:04:39,938
We'd quite like to have eaten
70 biscuits.

1458
01:04:45,283 --> 01:04:47,578
Bakers, well done,
it's been an amazing week

1459
01:04:47,603 --> 01:04:49,618
and it was a fabulous show stopper.

1460
01:04:49,643 --> 01:04:53,218
Fortunately, I've got the great job
of announcing which one of you

1461
01:04:53,243 --> 01:04:56,698
will be Star Baker this week.

1462
01:04:56,723 --> 01:05:01,938
And the person who is Star Baker
this week is...

1463
01:05:04,843 --> 01:05:06,298
Tasha.

1464
01:05:11,763 --> 01:05:17,698
Now, sadly, I have the job
of letting go of one baker.

1465
01:05:17,723 --> 01:05:19,698
And with just getting to
knowing you all,

1466
01:05:19,723 --> 01:05:21,738
we're absolutely adoring you.

1467
01:05:21,763 --> 01:05:25,418
But the baker leaving today is...

1468
01:05:31,163 --> 01:05:33,458
Keith.

1469
01:05:33,483 --> 01:05:35,458
Sorry, Keith. That's all right.

1470
01:05:36,963 --> 01:05:41,338
I feel fine. There's nothing sad
about this moment.

1471
01:05:41,363 --> 01:05:43,339
Thank you very much. It's been so
lovely to meet you, Prue.

1472
01:05:43,363 --> 01:05:45,658
I've had the most fantastic time.

1473
01:05:45,683 --> 01:05:48,658
I said to somebody, the first
weekend there was bruises

1474
01:05:48,683 --> 01:05:53,058
up and down my arms where I was
pinching myself every half hour.

1475
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:56,498
So, I don't know how many hours
I'm going to spend in the rest

1476
01:05:56,523 --> 01:05:58,378
of my life banging on about this.

1477
01:05:59,603 --> 01:06:02,138
Very happy to still be here.

1478
01:06:02,163 --> 01:06:03,898
So, yes, happy.

1479
01:06:03,923 --> 01:06:06,698
But sad at the same time,
because Keith's gone.

1480
01:06:08,123 --> 01:06:09,498
Well done.

1481
01:06:09,523 --> 01:06:12,378
Tasha's such a deserving Star Baker
this week, because her signature

1482
01:06:12,403 --> 01:06:15,018
yesterday - and I tasted her
signature - it was incredible.

1483
01:06:15,043 --> 01:06:18,098
So, it was well worth Star Baker
for the week on its own.

1484
01:06:18,123 --> 01:06:20,578
The handshake, I'll remember that
for a long time.

1485
01:06:22,163 --> 01:06:23,698
Well done.

1486
01:06:23,723 --> 01:06:26,018
It's the weirdest feeling,

1487
01:06:26,043 --> 01:06:28,538
because you put all this time
and this energy and...

1488
01:06:29,763 --> 01:06:32,058
At the end of the day,
it's biscuit, or it's cake,

1489
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:33,858
or it's something that you eat.

1490
01:06:33,883 --> 01:06:35,858
But...

1491
01:06:35,883 --> 01:06:38,178
it means so much.

1492
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:40,098
And, yeah...

1493
01:06:41,603 --> 01:06:43,858
Yeah, it's... it's a really
good feeling.

1494
01:06:44,923 --> 01:06:46,658
Next time - it's bread week...

1495
01:06:46,683 --> 01:06:48,619
I'm really nervous.
You're nervous about this one?

1496
01:06:48,643 --> 01:06:49,899
I just don't want him to not
like it.

1497
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:51,578
It's all about Paul? Yeah.

1498
01:06:51,603 --> 01:06:55,058
as the bakers take on a classic
cottage loaf signature.

1499
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:57,578
It's enormous.
My God.

1500
01:06:57,603 --> 01:06:59,898
A traditional technical...

1501
01:06:59,923 --> 01:07:01,658
that leaves some hot under
the collar.

1502
01:07:01,683 --> 01:07:03,138
Cool those balls!

1503
01:07:03,163 --> 01:07:04,538
And a plaited show stopper...

1504
01:07:04,563 --> 01:07:05,858
Help me, Lord.

1505
01:07:05,883 --> 01:07:07,658
that has them tied up in knots.

1506
01:07:07,683 --> 01:07:08,858
Stressful.

1507
01:07:08,883 --> 01:07:09,938
GLASS BREAKS

1508
01:07:11,283 --> 01:07:13,938
Chuff tog heck.
You just want an easy life.

1509
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:16,258
Are you a Star Baker in the making?
