<b>{\an2}Incredible.</b>
<b>We're taking it to Dragons' Den.</b>

6

<b>{\an2}That's amazing. But what's in it?</b>

9

<b>{\an2}Oh, the usual - flour, sugar</b>

<b>{\an2}Last week was very stressful</b>

57
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,840
<b>{\an2}Biscuits is completely different</b>
<b>to cakes.</b>

58
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,880
<b>{\an2}I make shortbread quite a lot.</b>

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,600
<b>{\an2}It's one of those recipes where you</b>
<b>get quite a lot of plaudits</b>

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,480
<b>{\an2}compared to the amount of effort</b>
<b>that you put in.</b>

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,400
<b>{\an2}Good to see you, bakers.</b>
<b>Welcome to Biscuit Week.</b>

62
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,400
<b>{\an2}Now, for your Signature Challenge</b>
<b>the judges would like you to make</b>

63
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,240
<b>{\an2}a batch of 12 identical</b>
<b>marshmallow biscuits.</b>

64
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,600
<b>{\an2}Inspired by childhood favourites</b>

65
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,120
<b>{\an2}like the tea cake</b>
<b>or the Wagon Wheel,</b>

66
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,880
<b>{\an2}the judges are looking for</b>
<b>delicious biscuits</b>

67
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,760
<b>{\an2}either topped or sandwiched</b>
<b>with perfectly set marshmallow.</b>

68
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,040
<b>{\an2}Now, you've probably noticed that</b>
<b>these biscuits,</b>

69
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,680
<b>{\an2}they're a lot smaller than they</b>
<b>used to be when we were kids.</b>

70
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,280
<b>{\an2}Well, this is your chance</b>
<b>to right that wrong.</b>

71
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,080
<b>{\an2}There's nothing stopping you from</b>
<b>making your biscuit</b>

72
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,040
<b>{\an2}absolutely massive,</b>
<b>like Noel's head.</b>

73
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,400
<b>{\an2}We're looking for dustbin lids, OK?</b>

74
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,680
<b>{\an2}Now, the shape, the flavours and</b>
<b>the design is entirely up to you.</b>

75
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,200
<b>{\an2}You've got two and a half hours.</b>

76
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,960
<b>{\an2}On your marks... Get set...</b>

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,120
<b>{\an2}Bake!</b>

78
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,800
<b>{\an2}Marshmallow biscuits isn't something</b>
<b>I've had for a really long time.</b>

79
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,040
<b>{\an2}There's only one marshmallow biscuit</b>
<b>as far as I'm concerned</b>

80
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,600
<b>{\an2}and it's a Tunnock's tea cake.</b>
<b>Oh, my days.</b>

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,200
<b>{\an2}PAUL: Marshmallow biscuits. Now,</b>
<b>this goes back to our childhood.</b>

82
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,800
<b>{\an2}For me, it was the Wagon Wheel.</b>
<b>It was just the best thing ever.</b>

83
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,160
<b>{\an2}Marshmallow is quite mild in flavour</b>
<b>and sweet.</b>

84
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,160
<b>{\an2}So you need something that lifts it,</b>
<b>like citrusy jam</b>

85
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,720
<b>{\an2}or something with a bit of acidity</b>
<b>will help.</b>

86
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,240
<b>{\an2}It's about decoration, as well,</b>

87
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,880
<b>{\an2}because although it should be</b>
<b>relatively simple</b>

88
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,480
<b>{\an2}to create the biscuits and the</b>
<b>marshmallow, it's about decoration.</b>

89
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,880
<b>{\an2}It's got to look good,</b>
<b>it's got to look shop made.</b>

90
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,880
<b>{\an2}Good morning, Dana. Hello, good</b>
<b>morning. How are you? Hello, Dana.</b>

91
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,640
<b>{\an2}Dana, tell us about your</b>
<b>signature marshmallow biscuit.</b>

92
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,080
<b>{\an2}I am doing a speculoos.</b>

93
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,480
<b>{\an2}Oh, lovely. Marshmallow biscuit</b>

94
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,360
<b>{\an2}that's got a lot of ginger, cloves,</b>
<b>mixed spice, a bit of everything.</b>

95
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,480
<b>{\an2}Oh, lovely.</b>

96
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,320
<b>{\an2}ALISON: Dana's love of spices</b>
<b>comes from</b>

97
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,240
<b>{\an2}the Indian dishes her mum Chhaya</b>
<b>taught her growing up.</b>

98
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,360
<b>{\an2}That's a lovely golden colour.</b>

99
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,000
<b>{\an2}Almost burnt colour.</b>

100
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,880
<b>{\an2}It's not burnt, Mum!</b>

101
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,280
<b>{\an8}Sitting on top of her</b>
<b>spiced biscuit,</b>

<b>{\an8}Dana's vanilla marshmallow and</b>
<b>speculoos biscuit buttercream</b>

103
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,840
<b>{\an8}will be set in an intricate mould.</b>

104
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,120
<b>{\an2}PRUE: Oh, they're beautiful.</b>

105
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,480
<b>{\an2}It's been a bit of a challenge</b>
<b>demoulding it. Yeah.</b>

106
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,720
<b>{\an2}But as long as I've got enough time</b>
<b>to get it in the fridge</b>

107
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,080
<b>{\an2}for a good half hour.</b>

108
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,440
<b>{\an2}It needs to be rock solid for me</b>
<b>to get it out of the mould.</b>

109
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,800
<b>{\an2}So that's what I'm hoping for.</b>

110
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,160
<b>{\an2}I'm looking forward to this one.</b>

111
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,360
<b>{\an2}Me, too!</b>
<b>Can't wait to have one myself.</b>

112
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,800
<b>{\an2}That's perfect. Right...</b>

113
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,840
<b>{\an2}NOEL: Those who have chosen</b>
<b>to make teacakes</b>

114
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,040
<b>{\an2}will be using moulds to create</b>
<b>the classic chocolate dome</b>

115
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,840
<b>{\an2}which will hold the marshmallow.</b>

116
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,520
<b>{\an2}Let me just wiggle them around.</b>

117
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,480
<b>{\an2}The outside will be nice and smooth</b>

118
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,400
<b>{\an2}because it's moulded into</b>
<b>the dome shape, thankfully.</b>

119
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,240
<b>{\an2}I'm probably a little bit envious</b>

120

<b>{\an2}of the people who have got moulds,</b>
<b>but hey-ho,</b>

121
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,600
<b>{\an2}I made the decision to go</b>
<b>for Wagon Wheels</b>

122
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,320
<b>{\an2}and when I've made them at home</b>
<b>people have liked it.</b>

<b>{\an2}ALISON: Keith likes to doorstep</b>

<b>{\an2}Good luck. Thank you.</b>

269
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,920
<b>{\an2}Thought I was your biggest fan?</b>

270
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,840
<b>{\an2}Ha! That's good, that is!</b>

271
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,280
<b>{\an2}Bakers... You are halfway through!</b>

272
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,160
<b>{\an2}Taking these out now.</b>

273
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,760
<b>{\an2}Oh, yes, they look nice. Very good.</b>

274
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,080
<b>{\an2}Yeah, they look like they did</b>
<b>at home, which is...a good thing.</b>

275
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,200
<b>{\an2}I think it's all right.</b>

276
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,200
<b>{\an2}Just a little brown,</b>

277
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,480
<b>{\an2}so I'm happy with that.</b>

278
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,880
<b>{\an2}Saku. Hello, how are you?</b>
<b>How you doing? You all right?</b>

279
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,440
<b>{\an2}Good, thank you very much. Yes, yes.</b>

280
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,600
<b>{\an2}Now, do you bake biscuits often?</b>

281
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,480
<b>{\an2}Not very often. Hmm.</b>
<b>At least once a week.</b>

282
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,080
<b>{\an2}That's often! If you're baking</b>
<b>biscuits every single week...</b>

283
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,720
<b>{\an2}Every day is often, I think.</b>

284
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,040
<b>{\an2}Every week is really often.</b>
<b>OK. Yes.</b>

285
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,000
<b>{\an2}So you're good at biscuit making,</b>
<b>then. I hope so!</b>

286
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,080
<b>{\an2}Every Sri Lankan New Year,</b>
<b>instead of baking biscuits,</b>

287
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,560
<b>{\an2}Saku and her family celebrate</b>
<b>by boiling over milk,</b>

288
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,200
<b>{\an2}a tradition that symbolises</b>
<b>prosperity.</b>

289

<b>{\an2}It run everywhere!</b>

290
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,080
<b>{\an8}Today she'll be serving up</b>

291

<b>{\an8}an elegant sandwiched pistachio and</b>
<b>raspberry jam marshmallow biscuit</b>

292
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,240
<b>{\an8}inspired by a flavour she</b>
<b>fell in love with in Sicily.</b>

293
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,200
<b>{\an2}So whenever we go there</b>
<b>I try pistachio granita.</b>

294
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,800
<b>{\an2}Ah, it's heavenly! I love pistachio.</b>

295
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,560
<b>{\an2}While Saku is bringing</b>
<b>a taste of Sicily into the tent,</b>

296
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,160
<b>{\an2}Tasha is taking us down under.</b>

297
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,040
<b>{\an2}I'm making a malted</b>
<b>chocolate biscuit.</b>

298
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,480
<b>{\an2}Um, it's like a chocolate drink</b>

299
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,280
<b>{\an2}that I used to have in Australia.</b>

300

<b>{\an2}Was this called Milo? Yes.</b>
<b>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</b>

301
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,720
<b>{\an2}I used to have that in South Africa.</b>
<b>Can you get it here?</b>

302
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,240
<b>{\an2}I can get... I need to know where.</b>

303

<b>{\an2}Don't tell her. Don't tell her!</b>

304
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,360
<b>{\an2}I'll tell you after.</b>

305
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,640
<b>{\an2}Tasha moved to Australia with her</b>
<b>mum and brother aged nine,</b>

306
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,800
<b>{\an2}where she got a taste</b>
<b>of the outdoors</b>

307
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,920
<b>{\an2}and for the malted chocolate</b>
<b>milk drink</b>

308
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,400
<b>{\an2}she would enjoy at the end</b>
<b>of every school day.</b>

309
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,200
<b>{\an8}She'll be flavouring every element</b>

<b>marshmallow biscuits</b>

<b>{\an8}with this popular powdered drink.</b>

312

<b>{\an2}he flavours are very much, like,</b>
<b>childhood flavours</b>

313
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,440
<b>{\an2}so I'll be very sad</b>
<b>if they don't like it!</b>

314
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,080
<b>{\an2}Tasha isn't the only baker...</b>

315

<b>{\an2}Oopsie boopsie!</b>

<b>childhood in sunnier climes.</b>

317
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,880
<b>{\an2}I used to live in Tunisia</b>

<b>{\an2}and we didn't...they don't</b>
<b>have teacakes there</b>

319
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,840
<b>{\an2}so they're not like</b>
<b>a big childhood thing for me,</b>

320
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,200
<b>{\an2}so I was like, I'll use</b>
<b>the other thing from my childhood</b>

321
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,920
<b>{\an2}that significantly impacted it,</b>
<b>which was living in Tunisia.</b>

322
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,240
<b>{\an2}Abbi spent seven years in</b>
<b>Tunisia before returning</b>

00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,120
<b>{\an2}to rural Cumbria, where she took up</b>
<b>a gravity defying fitness class.</b>

324
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,600
<b>{\an2}Whee!</b>

325
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,720
<b>{\an8}Her Tunisian inspired teacakes</b>

326

<b>{\an8}will see a zesty orange curd</b>

327

<b>{\an8}in between her pistachio</b>
<b>and cardamom biscuit</b>

<b>{\an8}and saffron marshmallow.</b>

329
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,320
<b>{\an2}Why do you bake?</b>

330
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,760
<b>{\an2}Why? Yeah.</b>

331
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,480
<b>{\an2}I like it cos it's like a</b>
<b>creative outlet.</b>

332
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,880
<b>{\an2}Do you do other creative things?</b>

333
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,800
<b>{\an2}I do aerial hoop.</b>
<b>What's that?</b>

334
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,280
<b>{\an2}It's like...it's like a...</b>

<b>{\an2}..a hoop that hangs down</b>
<b>from the ceiling</b>

336
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,640
<b>{\an2}and you go, like, upside down in it</b>
<b>and stuff. What?!</b>

337
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,760
<b>{\an2}Where do they have these?</b>
<b>Where does this happen?</b>

338
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,200
<b>{\an2}Uh, it's in a barn on a farm.</b>

339
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,640
<b>{\an2}What, so you drive to a barn...</b>

340
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,520
<b>{\an2}I drive to a barn</b>
<b>and then I get there...</b>

341
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,040
<b>{\an2}You get in an aerial hoop.</b>

342
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,800
<b>{\an2}And then I get in a hoop.</b>
<b>Make shapes.</b>

343
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,200
<b>{\an2}Yeah, and then I go home.</b>

344
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,640
<b>{\an2}Rowan, good morning.</b>
<b>Good morning. How are you?</b>

345
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,160
<b>{\an2}Morning, Rowan. Right, Rowan,</b>

<b>{\an2}tell us all about your</b>
<b>marshmallow biscuits.</b>

<b>shortbread</b>

<b>{\an2}with a Parma violet marshmallow.</b>

<b>{\an2}Parma violet?</b>

350
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,240
<b>{\an2}Yeah. My nan used to like Parma</b>
<b>violets.</b>

351
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,680
<b>{\an2}They are absolutely disgusting.</b>

352
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,440
<b>{\an2}Oh, wonderful!</b>

353
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,120
<b>{\an2}This is a vote of confidence.</b>

354
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,920
<b>{\an2}Yorkshire lad Rowan loves to</b>

<b>{\an1}WATER FLOWS</b>

<b>{\an8}His flavour packed teacakes</b>

<b>Parma violet marshmallow.</b>

362
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,360
<b>{\an2}But I don't know if you like</b>
<b>Parma violet but I told...</b>

363
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,200
<b>{\an2}Oh, I love it!</b>
<b>Is it those purple sweets?</b>

364
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,160
<b>{\an2}Yes! OK, someone likes it.</b>
<b>I LOVE those sweets.</b>

365
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,760
<b>{\an2}OK, so you love Parma violet.</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>

366
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,800
<b>{\an2}Paul and Prue do not.</b>
<b>They said it's a bit vile, actually.</b>

367
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,680
<b>{\an2}So I'm whipping up...</b>
<b>What are you going to do?</b>

368
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,800
<b>{\an2}Well, when life gives you</b>
<b>lemons, Alison...</b>

369
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,520
<b>{\an2}Make Parma violet.</b>
<b>Make Parma violet, yeah!</b>

370
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,120
<b>{\an2}Just make sure there's the right</b>
<b>amount of air in these shoulder</b>
<b>pads.</b>

371
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,240
<b>{\an1}HE IMITATES AN AIR PUMP</b>

372
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,720
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you have one hour left.</b>

373
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,040
<b>{\an2}Marshmallow time.</b>

374
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,240
<b>{\an2}Do you know what? before</b>
<b>the competition</b>

375
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,040
<b>{\an2}I've not made</b>
<b>a great deal of it to be honest,</b>

376
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,200
<b>{\an2}but it's a bit like</b>
<b>a Swiss meringue, basically.</b>

377
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,080
<b>{\an2}And then just with the addition of</b>
<b>loads of gelatine to help it set.</b>

378
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,160
<b>{\an2}Key to a marshmallow's pillowy</b>
<b>but firm form</b>

379
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,800
<b>{\an2}lies in the gelatine and sugar</b>
<b>syrup.</b>

380
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,080
<b>{\an2}I'm making the sugar syrup with</b>
<b>the caster sugar and golden syrup.</b>

381
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,600
<b>{\an2}Then I will add that to</b>
<b>the egg whites</b>

382
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,400
<b>{\an2}and get it whipped for</b>
<b>a good ten minutes</b>

383
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,680
<b>{\an2}and then it should get you creamy</b>
<b>marshmallow fluff</b>

384
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,480
<b>{\an2}just like, chef's kiss!</b>

385
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,040
<b>{\an2}But bringing this mix to the</b>
<b>right temperature is crucial.</b>

386
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,520
<b>{\an2}So this has to get to</b>
<b>114 to 116 degrees C.</b>

387
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,880
<b>{\an2}Oh, hurry up!</b>

388
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,400
<b>{\an2}Too hot and their marshmallow</b>
<b>will be tough and chewy.</b>

389
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,200
<b>{\an2}Too cold and it won't set.</b>

390
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,680
<b>{\an2}Here we go.</b>

391
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,120
<b>{\an2}So now that gets poured into</b>
<b>the egg whites.</b>

392
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,080
<b>{\an2}And then gradually it will turn into</b>
<b>a marshmallow fluff.</b>

393
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,800
<b>{\an2}And for those adding flavours...</b>

394
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,000
<b>{\an2}..there's an additional balance</b>
<b>to be struck.</b>

395
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,560
<b>{\an2}Going with some extract into</b>
<b>the marshmallow.</b>

396
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,120
<b>{\an2}Only, like, a cap.</b>
<b>Extract can be quite offensive</b>

397
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,680
<b>{\an2}if you use too much of it.</b>

398
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,920
<b>{\an2}It was always going to be</b>
<b>a couple of drops.</b>

399
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,280
<b>{\an2}But now I've spoke to the judges</b>

400
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,720
<b>{\an2}I think it's going to be maybe</b>
<b>one drop, if that.</b>

401
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,720
<b>{\an2}Might just do lemon. Sod it.</b>

402
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,920
<b>{\an2}But while most have</b>
<b>their marshmallows made, Keith...</b>

403
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,120
<b>{\an1}BLEEP</b>

404
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,120
<b>{\an2}..is struggling with</b>
<b>his sugar syrup.</b>

405
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,000
<b>{\an2}It's taking a little bit longer</b>
<b>than I expected for the, um,</b>

406
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,720
<b>{\an2}sugar to start to come up</b>
<b>to temperature.</b>

407
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,440
<b>{\an2}I'm a little bit concerned about</b>
<b>the time</b>

408
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,120
<b>{\an2}but we shall see.</b>

409
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,080
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you've got 30 minutes left.</b>

410
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,080
<b>{\an2}Time goes quick.</b>
<b>That's gone really quick.</b>

411
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,760
<b>{\an2}Right. And that's as good</b>
<b>as it will do for me.</b>

412
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,440
<b>{\an2}As Keith races to make</b>
<b>his marshmallow...</b>

413
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,720
<b>{\an2}Right, we're ready.</b>

414
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,120
<b>{\an2}..the rest of the bakers have begun</b>
<b>to build.</b>

415
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,200
<b>{\an2}Smells very Parma violety.</b>

416
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,200
<b>{\an2}I'm feeling stressed!</b>

417
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,600
<b>{\an2}But with so much marshmallow,</b>

418
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,720
<b>{\an2}it's essential</b>
<b>the bakers' other elements</b>

419
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,040
<b>{\an2}are able to punch through</b>
<b>the sweetness.</b>

420
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,680
<b>{\an2}Just putting the jam</b>

421
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,600
<b>{\an2}on top of the biscuits.</b>

422
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,720
<b>{\an2}Not too much. Just a wee layer</b>
<b>that'll just sort of sit.</b>

423
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,640
<b>{\an2}And while many of the bakers</b>
<b>are relying on moulds</b>

424
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,640
<b>{\an2}to achieve a flawless finish...</b>

425
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,280
<b>{\an2}So now it'll set in the fridge</b>
<b>until I demould it.</b>

426
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,920
<b>{\an2}That's if I can get it demoulded.</b>

427
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,080
<b>{\an2}..others are preparing for</b>
<b>a freehand finish.</b>

428
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,080
<b>{\an2}Oh, I'm going to have to get</b>
<b>dipping. Time is against me now.</b>

429
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,880
<b>{\an2}I just have to go really quickly.</b>

430
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,840
<b>{\an2}Please work,</b>
<b>please work, please work.</b>

431
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,000
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you have ten minutes left.</b>

432
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,880
<b>{\an2}I really wanted to take my time</b>
<b>on this but... Whoopsy daisy!</b>

433
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,120
<b>{\an2}So now I can start</b>
<b>doing the marshmallow.</b>

434
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,520
<b>{\an2}As Keith's biscuits finally</b>
<b>start coming together,</b>

435
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,240
<b>{\an2}for the teacake contingent,</b>
<b>it's time to demould.</b>

436
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,920
<b>{\an2}Moment of truth, here we go.</b>

437
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,200
<b>{\an2}Once they come out, they're done.</b>

438
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,760
<b>{\an2}But it's just getting them out</b>
<b>that's the tricky bit.</b>

439
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,120
<b>{\an2}I mean, they're coming out</b>
<b>and they're not snapping.</b>

440
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,280
<b>{\an2}I was expecting a breakage,</b>
<b>with my luck today.</b>

441
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,040
<b>{\an2}Right, that one's broken.</b>

442
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,320
<b>{\an2}That was challenge, though,</b>
<b>with this mould.</b>

443
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,520
<b>{\an2}I need to get the chocolate</b>
<b>round the edges</b>

444
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,040
<b>{\an2}but you do have to be very delicate</b>

445
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,360
<b>{\an2}and delicacy's not really</b>
<b>in my skill set.</b>

446
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,400
<b>{\an2}They're just so messy underneath.</b>
<b>Going to trim round carefully.</b>

447
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,840
<b>{\an2}Gentle, gentle, gentle...</b>

448
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,480
<b>{\an2}I need to decorate the top...</b>

449
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,840
<b>{\an2}..as best I can.</b>

450
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
<b>{\an2}Yeah, just jazz it up a bit.</b>

451
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,800
<b>{\an2}I'll put some peanuts on.</b>

452
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,800
<b>{\an2}I can, like, hide a lot of stuff</b>
<b>with glitter.</b>

453
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,120
<b>{\an2}That's what I'm hoping for!</b>

454
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,600
<b>{\an2}They're just sort of like dodgy</b>
<b>alloy wheels from, like, the 1990s.</b>

455
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,040
<b>{\an2}Oh, they look messy!</b>

456
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,480
<b>{\an2}Ah, sorry, kangaroo.</b>
<b>You're going to get a messy bum.</b>

457
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,200
<b>{\an2}Perfect!</b>

458
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,000
<b>{\an2}OK, bakers, your time is up.</b>

459
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,600
<b>{\an2}Please step away from</b>
<b>your biscuits.</b>

460
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,040
<b>{\an2}We got 12. That's the main thing.</b>

461
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,400
<b>{\an2}God. That was stressful.</b>

462
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,560
<b>{\an2}They look beautiful. Thank you.</b>

463
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,400
<b>{\an8}Mine looks a bag of BLEEP</b>
<b>compared to everybody else's.</b>

464
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,680
<b>{\an8}11 batches of marshmallow biscuits</b>

465
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,920
<b>{\an8}now face the judgment of</b>
<b>Prue and Paul.</b>

466
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,880
<b>{\an8}PRUE: Did you drop three of them?</b>

467
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,600
<b>{\an2}Um, I don't know what</b>
<b>you're on about, Prue!</b>

468
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
<b>{\an1}LAUGHTER</b>

469
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,400
<b>{\an2}There's nothing there,</b>
<b>there's nothing to see!</b>

470
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,720
<b>{\an8}I mean, they look amazing</b>
<b>bar these broken ones.</b>

471
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,800
<b>{\an2}Let's have a look</b>
<b>and see what it's like inside.</b>

472
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,640
<b>{\an2}Thank you. It's a lovely interior.</b>
<b>I think the balance</b>

473
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,840
<b>{\an2}between the marshmallow</b>
<b>and the biscuit is good.</b>

474
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,360
<b>{\an2}Oh, it's delicious.</b>
<b>Oh, thank you.</b>

475
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,760
<b>{\an2}Very spicy.</b>

476
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,400
<b>{\an2}The topping I like,</b>

477
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,600
<b>{\an2}but it's totally overwhelmed</b>
<b>by the biscuit.</b>

478
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,280
<b>{\an2}It's so potent</b>

479
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,240
<b>{\an2}that a delicate thing like</b>
<b>a marshmallow's</b>

480
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,840
<b>{\an2}never going to stand a chance.</b>
<b>Mm-hm.</b>

481
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,360
<b>{\an2}Do you know, I don't really agree</b>

482
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,000
<b>{\an2}because, frankly, marshmallow</b>
<b>deserves to be overridden. Mm-hm.</b>

483
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,440
<b>{\an2}I think it works beautifully.</b>

484
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,800
<b>{\an2}Thank you very much.</b>
<b>That's OK. Thank you, thank you.</b>

485
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,320
<b>{\an2}OK, let's have a look.</b>

486
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,720
<b>{\an2}Oh, my goodness.</b>
<b>That's neat as a pin, isn't it?</b>

487
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,160
<b>{\an2}Um, the Parma violet,</b>

488
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,720
<b>{\an2}I'm not getting too much of that,</b>

489
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,720
<b>{\an2}which for me is a good thing. OK.</b>

490
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,640
<b>{\an2}You do get that lemon</b>
<b>coming through.</b>

491
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,320
<b>{\an2}So you end up with a pretty</b>
<b>decent marshmallow biscuit.</b>

492
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,560
<b>{\an2}Do you know, I think it's amazing.</b>

493
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,440
<b>{\an2}I think you've got</b>
<b>so many flavours in there</b>

494
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,560
<b>{\an2}but you get them one after another.</b>
<b>It's perfect.</b>

495
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,000
<b>{\an2}Oh, thank you.</b>

496
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,840
<b>{\an2}Well done. I was so nervous.</b>
<b>Thank you. Well done. Thank you.</b>

497
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,880
<b>{\an8}Very pretty.</b>

498
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,280
<b>{\an2}Yeah.</b>

499
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,880
<b>{\an2}I baked a pistachio and vanilla</b>
<b>marshmallow biscuit.</b>

500
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,880
<b>{\an2}I think your flavours</b>
<b>are really good.</b>

501
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,680
<b>{\an2}The jam comes through, the biscuit,</b>
<b>you do get that pistachio flavour.</b>

502
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,240
<b>{\an2}My only comment would be</b>

503
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,080
<b>{\an2}the biscuit needed a little bit</b>
<b>longer in the oven.</b>

504
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,280
<b>{\an2}Oh!</b>

505
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,160
<b>{\an8}You could've spun the chocolate</b>

506
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,640
<b>{\an2}a little bit neater than that,</b>
<b>but I do like them.</b>

507
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,040
<b>{\an2}I think they do look pretty nice.</b>

508
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,320
<b>{\an2}Ooh. Oh, wow.</b>

509
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,880
<b>{\an2}Ooh, hello.</b>

510
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,160
<b>{\an2}I think your chocolate's</b>
<b>a bit thick down at the bottom.</b>

511
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,800
<b>{\an2}That should've been paper thin.</b>

512
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,280
<b>{\an2}Your orange jam is delicious.</b>

513
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,360
<b>{\an2}Yeah.</b>

514
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,280
<b>{\an2}I think if, instead of putting</b>
<b>a blob of jam in the middle,</b>

515
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,040
<b>{\an2}you'd put a layer of jam... Yeah.</b>

516
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,400
<b>{\an2}..then every mouthful</b>
<b>would've been perfect.</b>

517
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,880
<b>{\an8}Well, they all look neat as a pin</b>

518
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,440
<b>{\an8}and they're certainly identical.</b>

519
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,160
<b>{\an2}Let's cut one of these open.</b>

520
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,160
<b>{\an2}Good crack on the chocolate.</b>

521
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,600
<b>{\an2}Looks lovely inside, Josh.</b>

522
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,720
<b>{\an2}Nice and thin.</b>
<b>Chocolate's beautifully done.</b>

523
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,000
<b>{\an2}I like the balance between the</b>
<b>sweet and the tartness...</b>

524
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,440
<b>{\an2}Yeah. ..which comes from the jam.</b>

525
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,080
<b>{\an2}You've got the nice fruits</b>
<b>coming through in there.</b>

526
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,840
<b>{\an2}Pretty, pretty spot-on.</b>

527
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,400
<b>{\an2}Well, your roses worked, didn't</b>
<b>they? Yeah, they did. Perfect.</b>

528
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,160
<b>{\an2}The rose flavour's definitely there.</b>

529
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,040
<b>{\an2}But I don't think it's too much.</b>

530
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,560
<b>{\an2}I think, yeah, I think you're right.</b>

531
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,200
<b>{\an2}I think the rose level</b>
<b>is about right.</b>

532
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,000
<b>{\an2}The berry in there needed to be a</b>
<b>little bit stronger and more of it,</b>

533
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,600
<b>{\an2}but I think it's very neat and</b>
<b>I think you've done a decent job.</b>

534
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,440
<b>{\an8}They are a bit messy but I do think</b>
<b>they're exciting and attractive.</b>

535
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,240
<b>{\an2}Yeah, they look like crowns,</b>
<b>don't they?</b>

536
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,040
<b>{\an1}ABBI LAUGHS</b>

537
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,920
<b>{\an2}There's a lot of orange in there.</b>

538
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,880
<b>{\an2}Yes, I think probably</b>
<b>a little bit too much.</b>

539
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,320
<b>{\an2}The biscuit is lovely and crispy</b>

540
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,640
<b>{\an2}but the orange is really punching.</b>

541
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,800
<b>{\an2}And be careful to allow yourself</b>
<b>time to finish off your bakes...</b>

542
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,000
<b>{\an2}Yeah. ..with a little bit more</b>
<b>finesse. Yeah.</b>

543
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,040
<b>{\an8}Well, at first glance</b>
<b>they look pretty good.</b>

544
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,520
<b>{\an2}When you look a bit closer,</b>
<b>they're a little bit messy.</b>

545
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,560
<b>{\an2}Interesting inside. I mean, you've</b>
<b>got a lot going on in there</b>

546
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,960
<b>{\an2}when it comes to the layers.</b>

547
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,600
<b>{\an2}These are a peanut biscuit</b>
<b>with white chocolate</b>

548
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,280
<b>{\an2}and peanut butter ganache</b>
<b>and a banana marshmallow.</b>

549
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,960
<b>{\an2}I don't quite know what</b>
<b>I think about that</b>

550
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,440
<b>{\an2}because I think technically</b>
<b>it's perfect. Hmm.</b>

551
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,760
<b>{\an2}Maybe I don't quite share your</b>
<b>four-year-old's tastes.</b>

552
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,760
<b>{\an2}Yeah, possibly so, yeah, yeah!</b>

553
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,680
<b>{\an2}Texture wise it's spot-on.</b>

554
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,920
<b>{\an2}And not a big thick layer</b>
<b>of chocolate. Yeah.</b>

555
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,720
<b>{\an2}It's paper thin and that's how</b>
<b>it should be.</b>

556
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,480
<b>{\an2}If you hadn't put the cartwheel on,</b>

557
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,160
<b>{\an2}they would've looked ten times</b>
<b>better. Yeah. I know.</b>

558
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,480
<b>{\an8}Bit messy, aren't they?</b>

559
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,120
<b>{\an2}Well, I knew they weren't gonna be</b>

560
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,200
<b>{\an2}the most attractive offering</b>
<b>in the tent.</b>

561
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,840
<b>{\an2}I, I wasn't planning on them being</b>
<b>quite so messy.</b>

562
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,920
<b>{\an2}They're probably gonna</b>
<b>taste amazing.</b>

563
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,000
<b>{\an2}Keith, you're looking really</b>
<b>worried.</b>

564
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,760
<b>{\an2}Keith the truth is, it really</b>
<b>is delicious.</b>

565
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
<b>{\an2}The, erm, marshmallow's holding</b>
<b>its shape.</b>

566
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,200
<b>{\an2}The raspberry jam is terrific.</b>

567
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,840
<b>{\an2}This is the nicest,</b>
<b>crispest biscuit.</b>

568
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,840
<b>{\an2}So is it ugly but nice?</b>

569
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,760
<b>{\an2}It's beauty and</b>
<b>the beast, that's what it is.</b>

570
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,240
<b>{\an2}Beauty's on the inside.</b>
<b>But look at it. I'll take that.</b>

571
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,920
<b>{\an2}Thank you very much, Keith.</b>
<b>Cheers.</b>

572
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,400
<b>{\an8}So these are biscuit</b>
<b>with ground pistachios,</b>

573
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,160
<b>{\an2}rhubarb and ginger jam</b>
<b>and then chocolate on the top.</b>

574
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,160
<b>{\an2}Where's the, where's the ginger?</b>

575
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,600
<b>{\an2}The jam. It was, it was there.</b>
<b>Where is it?</b>

576
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,320
<b>{\an2}I, I think it ran a wee bit.</b>

577
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,400
<b>{\an2}Well, it ran out</b>
<b>the tent that's what it's done.</b>

578
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,000
<b>{\an2}There's nothing here. Never mind.</b>

579
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,160
<b>{\an2}He's trying to find some.</b>
<b>Oh, stop it!</b>

580
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,040
<b>{\an2}ALISON: Oh, he's trying to see...</b>
<b>Oh, no.</b>

581
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,640
<b>{\an2}No. There's gotta be some somewhere.</b>

582
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,160
<b>{\an2}There is.</b>
<b>I just put a wee thin layer on.</b>

583
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,840
<b>{\an2}Why? Why? Because I didn't want it</b>
<b>to overpower it.</b>

584
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,040
<b>{\an2}See, you've got a wee bit there.</b>

585
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,480
<b>{\an2}Oh, dearie me, never mind.</b>

586
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,480
<b>{\an2}It is, it is dearie me because</b>
<b>otherwise it's nicely constructed.</b>

587
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,160
<b>{\an2}The biscuit is beautiful,</b>
<b>the chocolate's nice and thin.</b>

588
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,840
<b>{\an2}You've done a good job</b>
<b>but we needed the jam.</b>

589
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,320
<b>{\an2}Well, they look very sophisticated</b>
<b>and beautifully piped</b>

590
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,000
<b>{\an2}and the spinning is just so thin</b>
<b>and lovely.</b>

591
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,440
<b>{\an2}My instinct is that</b>
<b>the biscuits are too thick.</b>

592
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,600
<b>{\an2}Because I think that's quite</b>
<b>a mouthful.</b>

593
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,200
<b>{\an2}I think they're,</b>
<b>the biscuit, you think it's thick</b>

594
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,920
<b>{\an8}but it's not because it crumbles</b>

595
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,600
<b>{\an8}and it's so delicate,</b>

596
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,960
<b>{\an8}and the chocolate comes through -</b>
<b>not dark chocolate,</b>

597
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,560
<b>{\an8}but it has a beautiful malted</b>
<b>aftertaste in the mouth.</b>

598
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,200
<b>{\an2}I think they're delicate,</b>

599
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,840
<b>{\an2}I think they're pretty and I have</b>
<b>to...</b>

600
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,440
<b>{\an2}Oh, good for you.</b>
<b>Yeah!</b>

601
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,040
<b>{\an2}Thank you. Ah. I tell you what,</b>

602
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,800
<b>{\an2}that pleases me as much as it</b>
<b>pleases you.</b>

603
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,880
<b>{\an2}Ooh, that's a handshake. I'll have</b>
<b>two of those. Thanks.</b>

604
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,240
<b>{\an2}I got a Hollywood handshake.</b>

605
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,680
<b>{\an2}I was not expecting that at all.</b>

606
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,400
<b>{\an2}Yes!</b>

607
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,480
<b>{\an2}I'm so proud.</b>

608
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,840
<b>{\an2}I don't think I could've got any</b>
<b>better than that.</b>

609
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,960
<b>{\an2}Because the judges aren't blind,</b>

610
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,800
<b>{\an2}they could see that it looked</b>
<b>like a flipping mess.</b>

611
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,360
<b>{\an2}You can't be worried about these</b>
<b>things cos it's done.</b>

612
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,280
<b>{\an2}And I can't do anything about it.</b>

613
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,480
<b>{\an2}And so, yeah, you've just got</b>
<b>to enjoy the moment,</b>

614
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,280
<b>{\an2}keep smiling cos that's what</b>
<b>life's all about, isn't it?</b>

615
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,760
<b>{\an2}While the bakers could practise</b>
<b>their marshmallow biscuits</b>

616
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,400
<b>{\an2}the next challenge is a mystery.</b>

617
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,800
<b>{\an2}Hello, bakers,</b>
<b>welcome back to the tent.</b>

618
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,040
<b>{\an2}It's time for your Technical</b>
<b>Challenge which today has been set</b>

619
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,480
<b>{\an2}for you by the lovely Prue.</b>
<b>Any words of wisdom?</b>

620
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,600
<b>{\an2}I've only got one piece of advice</b>
<b>for you guys,</b>

621
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,800
<b>{\an2}and that is use your time wisely.</b>

622
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,400
<b>{\an2}Now, as always, this challenge is</b>
<b>gonna be judged blind</b>

623
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,160
<b>{\an2}so, guys, off you go.</b>

624
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,080
<b>{\an2}Off you pop and when we say go we</b>
<b>mean go,</b>

625
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,280
<b>{\an2}don't skulk back pretending</b>
<b>to look for your phone charger.</b>

626
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,240
<b>{\an2}OK, Prue would like you to make</b>

627
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,800
<b>{\an2}a batch of 12 perfectly baked</b>
<b>custard creams.</b>

628
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,600
<b>{\an2}Your custard creams should be</b>

629
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,400
<b>{\an2}made with a short buttery biscuit</b>

630
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,800
<b>{\an2}and imprinted with that classic</b>
<b>custard cream design</b>

631
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,040
<b>{\an2}and they should be filled with</b>
<b>a custard buttercream.</b>

632
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,760
<b>{\an2}Sounds delicious. You've got one and</b>
<b>a half hours for this.</b>

633
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,480
<b>{\an2}That does not sound long enough.</b>
<b>On your marks.</b>

634
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,920
<b>{\an2}Get set. Bake!</b>

635
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,200
<b>{\an2}Oh, my gosh.</b>

636
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,200
<b>{\an2}I've never made custard creams.</b>
<b>I've eaten them. But never made one.</b>

637
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,880
<b>{\an2}It's good because you know what they</b>
<b>look and taste like.</b>

638
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,480
<b>{\an2}It's bad because you know what they</b>
<b>look and taste like.</b>

639
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,920
<b>{\an2}Custard creams. I have no idea.</b>

640
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,680
<b>{\an2}I'm a huge fan of custard so I'm</b>
<b>looking forward to all of this.</b>

641
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,200
<b>{\an2}Huge custard man, yeah. I'm from the</b>
<b>North, mate, have it for breakfast.</b>

642
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,600
<b>{\an2}Custard creams, Prue, I think this</b>
<b>is a great Technical Challenge.</b>

643
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,360
<b>{\an2}But do you think it's too simple?</b>

644
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,920
<b>{\an2}It's not that simple.</b>
<b>It's actually easy to go wrong.</b>

645
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,720
<b>{\an2}I think the most common problem</b>
<b>will be people not chilling their</b>

646
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,360
<b>{\an2}biscuit dough enough.</b>

647
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,520
<b>{\an2}It needs to go into the oven</b>
<b>really, really cold.</b>

648
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,200
<b>{\an2}If it's a slightest bit warm,</b>

649
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,200
<b>{\an2}the butter will start to melt and</b>
<b>you'll lose the definition</b>

650
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,160
<b>{\an2}and the shape and the next most</b>
<b>common problem will be not getting</b>

651
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,000
<b>{\an2}the creme au beurre</b>
<b>properly chilled.</b>

652
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
<b>{\an2}It's all about chilling and timing.</b>

653
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,640
<b>{\an2}Choose your, uh, biscuit Prue. Hmm.</b>

654
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,440
<b>{\an2}It holds together beautifully.</b>

655
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,920
<b>{\an2}Beautiful custard flavour.</b>

656
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,760
<b>{\an2}but there's a lovely snap to</b>
<b>it as well in the mouth.</b>

657
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,320
<b>{\an2}I tell you what these</b>
<b>taste a whole heap better</b>

658
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,920
<b>{\an2}than the ones in the packet.</b>

659
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,080
<b>{\an2}First instruction - make biscuit</b>
<b>dough, chill in freezer.</b>

660
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,960
<b>{\an2}Just says make the biscuit dough.</b>
<b>Which is really helpful.</b>

661
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,320
<b>{\an2}Thanks, Prue.</b>

662
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,560
<b>{\an2}I actually looked up a custard</b>
<b>cream recipe last night. Shh.</b>

663
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,200
<b>{\an2}You cream together your butter</b>
<b>and sugar and then add in your egg</b>

664
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,320
<b>{\an2}and then you add in your flour</b>

665
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,040
<b>{\an2}and then I've put the custard</b>
<b>powder in with the flour.</b>

666
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,840
<b>{\an2}Hey, Dana. Hi, Alison.</b>

667
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,320
<b>{\an2}You look like you're ahead.</b>

668
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,440
<b>{\an2}Oh, don't say that.</b>
<b>You're doing good.</b>

669
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,400
<b>{\an2}Cos that's how it was last week and</b>
<b>I came last, didn't I? But, erm...</b>

670
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,040
<b>{\an2}Well, no, listen, don't</b>
<b>put no pressure on yourself.</b>

671
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,480
<b>{\an2}Yeah. Have you done this before?</b>

672
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,320
<b>{\an2}No. It's just biscuit, isn't it?</b>
<b>It's just, just biscuit.</b>

673
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,280
<b>{\an2}It's just biscuit. It's not</b>
<b>just biscuit, it's a custard cream.</b>

674
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,680
<b>{\an2}Get it</b>
<b>straight in the freezer.</b>

675
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,920
<b>{\an2}I get the impression from how Prue</b>
<b>was describing it that you</b>

676
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,400
<b>{\an2}haven't got a great</b>
<b>deal of time to mess around.</b>

677
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,760
<b>{\an2}Whole thing about this</b>
<b>is freezing</b>

678
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,040
<b>{\an2}cos you've got a stamp</b>
<b>and you wanna be able to stamp it</b>

679
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,520
<b>{\an2}and see it, don't you? Cos</b>
<b>if you don't, what's the point?</b>

680
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,240
<b>{\an2}It's not a custard cream.</b>

681
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,200
<b>{\an2}It's kind of amazing.</b>
<b>I know I'd love that. Did you know</b>
<b>that existed until today? No.</b>

682
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,000
<b>{\an2}It, it's brilliant. No, me neither.</b>

683
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,680
<b>{\an2}It's almost like a game.</b>
<b>Where we've got to be the quickest</b>
<b>to the button.</b>

684
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,040
<b>{\an2}To the buzzer? Yeah.</b>

685
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,720
<b>{\an2}Who's got the baking? Paul or Prue?</b>

686
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,680
<b>{\an2}Paul.</b>

687
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,560
<b>{\an2}Who's gonna win the Bake Off</b>
<b>this year? Don't... Keith.</b>

688
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,040
<b>{\an2}So step number two is for the</b>
<b>custard buttercream, make</b>

689
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,560
<b>{\an2}a sugar syrup in a small pan</b>
<b>and boil to 121 Celsius.</b>

690
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,760
<b>{\an2}Oh, it's getting very</b>
<b>technical now.</b>

691
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,080
<b>{\an2}Dissolve.</b>

692
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,200
<b>{\an2}It's made like a French</b>
<b>meringue buttercream</b>

693
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,240
<b>{\an2}and I have made one already.</b>
<b>So I know what I'm doing.</b>

694
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,880
<b>{\an2}So this is gonna heat up and then</b>
<b>I'm gonna pour it into my egg</b>

695
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,400
<b>{\an2}yolks and whisk it</b>
<b>until they're really big and fluffy.</b>

696
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,720
<b>{\an2}Well, we've just zoomed past 121 so</b>
<b>I'll just leave it there for a sec.</b>

697
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,600
<b>{\an2}It's fine.</b>

698
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,200
<b>{\an2}I've just</b>
<b>got this to 121 degrees.</b>

699
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,080
<b>{\an2}And I shall be plonking it in here</b>
<b>now with the egg yolks.</b>

700
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,480
<b>{\an2}I know you've gotta do</b>
<b>this really slowly.</b>

701
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,400
<b>{\an2}If you chuck it all in it</b>
<b>will like split.</b>

702
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,880
<b>{\an2}The eggs haven't whisked up,</b>

703
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,520
<b>{\an2}the buttercream has all gone to pot</b>
<b>and I need to start again.</b>

704
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,640
<b>{\an2}So it's getting nice</b>
<b>and thick. Which is what we want.</b>

705
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,920
<b>{\an2}Sieve custard powder then</b>
<b>whisk again.</b>

706
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,360
<b>{\an2}Get as much of that as possible.</b>
<b>And give it another whisk.</b>

707
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,000
<b>{\an2}The buttercream's looking better.</b>
<b>I'm still a lot behind though.</b>

708
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,600
<b>{\an2}When ready, whisk the butter into</b>
<b>the buttercream.</b>

709
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,360
<b>{\an2}And once you incorporate</b>
<b>the butter into it,</b>

710
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,720
<b>{\an2}it will obviously increase in</b>
<b>volume, thicken up.</b>

711
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,160
<b>{\an2}I'm just gonna keep on whisking it</b>
<b>and then it gets nice and fluffy.</b>

712
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,600
<b>{\an2}If it's too loose it's just gonna</b>
<b>splodge out the side everywhere.</b>

713
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,160
<b>{\an2}Plaafff, it's never good.</b>

714
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,600
<b>{\an2}This is pretty terrible.</b>

715
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,560
<b>{\an2}I can see flecks of yellow but I</b>
<b>can't get it to whisk any more.</b>

716
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,080
<b>{\an2}I'm not sure about</b>
<b>the consistency...</b>

717
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,280
<b>{\an2}..but I will go with this.</b>

718
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,080
<b>{\an2}Right, roll out the biscuit dough</b>
<b>and chill in the freezer.</b>

719
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,960
<b>{\an2}It's a lot of chilling.</b>
<b>We need to make 12.</b>

720
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,600
<b>{\an2}That is 24 biscuits.</b>
<b>So it needs to be thin.</b>

721
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,360
<b>{\an2}Custard creams,</b>
<b>about three mil thick, I reckon.</b>

722
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,800
<b>{\an2}We're rolling, it's looking all</b>
<b>right, yeah, the dough's nice.</b>

723
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,680
<b>{\an2}Cristy.</b>
<b>Have you used my biscuit dough?</b>

724
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,760
<b>{\an2}You have.</b>
<b>Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.</b>

725
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,320
<b>{\an2}That's my biscuit dough.</b>

726
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,160
<b>{\an2}Ah!</b>

727
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,480
<b>{\an2}Rowan! Ah, there you go.</b>
<b>I'm so sorry, Rowan.</b>

728
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,840
<b>{\an2}No, it's fine. I thought...</b>

729
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,320
<b>{\an2}Are you swapping dough, you kids?</b>

730
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,280
<b>{\an2}Rowan, what really happened?</b>

731
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,400
<b>{\an2}I found my dough missing.</b>

732
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,920
<b>{\an2}Sabotage? Sabotage, no.</b>
<b>Cristy, you've done a great job.</b>

733
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,640
<b>{\an2}Do you feel like you rolled his out</b>
<b>better than you're doing yours?</b>

734
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,680
<b>{\an2}Yeah, for sure.</b>
<b>Oh, no, what's going on here?</b>

735
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,760
<b>{\an2}Don't.</b>

736
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,760
<b>{\an2}Feel like this is a bit sticky.</b>
<b>Need a bit more of this. Sorry.</b>

737
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,240
<b>{\an2}Before their dough is ready</b>
<b>to be cut and stamped...</b>

738
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,240
<b>{\an2}I think that'll do.</b>

739
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,320
<b>{\an2}..it must be chilled thoroughly.</b>

740
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,840
<b>{\an2}The longer it chills</b>
<b>the better definition it'll be</b>

741
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,240
<b>{\an2}but the less time it will have</b>
<b>to bake and then cool down.</b>

742
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,320
<b>{\an2}But it's a process that</b>
<b>can't be rushed.</b>

743
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,400
<b>{\an2}It's not working. Sticking.</b>
<b>More time in the fridge.</b>

744
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,960
<b>{\an2}You've got 45 minutes left,</b>
<b>everyone, 45 minutes.</b>

745
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,680
<b>{\an2}Please be ready, please be ready,</b>
<b>please be ready.</b>

746
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,960
<b>{\an2}So I'm hoping these are set</b>

747
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,400
<b>{\an2}and they'll push out of this mould</b>

748
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,000
<b>{\an2}but we're gonna find out in</b>
<b>a moment, aren't we? Stamp.</b>

749
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,120
<b>{\an2}I don't know how hard to push.</b>

750
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,120
<b>{\an2}Am I gonna go all the way through?</b>
<b>See, look, it's getting stuck.</b>

751
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,360
<b>{\an2}Is this happening for other people?</b>

752
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,440
<b>{\an2}I'm probably doing it wrong.</b>

753
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,840
<b>{\an2}Give it a bit of welly.</b>

754
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,680
<b>{\an2}Yeah, looks all right.</b>

755
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,240
<b>{\an2}Come on, out you come.</b>
<b>It is a pretty little pattern.</b>

756
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,680
<b>{\an2}It's quite sweet, I think.</b>

757
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,040
<b>{\an2}It's not a uniform custard cream</b>
<b>but she's the first,</b>

758
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,800
<b>{\an2}it's like the first pancake.</b>

759
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,280
<b>{\an2}It's always the worst one</b>
<b>but we go uphill from here.</b>

760
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,640
<b>{\an2}They're not looking too bad at</b>
<b>the moment.</b>

761
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,520
<b>{\an2}Can I press the button?</b>

762
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,920
<b>{\an2}You can do.</b>

763
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,680
<b>{\an2}Hey, presto.</b>

764
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,960
<b>{\an2}So I'm gonna go as far</b>

765
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,720
<b>{\an2}and say that was the best one.</b>

766
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,320
<b>{\an2}Some of us have just got the touch.</b>

767
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,240
<b>{\an2}You do. It won't stop sticking</b>
<b>so it's go back in the freezer</b>

768
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,400
<b>{\an2}with a layer of flour.</b>

769
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,840
<b>{\an2}Nightmare, aren't they? After you.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>

770
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,800
<b>{\an2}It's sticking to the... Agh!</b>
<b>..cutter.</b>

771
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,280
<b>{\an2}Ah, not at all neat.</b>

772
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,840
<b>{\an2}I'm very concerned about this.</b>

773
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,840
<b>{\an2}This dough has gone too soft</b>
<b>to manipulate. Freezer.</b>

774
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,640
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you've got half</b>
<b>an hour left.</b>

775
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,760
<b>{\an2}Ah. Running out of time.</b>

776
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,480
<b>{\an2}That's not very long.</b>
<b>I need to get mine in the oven.</b>

777
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,960
<b>{\an2}It just says bake.</b>
<b>13 to start with.</b>

778
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,840
<b>{\an2}Eight minutes.</b>

779
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,840
<b>{\an2}So I'm gonna go</b>
<b>for about 12 minutes.</b>

780
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,840
<b>{\an2}They're quite pale, aren't they?</b>

781
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,840
<b>{\an2}Quite insipid actually, like me in</b>
<b>the winter.</b>

782
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,120
<b>{\an2}Come on, custard cream.</b>

783
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,120
<b>{\an2}Abbi, get a bit closer.</b>

784
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,120
<b>{\an2}It's already melting.</b>

785
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,880
<b>{\an2}I think the design's just gonna</b>
<b>be lost.</b>

786
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,040
<b>{\an2}I didn't chill them long enough,</b>
<b>I know I didn't.</b>

787
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,960
<b>{\an2}So I've put a batch of 12 in.</b>

788
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,680
<b>{\an2}It's gonna be tough to go again.</b>

789
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,520
<b>{\an2}I had timing issues this morning.</b>

790
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,680
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you've got ten minutes left,</b>
<b>ten minutes.</b>

791
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,680
<b>{\an2}I don't know when they're gonna</b>
<b>be ready.</b>

792
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,960
<b>{\an2}Oh, I don't know, I don't know.</b>
<b>It's hard to call, isn't it?</b>

793
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,680
<b>{\an2}As soon as I start seeing</b>
<b>them getting brown then they're</b>
<b>coming out.</b>

794
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
<b>{\an2}I love a custard cream</b>

795
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,760
<b>{\an2}and I'm gonna be mentally scarred by</b>
<b>them now, aren't I, forever?</b>

796
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,000
<b>{\an2}I'm never gonna be able</b>
<b>to eat one again, am I?</b>

797
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,320
<b>{\an2}I'm coming out.</b>
<b>Mine look a bit ropey.</b>

798
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,680
<b>{\an2}But they're coming out whatever.</b>

799
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,200
<b>{\an2}They're looking all right</b>
<b>I think actually, yeah. Looking</b>
<b>custard cream-ish.</b>

800
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,600
<b>{\an2}That one's nice.</b>

801
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,680
<b>{\an2}This one's gonna be a top.</b>

802
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,360
<b>{\an2}This one's gonna be a bottom.</b>
<b>I'm a man with a plan.</b>

803
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,000
<b>{\an2}I'm gonna take these out cos</b>
<b>they've gotta cool down.</b>

804
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,800
<b>{\an2}I will put it in the freezer.</b>

805
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,360
<b>{\an2}Ah...</b>

806
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,480
<b>{\an2}I dropped.</b>

807
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,040
<b>{\an2}Rowan, what you doing? I'm warming</b>
<b>my cream. Rowan.</b>

808
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,920
<b>{\an2}I don't think my buttercream's as</b>
<b>nice as I would like.</b>

809
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,440
<b>{\an2}I've probably overfilled them</b>
<b>but it doesn't matter.</b>

810
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,000
<b>{\an2}I'm shaking. This is ridiculous.</b>
<b>I can't do it.</b>

811
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,880
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you've got one minute left.</b>

812
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,800
<b>{\an2}If I can't get 12 out at least</b>
<b>I'm-a get six out.</b>

813
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,520
<b>{\an2}I don't know what they're gonna say.</b>

814
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,640
<b>{\an2}They don't look perfect to me.</b>

815
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,400
<b>{\an2}So ugly.</b>

816
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,920
<b>{\an2}OK, bakers, your time is up.</b>

817
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,120
<b>{\an2}Please come and bring your bakes</b>

818
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,240
<b>{\an2}and place them behind your</b>
<b>beautiful photos.</b>

819
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,640
<b>{\an2}They are so ugly.</b>
<b>They look absolutely...</b>

820
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,120
<b>{\an8}..rubbish.</b>
<b>I've got custard on my trainers.</b>

821
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,840
<b>{\an2}On your meggings? On my megging?</b>

822
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,920
<b>{\an8}Yeah. What's that?</b>
<b>Your megging, trainers.</b>

823
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,960
<b>{\an2}OK, bakers, let's welcome back</b>
<b>our judges.</b>

824
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,520
<b>{\an2}We missed you guys.</b>

825
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,600
<b>{\an2}Paul and Prue are looking</b>
<b>for 12 identical custard creams</b>

826
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,400
<b>{\an2}with their iconic pattern well</b>
<b>defined and filled</b>

827
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,440
<b>{\an2}with a smooth custard buttercream</b>

828
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,080
<b>{\an2}and they have no idea</b>
<b>whose are whose.</b>

829
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,720
<b>{\an2}Not very easy, but you seem</b>
<b>to have more or less managed it.</b>

830
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
<b>{\an2}More or less!</b>

831
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,280
<b>{\an2}Shall we start over here, Prue?</b>

832
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,360
<b>{\an2}They look a bit pale,</b>
<b>is my first thought.</b>

833
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,800
<b>{\an2}They do look a bit pale.</b>

834
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,520
<b>{\an2}There is a bit of definition</b>
<b>there... Yes, it's good.</b>

835
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,800
<b>{\an2}..and they are pretty neat.</b>

836
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,280
<b>{\an2}And they're not overfilled.</b>

837
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,360
<b>{\an2}Nice snap.</b>

838
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,480
<b>{\an2}That biscuit just needs</b>
<b>a bit longer in the oven.</b>

839
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,480
<b>{\an2}It's got a slightly floury taste.</b>

840
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,920
<b>{\an2}Moving on to number two.</b>

841
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,880
<b>{\an2}Now these lost a little bit of</b>
<b>definition here.</b>

842
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,120
<b>{\an2}The filling inside is a bit sparse.</b>

843
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,160
<b>{\an2}Also it's not quite set. Mm-hm.</b>

844
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,880
<b>{\an2}Still very soft.</b>
<b>And so's the biscuit actually.</b>

845
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,240
<b>{\an2}Not much snap to that.</b>

846
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,840
<b>{\an2}Again, I think it needs a little</b>
<b>longer in the oven. Yeah, it does.</b>

847
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,880
<b>{\an2}This one unfortunately</b>
<b>has very little definition.</b>

848
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,360
<b>{\an2}You can't read "custard cream"</b>
<b>on it. Yeah.</b>

849
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,320
<b>{\an2}Well, filled though.</b>
<b>Difference in thickness and thin.</b>

850
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,440
<b>{\an2}They're just not rolled enough</b>
<b>because the dough was quite soft.</b>

851
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,040
<b>{\an2}The custard is</b>
<b>better than the biscuit.</b>

852
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,760
<b>{\an2}Yeah, it is.</b>

853
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,280
<b>{\an2}This has got a bit of colour</b>
<b>to it, which I quite like.</b>

854
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,920
<b>{\an2}We expect a little bit more</b>
<b>definition, but it's not bad.</b>

855
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,640
<b>{\an2}The piping's pretty good. Yeah.</b>
<b>Mm-mm.</b>

856
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,440
<b>{\an2}And tastes properly baked. Mm-hm.</b>

857
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,120
<b>{\an2}Moving on. Lovely colour,</b>
<b>pretty even on the top and bottom.</b>

858
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,280
<b>{\an2}Very, very good. Well filled.</b>
<b>Mm-hm.</b>

859
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,360
<b>{\an2}Needed a little bit longer</b>
<b>in the oven.</b>

860
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,360
<b>{\an2}It's a pity because,</b>
<b>apart from that,</b>

861
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,080
<b>{\an2}I would've said that's pretty</b>
<b>faultless. They look wonderful.</b>

862
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,360
<b>{\an2}Now, this one's got a little bit</b>
<b>more colour on it.</b>

863
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,160
<b>{\an2}There's a bit of definition here,</b>

864
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,880
<b>{\an2}although it's washed out on</b>
<b>a few of them. Well filled.</b>

865
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,240
<b>{\an2}The custard comes through really</b>
<b>nicely in it. Good flavour.</b>

866
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,000
<b>{\an2}Same old problem.</b>
<b>A little bit underbaked.</b>

867
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,440
<b>{\an1}THUNDER RUMBLES</b>

868
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,400
<b>{\an2}Lost a bit of definition in places.</b>

869
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,040
<b>{\an2}Yeah, and a little unevenly filled.</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>

870
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,440
<b>{\an2}There is actually a little bit</b>
<b>of a crunch to that.</b>

871
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,680
<b>{\an2}It's not bad, but it's a</b>
<b>bit...thick.</b>

872
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,560
<b>{\an2}This one, a lot of them,</b>
<b>are misshapen.</b>

873
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,920
<b>{\an2}That one's thin at one end</b>
<b>and fat at the other.</b>

874
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,520
<b>{\an2}That one there's got no definition</b>
<b>on it at all.</b>

875
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,480
<b>{\an2}That custard actually curdled.</b>

876
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,240
<b>{\an2}It's a shame.</b>

877
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,000
<b>{\an2}This has got nice definition.</b>
<b>Beautiful. Nice and equal.</b>

878
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,400
<b>{\an2}Colour's right. It's got the</b>
<b>slight brown hue to it.</b>

879
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,920
<b>{\an2}That looks really good.</b>
<b>Nice and thin.</b>

880
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,680
<b>{\an2}Yeah, mm-hm. Now you're talking,</b>
<b>really crispy.</b>

881
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,320
<b>{\an2}That's a custard cream.</b>
<b>In fact that's a lot better</b>

882
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,760
<b>{\an2}than a commercial custard cream.</b>
<b>Very, very good.</b>

883
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,960
<b>{\an2}These are a bit messy.</b>
<b>Uneven, no definition, the dough</b>

884
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,640
<b>{\an2}was obviously very soft, very</b>
<b>difficult to cut.</b>

885
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,360
<b>{\an2}It's like rubber.</b>
<b>Not a success, sadly. Mm-hm.</b>

886
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,960
<b>{\an2}Hmm. Now these look great.</b>
<b>Don't they look good?</b>

887
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,920
<b>{\an2}Even, they look very professional.</b>

888
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,040
<b>{\an2}Sadly, slightly underbaked. You know</b>
<b>why, it's cos they're too thick.</b>

889
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,560
<b>{\an2}Mm-hm, another couple of minutes</b>
<b>that would've been perfect.</b>

890
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,280
<b>{\an2}It's a real shame.</b>

891
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,520
<b>{\an2}ALISON: Paul and Prue will now rank</b>
<b>the custard creams</b>

00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,280
<b>{\an2}from worst to best.</b>

893
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,440
<b>{\an2}In 11th place, we have this one.</b>

894
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,200
<b>{\an2}Keith, they're a bit of a mess.</b>
<b>Bit misshapen.</b>

895
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,520
<b>{\an2}They look like they were done</b>
<b>in a rush.</b>

896
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,120
<b>{\an2}In 10th spot, we have this one.</b>

897
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,760
<b>{\an2}Saku, a real mess and too soft,</b>
<b>slightly underbaked.</b>

898
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,600
<b>{\an2}In ninth place, we have this one.</b>

899
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,480
<b>{\an2}Cristy, they're a bit uneven.</b>

900

<b>{\an2}And so, you don't get</b>
<b>the definition.</b>

901
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,880
<b>{\an2}NOEL: Tasha's in eighth place,</b>

<b>{\an2}And in third place,</b>
<b>we have this one.</b>

907

<b>{\an2}Rowan, they're really nice,</b>

908

<b>{\an2}In second, we have this one.</b>

<b>{\an2}Whose is this?</b>

911
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,840
<b>{\an2}To be honest,</b>
<b>these were pretty good,</b>

912
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,480
<b>{\an2}just not as good as number one.</b>

913
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,720
<b>{\an2}Well done.</b>

914
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,400
<b>{\an2}Which means the winner is this one.</b>

915

<b>{\an2}Abbi! Pretty well perfect</b>
<b>custard creams, well done.</b>

00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,080
<b>{\an2}Oh, I'm just so, so relieved!</b>

917
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,840
<b>{\an2}I mean, "Better than a commercial</b>
<b>custard cream."</b>

918
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,360
<b>{\an2}That's high praise.</b>
<b>I'm really pleased about that.</b>

919
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,160
<b>{\an2}I pulled that out the bag,</b>
<b>didn't I, really.</b>

920
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,200
<b>{\an2}That is so much better than last</b>

<b>{\an2}I'm really enjoying biscuit week.</b>

<b>{\an2}For me, highlight, Tasha's</b>
<b>handshake. That was incredible.</b>

<b>{\an2}I missed it. It was my first one,</b>
<b>it was amazing. Well deserved.</b>

<b>{\an2}It was well deserved. She dropped</b>
<b>a little bit in the Tech.</b>

<b>{\an2}I'd like to see her do really</b>
<b>well in the Showstopper. Yes.</b>

931
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,720
<b>{\an2}So who do you think is in danger of</b>
<b>going? I think Keith is in trouble.</b>

932
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,400
<b>{\an2}The actual marshmallow biscuit</b>
<b>he created looked awful.</b>

933
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,200
<b>{\an2}I mean, really big lumps</b>
<b>of nuts on the top.</b>

934
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,160
<b>{\an2}But the taste was very good.</b>

935
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,720
<b>{\an2}I think Dana is in</b>
<b>a little bit of trouble.</b>

936
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,920
<b>{\an2}Struggled in the Sig and she</b>
<b>was seventh in the Technical.</b>

937
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,840
<b>{\an2}What about No Jam Nicky?</b>
<b>That was the funniest.</b>

938
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,800
<b>{\an2}No Jam Nicky!</b>
<b>She had literally no jam whatsoever.</b>

939
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,640
<b>{\an2}She picked two flavours,</b>
<b>rhubarb and ginger, which</b>
<b>really bring a flavour.</b>

940
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,280
<b>{\an2}Beautiful flavours</b>
<b>and then hardly put them in.</b>

941
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,920
<b>{\an2}Who is in line for Star Baker</b>
<b>at the moment?</b>

942
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,920
<b>{\an2}Rowan. Tash.</b>

943
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,200
<b>{\an2}I can't call it. I can't call it,</b>
<b>can you call it? Nobody can.</b>

944
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,000
<b>{\an2}Not even the god of baking,</b>
<b>Paul Hollywood!</b>

945
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,960
<b>{\an2}No, not even Paul Hollywood.</b>

946
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,800
<b>{\an2}Morning, bakers.</b>

947
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,120
<b>{\an2}For your Showstopper challenge,</b>

948
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,760
<b>{\an2}Prue and Paul would like you to make</b>
<b>an amazing illusion biscuit display,</b>

949
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,800
<b>{\an2}which is depicting</b>
<b>your favourite meal.</b>

950
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,400
<b>{\an2}What if their favourite meal</b>
<b>is a plate of biscuits?</b>

951
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,720
<b>{\an2}You didn't think about that,</b>
<b>did you, Paul?</b>

952
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,560
<b>{\an2}Now, you can choose any style of</b>
<b>biscuit. It's completely up to you.</b>

953
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,400
<b>{\an2}But it's got a taste amazing</b>
<b>and look visually realistic.</b>

954
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,960
<b>{\an2}You have four hours,</b>
<b>which seems a hell of a lot of time.</b>

955
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,600
<b>{\an2}On your marks. Get set. Bake.</b>

956
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,440
<b>{\an2}I'm looking forward</b>
<b>to the challenge today.</b>
<b>It's a bit different, isn't it?</b>

957
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,080
<b>{\an2}It's like something you never</b>
<b>think of doing basically,</b>
<b>so it's pretty cool.</b>

958
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,240
<b>{\an2}I feel like I'm a very</b>
<b>creative person,</b>

959
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,320
<b>{\an2}so I love coming up with new ideas.</b>

960
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,600
<b>{\an2}So it's kind of like my way,</b>
<b>I can finally get inventive.</b>

961
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,680
<b>{\an2}I'm very excited, I really am.</b>

962
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,640
<b>{\an2}We've asked them to make a meal or</b>
<b>a banquet scene out of biscuits.</b>

963
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,000
<b>{\an2}It could be burgers, it could be</b>
<b>pizzas, it could be anything.</b>
<b>Mine personally? Pizza.</b>

964
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,800
<b>{\an2}They really have to be a little</b>
<b>bit artistic with this</b>

965
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,200
<b>{\an2}and certainly a little bit of</b>
<b>sculpting knowledge would be useful.</b>

966
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,080
<b>{\an2}Nearly all the biscuits they bake</b>
<b>are going to have to be a very</b>

967
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,760
<b>{\an2}specific shape, so there is a real</b>
<b>danger of overworking the dough.</b>

968
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,280
<b>{\an2}And we all know that if you</b>
<b>overwork the dough it gets tough</b>

969
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,200
<b>{\an2}and loses its crumbly texture</b>
<b>and its crack.</b>

970
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,800
<b>{\an2}We want the biscuits</b>
<b>to taste good, look good,</b>

971
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,840
<b>{\an2}but look like something else.</b>

972
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,280
<b>{\an2}I want it to really have</b>
<b>that wow factor</b>

973
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,240
<b>{\an2}because it is the Showstopper</b>

974
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,800
<b>{\an2}and certainly for one baker</b>
<b>it's their last bake.</b>

975
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,880
<b>{\an2}Hello, Josh. Hello. Hello, Josh.</b>
<b>Right, Josh, illusion bake.</b>

976
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,720
<b>{\an2}What are you doing?</b>
<b>I am doing burger and fries.</b>

977
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,960
<b>{\an2}I've got five different</b>
<b>types of biscuit.</b>

978
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,200
<b>{\an2}I've got a gingerbread</b>
<b>for the chopping board</b>

979
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,480
<b>{\an2}and then the burger</b>
<b>is going to be a Florentine.</b>

980
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,880
<b>{\an2}Florentine, that's a very good idea.</b>
<b>It looks so realistic as well.</b>

981
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,400
<b>{\an2}Josh's gingerbread board will</b>
<b>display his orange shortbread fries</b>

982
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,000
<b>{\an2}and his towering burger complete</b>
<b>with his Florentine patties,</b>

983
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,000
<b>{\an2}almond flavoured burger buns</b>

984
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,960
<b>{\an2}and salad made from strawberry</b>
<b>flavoured sugar biscuits.</b>

985
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,520
<b>{\an2}I love this idea. You've thought</b>
<b>this through really well.</b>

986
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,520
<b>{\an2}Do you know what would</b>
<b>really help you?</b>

987
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,120
<b>{\an2}If you get a real burger and chips</b>
<b>and put it to the side,</b>

988
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,280
<b>{\an2}just so we've got something to look</b>
<b>at the difference between the two.</b>

989
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,880
<b>{\an2}Shall we order it now? Yes.</b>
<b>You might lose it though.</b>

990
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,480
<b>{\an2}It might disappear down Paul's neck!</b>
<b>See you, Josh. Well done.</b>

991
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,920
<b>{\an2}Josh isn't the only baker recreating</b>
<b>their favourite fast food feast.</b>

992
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,000
<b>{\an2}So I am making pizza.</b>

993
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,240
<b>{\an2}It was an absolute no-brainer.</b>

994
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,280
<b>{\an2}I literally probably have pizza</b>
<b>every Friday night.</b>

995
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,400
<b>{\an2}Dana's gravity defined pizza</b>

996
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,640
<b>{\an2}will comprise a maple pecan</b>
<b>shortbread base,</b>

997
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,400
<b>{\an2}date rolled stuffed crust</b>
<b>and a tuile pepperoni.</b>

998
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,800
<b>{\an2}What happened in the Signature?</b>
<b>Paul said he did like it.</b>

999
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,800
<b>{\an2}He literally said those words.</b>
<b>What about Prue? Prue liked it.</b>

1000
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,600
<b>{\an2}It's not enough though, is it?</b>
<b>It was very good cop, bad cop.</b>

1001
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,880
<b>{\an2}You need blue eyes to like it,</b>
<b>don't you? Are you slightly angry?</b>

1002
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,240
<b>{\an2}Livid.</b>

1003
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,080
<b>{\an2}First batch in.</b>

1004
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,000
<b>{\an2}With multiple batches to bake</b>

1005
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,120
<b>{\an2}in various shapes, sizes,</b>
<b>thicknesses and doughs...</b>

1006
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,720
<b>{\an2}That's going to go in the oven</b>
<b>for 36 minutes.</b>

1007
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,160
<b>{\an2}..the bakers will need to work</b>
<b>as efficiently as possible...</b>

1008
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,400
<b>{\an2}Right, behave yourselves.</b>

1009
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,000
<b>{\an2}..if they are to keep their biscuit</b>
<b>production line running smoothly.</b>

1010
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,680
<b>{\an2}There is just so much to do.</b>

1011
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,400
<b>{\an2}I've selected things and done them</b>
<b>at the right thickness,</b>

1012
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,400
<b>{\an2}so the oven temperature doesn't</b>
<b>really need to change much at all</b>
<b>throughout the whole bake.</b>

1013
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,160
<b>{\an2}I bake these, then they come out.</b>
<b>Then I bake my steamer basket.</b>

1014
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,440
<b>{\an2}Then I bake the other half</b>
<b>of my steamer basket.</b>

1015
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,000
<b>{\an2}Then I bake my dumplings.</b>
<b>Then I bake my other dumplings.</b>

1016
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,040
<b>{\an2}Then I do the batter ones</b>
<b>towards the end.</b>

1017
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,360
<b>{\an2}Just got to tick everything off to</b>
<b>make sure I don't miss anything.</b>

1018
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,200
<b>{\an2}I'm going to do like a cheeseboard.</b>

1019
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,280
<b>{\an2}I've made marzipan to go on top</b>
<b>of the biscotti to give you</b>
<b>the cured meat illusion.</b>

1020
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,800
<b>{\an2}What's happening here?</b>
<b>Is that bacon?</b>

1021
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,320
<b>{\an2}I knew it looked like bacon,</b>
<b>but it's not. What is it?</b>
<b>It's supposed to be Parma ham.</b>

1022
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,800
<b>{\an2}Oh, yeah, that's fine. Yeah, it does</b>
<b>look like Parma ham. Does it? Yeah.</b>

1023
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,720
<b>{\an2}Alongside her marzipan ham</b>
<b>covered biscotti,</b>

1024
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,760
<b>{\an2}Cristy's grazing board will feature</b>
<b>fondant-topped ginger biscuits</b>

1025
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,280
<b>{\an2}masquerading as slices of cheese,</b>

1026
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,840
<b>{\an2}and chorizo and orange</b>
<b>and pistachio biscuits</b>

1027
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,560
<b>{\an2}that will be stacked to make</b>
<b>an array of cheeses.</b>

1028
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,880
<b>{\an2}Oh, look at the bacon!</b>

1029
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,200
<b>{\an2}It's Parma ham.</b>

1030
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,240
<b>{\an2}It's Parma ham. It's not bacon.</b>

1031
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,200
<b>{\an2}Same thing, innit?</b>
<b>That's what I said!</b>

1032
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,760
<b>{\an2}It does look like bacon. All right,</b>
<b>don't laugh at me.</b>

1033
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,640
<b>{\an2}Cristy's not the only baker counting</b>
<b>on cured meat</b>

1034
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,080
<b>{\an2}to make an impression.</b>

1035
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,520
<b>{\an2}This is sugar cookie prosciutto.</b>

1036
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,560
<b>{\an2}I love a charcuterie night</b>
<b>with my mates.</b>

1037

<b>{\an2}It's quite nice to get everyone</b>
<b>around the dinner table,</b>

1038
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,920
<b>{\an2}and you can just kind of chill out,</b>
<b>talk to people,</b>

1039
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,520
<b>{\an2}eat some really smelly cheese,</b>

1040
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,360
<b>{\an2}and gorge on crackers and down</b>
<b>the wine. It's great.</b>

1041
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,760
<b>{\an2}Featuring prosciutto sugar biscuits,</b>
<b>and slices of bread</b>

<b>{\an2}and cheese made from Polish</b>
<b>gingerbread,</b>

<b>{\an2}Rowan's attempting a recreation of</b>
<b>his favourite student night in.</b>

1044
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,280
<b>{\an2}So you've got a cupboard full</b>
<b>of pinot</b>

1045
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,400
<b>{\an2}and a load of charcuterie in</b>
<b>the fridge? Yeah.</b>

1046
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,160
<b>{\an2}And that's your university life?</b>

1047
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,760
<b>{\an2}That's me, yeah. Question, how do</b>
<b>you afford all this?</b>

1048
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,960
<b>{\an2}This is like...</b>
<b>You're at university.</b>

<b>{\an2}I'm at uni. Yet you're having</b>
<b>one of these boards?</b>

<b>{\an2}You don't want to see my overdraft,</b>
<b>Alison. You don't. I don't.</b>

<b>{\an2}The battle of the grazing boards has</b>
<b>a third contender.</b>

1052

<b>{\an2}It's like a cheese board is</b>
<b>what I'm going for.</b>

<b>{\an2}competition is?</b>
<b>Anyone you're scared of?</b>

1062
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,760
<b>{\an2}Abbi as well, cos I can see</b>

<b>{\an2}So for my Showstopper, I am making</b>
<b>a dim sum brunch</b>

1066
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,200
<b>{\an2}because I love Chinese food.</b>

1069
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,640
<b>{\an2}So I thought, you know what,</b>
<b>I'll give it a go,</b>

1070
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,920
<b>{\an2}make it out of biscuit.</b>

<b>which aren't technically an illusion</b>

1076
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,560

<b>complete without fortune cookies.</b>

1077
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,120
<b>{\an2}So, I've written some</b>

1090
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,880
<b>{\an2}I think in the technical you did OK,</b>

1091
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,320
<b>{\an2}but in the signature you smashed it</b>
<b>out the park.</b>

1092
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,040
<b>{\an2}I expect today to be as good as</b>

<b>{\an2}No pressure. No pressure. See you</b>

<b>{\an2}I'm hoping to present you</b>

<b>{\an2}that I presented you with yesterday.</b>

<b>{\an2}Well, they tasted great.</b>

1101
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,600
<b>{\an2}I've called it my Lee on</b>
<b>Solent lunchtime meal deal.</b>

1102
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,400
<b>{\an2}I work from home and I live near</b>
<b>the seaside,</b>

1103
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,200
<b>{\an2}so quite often when I make my lunch,</b>
<b>I'll go down to</b>

1104
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,920
<b>{\an2}the seaside and sit on the beach</b>
<b>for half an hour. Ah, that's lovely.</b>

<b>{\an2}And eat your meal deal. See the</b>
<b>waves coming in, eat my meal deal.</b>

1106
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,920
<b>{\an2}And if I've been a good boy</b>

1107
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,520
<b>{\an2}and I've worked hard in</b>
<b>the morning, I treat myself to</b>

<b>{\an2}a pink and white squirty ice cream.</b>

<b>{\an2}Keith's Viennese biscuit</b>

<b>{\an2}ham and tomato sandwich with</b>
<b>a spiced biscuit crust,</b>

1112
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,440
<b>{\an2}and a portion of almond tuile crisps</b>
<b>contained within their cylindrical</b>

1113
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,800
<b>{\an2}gingerbread packaging.</b>

1114
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,720
<b>{\an2}I'm creating the two halves</b>
<b>of my Pringles tube.</b>

1115
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,960
<b>{\an2}But of course as soon as</b>
<b>the heat hits it,</b>

1116
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,160
<b>{\an2}it all flops down to the bottom</b>
<b>of the oven,</b>

1117
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,840
<b>{\an2}so I've got to really watch them.</b>

1118
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,160
<b>{\an2}So that goes in.</b>

1119
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:33,520
<b>{\an2}There's two things I've got to put</b>
<b>on - the timer and glasses.</b>

1120
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,800
<b>{\an2}So I can see what's going on.</b>

1121
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,080
<b>{\an2}I'm just going to brush</b>
<b>the garibaldi with some egg white.</b>

1122
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,240
<b>{\an2}I think it gives it a glaze.</b>

1123
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,120
<b>{\an2}That I'm then going to hide with</b>
<b>fondant. So why are we bothering?</b>

1124
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,720
<b>{\an2}These are the burger buns. They've</b>
<b>kept their shape really nicely.</b>

1125
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,400
<b>{\an2}While it's important</b>
<b>the bakers' biscuits showcase</b>

1126
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,000
<b>{\an2}a variety of tastes and textures...</b>

1127

<b>{\an2}Biscotti in.</b>

1128

<b>{\an2}This is the burger</b>

1129
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,640
<b>{\an2}and it's a Florentine burger,</b>

1130
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,120
<b>{\an2}so I've got walnuts, pecans</b>
<b>and almonds in there.</b>

1131
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,680
<b>{\an2}..Paul and Prue are expecting</b>
<b>convincing illusion biscuits...</b>

1132
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,960
<b>{\an2}These are the gingerbread cups.</b>

1133
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,720
<b>{\an2}..so the bakers need to get creative</b>
<b>with their moulds.</b>

1134
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,520
<b>{\an2}This is the steamer basket.</b>

1135
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,840
<b>{\an2}This basically is just</b>

1136
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,280
<b>{\an2}to hold everything in place</b>
<b>while it bakes.</b>

1137
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,400
<b>{\an2}And hope their choice</b>
<b>of biscuit is robust enough.</b>

1138
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:21,000
<b>{\an2}Trying to make a bowl.</b>
<b>This is the Palet Breton.</b>

1139
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,720
<b>{\an2}It's really strong. I tried</b>
<b>different doughs</b>

1140
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,040
<b>{\an2}and they just kind of melted in</b>
<b>the oven.</b>

1141
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,000
<b>{\an2}And Keith's gingerbread</b>
<b>crisp tubes...</b>

1142
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,320
<b>{\an2}BLEEP.</b>

1143
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,120
<b>{\an2}..have done just that.</b>

1144
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,840
<b>{\an2}I can't believe the state of this.</b>

1145
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,280
<b>{\an2}The two halves of the cylinder,</b>
<b>they've both slid off.</b>

1146
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,360
<b>{\an2}Yeah, a bit panicky.</b>

1147
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,760
<b>{\an2}I made sure I made plenty of</b>
<b>gingerbread</b>

1148
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,480
<b>{\an2}for fear of this happening.</b>

1149
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,920
<b>{\an2}But I can't afford</b>
<b>to get it wrong twice.</b>

1150
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,600
<b>{\an8}Bakers, you have halfway left.</b>

1151
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,760
<b>{\an8}Halfway left?</b>

1152
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,680
<b>{\an8}You're halfway left.</b>

1153
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,800
<b>{\an2}Halfway there.</b>

1154
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,640
<b>{\an2}I've got my next try at</b>
<b>the gingerbread cylinder.</b>

1155
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,600
<b>{\an2}I would say it's slightly better.</b>
<b>I just...</b>

1156
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,640
<b>{\an2}I'm really desperate for this</b>
<b>to happen.</b>

1157
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,960
<b>{\an2}As Keith's crisp tube takes</b>
<b>a second shot in the oven,</b>

1158
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
<b>{\an2}the other bakers' illusions are</b>
<b>starting to take shape.</b>

1159
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:21,200
<b>{\an2}Now I'm just assembling the little</b>
<b>pizza and the stuffed crust.</b>

1160
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,080
<b>{\an2}This is the camembert.</b>

1161
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,640
<b>{\an2}This is one of my two different</b>
<b>shapes of dumplings,</b>

1162
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,680
<b>{\an2}and I'm just filling it with</b>
<b>apricot and pistachio filling.</b>

1163
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,800
<b>{\an2}I've got my tomato rings</b>
<b>with the strawberry biscuit.</b>

1164
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,760
<b>{\an2}I've put some crushed</b>
<b>boiled sweets,</b>

1165
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,280
<b>{\an2}into there and they're going to</b>
<b>melt,</b>

1166
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,800
<b>{\an2}and they'll form the watery bit</b>
<b>inside a tomato.</b>

1167
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,360
<b>{\an2}Saku, is that real onions?</b>
<b>Yeah, that's real onion.</b>

1168
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,600
<b>{\an2}But you're not supposed</b>
<b>to do real onions, babe.</b>

1169
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,040
<b>{\an2}You're supposed to make it look like</b>
<b>onion. It is a side dish.</b>

1170
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,400
<b>{\an2}But it's real onions?</b>

1171
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,720
<b>{\an2}Really?</b>

1172
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,880
<b>{\an2}Alongside Saku's onions will be</b>
<b>a biscuit rendering of</b>

1173
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,080
<b>{\an2}a traditional Sri Lankan breakfast,</b>
<b>featuring coconut</b>

<b>{\an2}and cardamom biscuit hoppers,</b>

1175

<b>{\an2}rotis of cheddar, rosemary and black</b>
<b>pepper,</b>

1176
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,840
<b>{\an1}and a chocolate and coffee</b>
<b>biscuit chicken curry.</b>

1177
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,480
<b>{\an2}Sri Lankan breakfast is</b>
<b>very filling.</b>

1178
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,800
<b>{\an2}So you can hold on for</b>
<b>the whole day until dinner time,</b>

1179
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,120
<b>{\an2}maybe lunch time for me, after</b>
<b>having that breakfast.</b>

1180
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,360
<b>{\an2}Of course Sri Lankan food is</b>
<b>the best in the world!</b>

1181
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,840
<b>{\an2}Without a doubt.</b>

1182
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,760
<b>{\an2}Saku might be trying to recreate</b>

<b>{\an2}a traditional Sri Lankan breakfast,</b>

<b>{\an2}but Nicky has some traditions</b>
<b>of her own.</b>

<b>{\an2}I'm just sandwiching</b>
<b>the biscuits together now</b>

<b>{\an2}to sort of resemble a wee bit</b>
<b>of steak.</b>

1187

<b>{\an2}So I'm doing a steak pie</b>

<b>{\an2}because even now when I go home,</b>

<b>{\an2}Mum always cooks a steak pie.</b>

<b>{\an2}Beneath her shortbread pie crust,</b>

1191

<b>{\an2}Nicky's chocolate steak biscuits</b>
<b>will be sandwiched with</b>

<b>{\an2}a hazelnut and orange ganache.</b>

<b>{\an2}Rosehip marzipan peas and shortbread</b>
<b>chips will sit alongside on</b>

<b>{\an2}a plate of decorated gingerbread.</b>

1195

<b>{\an2}I believe Dan is doing</b>
<b>a pie as well.</b>

1196
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,160
<b>{\an2}No pressure again. Just seems</b>

1197
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,160
<b>{\an2}to be all I ever do is get</b>
<b>under pressure, doesn't it?</b>

1198
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,280
<b>{\an2}Yeah, cos Dan's pretty good.</b>

1199
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,080
<b>{\an2}So, I don't know how I'll get on.</b>

1200
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,400
<b>{\an2}So I am doing a cheese</b>
<b>and onion pie.</b>

1201
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,200
<b>{\an2}When I shout from the kitchen,</b>

1203
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,840
<b>{\an2}and onion pie.</b>
<b>Yeah, so it's a firm favourite.</b>

1204

<b>shortbread onions</b>

<b>{\an2}Nestled next to his pie will be</b>

1209

<b>{\an2}a generous portion of shortbread</b>
<b>peas and vanilla biscuit chips.</b>

1210
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,040
<b>{\an2}Quite a mess, your work station.</b>
<b>It's giving me a panic attack.</b>

1211

<b>{\an2}I know. I'm in the process of</b>

<b>{\an2}You know who loves that? Paul</b>
<b>Hollywood.</b>

<b>{\an2}Like, this would freak him out.</b>

1214
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,040
<b>{\an2}Yeah, I know. He'd just be like,</b>
<b>"Argh!" That's why he</b>

1215
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,680
<b>{\an2}was just like tutting and shaking</b>
<b>his head walking past me before.</b>

1216

<b>{\an2}Have you ever seen one</b>
<b>of his work stations?</b>

1217
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,280
<b>{\an2}No. Denim.</b>

1218

<b>{\an2}Starched denim.</b>

1219

<b>{\an2}Bakers, you have one hour left.</b>

1220

1221

<b>{\an2}Ooh. Cannot begin to tell you how</b>
<b>relieved I am with that.</b>

1222
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,320
<b>{\an2}Ah!</b>

<b>{\an2}I'm making these things called tuile</b>
<b>biscuits</b>

<b>{\an2}..and the rest of the bakers can</b>
<b>start bringing their illusions</b>

<b>{\an2}to life with decoration.</b>

1229

<b>{\an2}So, yeah, I love this bit.</b>

1230
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,800
<b>{\an2}I'm just painting up</b>
<b>the gingerbread plate.</b>

1231
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,800
<b>{\an2}It's quite hard cos the icing's</b>
<b>not set.</b>

1232
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,680
<b>{\an2}This is what makes it look</b>
<b>like bamboo.</b>

1233
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,200
<b>{\an2}Doing some lattice work here</b>
<b>to achieve the red</b>

<b>{\an2}Cut this, cut this.</b>

1236
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,560
<b>{\an2}Chuffing heck. I'm looking around</b>

1237
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,600
<b>{\an2}and everybody's is so good</b>
<b>and realistic.</b>

1238
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,640
<b>{\an2}This is shocking.</b>

1239
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,640
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you have 30 minutes left.</b>

1240
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,920
<b>{\an2}I'm putting melted chocolate onto</b>
<b>these florentines just</b>

1241
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,240
<b>{\an2}to make them look like the burgers.</b>

1242
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,440
<b>{\an2}Is there anything I can do</b>
<b>to help you? No.</b>

1243
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,880
<b>{\an2}Do you want to get on my shoulders?</b>

1244
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,680
<b>{\an2}No. OK, maybe later.</b>

1245
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,880
<b>{\an2}But thank you.</b>

1246
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,640
<b>{\an2}This is royal icing which is</b>
<b>the tomato sauce.</b>

1247
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,800
<b>{\an2}My favourite bit actually is</b>
<b>the tomato rings.</b>

1248
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,520
<b>{\an2}They look really, really pretty.</b>

1249
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,560
<b>{\an2}This is meant to represent the seeds</b>
<b>of the tomato.</b>

1250
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,080
<b>{\an2}The top of the camembert,</b>
<b>I've just torched it.</b>

1251
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,560
<b>{\an2}This is white chocolate</b>

1252
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,920
<b>{\an2}and this is creating</b>
<b>the cheese pull for the pizza.</b>

1253
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,600
<b>{\an2}Just got to make the brie look like</b>
<b>the brie.</b>

1254
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,160
<b>{\an2}Yeah, we're getting there now,</b>
<b>aren't we?</b>

1255
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,600
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you have five minutes left.</b>

1256
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,640
<b>{\an2}Scissors, scissors, scissors!</b>

1257
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,360
<b>{\an2}Get some chips on,</b>
<b>let's see how they look.</b>

1258
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,680
<b>{\an2}I do like my chips on</b>
<b>the darker side.</b>

1259
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,280
<b>{\an2}Just piping the grapes</b>
<b>and the olives.</b>

1260
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,520
<b>{\an2}How long do we have?</b>

1261
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,640
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you have one minute left.</b>

1262
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,040
<b>{\an2}Tuile pepperoni.</b>

1263
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,800
<b>{\an2}Taking it to the wire.</b>

1264
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,960
<b>{\an2}They're little gherkins.</b>

1265
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,640
<b>{\an2}Right.</b>

1266
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,240
<b>{\an2}Bakers, that is time up.</b>

1267

<b>{\an2}Please step away from</b>
<b>your Showstoppers.</b>

1268
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,240
<b>{\an2}It's so bad.</b>

1269
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,560
<b>{\an2}First time in three things I haven't</b>
<b>had an absolutely mad panic.</b>

1270
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,080
<b>{\an2}Have I forgotten anything?</b>

1271
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,720
<b>{\an2}Josh's is BLEEP outrageous.</b>

1272
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,520
<b>{\an2}Yeah, that's sick, innit?</b>

1273
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,840
<b>{\an2}It's judgment time for the bakers'</b>
<b>biscuit illusion banquets.</b>

1274
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,480
<b>{\an2}Tasha, would you like to bring up</b>
<b>your Showstopper, please?</b>

1275
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,160
<b>{\an8}I think it looks good.</b>

1276
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,480
<b>{\an2}Thank you.</b>

1277
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,200
<b>{\an2}It's very pretty.</b>

1278
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,480
<b>{\an2}It does give the illusion of being</b>
<b>a chicken katsu.</b>

1279
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,720
<b>{\an2}Um, I'll take a little bit of the...</b>

1280
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,080
<b>{\an2}It is a Palet Breton lemon-flavoured</b>
<b>bowl.</b>

1281
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,440
<b>{\an2}Hmm. Mm. Good, isn't it?</b>

1282
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,640
<b>{\an2}That biscuit is nice</b>
<b>and sharp with flavour.</b>

1283
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,600
<b>{\an2}Limoncello comes through nicely.</b>

1284
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,280
<b>{\an2}Let's have some of the chicken.</b>

1285
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,240
<b>{\an2}This one is an orange and almond</b>
<b>biscotti coated in white chocolate.</b>

1286
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,000
<b>{\an2}That biscotti's delicious.</b>

1287
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,320
<b>{\an2}Oh.</b>

1288
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:18,040
<b>{\an2}I love the crunch, the flavour.</b>

1289
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,720
<b>{\an2}The texture's spot on.</b>
<b>Really good.</b>

1290
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,360
<b>{\an2}Both of those biscuits are perfect.</b>

1291
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,400
<b>{\an2}You have set a bar that's</b>
<b>a little bit high.</b>

1292
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,760
<b>{\an2}Well done.</b>

1293
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,280
<b>{\an2}Thank you so much.</b>

1294
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,800
<b>{\an8}Well, I think that it looks</b>
<b>wonderful.</b>

1295
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,040
<b>{\an2}Let's have a look at this.</b>
<b>That's the ginger.</b>

1296
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,720
<b>{\an2}Ginger's got a good flavour,</b>
<b>nice and warm.</b>

1297
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,200
<b>{\an2}Is this a biscotti? Yeah.</b>

1298
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,520
<b>{\an2}Almond and dried cherry.</b>

1299
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,760
<b>{\an2}Biscotti's very nice,</b>
<b>it's nice and tangy.</b>

1300
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,200
<b>{\an2}I think you've done well.</b>

1301
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,720
<b>{\an2}It's smart, it's neat. Well done.</b>

1302
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,120
<b>{\an2}Thank you, guys.</b>

1303
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,000
<b>{\an2}We'll start...</b>
<b>We'll have a look at these.</b>

1304
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,200
<b>{\an2}These are...</b>

1305
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,400
<b>{\an2}It's a spiced black pepper</b>
<b>gingerbread type thing.</b>

1306
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,760
<b>{\an2}Good flavour.</b>

1307
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,600
<b>{\an2}Texture's softened slightly,</b>

1308
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,600
<b>{\an2}uh, because of the topping on it.</b>

1309
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,560
<b>{\an2}The illusion bit doesn't work</b>
<b>all that well.</b>

1310
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,120
<b>{\an2}After a while, you realise that's</b>
<b>maybe salami on top.</b>

1311
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,520
<b>{\an2}Is that right? Yeah.</b>

1312
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,600
<b>{\an2}But I do like the flavours,</b>
<b>your flavours are good.</b>

1313
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,080
<b>{\an2}Yeah.</b>

1314
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,720
<b>{\an2}It's a terrific illusion. I mean,</b>
<b>as soon as you look at it,</b>

1315
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,200
<b>{\an2}it really looks like a cheeseboard.</b>

1316
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,680
<b>{\an2}These sort of crackers,</b>
<b>this is the one I want to try.</b>

1317
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,240
<b>{\an2}I saw you making these.</b>

1318
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,240
<b>{\an2}Yeah, they looked as if they were</b>
<b>stuffed with cranberries.</b>

1319
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,880
<b>{\an2}Very crumbly shortbread.</b>

1320
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,280
<b>{\an2}It's lovely. Yeah.</b>

1321
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,840
<b>{\an2}Well done, Matty. Thank you, Matty.</b>

1322

<b>{\an2}Thank you, cheers.</b>

1323
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,920
<b>{\an8}I think it's clever.</b>

1324
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,880
<b>{\an2}I'm not quite sure I've seen</b>
<b>many tomatoes...</b>

1325
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,680
<b>{\an2}..like that. No.</b>

1326
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,880
<b>{\an2}They're from the south coast. We...</b>

1327
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,840
<b>{\an2}We have very good...</b>

1328
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,040
<b>{\an2}We have very good growing</b>
<b>conditions,</b>

1329
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,880
<b>{\an2}and you get that redness.</b>
<b>That's amazing.</b>

1330
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,560
<b>{\an2}I do like the way you've done</b>
<b>the bread. Oh, dear.</b>

1331
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,160
<b>{\an2}It's very soft.</b>

1332
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,360
<b>{\an2}Great flavour.</b>

1333
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,640
<b>{\an2}Your flavours are always good.</b>

1334
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,360
<b>{\an2}The issue is, I shouldn't be able to</b>
<b>push my finger in like that. No.</b>

1335
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,840
<b>{\an2}It's too soft.</b>

1336
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,120
<b>{\an2}The ham slice in the middle,</b>
<b>is that the same?</b>

1337
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,160
<b>{\an2}Yes.</b>

1338
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,760
<b>{\an2}That is much better baked.</b>

1339
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,480
<b>{\an2}Right, the ice cream.</b>

1340
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,720
<b>{\an2}It's vanilla-flavoured Viennese</b>
<b>and raspberry buttercream.</b>

1341
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,200
<b>{\an2}Slightly raw inside the biscuit.</b>

1342
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,800
<b>{\an2}You struggled on this one a bit,</b>
<b>Keith.</b>

1343
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,080
<b>{\an2}I have to say, I've never seen</b>
<b>a pizza that deep.</b>

1344
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,240
<b>{\an2}Neither have I, to be honest!</b>

1345
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,040
<b>{\an2}But that's the dream.</b>

1346
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,760
<b>{\an2}So, the bottom two are the</b>
<b>shortbread,</b>

1347
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,880
<b>{\an2}and the top is just a vanilla</b>
<b>biscuit with the date filling.</b>

1348
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,680
<b>{\an2}Well, I enjoyed all that a lot.</b>

1349
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,280
<b>{\an2}You've done a really good job</b>
<b>with that.</b>

1350
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,160
<b>{\an2}I think the flavours and textures</b>
<b>are clever.</b>

1351
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,760
<b>{\an2}And it's so original.</b>

1352
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,400
<b>{\an2}I mean, I love the date-stuffed</b>
<b>crust.</b>

1353
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,200
<b>{\an2}Thank you, Dana. Thank you.</b>

1354
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,960
<b>{\an2}I like the look of this,</b>
<b>this is clever.</b>

1355
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,440
<b>{\an2}Love the steam basket. Very nice,</b>
<b>steamer basket, it's beautiful.</b>

1356
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,800
<b>{\an2}Absolutely perfect.</b>

1357
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,000
<b>{\an2}And what's in these?</b>

1358
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,680
<b>{\an2}So, it's an apricot, pistachio</b>
<b>and thyme filling.</b>

1359
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,040
<b>{\an2}Filling is very strong,</b>
<b>but it's delicious.</b>

1360
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:15,400
<b>{\an2}And the biscuit is crisp</b>
<b>and flavoursome.</b>

1361
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,280
<b>{\an2}It looks like a dim sum.</b>
<b>This looks lovely.</b>

1362
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,080
<b>{\an2}So, I think you've done a decent job</b>
<b>with this.</b>

1363
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,400
<b>{\an2}The illusion works.</b>

1364
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,240
<b>{\an2}Thank you very much.</b>
<b>Thank you. Well done.</b>

1365
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,640
<b>{\an2}These are the rotis?</b>
<b>Very delicious.</b>

1366
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,240
<b>{\an2}That is fantastic.</b>
<b>They're so good.</b>

1367
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,960
<b>{\an2}That in its own right should be</b>
<b>a well-known Sri Lankan delicacy.</b>

1368
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,800
<b>{\an2}OK. Let's try a hopper.</b>

1369
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,920
<b>{\an2}The spices in there are good,</b>

1370
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,560
<b>{\an2}but I think you could've done</b>
<b>more with that.</b>

1371
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,440
<b>{\an2}Perhaps if you'd have made the egg</b>
<b>a little bigger</b>

1372
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,080
<b>{\an2}and done it with spring onion,</b>
<b>a bit of chilli,</b>

1373
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,280
<b>{\an2}so that it looked more colourful.</b>
<b>Yes.</b>

1374
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,280
<b>{\an8}It's just beautiful. Amazing.</b>

1375
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,200
<b>{\an2}Are these chips shortbread?</b>

1376
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,120
<b>{\an2}Uh, just vanilla,</b>
<b>like a sable biscuit.</b>

1377
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,560
<b>{\an2}They taste nice,</b>
<b>but they are a little bit burnt.</b>

1378
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,400
<b>{\an2}Let's have a look at this pie.</b>

1379
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,360
<b>{\an2}What is the biscuit here?</b>
<b>This is...</b>

1380
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,800
<b>{\an2}It's, like, a pistachio shortbread</b>
<b>in there, as well.</b>

1381
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,000
<b>{\an2}Do you know, I think it's</b>
<b>absolutely delicious. It is.</b>

1382
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,400
<b>{\an2}I think it's a triumph,</b>
<b>I really do.</b>

1383
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,080
<b>{\an2}I think you've done a great job</b>
<b>on the biscuits,</b>

1384
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,040
<b>{\an2}except for the overbaking slightly.</b>

1385
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,800
<b>{\an2}And the filling is wonderful.</b>

1386
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,760
<b>{\an2}Well done. Excellent.</b>
<b>Well done, Dan.</b>

1387
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,240
<b>{\an2}Thank you very much. Thanks.</b>

1388
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,320
<b>{\an2}It's a good looking thing.</b>
<b>I mean, it's...</b>

1389
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,800
<b>{\an2}It's neat. It's quite well detailed,</b>
<b>and it is neat.</b>

1390
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,520
<b>{\an2}Right, let's try the shortbread.</b>

1391
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,320
<b>{\an2}To be honest, your chips do look</b>
<b>more like shortbread fingers</b>

1392
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,520
<b>{\an2}than chips.</b>
<b>LAUGHING: They do, don't they?</b>

1393
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,960
<b>{\an2}They do, don't they?</b>

1394
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,760
<b>{\an2}What is the beef?</b>

1395
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:49,000
<b>{\an2}The beef is a chocolate biscuit</b>
<b>with chocolate ganache,</b>

1396
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,160
<b>{\an2}with orange and hazelnuts</b>
<b>through it.</b>

1397
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,240
<b>{\an2}The chocolate and hazelnut</b>
<b>are beautiful.</b>

1398
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,320
<b>{\an2}The texture falls apart</b>
<b>in the mouth.</b>

1399
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,000
<b>{\an2}And the ganache just tops it off.</b>

1400
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,120
<b>{\an2}It's a good sandwich biscuit.</b>
<b>Mm.</b>

1401
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,560
<b>{\an2}And what's the bowl made of?</b>

1402
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,720
<b>{\an2}Gingerbread.</b>

1403
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,880
<b>{\an2}Gingerbread. Gingerbread.</b>

1404
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,600
<b>{\an2}The flavour of the ginger's very</b>
<b>gingery. It's too thick and</b>
<b>underbaked.</b>

1405
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,240
<b>{\an2}Just needed longer in the oven...</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>

1406
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,800
<b>{\an2}..and thinner, and it would've</b>
<b>been better. Yeah.</b>

1407
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,720
<b>{\an2}Josh, it is so neat,</b>

1408
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,240
<b>{\an2}and so clearly what it is.</b>

1409
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,000
<b>{\an2}I think it's a little triumph.</b>

1410
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,800
<b>{\an2}I think it's a big triumph.</b>

1411
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,160
<b>{\an2}This is the orange shortbread,</b>
<b>isn't it? Yeah.</b>

1412
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,760
<b>{\an2}That's beautiful. Beautiful.</b>

1413
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,160
<b>{\an2}Delicate. Light.</b>

1414
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,240
<b>{\an2}Hmm.</b>

1415
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,080
<b>{\an2}Oh, look at that.</b>
<b>Look at that tomato.</b>

1416
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,360
<b>{\an2}Look at that tomato. Let me hold</b>
<b>it up. That's clever.</b>

1417
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,960
<b>{\an2}You can see through it.</b>

1418
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,800
<b>{\an2}Isn't that amazing?</b>

1419
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,920
<b>{\an2}Let's try this chocolate one.</b>

1420
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,720
<b>{\an2}There's walnuts, pecans</b>
<b>and almonds in there,</b>

1421
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,600
<b>{\an2}and then some currants</b>
<b>and some cherries, as well.</b>

1422
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,880
<b>{\an2}It's chewy, it's crispy, it's zingy,</b>

1423
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,240
<b>{\an2}it's full of flavour.</b>

1424
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,200
<b>{\an2}I think overall you've created...</b>
<b>something a little bit special.</b>

1425
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:57,480
<b>{\an2}You don't often get illusion stuff</b>
<b>that tastes</b>

1426
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,040
<b>{\an2}and looks as good as that.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>

1427
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,720
<b>{\an2}That's amazing, mate. Yeah, well</b>
<b>done. Cheers, thank you. Well done.</b>

1428
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,760
<b>{\an2}That was incredible, wasn't it?</b>

1429
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,160
<b>{\an2}Wasn't expecting that at all.</b>

1430
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,480
<b>{\an2}Know what, mate?</b>

1431
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,720
<b>{\an2}Oh, come on.</b>

1432
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,960
<b>{\an2}I'll come to you.</b>
<b>Oh, thank you. Oh, wow.</b>

1433
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,040
<b>{\an2}That was amazing.</b>
<b>Honestly, it was seriously good.</b>

1434
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,480
<b>{\an2}Amazing.</b>

1435
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,960
<b>{\an2}I think Josh has pipped Star Baker.</b>

1436
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,400
<b>{\an2}But that's fine.</b>

1437
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,720
<b>{\an2}Another time.</b>

1438
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,440
<b>{\an2}I was...</b>

1439
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,880
<b>{\an2}..touching distance,</b>
<b>and then it was gone.</b>

1440
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,920
<b>{\an2}I'm actually quite good at</b>
<b>making a real steak pie,</b>

1441
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,920
<b>{\an2}but maybe not so much out</b>
<b>of biscuit.</b>

1442
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,520
<b>{\an2}So, I've got a right to be</b>
<b>a bit concerned, I think.</b>

1443
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,080
<b>{\an2}It's decision time for</b>
<b>Paul and Prue.</b>

1444
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,160
<b>{\an2}Who will be crowned Star Baker</b>

1445
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,920
<b>{\an2}and who will be leaving the tent?</b>

1446
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,240
<b>{\an2}What a Showstopper.</b>
<b>You got your handshake out.</b>

1447
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,920
<b>{\an2}Ah. Yeah, it was delayed.</b>

1448
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,000
<b>{\an2}It was, because I was so full</b>
<b>of biscuit.</b>

1449
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,040
<b>{\an2}It... Everything was numb.</b>

1450
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,960
<b>{\an2}And then, eventually,</b>
<b>it hit me, and I went,</b>

1451
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,080
<b>{\an2}"Hang on a minute, I owe him</b>
<b>a handshake." That was so good.</b>

1452
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,840
<b>{\an2}Josh is definitely in the running</b>
<b>for Star Baker. Yeah.</b>

1453
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,400
<b>{\an2}I mean, he was sort midway,</b>
<b>but he's just escalated himself</b>

1454
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,120
<b>{\an2}into the position of challenging</b>
<b>for Star Baker.</b>

1455
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,000
<b>{\an2}I'm really thrilled about Tash,</b>
<b>cos I think she's up there, too.</b>

1456
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,000
<b>{\an2}I agree. I mean, she's hardly</b>
<b>put a foot wrong.</b>

1457
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,040
<b>{\an2}Who do you think's in danger</b>
<b>of going?</b>

1458
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,120
<b>{\an2}Keith. Yeah, Keith.</b>

1459
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,720
<b>{\an2}The thing is with Keith, he's got</b>
<b>flavour, he's delivering good taste.</b>

1460
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,960
<b>{\an2}Nicky has struggled a bit, as well.</b>

1461
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,640
<b>{\an2}I mean, when you look at her bakes</b>
<b>and look at everybody else's,</b>

1462
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,840
<b>{\an2}you think, "Oh, hang on a minute.</b>

1463
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,280
<b>{\an2}"It's not as good as we initially</b>
<b>thought it was."</b>

1464
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,720
<b>{\an2}Well, I'm glad I'm not in your</b>
<b>shoes, judges.</b>

1465
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,840
<b>{\an2}We'd quite like to have eaten</b>
<b>70 biscuits.</b>

1466
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,360
<b>{\an2}Bakers, well done,</b>
<b>it's been an amazing week</b>

1467
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,440
<b>{\an2}and it was a fabulous show stopper.</b>

1468
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,080
<b>{\an2}Fortunately, I've got the great job</b>
<b>of announcing which one of you</b>

1469
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,520
<b>{\an2}will be Star Baker this week.</b>

1470
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:01,840
<b>{\an2}And the person who is Star Baker</b>
<b>this week is...</b>

1471
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,200
<b>{\an2}..Tasha.</b>

1472
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:17,520
<b>{\an2}Now, sadly, I have the job</b>
<b>of letting go of one baker.</b>

1473
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,560
<b>{\an2}And with just getting to</b>
<b>knowing you all,</b>

1474
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,600
<b>{\an2}we're absolutely adoring you.</b>

1475
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,320
<b>{\an2}But the baker leaving today is...</b>

1476
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,320
<b>{\an2}..Keith.</b>

1477
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,360
<b>{\an2}Sorry, Keith. That's all right.</b>

1478
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,920
<b>{\an2}I feel fine. There's nothing sad</b>
<b>about this moment.</b>

1479
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,200
<b>{\an2}Thank you very much. It's been so</b>
<b>lovely to meet you, Prue.</b>

1480
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,480
<b>{\an2}I've had the most fantastic time.</b>

1481
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,480
<b>{\an2}I said to somebody, the first</b>
<b>weekend there was bruises</b>

1482
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:52,640
<b>{\an2}up and down my arms where I was</b>
<b>pinching myself every half hour.</b>

1483
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,360
<b>{\an2}So, I don't know how many hours</b>
<b>I'm going to spend in the rest</b>

1484
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,280
<b>{\an2}of my life banging on about this.</b>

1485
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,000
<b>{\an2}Very happy to still be here.</b>

1486
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,720
<b>{\an2}So, yes, happy.</b>

1487
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,600
<b>{\an2}But sad at the same time,</b>
<b>because Keith's gone.</b>

1488
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,320
<b>{\an2}Well done.</b>

1489
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,200
<b>{\an2}Tasha's such a deserving Star Baker</b>
<b>this week, because her signature</b>

1490
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,840
<b>{\an2}yesterday - and I tasted her</b>
<b>signature - it was incredible.</b>

1491
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,920
<b>{\an2}So, it was well worth Star Baker</b>
<b>for the week on its own.</b>

1492
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,480
<b>{\an2}The handshake, I'll remember that</b>
<b>for a long time.</b>

1493
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,560
<b>{\an2}Well done.</b>

1494
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,680
<b>{\an2}It's the weirdest feeling,</b>

1495
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,440
<b>{\an2}because you put all this time</b>
<b>and this energy and...</b>

1496
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,920
<b>{\an2}At the end of the day,</b>
<b>it's biscuit, or it's cake,</b>

1497
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,720
<b>{\an2}or it's something that you eat.</b>

1498
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,720
<b>{\an2}But...</b>

1499
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,040
<b>{\an2}..it means so much.</b>

1500
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,000
<b>{\an2}And, yeah...</b>

1501
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,760
<b>{\an2}Yeah, it's... it's a really</b>
<b>good feeling.</b>

1502
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,480
<b>{\an2}Next time - it's bread week...</b>

1503
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,440
<b>{\an2}I'm really nervous.</b>
<b>You're nervous about this one?</b>

1504
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,760
<b>{\an2}I just don't want him to not</b>
<b>like it.</b>

1505
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,400
<b>{\an2}It's all about Paul? Yeah.</b>

1506
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,880
<b>{\an2}..as the bakers take on a classic</b>
<b>cottage loaf signature.</b>

1507
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,440
<b>{\an2}Oh! It's enormous.</b>
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

1508
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,560
<b>{\an2}A traditional technical...</b>

1509
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,520
<b>{\an2}..that leaves some hot under</b>
<b>the collar.</b>

1510
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,000
<b>{\an2}Cool those balls!</b>

1511
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,400
<b>{\an2}And a plaited show stopper...</b>

1512
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,720
<b>{\an2}Help me, Lord.</b>

1513
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,520
<b>{\an2}..that has them tied up in knots.</b>

1514
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,720
<b>{\an2}Stressful.</b>
