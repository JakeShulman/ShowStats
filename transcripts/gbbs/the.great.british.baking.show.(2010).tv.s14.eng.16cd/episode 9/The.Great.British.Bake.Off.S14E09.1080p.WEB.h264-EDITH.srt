1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Last time...

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,720
..it was Party Week.
Go, go, go.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,240
# Woo-woo-woo, boop-boop,
boop-boo... #

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,680
While Matty celebrated with
a handshake...

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,120
HE GASPS
Aww!

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,280
Thanks very much.

7
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,320
..and Star Baker...

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,000
This is the party I want to be at.

9
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,240
..Dan was in danger...

10
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,600
This is outrageous.

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,800
..of heading home early.

12
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,440
Cover it in chocolate
and hope for the best.

13
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,520
But it was Cristy...

14
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,560
I've done it wrong.

15
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,000
It's a bit rough and ready.

16
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,560
..whose time in the tent was up.

17
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,360
Cristy, you've done so well.

18
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,040
Now, it's Patisserie Week.

19
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,520
So much going on.

20
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,960
Oh, my days.

21
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,240
..as our semifinalists face
a fancy French signature...

22
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,200
Has to look like it's from a
Parisian shop, don't it?

23
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,280
Which isn't easy.

24
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, it's so curdled.

25
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,560
Certainly not for me!

26
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,240
..elevate the humble apple tart
in the technical...

27
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,400
Oh, my God, I can't watch.

28
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,080
..and create stunning
puff pastry showstoppers.

29
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,360
Coming out.
Who will rise to the occasion?

30
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,880
I'm really, really pleased.
Just get Paul in now.

31
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,680
And who will fold under the
pressure?

32
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,520
Oh, my God.

33
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,600
This is the first time I might
not actually finish a challenge.

34
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,560
Oh, man.

35
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,560
Just want to go to the pub.

36
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,120
Just three patisserie challenges

37
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,440
stand between our four remaining
bakers and a place in the final.

38
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,200
I'm absolutely over the moon
to be here.

39
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,840
Worst case scenario,
you've made it to the semifinals.

40
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,120
Best case, I go to the finals.

41
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,440
All the best, dudes.
Let's do it today.

42
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,760
Boom!

43
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,800
I'm so proud of how far I've come.

44
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,000
The confidence it's given me

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,800
to believe in myself in such
a short space of time is...

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,400
Yeah, it's amazing.

47
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,040
The nerves are really big.

48
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,480
I never in a million years would've
imagined I could get this far,

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,680
so a place in the final would be
absolutely amazing.

50
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,560
Week Nine, it's so bizarre.

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,920
I mean, I'm looking around at
the other three and I'm thinking,

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,120
"What am I doing here?"

53
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,320
I've not labelled it semifinal,
I've just kind of thought

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,920
about what I need to do.

55
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,160
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

56
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,840
Unfortunately today,
Alison's a little bit poorly

57
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,480
and she won't be joining us,
but she'll be back soon.

58
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,960
Now, the good news is you've
all made it to the semifinal.

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
The bad news is it's Patisserie
Week.

60
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,360
Now, the judges
would love you to make

61
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,520
two batches of 12 financiers.

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,320
Your financiers should be worthy of
a Parisian patisserie window,

63
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,560
and they can be any flavour
you like.

64
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,200
You have two hours
to complete this challenge.

65
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,840
On your marks, get set, bake!

66
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,560
It is very quiet in the tent.

67
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,800
Everyone's got game faces on,
everyone's very serious.

68
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
Time is so important this week.

69
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,440
I need it to make it look decent.

70
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,040
SHE SIGHS
Patisserie, patisserie, patisserie.

71
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,240
I'm ready,
I'm ready for the challenge.

72
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,640
Our signature bake is a financier.

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,640
A classic financier is
a little sponge cake

74
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,000
that looks like a little gold bar.

75
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,120
They always have ground nuts in
there, usually ground almonds,

76
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,320
and they usually have brown
butter in there,

77
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,240
and brown butter is just
butter that is heated

78
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,480
until it's on the point of burning.

79
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,120
Burn, my beauty, burn.

80
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,640
It gives the sponge
a really nutty, very rich flavour.

81
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Financiers should be quite
moist inside

82
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,320
but light at the same time.

83
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,240
It's quite tricky
to get them absolutely spot on.

84
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,520
We're asking them to
highly decorate their financiers.

85
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,880
Normally it's just a sponge,

86
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,400
but we want them to really take the
financier to another level.

87
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,640
It's a semifinal,

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,240
we're looking for perfection,
elegance, and beautiful flavours.

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,440
Hello, Dan. Good morning.
Hello, Dan.

90
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,520
So, Dan, tell us all about
your financiers.

91
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,480
So, for my first batch,
I am doing pistachio with

92
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,840
matcha and pink peppercorn.

93
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,920
Matcha? There's only one teaspoon
of matcha going in it.

94
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,320
OK. So, it's...
So why are you putting it in at all?

95
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,520
Because it does lend a little bit
of flavour to the pistachio.

96
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,120
Paul absolutely loves matcha.

97
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,680
Oh, do you? No.

98
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,920
{\an8}Dan's financiers,

99
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,400
{\an8}delicately flavoured with
matcha green tea powder,

100
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,520
{\an8}will be decorated with yuzu gel
and tonka bean mousse.

101
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,400
{\an8}He'll serve these alongside
orange and vanilla financiers

102
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,320
{\an8}topped with macerated peach
and fresh raspberries.

103
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,520
Hello, matcha boy. Hello, matcha...

104
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,200
Have you worn a matcha T-shirt?

105
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,640
Yes, yeah, I have actually, yeah.

106
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,960
Paul looked massively enthusiastic
about this one, didn't he?

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,600
The question is, will he ever admit
that he likes something

108
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,760
if it's matcha?

109
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,080
Well, today might be the day.

110
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,800
Yeah, you never know, do you?

111
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,760
So, not only are you trying
to win this,

112
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,760
but you're trying
to break Paul Hollywood.

113
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,040
Yes, well, he's...

114
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,080
He's done a good job of breaking me,
so I'm trying to fight back.

115
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,240
Whilst Dan gambles with matcha...

116
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,360
Looks like something out of
a horror movie, doesn't it?

117
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,760
Bleurgh!

118
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,320
..Josh is sticking
to some classic flavours.

119
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,960
They're inspired by puddings
that I like,

120
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,920
so one of them's gonna be
a Bakewell-flavoured one.

121
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,560
It's got ground almonds in
the batter, some almond extract,

122
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,840
and the other one is going to be
chocolate, hazelnut and orange.

123
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,040
Delicious. How many Star Bakers
have you had, Josh?

124
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,600
One.

125
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,440
So, today is your day to catch up
with the others.

126
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,320
Um, yeah.
Cause they've all had two. Possibly.

127
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,920
{\an8}In a bid to even the score,

128
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,960
{\an8}Josh will embellish his
Bakewell-inspired financiers with

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,760
{\an8}a vanilla custard buttercream,

130
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,880
{\an8}fresh raspberries,
and flaked almonds.

131
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,240
{\an8}Whilst his chocolate
and orange offering will be topped

132
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,680
{\an8}with rich chocolate buttercream,
and a wafer-thin chocolate shard.

133
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,800
Semifinal. It is, yeah.

134
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,760
Would you have taken semis at
the beginning?

135
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,080
Yeah, definitely. Would you?

136
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,280
I'd have taken Week Two.

137
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,120
Week Two?
You were never a Week Two person.

138
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,720
Well, I just wanted
to get through one week.

139
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,800
We'll see what happens.
We'll see what happens.

140
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,480
You're quietly confident
though, right?

141
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,680
Erm...

142
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Just quiet.

143
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,960
This is for my hazelnut
coffee financiers.

144
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,440
Oh, Tasha's doing coffee?

145
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,520
Bloody hell.
That's not what you need, is it?

146
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,440
So, we've gone for
a coffee-flavoured one,

147
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,360
so almost like a tiramisu,

148
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,640
and then mango, lime and coconut.

149
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,000
There's a big emphasis not just on
flavour this week,

150
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,440
but it has to look like it's from
a Parisian shop, don't it?

151
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,760
Which isn't easy,
certainly not for me!

152
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,840
{\an8}Running through the centre of
Matty's coffee-flavoured financiers

153
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,440
{\an8}is a generous channel of
chocolate ganache topped

154
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,080
{\an8}with vanilla mascarpone cream.

155
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,560
{\an8}He'll contrast these rich flavours
with mango,

156
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,720
{\an8}lime and coconut financiers
decorated with mango puree

157
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,120
{\an8}and a white chocolate
coconut ganache.

158
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,360
Oh, wow. You know, I think those
are two really great flavours.

159
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,760
Yeah, and Star Baker as well,
eh, Matty? Yeah!

160
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,640
So you're brimming with confidence.
Yeah, I think it was a nice

161
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,320
confidence-booster in kind of
preparation for this week.

162
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,680
Well, I think you've got two very
contrasting flavours here

163
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,920
which sound good if you
get it spot on and baked well

164
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,480
and neat and piped and decorated.
Exactly that, yeah.

165
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,720
I know what I'm doing and it's
written down, as is my schedule.

166
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,880
As your famous plan. Oh, you've got
your schedule as well?

167
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,680
Always helpful. Always got a plan.

168
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,080
I'm looking forward to it, mate.
Good luck. Cheers, thank you.

169
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,760
While Matty hopes
to replicate last week's win...

170
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,640
Full-on feel like
I'm a kid at school.

171
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,880
..Tasha's looking to bounce back.

172
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,120
I am trying to redeem myself from
last week's Viennese whirl disaster,

173
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,120
cos the flavours were good.

174
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,120
Textures and presentation
left something to be desired,

175
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,680
so I'm making raspberry
and pistachio financiers.

176
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,720
Tasha's redemptive financiers will
see her pistachio sponges decorated

177
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,640
with raspberry Swiss
meringue buttercream

178
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,960
and fresh raspberries.

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,760
{\an8}While hazelnut and coffee financiers
topped with coffee,

180
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,880
{\an8}chocolate ganache and
caramelised hazelnuts,

181
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,520
{\an8}complete her opening bid for
a place in the final.

182
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,840
So, how far have you got?

183
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,240
Batter's chilling in the fridge,
and my piping bags,

184
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,320
and I'm going to pipe it into
my tins

185
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,720
and pop it in the oven in about
ten minutes. Perfect.

186
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,880
I do love these moulds.
They look like miniature coffins.

187
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,840
The sort of thing Noel would lie in.

188
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,720
Right, what am I doing now?

189
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,840
I'm about to start piping
the financiers.

190
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,640
These bite-sized cakes are
traditionally baked in small,

191
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,040
rectangular moulds.

192
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,440
DAN: So, we have in here
orange financier.

193
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,280
{\an8}The shallow depth allows
the batter to bake perfectly

194
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,560
{\an8}in a matter of minutes.

195
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
You just need to get them as even
as possible.

196
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,480
If they've got different quantities
in, they're gonna look different.

197
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,960
I'm just gonna put some
fresh raspberries

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,480
on top of the almond one.

199
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,280
But having chosen deeper moulds,

200
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,560
Josh and Matty must take care not
to underbake their financiers.

201
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,200
I feel like everyone's quiet.
Quiet in here, isn't it?

202
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,840
It's eerie a bit, isn't it?
Yeah, a little bit.

203
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,560
I don't really like silence either.

204
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,760
I know, it feels
a little bit serious.

205
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,600
It is, isn't it?
Little bit grown up.

206
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,160
Yeah, it's not a bit of me.

207
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,080
LAUGHTER
No, me neither.

208
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,480
Bakers, you are halfway through.

209
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,320
TASHA: OK, these are going in now.

210
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,480
As the first bake of
the semifinal gets under way...

211
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,760
15 minutes.

212
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,320
They'll probably need
a little bit longer.

213
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,400
15 minutes.

214
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,040
Might need another five for
the pistachio ones.

215
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,800
Oh, I ain't started the timer.

216
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,680
Call it 16 minutes.

217
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,360
..attention turns to toppings
and decorations.

218
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,080
Italian meringue buttercream,

219
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
which is the crucial bit
cos it's what's gonna flavour

220
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,880
both of my things, so the big
thing to do is being able to

221
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,400
get them in, out, cool and be
able to do the decoration.

222
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,720
And while Prue and Paul are
expecting exquisitely presented
patisserie...

223
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,320
They want Parisian windows-type
stuff, don't they?

224
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,440
So, you know, it's gonna be
finesse, a bit of precision...

225
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,800
..it's also a chance to add extra
flavour to their financiers.

226
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,880
That's my Swiss
meringue buttercream.

227
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Raspberry puree,
that will go in there.

228
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,120
It splits, and it looks quite scary,
but secret is to just be patient.

229
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,000
Are you happy to be in
the semifinal?

230
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,440
Yeah, I never thought I'd be here,
it's bizarre.

231
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,280
You only have to beat one
of these people

232
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,640
and you're in the final. I know.

233
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,240
Who do you think you could take out?

234
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,160
I thought you said last week you was
gonna turn some ovens off for me.

235
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,680
Whose do you want me to turn off?
Josh?

236
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,840
He's very clever, though.

237
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,640
He probably checks his oven,
unlike me.

238
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,040
{\an1}Dan won't notice till it's too late.
LAUGHTER

239
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,680
What about Tash?

240
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,560
Fridge and oven, she's very good.
LAUGHTER

241
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,520
This would be more fun than
the actual show if we did this.

242
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,000
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

243
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,160
Oh, good.

244
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,200
It's the semifinals, guys.
Let's dig deep.

245
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:32,240
A perfectly-baked financier has
a crisp, eggshell-like exterior.

246
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,120
Yeah, I'm really, really,
really pleased with them.

247
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,000
Good.
Skewer comes out nice and clean.

248
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,720
Coffee and hazelnut sponges
I think are done.

249
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,520
The pistachio ones are in
for another five minutes-ish.

250
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,200
..but spend too long in the oven

251
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,320
and they'll lose their moist centre.

252
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,480
Problem is, you don't wanna
overbake these batches

253
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,760
because they'll be tough as old
boots, as Paul likes to say.

254
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,320
I'm just going to give them another
minute or two.

255
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,280
Pistachio sponges,
these ones are really deceptive.

256
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,440
They look like they're done

257
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,400
but they're sometimes quite stodgy
in the middle.

258
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,120
I don't think I've overbaked
so far in practice,

259
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,200
so there's still time, I guess.

260
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,640
Oh, God.

261
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,720
You good? Multitasking.

262
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,440
Whew. Lot going on here.

263
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,440
Yeah, there's a fair bit.
I've skewered some hazelnuts.

264
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,080
Are they quite hard to skewer?
Surprisingly soft.

265
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,200
Oh, they're soft.
Would you like to try? No. No.

266
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,920
It's too much for me.

267
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,040
Imagine if I'm good at it.

268
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,000
I'll have to start baking,
no-one wants that.

269
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,520
Right, I think we're ready to go.

270
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,360
We can begin with the decoration.

271
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,720
Come on.

272
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,440
What you putting on there, mango?

273
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,720
Peach. Peach. Slipping and sliding.
I know, I know.

274
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,960
This is like The Krypton Factor.
It is.

275
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,400
"If you can put tiny slices of
slipping and sliding peach

276
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,360
"onto these oblong sponges..."

277
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,440
Yes, "You go onto the next stage."

278
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,880
Right, they're coming out.

279
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,360
That's dark enough for me.

280
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,160
I think they look all right.

281
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,920
Oh, I don't know.

282
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,440
I don't know if that's
baked enough.

283
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,240
How long have we got?
OK, bakers, ten minutes left.

284
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,600
So, this is the tonka bean mousse.

285
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,120
It's gonna be extremely,
extremely close, this.

286
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,520
I just wanna cut out
a little wedge for the ganache.

287
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,160
Oh, I hope that's cooked.

288
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,400
I'm just gonna get this yuzu gel
on here.

289
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,440
This is my chocolate coffee ganache.

290
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,400
I'll put the chocolate in the middle

291
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,360
and then pipe over the top.

292
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,320
Do you think your pipework's come on
since you've been in this show?

293
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,480
Yeah, probably.

294
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,440
I mean, I was no good at it before,

295
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,360
and now I'm, like, not as no-good.

296
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,680
JOSH: It's not too bad.

297
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,160
Buttercream's curdled.

298
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,400
Don't have any other choice
but to pipe. Got no time.

299
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,960
Chocolate over the top,
just to give it a nice finish.

300
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,280
DAN: Just put these mint leaves on.

301
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,880
Oh, it's so curdled.

302
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,160
I really wish I had time
to re-whip this buttercream.

303
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,120
DAN: Got a bit of colour on my,
uh, raspberries.

304
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,880
Bakers, your time is up.

305
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,440
Please step away from your bakes.

306
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,520
I think mine are underbaked.

307
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,360
Oh, look at these little beauties.

308
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,880
Curdled my buttercream.

309
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,120
It's all right, my mousse is lumpy,
so don't worry.

310
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,000
{\an8}The bakers' financiers now face
the judgment of Prue and Paul.

311
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,120
{\an8}Hello, Matty. Hiya. Hiya, Matty.

312
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,040
{\an8}Well, straight off the bat,
they look very good.

313
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,760
{\an8}Both look uniform, cos you've
used a similar pattern on both.

314
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,520
All right, let's start with coffee.

315
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,120
So, there's a chocolate ganache,

316
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,960
coffee liqueur, and vanilla cream
with some walnuts.

317
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,680
I like it. Pretty strong.

318
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,000
I really like your flavours.

319
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,800
I do think it's overbaked.

320
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,600
Overbaked? OK.
Yeah, it's a little bit dry,

321
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,600
and I expect a little bit of
moisture there,

322
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,840
and there just isn't.

323
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,480
Let's have a look at the...
This is the...?

324
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,480
Mango, lime and coconut.

325
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,400
Your flavours are so good, Matty.

326
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,920
That is better.
Do you know what it is?

327
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,640
You didn't have to make them
so thick.

328
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,040
You could have almost halved
the sponge. I think that's right.

329
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,360
It's actually too much cake
versus topping.

330
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,280
But I think you've got real
grown-up flavours.

331
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,600
HE LAUGHS
No, they are.

332
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,040
"Grown-up flavours."

333
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Well done.

334
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,400
Thank you.

335
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,520
On first glance, they look
absolutely lovely.

336
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,320
Second glance, you look as if you've
dropped one or two of them.

337
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,920
Yeah, they look, uh, rough.

338
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,560
These look beautiful, though.

339
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,880
So this is a coffee
and hazelnut financier

340
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,080
and then the ganache is
chocolate and coffee.

341
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,240
Mm.

342
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,800
I think that is absolutely
delicious, Tasha.

343
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,280
Thank you.
Melts in the mouth.

344
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,440
The ganache is really
luxurious and decadent.

345
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,160
I think the flavours,
they're spot on,

346
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,880
and more importantly,
the bake is perfect.

347
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,960
You've got a little bit of
moisture in there as well,

348
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,400
which holds on the tongue.

349
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,880
Delicious. OK. Really good.

350
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,400
This is pistachio, isn't it?

351
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,600
Pistachio sponge with raspberry
Swiss meringue buttercream.

352
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,160
I love raspberry
and pistachio together.

353
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,720
The sponge has just that little bit
of resistance.

354
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,960
Do you think it's just
slightly overbaked?

355
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,040
It has gone slightly over,
unfortunately.

356
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,400
And actually, it could've been
much neater on that one.

357
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,400
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
Well done, Tasha.

358
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,760
Thank you.

359
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,400
{\an8}I do think they look very good.

360
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,800
I think your size might be
a little bit tall.

361
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,960
Just a little bit.

362
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,240
This one's a
Bakewell-inspired financier

363
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,840
with custard flavoured Italian
meringue buttercream on top.

364
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,040
Did you add almond essence as well?
Just a fraction, yeah.

365
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,600
I think a tiny bit too much. Hmm.

366
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,280
It should be a hint,
and it's quite overwhelming.

367
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,600
It still tastes delicious,

368
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,200
and it's got that thing that I love,
which is the slight chewiness.

369
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,600
Hmm. And nice and moist
and soft in the middle. Yeah.

370
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,000
Let's have a look at your chocolate.

371
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,920
It's hazelnut chocolate and orange

372
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,080
with a chocolate Italian meringue
buttercream on top.

373
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,120
Flavour is delicious.

374
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,080
However, the financier itself is
slightly dry.

375
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,200
A financier should almost melt in
the mouth. It's great flavour.

376
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,440
Ah, can't complain about your
flavour. Flavour's good.

377
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,720
Thank you very much.

378
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,920
They do look beautiful.

379
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,600
They're very neat, Dan.
Thank you.

380
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,720
You were worrying about finesse,
and they look beautiful.

381
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,400
Ah, thank you.
They do look very, very good.

382
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,280
I think we'll have a look at the
Japanese-inspired one first.

383
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,680
This is the tonka bean with
the pink peppercorn

384
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,600
and pistachio and matcha and...
Everything else.

385
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,160
That's beautiful. Is...is it?
Clever, yeah.

386
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,960
Matcha hits right at the end.
Tonka bean's there.

387
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,120
The choice of fruit I like on there
as well.

388
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,280
That is delicious.
All of it's delicious.

389
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,800
Oh, thank you. Phew.

390
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,880
Let's look at the peach, orange...
And raspberry. Yeah.

391
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,920
Mm.

392
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,320
That's beautiful. Oh...

393
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,920
Really nice.

394
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,360
It's like a celebration of citrus,
and it pops,

395
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,640
and it's beautifully baked.

396
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,800
It's got moisture there.

397
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,120
That's the perfect financier
for me. Very good.

398
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,920
I think it's a triumph.
Well done, Dan.

399
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,760
That's great, thank you very much.

400
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,920
What a time to get a handshake.

401
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,040
That went a bit better than
expected, didn't it?

402
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,760
There's a lot of chat about getting
a handshake off Paul.

403
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,960
I mean, I'd like a fist bump off
Prue, personally, but...

404
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,400
You know, I might see if we can
get one off her tomorrow.

405
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,840
Dan's done amazing.

406
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,200
We've known for weeks that
patisserie is his week.

407
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
It's the one that he's been really
looking forward to,

408
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,200
and he's shown that straight away,
hasn't he, today?

409
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,040
No redemption, but that's OK.

410
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,480
Every week, I feel like
I learn a little bit more,

411
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,960
and every week I'm reminded that
I know absolutely nothing.

412
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,720
I thought they was underbaked.

413
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,880
Nope, over!

414
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,200
One bake down, two to go,

415
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,840
and the pressure in
the tent is about to rise

416
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,160
as the bakers face another
gingham-wrapped unknown.

417
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,040
Hello, kids.
Welcome back to the tent.

418
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,080
Today, your technical challenge
has been set for you

419
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,400
by the wonderful Prue.

420
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,040
Prue, any words of advice?

421
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,400
This recipe is so delicious, you can
hardly go wrong with the flavour.

422
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,720
So, what Paul and I
are going to be looking for

423
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,120
is exquisite presentation.

424
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,840
As ever, this technical challenge
will be judged blind,

425
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,440
so we're gonna have to ask
these two joyous poppets...

426
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,360
Thank you...to leave the tent.
NOEL CHUCKLES

427
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,400
For your technical challenge,
Prue would love you to make

428
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,480
a tarte aux pommes.

429
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,480
If you didn't do GCSE French,
that is an apple tart.

430
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,160
Your apple tart should consist of

431
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,000
a short, buttery pastry case,

432
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,960
filled with a smooth almond
frangipane and apple puree,

433
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,960
topped with glazed apple slices
arranged in a way

434
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,840
that's very pleasing to the eye.

435
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,920
You have two-and-a-half hours.

436
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,440
On your marks, get set...

437
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,920
..bake!

438
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,840
I had a feeling it was gonna be
something like this.

439
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,160
I can't remember how to do it,
though.

440
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,120
This is giving me strong memories
of Pie Week, actually.

441
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,200
Blind baking went wrong in Pie Week.

442
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,320
Pie Week? Pastry Week.

443
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,000
Really don't wanna cock this one up
like I did last week, to be honest.

444
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,520
Four weeks ago,
you could finish fourth

445
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,040
and you'd be like, "Get in there."

446
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,400
Now, like, you finish fourth,
it's like doomsday, isn't it?

447
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,640
Tarte aux pommes, I think this is a
great challenge for the semifinal.

448
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,840
It's my favourite dessert.
I absolutely love it.

449
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,200
I mean, to get a perfect
apple tart like this,

450
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,440
it actually has to go in
the oven three times.

451
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,160
The first time's for the blind bake,

452
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,760
and that's probably
the most important one,

453
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,560
because otherwise you'll get
a soggy bottom.

454
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,480
And actually, that's
the thing that really starts

455
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,120
to achieve the correct colour.

456
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,560
They then bake again a layer of
frangipane, just to set it a bit,

457
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,920
and then they add the apple puree
and the apples to bake.

458
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,720
I think it's about the finesse.

459
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,360
The apples have to be really,
really thin,

460
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,640
otherwise, A,
they don't get baked enough,

461
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,520
and secondly, they look all clumsy.

462
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,800
It's gorgeous, isn't it? Mm.

463
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,040
Frangipane is absolutely delicious.
It is.

464
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,800
And that could easily be because

465
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,200
it has three tablespoons
of Calvados in it,

466
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,160
but I haven't told them
how much to do,

467
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,600
so it'll be interesting
to see how cautious they are.

468
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,120
That's a real celebration
of apples right there.

469
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,920
It's beautiful. Yeah.

470
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,480
"Make, and blind bake,
a pastry case."

471
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
Very informative.

472
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm just mixing flour with
the butter.

473
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,360
{\an8}There's two methods. This one...

474
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,880
{\an8}..and this one.

475
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,400
Maybe I should do this one.

476
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,840
My hands are quite warm, so...

477
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,200
That's a poor excuse
for being lazy, ain't it?

478
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,920
But you want to keep it short,
so you don't want to overwork it.

479
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,600
That's why I've done it all by hand.

480
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,040
Who makes the best apple tart,
northerners or southerners?

481
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,720
Definitely... French people.

482
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,280
I've got some French in me.

483
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,320
Have you? Oh...

484
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,160
I'm quite moody. I've got a big
nose. I've got a big nose.

485
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,920
Me and you have got some schnozzers,
haven't we?

486
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,720
We have, haven't we, mate? Yeah.
Strong leaders.

487
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,040
Strong leaders, yeah.
Gods.

488
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,560
Caesar, Zeus.

489
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,880
See you later.

490
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,200
Turn that into a dough,
wrap it in clingfilm,

491
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,480
stick it in the freezer,
and then I'm gonna roll it out.

492
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,480
Five to ten minutes.

493
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,280
Get that gluten to chill out, man.

494
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,320
"Make a textured apple puree."

495
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,880
I'm very aware that they might
cook down,

496
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,440
but also I don't want to have
to cook them forever,

497
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,840
and I have previous
of undercooking fruit.

498
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,080
I don't want it to be mushy.

499
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,600
Anyone in your family got
a nose as big as mine?

500
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,400
Play rugby, so I've seen people
with far worse noses.

501
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,040
What's your worst rugby injury?

502
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,880
Um, fractured my skull.

503
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,000
I've got a titanium mesh
just under there, yeah.

504
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,960
Have you got a titanium skull?

505
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,720
When I came out of the
operating theatre,

506
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,880
someone had written in Sharpie,

507
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,760
"Do not press," on my head.

508
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,880
If you see a sign saying,
"Do not press,"

509
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,160
what are you gonna do?

510
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,760
Well... You're gonna press, right?

511
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,360
Well, good job you weren't there,
then.

512
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,560
Apples are softened,
I'm quite liking the look of them.

513
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,960
Is it pureeing down?
It's mushing down.

514
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,120
Oh, I think we'll leave it at that.

515
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,320
Probably roll out my pastry now.

516
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,640
I think this will definitely
be important.

517
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,960
I want to get it to
maybe about three mil.

518
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,280
I'm saying that like
I know what three mil looks like.

519
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,960
It's about a pound thickness.

520
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,120
It's a crumbly pastry.
That's not good. Very crumbly.

521
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,600
You don't want cracks, either,
so you've gotta be quite delicate.

522
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,720
Take a bit off this,
do a bit of DIY work down here...

523
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,560
OK, I'm gonna use
all of these beans,

524
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,200
try and get them right
into the corners.

525
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,200
It doesn't tell you how long
to bake it for,

526
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,160
it just tells you to bake it at 170.

527
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,640
Be good to me.

528
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,040
Maybe 12 minutes for a blind bake?

529
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,480
I don't bloody know.

530
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,800
Key to the perfect tart,

531
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,960
the pastry case needs to bake
for 25 minutes.

532
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,280
Start with ten minutes,
see how it's doing, check again.

533
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,520
Anything less,
and the bakers risk ending up

534
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,440
with the dreaded soggy bottom.

535
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,720
20 minutes.

536
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,680
It's a very, very big tart case,

537
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,720
so if the pastry isn't baked when
the filling goes in,

538
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,160
I don't think it'll ever bake.

539
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,640
So, I'm gonna get started on
my frangipani.

540
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,920
Frangipani? Frangipane? Frangipane.

541
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,720
I have never made
frangipane before.

542
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,160
It's just cream, butter and sugar,

543
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,160
and then mix in your egg and
almonds.

544
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,440
Beat that baby in.

545
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,200
Flavouring it with apple brandy,
Calvados.

546
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,120
I'm thinking a tablespoon.

547
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,720
I want to get the flavour but
I don't want to affect the mixture

548
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,400
because it might get a bit runny.

549
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,840
I'm gonna go half a tablespoon.

550
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,040
Prue likes a drink, don't she,
so maybe 50 mil?

551
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,520
Screw it, two tablespoons.

552
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,000
Done it.

553
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,280
Could be good, could be bad?

554
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,120
OK, that's ready to come out.

555
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,120
Now, I want to give it
a little minute or two.

556
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,760
Still not dried out yet.

557
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,840
Yeah, another five minutes,
yeah, I think.

558
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,280
I maybe should've gone longer
but I don't want it to be dried out

559
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,120
and I don't want it to burn,
cos it has to go in again twice.

560
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,240
{\an1}SHE SIGHS

561
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,480
Bakers, you are halfway through,

562
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,760
halfway through your
technical challenge,

563
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,040
or technical sha-longe,
as Paul Hollywood calls it

564
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,800
when he's trying to impress.

565
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,480
Looks quite a nice colour.

566
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,520
Not too much shrinkage on it either.

567
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,960
Got a crack.

568
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,840
Oh, bloody hell.

569
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,120
Any cracks in the pastry,
and there's a danger

570
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,200
the filling could leak out,
and the case collapse.

571
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,360
Happy with it?

572
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,680
Not really, no.

573
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,240
A few cracks, so I've got a funny
feeling I might be coming fourth.

574
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,960
Have you ever won a technical?
I beg your pardon? I've won three.

575
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,280
Oops.

576
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,600
Yeah, I'm really pleased.

577
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,000
You can just see it beginning
to have a little bit of colour

578
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,080
on the bottom there.

579
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,320
I need to get a shimmy on, really,
so I'm gonna slap this in, like so.

580
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,080
"Bake the frangipane
and the pastry case."

581
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,160
Whack it back in the oven.
How long for?

582
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,320
Probably until Josh takes his out.

583
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,360
"For the topping,
core and halve the red apples.

584
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,040
"Slice thinly into two to three
millimetre slices."

585
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,840
{\an8}They want it looking really good,
don't they?

586
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,440
{\an8}That's obviously the whole
point of patisserie.

587
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,320
{\an8}They're miles too thick.

588
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,640
{\an8}My chopping isn't exactly
the most even.

589
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,200
{\an8}How long's that cook for?

590
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,840
{\an8}Does anybody know?
Can anybody tell me?

591
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,680
{\an8}Absolutely no idea what I'm
looking for.

592
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,440
{\an8}Maybe a bit longer? No, no.

593
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,240
I don't want them so it's overdone.

594
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,040
It's firm to the touch
and spongy, and it should be.

595
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,400
He's a bit rough.
Looks like a dog's dinner, don't it?

596
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,400
"Spread the apple puree
over the frangipane."

597
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,840
No idea if I'm meant to wait
for it to cool.

598
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm gonna go with no.

599

"Working from the outside edge of
the tart, arrange the apple slices

"skin side up in a
concentric overlapping circle."

601
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,240
I'm baffled by those instructions.

602
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,240
What's a concentric circle
when it's at home?

603
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,360
How do I do this?

604
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,280
It's just losing its way slightly.

605
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,480
SHE SIGHS
Not easy.

606
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,440
I feel like this is more your thing
than mine, artistic.

607
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,160
I like these with the kink in them.

608
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,400
You like a kinky apple?

609
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,600
Is that nature or was that you?

610
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,040
Kinky apples.
Shall we start a band?

611
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,240
"I'm gonna see the
Kinky Apples tonight."

612
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,040
Don't forget to bring
silver wellies, yeah?

613
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,400
And some sort of hat.
See you on the Pyramid Stage.

614
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,480
Josh's looks absolutely top,
don't it?

615
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,000
Oh, that's how he's... Yeah, yeah.

616
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,120
Oh, man, his is dead good.

617
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,760
Needs to look really, really pretty.

618
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,120
Oh, it's awful.

619
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,720
That's what I should've done.

620
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,720
Yeah, doesn't look too bad.

621
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,560
Bakers,
you only have half an hour left.

622
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,800
Oh, no!

623
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,720
Going in.

624
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,200
{\an8}Right, 25 minutes.

625
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,840
I think that's going to be in there
as long as we've got left.

626
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,440
SHE SIGHS
Right.

627
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,880
"Glaze the tart with
apricot nappage."

628
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,400
Do you know what a nappage is?

629
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,840
No, nor do I.

630
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,480
It's probably nap-ahge.

631
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,880
Depends where you grew up, I guess.

632
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,720
Or we could just say,
"Apricot glaze."

633
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,800
It's jam sugar.

634
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,560
I've just chopped up the apricots.

635
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,680
And then a few tablespoons
of water, gonna reduce.

636
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,120
So, I think it's gonna be
quite thin, but also sticky.

637
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,720
Shiny, but brushable.

638
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,720
JOSH: There we are, one nappage.

639
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,360
Bakers,
you only have five minutes left.

640
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,440
Oh, I don't want to take it out.

641
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,680
I'm just gonna give it maybe
another minute.

642
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,280
Let's whack her up.

643
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,520
Yeah, I'm gonna take it out.

644
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,880
It's gonna have to come out.

645
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,040
{\an8}I'm just giving the old
nap-ahge a go.

646
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,920
Looks a bit rough, doesn't it, but?

647
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,360
It's really soggy.

648
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,200
I'm really happy with that.

649
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,840
I'm not so happy with having to
take it out whilst it's piping hot,

650
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,440
but there we go.

651
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,240
Bakers, you only have one
minute left.

652
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,800
I don't know if that's
baked enough.

653
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,440
{\an8}Oh!

654
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,000
{\an8}Popped straight off.

655
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,640
{\an8}That was horrible.

656
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,840
{\an8}Oh, my God, I can't watch.

657
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

658
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,920
Oh, my God.
It's just falling apart.

659
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,560
Can I help?

660
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,880
OK, bakers, your time is up.

661
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,200
Oh, man.

662
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,320
Just want to go to the pub.

663
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,560
Please bring your tartes aux pommes

664
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,880
down to the gingham tablecloth

665
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,880
and place them behind
your photographs.

666
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,360
Oh, that looks amazing.

667
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,880
How did you do that?

668
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,160
I don't know, mate.

669
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,000
Prue and Paul are expecting

670
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,000
four beautifully decorated
tartes aux pommes,

671
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,080
pretty enough to grace any
Parisian patisserie,

672
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,360
with a short, buttery pastry case,

673
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,640
a flavourful frangipane
and apple puree filling,

674
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,880
topped with beautifully arranged
slices of apple.

675
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,120
We start with this one,
Prue, uh, bit of a split here.

676
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,280
It's a bit clumsy.
Yeah, it's sort of lost it.

677
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,240
Yeah, clumsy's a good word
for this.

678
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,920
Hmm. The pastry may be cracked,
but it's very nice,

679
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,440
and it's properly baked.

680
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,560
Frangipane's not very strong.

681
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,040
Could be stronger. Yeah.

682
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,320
Right.
This one's quite neat, isn't it?

683
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,320
Very neat, and the apples are
beautifully arranged.

684
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,280
Pastry, I would say possibly
could have had a little bit longer

685
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,480
in the oven, just to put
a bit more of a flash of colour.

686
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,200
The pastry's actually crisp
on the bottom... Yeah.

687
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,480
..but a bit soggy there.

688
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,920
Right.
Now, moving on to this...disaster.

689
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,120
This struggled to come out of
the tin, didn't it?

690
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,040
And it looks very messy.

691
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,200
I think this perhaps wasn't
baked blind enough.

692
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,880
There's no colour on that at all.
No, it's very raw.

693
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,080
Mm.

694
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,680
The flavour's OK,

695
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,160
I just think the pastry's let it
down a little bit.

696
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,520
Right. OK, this is quite neat.

697
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,080
You've got a bit of a split there.

698
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,600
All the worst bit's been
put that way, which is...

699
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,600
Obviously, I'd do exactly
the same if it was me.

700
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,600
That melts in the mouth,
that pastry.

701
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,800
It's delicious.

702
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,120
The apples are very nicely, thinly
sliced, they're nicely arranged...

703
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,920
Oh, it's lovely.

704
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,240
Prue and Paul will now rank the
apple tarts from worst to first.

705
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,800
In fourth place, we have this one.

706
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,160
Tash, big problem with the pastry.

707
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,520
It just fell apart, and the shape
wasn't as good as I expected.

708
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,000
And in third place,
we have this one.

709
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,640
Dan, it looked a bit clumsy

710
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,440
and the pastry had cracked a little,

711
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,200
but it was delicious.

712
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,480
In second place, we have this one.
Whose is this?

713
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,000
Matty, pretty good actually.
Very, very neat.

714
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,120
It just needed a little bit longer
in the oven. Very, very good.

715
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,960
Which means, Josh,

716
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,800
this is the best one.
It was absolutely lovely.

717
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
First in a technical,

718
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,080
it's taken nine weeks,
but got one now,

719
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,360
so I'm over the moon.

720
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,960
I'm really pleased with that.

721
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,440
I saw Josh's, to be fair,

722
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,040
and I thought, "Yeah, that's good."

723
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,800
Yeah, third, I'm happy with that,

724
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,160
because there was absolutely
nothing between them.

725
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,840
It was like splitting hairs,
to be honest,

726
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,080
and the financiers couldn't have
gone any better, could they?

727
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,520
So I've had such an ace day,
it's been brilliant.

728
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,760
What a disaster.

729
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,200
Last place,
so tomorrow I need to try

730
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,560
and not let the stress get
to my head.

731
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,280
I could very easily go home.

732
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,680
{\an8}Just one challenge remains
for our bakers to secure

733
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,560
{\an8}a place in the final.

734
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,360
{\an8}So, obviously Alison's
still not with us.

735
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,160
{\an8}She's still poorly, unfortunately,

736
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,000
{\an8}but it was a great start to
the semifinals.

737
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,240
It certainly was.

738
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,440
Dan got a handshake.

739
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,680
I think he came back yesterday.

740
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,680
I think he's been on
a bit of a sabbatical,

741
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,680
and he's popped back
to see what's going on.

742
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,480
Well, it's a good time to pop back,
semifinal. Yeah, semifinal.

743
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,320
But the other three are right there
biting his heels.

744
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,960
I mean, looking at the technical,
we had Josh in first,

745
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,800
but in the signature,
the Bakewell tart,

746
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,800
I do think it was
a little bit artificial. Yeah.

747
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,760
Technical, Matty came second.

748
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,880
He did, and then we look at
the signature bake,

749
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
great flavours in both.

750
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,040
His sponge was a little bit dry.

751
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,880
And then you had Tash in last place.

752
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,200
I would never have said Tasha
could make such a mess

753
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,080
of such a simple thing as
an apple tart.

754
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,280
Tasha needs to pull it back in
the showstopper today.

755
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,640
It's very tight this week.

756
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,280
You just can't call it
at the moment.

757
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,280
It is all down to this
last challenge.

758
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,640
So exciting!

759
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,840
Hello, bakers.
Welcome back to the tent.

760
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,480
It's time for your
showstopper challenge.

761
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,080
Today, the judges would
love you to bake

762
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,840
an exquisite millefoglie,

763
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,760
which is the Italian equivalent of
the French mille-feuille.

764
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,960
Now, I know how to say it
in Italian and French,

765
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,600
but I don't know what it is. Paul?

766
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,320
It's a highly decorated pastry
with buttery, flaky layers.

767
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,160
Amazing. You have four hours.

768
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,360
On your marks, get set, bake!

769
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,320
Let's do it, everybody.

770
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,920
There's so many elements that have
got to go right today, isn't there?

771
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,400
The pastry's, like,
first and foremost.

772
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,720
Lamination's just about holding
your nerve, making sure that you

773
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,840
give yourself enough time to do
what you need to do.

774
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,080
Puff pastry, if I was
doing it normally at home,

775
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,600
I'd do this over a couple of days,

776
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,960
I wouldn't be ramming
it in to four hours.

777
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,080
It's gonna be a manic one.

778
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,680
It's actually my birthday today.

779
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,560
It's a memorable one, for sure.

780
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,400
I've not had a birthday like it,

781
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,040
and probably never will again.

782
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,120
The showstopper challenge in
the semifinal is a millefoglie.

783
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,120
This, traditionally,
is an Italian celebration cake.

784
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,240
These things are highly decorated
and taste incredible.

785
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,160
What we want is at least
four layers of puff pastry,

786
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,800
real puff pastry, not rough puff or
cheat's puff, proper puff pastry.

787
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,360
This is all about timing.

788
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,680
It's about producing those gorgeous
laminations that we want inside.

789
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,560
I am just rolling out my butter.

790
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,160
Once my dough's rested
in the fridge,

791
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,240
I'll then start doing
the laminating.

792
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,320
The trick is to keep
chilling the pastry,

793
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,000
because, of course, all this rolling
and folding warms the pastry up.

794
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,520
If it gets too warm,
the layers disappear.

795
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,920
So, I'm alternating all day between
the fridge and the freezer.

796
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,760
Fingers crossed it'll all
be all right.

797
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,000
It's very difficult.

798
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,160
There's nowhere to hide on this,

799
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,920
because all the layers are there,
stark, and everyone can see it,

800
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,000
so any problems,
they will show up straight away.

801
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,920
This has to be perfection.

802
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,120
Morning, Dan. Good morning.
Hello, there. Hello.

803
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,000
It's handshake Dan! Hello!

804
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,680
Dan, tell us about your millefoglie.

805
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,840
So, I am doing my take on
a tiramisu... Oh, lovely.

806
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,000
..and it's gonna be in the shape
of an electric guitar.

807
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,720
Why like a guitar? This is
for a gig I missed last week,

808
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,480
Sam Fender.
I bought my tickets thinking,

809
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,960
"Oh, you know, I'll never
get this far, I'll be all right,"

810
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,920
and here I am, so...

811
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,880
{\an8}Hoping to strike a chord
with the judges,

812
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,080
{\an8}Dan's tiramisu-inspired
showstopper will contain layers

813
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,080
{\an8}of coffee and chocolate
creme diplomat

814
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,280
{\an8}and amaretto mousse,

815
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,160
{\an8}topped with a
bright blue mirror glaze

816
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,880
{\an8}to recreate
the guitar of his musical hero.

817
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,160
The flavours sound great.

818
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,160
Now, this is a showstopper
in the semifinal,

819
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,640
and you want to get into the final.

820
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,800
Is this gonna be the one
that'll push you over the edge
to get you in?

821
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,560
I think it's the best one
I've done so far,

822
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,880
but it's all on the pastry today.
I really want it to be good.

823
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,360
Good luck.
Thank you very much, cheers.

824
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,160
Thank you, see you later.
Good luck, Dan.

825
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,920
Might get a first turn done,
actually.

826
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,880
With their dough rested
and butter blocks chilled firm,

827
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,680
the bakers can begin
the lamination process,

828
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,440
key to producing puff pastry's
signature crisp, flaky layers.

829
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,080
Put the butter block in,

830
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,000
completely encasing,
so it's got no avenue to escape.

831
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,000
Working quickly is crucial.

832
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,160
It's a stubborn old mule to roll.

833
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,560
The longer they take...

834
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,200
God, there's so much of this stuff.

835
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,000
..the warmer their butter
and dough will become.

836
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
Temperature can be your worst enemy.

837
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,120
If it's too hot, the butter,
it'll, like, seep out,

838
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,360
so you don't get that puff.

839
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,840
If it's too cold, it will crack,
and then the butter seeps out.

840
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,200
While most of the bakers have
opted for the traditional method

841
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,160
of encasing the butter
inside the dough...

842
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,560
This is my butter packet.

843
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,560
..in the pursuit of an even
flakier pastry...

844
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,840
That'll go in the freezer.

845
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,720
..Tasha's treading a different path.

846
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,360
I'm doing inverse puff pastry.

847
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,560
That's the one where
the butter goes on the outside?

848
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,280
That's right. It's supposed
to be much more difficult.

849
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,160
Yeah, I like making my
life difficult.

850
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,640
{\an8}Tasha's tricky puff pastry will
sandwich layers of lime

851
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,480
{\an8}and mint mojito mousse
and mango curd,

852
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,240
elegantly decorated with
a white chocolate cup

853
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,480
containing a delicate mango rose.

854
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,720
Wow.

855
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,520
Well, your flavours are
always great,

856
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,000
your textures are spot on.

857
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
It's the finishing we're
worrying about.

858
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,320
Me too.

859
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,080
OK, so concentrate today on
getting that little bit of finesse.

860
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,480
This is Patisserie Week.

861
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,840
Also, you're one bake away
from the final.

862
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,200
No pressure. Oh, don't....

863
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,440
Oh...

864
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,720
{\an8}Just doing my first envelope turn.

865
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,200
{\an8}One third down.

866
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,520
{\an8}Then another third up.

867
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,960
So, I'm quite happy with that
so far, actually that's pretty good.

868
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,320
I'm gonna pop that in
the freezer for a bit.

869
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,920
As Dan, Josh, and Matty's pastry
hits the fridge

870
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,600
to firm up ahead of the next turn,

871
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,880
Tasha's is ready
for its first inverse fold.

872
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,360
It's really cold.

873
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,960
Oh, God.

874
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,080
Have to crack...

875
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,680
I'm so glad he saw that crack.

876
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,280
The butter's too hard,

877
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,480
so it's really hard to roll.

878
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,160
So, I'm gonna zest my limes,

879
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,880
and then I'm gonna go back to
the pastry.

880
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,440
{\an1}SHE SIGHS

881
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,240
Right, so, I'm gonna make
the various fillings.

882
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,000
I need to get cracking on
with this now

883
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,920
so that I can get it all
chilled in time.

884
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,240
To reach the heights of patisserie
perfection demanded by Prue and
Paul,

885
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,760
not only must every one of
the bakers' flavours sing...

886
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,280
I put the coffee in there
just to infuse.

887
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,600
..they must work in harmony
with one another, too.

888
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,480
And not too overpowering,

889
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,160
just a nice coffee flavour
to complement me amaretto mousse.

890
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,840
I'm doing mango curd,
and I'm also making a mojito curd,

891
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,280
so we've got lots of
lime juice and zest,

892
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,880
mint and rum.

893
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,920
It's not REALLY rummy,
it's just a hint.

894
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,360
While Tasha and Dan strive
to balance their boozy fillings...

895
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,200
Lovely, lovely amaretto.

896
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,400
..Matty's decided to go all in.

897
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,160
It's three tiers, all alcohol.

898
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,600
Limoncello, Marsala and amaretto.

899
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,760
The flavours are from
an Italian dessert.

900
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,520
Zabaione?

901
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,400
Maybe?

902
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,200
{\an8}Matty's Italian tipples will flavour
three creme diplomat fillings,

903
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,920
{\an8}drizzled with lemon and plum curds,

904
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,520
and piped between layers
of puff pastry discs

905
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,640
to create a three-tiered Italian
wedding-cake-inspired millefoglie.

906
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,920
I look forward to this.

907
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,560
This is a play on alcohol levels,
not getting them too much.

908
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,520
Yeah, for sure.
And that's tricky with three.

909
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,040
Also finding the right levels
for Prue and Paul,

910
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,040
cos they've got different levels.

911
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,000
No, you shouldn't worry
about the booze,

912
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,720
it's just how it tastes, you know?

913
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
That's been Prue's mantra
for years.

914
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,920
NOEL LAUGHS
"Don't worry about the booze."

915
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,920
One day, I'll punch him.

916
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,600
Thank you, Matty. Thank you.

917
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,600
Uh, I'm a bit behind already.

918
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,240
Pastry, it wants another turn,

919
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,520
but hopefully this one's
a bit smoother than the last one.

920
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,440
This will be fold four.
Two from being done.

921
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,720
This is looking really good,
I'm really pleased with it.

922
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,840
It's blended really well.

923
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,000
You can see all of the layers
all the way through that,

924
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,760
so I'm really, really pleased
with the pastry.

925
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,880
It's better even than when
I did it in my last practice.

926
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,560
I'll do a final turn,
and then I'll start rolling it out.

927
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,240
Something's so wrong
with this pastry.

928
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,800
Oh, God.

929
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,280
Bakers...

930
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,160
Don't tell me I'm halfway through,
whatever you do.

931
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,160
Bakers, you are halfway through.

932
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,760
Holy mackerel.

933
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,400
Wish I had another hour.

934
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,400
{\an8}As Tasha struggles on
with her pastry...

935
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,080
{\an8}Why did I do inverse?

936
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,040
{\an8}That was a really stupid
thing to do.

937
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,680
..the rest of the bakers have
finished their final folds.

938
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,160
I'm gonna start shaping it
and getting it in the oven now.

939
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,600
Whatever the shape
the bakers have chosen...

940
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,720
So, I had a look at
Sam's guitar online.

941
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,800
It's like a blue Fender
Stratocaster, I think it is.

942
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,640
..sharp, clean cuts are a must

943
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,000
to ensure their pastry puffs up
perfectly in the oven.

944
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,960
I'd say you can see layers.

945
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,200
They might say different.

946
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,000
But while Paul and Prue
will expect beautifully risen

947
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,120
baked sheets of puff pastry...

948
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,800
Conscious where we're at
with the time now,

949
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,000
so I want to make sure
we can get all these in.

950
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,080
..when it comes to patisserie,
precision is paramount.

951
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,560
You don't want them to be too thick,

952
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,880
cos when you have a mille-feuille,
they're quite thin layers.

953
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,480
That's why you've got
the sheet on there,

954
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,760
to sort of weigh them down.

955
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,480
Right, time to bake.

956
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,400
Oh, it's not on!

957
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,120
Ahh!

958
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,960
Josh's sheets of puff pastry
will contain layers

959
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,480
of lemon creme diplomat,

960
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,240
blackberry curd and blackcurrant
jam,

961
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,160
decorated with home-grown berries

962
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,920
and piped buttercream peonies,

963
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,720
dedicated to the woman responsible

964
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,840
for him entering this year's
Bake Off.

965
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,560
This was the celebration
for a person in mind,

966
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,640
so I've done it for my nan,
and I've gone for

967
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,400
the colours that I associated
with her a lot,

968
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,960
yellows, purples and pinks.

969
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,680
So far, showstoppers have been your
strong point.

970
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,280
I've really enjoyed putting
them together.

971
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,880
Well, you've thought about it,
and you are good at showstoppers.

972
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,360
You've only got one problem,

973
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,960
and that's there are three other
bakers who are damn good too.

974
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,400
Yeah, they're incredible, yeah.

975
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,240
Good luck, Josh.
Thank you very much. Good luck.

976
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,720
Just 90 minutes remain.

977
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,240
So, I've got two in, and then I'm
gonna get these two prepared,

978
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,000
bang them in the fridge, ready
to go in as soon as they come out.

979
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,480
I start with about 15 minutes,
and then I sort of check them

980
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,800
every five minutes after that.

981
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,080
At least until they're lovely,
golden and crisp.

982
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,400
Two of the layers are in
the oven at the moment.

983
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,600
This is plum curd, which is,

984
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,120
it's quite nice, it's a bit tart.

985
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,320
Right, cut this in half.

986
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,840
Oh, my God.

987
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,440
Tash, you all right?

988
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,680
There's no layers in my pastry.

989
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,120
My puff pastry is a disaster.

990
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,160
No, don't say that.

991
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,040
I cut into it,
and there aren't any layers...

992
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,280
Oh, no.

993
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,200
..which is like the most
important thing, so...

994
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,840
Might something miraculous
happen in the oven?

995
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,360
We can pray.

996
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,280
PAUL: Millefoglie.
I think this is a great challenge.

997
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,040
Yes, there are one or two things
that worry me a little.

998
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,480
I mean, Tasha,
I'm worried about her pastry,

999
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,200
because I've never done pastry
the way she's doing it. Hmm.

1000
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,880
Tasha's some amazing flavours,

1001
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,360
but she struggled
a little bit with timing,

1002
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,920
and she's got to get this one right.

1003
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,680
She's got to finish it.

1004
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,880
It's got to look
and taste incredible.

1005
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,600
Gotta keep going.

1006
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,400
It's the Bake Off tent.

1007
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,720
Things happen.

1008
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,240
DAN: Keep going, keep going,
keep going.

1009
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,640
Just put everything into it.

1010
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,480
What I like about Dan's is that
he's actually shaping the pastry,

1011
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,000
but are you not worried about
the idea of a mirror glaze on top?

1012
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,960
I like the idea of a mirror glaze,

1013
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,120
but it's about the texture
of it sometimes.

1014
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,640
It can be a bit rubbery.

1015
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,800
If you check out his guitar,
it's a pretty similar colour.

1016
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,000
A bit like Josh with blackberry
and blackcurrant and lemon,

1017
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,560
the flavours sound great,

1018
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,560
but for me it's about
the setting on those things.

1019
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,480
I imagine he's going to have
to put a bit of gelatine

1020
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,160
into each of his layers,
because the curd won't stand up

1021
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,080
to the weight of other layers
on top.

1022
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,800
He's got to keep
the level really flat.

1023
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,360
15 sheets of gelatine.
That's gonna go into here,

1024
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,280
which seems a lot, but then again,

1025
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,920
I'm making a very,
very large batch of it.

1026
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,440
But then you've got Matty.

1027
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,520
Whoa.

1028
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,840
Matty is my biggest concern
when it comes to flavour.

1029
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,040
He's using all the alcohols
you can think of.

1030
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,400
It's a dangerous thing to do.

1031
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,640
Some amaretto.

1032
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,560
Need to be cautious with quantity.

1033
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,440
The thing about cooking with alcohol
is you should never be able to feel,

1034
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,360
"My God, that's full of booze."

1035
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,880
Hmm. You should just think
it tastes wonderful.

1036
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,360
I don't want to eat his millefoglie
and think, "I can't drive now."

1037
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,800
IN MYSTERIOUS VOICE:
Bakers, you have an hour left.

1038
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,960
One hour.

1039
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,760
NORMALLY:
That was the spirit of bread.

1040
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,680
I'm so behind.

1041
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,000
Pastry needs to bake.

1042
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,760
Still got mango curd to make.

1043
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,120
This is the first time

1044
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,680
I might not actually finish
a challenge.

1045
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,240
Everything is now in the oven.

1046
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,640
I need it to be cool before
I assemble anything.

1047
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,840
So much going on.
Sorting out my curd,

1048
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,720
whipping that cream,
getting them out of the oven,

1049
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
getting more in the oven.

1050
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,240
I'm just making my amaretto mousse.

1051
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,120
That's a gelatine mix gone in
with the amaretto.

1052
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,760
Gives it a nice bit of body
and hopefully a bit of strength

1053
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,800
to withstand the leaning tower
of electric guitars.

1054
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,040
This is the limoncello diplomat.

1055
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,760
It's a bit soft, but I'm hoping...

1056
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,320
Should be all right.

1057
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,440
Looking very good.
I think I might...

1058
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,480
I think I might give it another
couple of minutes.

1059
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,360
Then it's gonna be done,
but it looks really nice.

1060
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,680
Nice and golden, nice and puffy.

1061
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,800
DAN: Happy with that.

1062
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,680
These look nice. Happy?

1063
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,520
I'm looking at the colour
of Dan and Josh's,

1064
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,800
and theirs are dark!

1065
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,840
Maybe I'll put them back in.
You want them to be crisp.

1066
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,040
Look how dark theirs are
compared to mine.

1067
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,160
Yeah, I know but what if Paul goes,
"Theirs are too dark"?

1068
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,320
You'd be kicking yourself.

1069
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,920
What are your baker's
instincts telling you?

1070
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,480
Copy them.

1071
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,880
Ah, if that's the right colour
you're gonna hurt yourself.
I've lost my bottle.

1072
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,360
As Matty's pastry
goes back in to bake,

1073
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,120
Tasha's is finally ready
for the oven.

1074
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,120
I can do it. I can do it.

1075
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,600
So, now what I need to do is
I need to make the mango curd,

1076
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,800
so I'm going to do that
as quickly as I can.

1077
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,880
I want to start assembling,
so I'm gonna try and

1078
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,600
trim these ones down to size.

1079
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,880
I like to trim it down,

1080
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,680
cos it sort of, like, shows off
your flakiness underneath.

1081
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,640
This is the mirror glaze.

1082
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,360
See me barnet in that.

1083
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,880
Oh, yes!

1084
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,520
It's like the Brothers In Arms
album.

1085
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah!

1086
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,960
Plum curd just kind
of heating away now.

1087
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,600
Need to do it at a speed that
doesn't cook the egg, though.

1088
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,800
Hurry up, hurry up and thicken.

1089
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,640
This is the tuile for
the top of the guitar.

1090
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,880
It's a wood effect.

1091
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,440
Got the four sheets now.

1092
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,560
Just need to do a bit of assembly,
don't we?

1093
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,560
Right, I'm gonna start building up
my bottom layer now.

1094
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,880
Amaretto mousse on here,
full layer of.

1095
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,640
As the rest of the bakers'
millefoglies start to take shape,

1096
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,520
Tasha's oven...

1097
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,560
It's a miracle!
..contains a surprise.

1098
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,840
I see layers.

1099
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,560
You see layers? I see layers.

1100
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,400
Told you, weird stuff
happens in the oven.

1101
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,640
We don't know
what's going on in there.

1102
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,240
It's a box of heat.

1103
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,520
So, there's a lot of butter
in there, but there are layers.

1104
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,000
Back in the game!

1105
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,120
Bakers,
you only have half an hour left.

1106
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,160
Oh, my days.

1107
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,880
Right, they're coming out.

1108
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,360
Pastry's looking good.

1109
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,440
My concern now is getting it cool.

1110
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,200
Middle layer, limoncello diplomat,

1111
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,360
plum curd, chopped walnuts.

1112
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,280
Amaretto mousse on here.
It's a wee bit loose.

1113
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,120
I'd like it to be
a little bit more set

1114
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,400
but I'm just happy that I'm at the
stage to decorate at this moment.

1115
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,200
This is the blackcurrant jam.

1116
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,160
Need to cool.

1117
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,840
This is the coffee and chocolate.

1118
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,040
It's a bit more stable, this,

1119
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,480
so in hindsight, should've put this
one on the bottom, shouldn't I?

1120
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,640
I'm not too happy with this.

1121
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,960
There's bit of oozing,
but I have a plan.

1122
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,880
Hide with fruit.

1123
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,360
I'm quite pleased
with how it's all coming together.

1124
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,200
I've just got to do that last leg

1125
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,040
and then I can just quickly move on

1126
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,440
to doing buttercream flowers on top.

1127
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,400
That mousse isn't set.

1128
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,960
Just melting.

1129
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,280
Bakers...

1130
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,840
15 minutes left.

1131
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,560
Whoa!

1132
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,120
What am I doing now? Fondant.

1133
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,600
Just gotta assemble that.

1134
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,080
Let's have a lovely day,
relaxing baking.

1135
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,480
Yeah, why not?

1136
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,240
This is madness.

1137
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,600
Oh, ya beauty!

1138
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,040
Other weeks, you've been able
to get by with maybe being

1139
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,320
a little bit sloppy.

1140
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,840
Oh, it's a bit big.

1141
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,000
This week, if they say
that it looks a bit messy,

1142
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,720
it's a dagger to the heart,

1143
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,400
and it's making me nervous.

1144
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,880
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

1145
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,000
No rush.

1146
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,160
Job done. Not doing any more to it.

1147
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,000
Ah, it's not set.

1148
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,720
Anybody need a hand?

1149
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,040
Need a hand?

1150
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,640
Paper over the cracks.

1151
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,040
My balloons aren't set,

1152
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,160
so I'm trying to get
the chocolate out of the balloons.

1153
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,920
Oh, right, OK.
Do you want to have a go?

1154
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,160
I like a challenge.

1155
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,000
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1156
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,760
A peony is the look I'm going for.

1157
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,480
BALLOON POPS
Oh...!

1158
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,920
Right, that'll do.

1159
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,080
Worst layers ever, but...

1160
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,280
I'm all done.

1161
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,040
I'm really, really pleased.

1162
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,240
It's not dipping, is it?

1163
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,920
Just get Paul in now.

1164
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,640
Yeah, steady hands, steady hands...

1165
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,680
Oh!

1166
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,400
OK, bakers, your time is up.

1167
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,200
Please step away from your bakes.

1168
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,040
You did it, babies.
SHE SIGHS

1169
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,320
You did it.

1170
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,800
Well done, everybody.

1171
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,000
Awesome.

1172
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,440
Oh, Josh, that's incredible.

1173
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,080
DAN: Yours looks lovely, Matty.

1174
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,200
Just wish that cream was set
a little bit more.

1175
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,880
{\an8}It's time to judge
the bakers' millefoglies.

1176
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,720
Josh, would you like to bring up
your showstopper, please?

1177
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,280
Josh, it is a thing of beauty.

1178
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,320
The lamination that you've achieved
is exceptional.

1179
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,000
It flakes, and it's flat.

1180
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,400
It's not dipping, and I like that.
Like you said.

1181
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,800
Let's have a look inside, shall we?

1182
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,280
Beautiful.

1183
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,360
Phew.

1184
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,720
Look at that.
I want to clap. It's so perfect.

1185
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,840
{\an1}JOSH GIGGLES

1186
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,800
I think you've done
an amazing job with the pastry.

1187
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,200
Thank you.
It literally crumbles in your mouth.

1188
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,280
However, I think you've slightly
overbaked it by minutes. OK.

1189
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:25,000
You've been really clever about
the amount of gelatine you've used

1190
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,280
because it could
so easily have been rubbery.

1191
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,360
And it could've oozed out as well
with the weight, so...

1192
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,240
You've done it beautifully.

1193
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,440
And I very seldom disagree
with Mr Hollywood,

1194
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,320
but I don't think
the pastry's overbaked.

1195
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,840
Thank you very much.
Lovely, thank you. Thank you, Josh.

1196
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,560
Well done.

1197
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,400
Well done, Joshy.

1198
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,960
You've had a bit of
a squeeze on that,

1199
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,960
and the reason is your chocolate
is heavier than your cream.

1200
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,920
If you'd flipped it round,
that wouldn't have happened.

1201
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,640
As soon as I put it on, I thought,

1202
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,160
"I should've put that
on the bottom."

1203
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,560
Yeah. Exceptional decoration
on there, though.

1204
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,680
I think it's so imaginative,
and I love the shape,

1205
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,480
and you can see the lamination.

1206
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,800
The flake's good.

1207
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,200
Cream is delicious.

1208
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,800
The flavours are fantastic.

1209
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,480
There is a tiramisu feel to it.

1210
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,400
The coffee is just the right level.

1211
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,800
But I don't think
the mirror glaze works.

1212
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,600
It looks beautiful,
but it's very rubbery.

1213
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,680
Oh, is it? OK.

1214
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,360
Thank you, Dan.
Cheers, thank you very much.

1215
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,440
Well done, Dan.
Thanks.

1216
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,120
Well done, mate.

1217
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,600
Well done.

1218
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,600
It does look like a celebration.

1219
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,640
Centrepiece, isn't it?

1220
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,560
Yeah, but I think you made
a little mistake here.

1221
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,760
Did you use a cake tin
to cut the pastry? Yeah.

1222
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,560
The trouble is that the cake ring
will squash the pastry.

1223
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,760
It squashes and seals. It'll grow...

1224
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,240
Yeah.
..but it won't grow at the edges.

1225
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,240
But you can see that
the pastry is laminated.

1226
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,320
It is splitting into layers.

1227
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,640
I don't like your puff pastry.

1228
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,120
It's a bit too rubbery.

1229
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,160
If it was baked right through,
it would be better.

1230
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,440
It should be flakier than that. OK.

1231
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,240
I think you've shied off from
giving it a little bit of colour.

1232
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,600
Now, this one is the Marsala.
That one's Marsala, yeah.

1233
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,200
That's delicious.

1234
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,000
I love the flavours.
You're spot on with that.

1235
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,200
Puff pastry,
I'm not convinced about.

1236
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,320
Thanks, Matty. Thank you.

1237
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,360
Well done, Matty. Thank you.

1238
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,480
Good flavour. We'll see.

1239
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,480
I like the pipework,
I like the decoration,

1240
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,800
but it's not particularly square.

1241
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,440
No, I had to rush at the end,
I had some problems.

1242
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,960
You never had a chance to cut it?

1243
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,560
No, I was trying to get them cool
as quickly as I could. Right.

1244
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,360
I didn't want the fillings to melt.

1245
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,320
You've got a great lamination all
the way through.

1246
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,960
That lamination is incredible.

1247
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,360
It's flaking beautifully.

1248
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,800
Let's have a look inside, shall we?

1249
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,280
I mean that really does look
delicious, doesn't it?

1250
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,720
What's this?

1251
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,920
The mango curd.

1252
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,000
It's very grainy.

1253
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:20,080
Tastes lovely, but it's not quite as
silky smooth as the other two.

1254
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,960
I think you've done well
with your lamination

1255
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,800
and your flavours are good,

1256
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,760
but that mango curd isn't right.

1257
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,840
Thank you. Sorry.
Well done, Tasha.

1258
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,440
Yeah.

1259
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,680
Not ideal.

1260
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,760
I'm disappointed in myself

1261
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,520
because I know I could do better.

1262
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,160
But...gotta keep your chin up, so...

1263
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,800
The flavours, they liked.

1264
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,720
Ah, it's just the pastry.

1265
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:01,120
Not enough colour,
and the way that I cut it.

1266
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,360
All makes perfect sense
now, doesn't it?

1267
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,680
Once you know, you know.

1268
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,920
That could be the issue.

1269
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,600
That could be a problem.

1270
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,160
Yeah.

1271
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,200
{\an8}Well, that was an interesting
showstopper.

1272
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,040
{\an8}I really enjoyed them. Josh's one...

1273
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,840
{\an8}Epic. I think his flavours
were really good.

1274
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,480
{\an8}The look of it was perfect,
and beautifully laminated.

1275
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,000
So, overall, in line for Star Baker.

1276
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,240
Dan has done well, too.

1277
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,800
I loved this,
cos it was so original.

1278
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,480
Slight rubbery mirror,
but it's so thin.

1279
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,880
And it's so thin you can't even...

1280
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,960
But it was worth it for
the effect of that guitar.

1281
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,280
Yeah. It was beautiful, wasn't it?

1282
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,840
So, I think it is between
Josh and Dan.

1283
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,200
I think Tasha and Matty are in
a more precarious position.
I agree, I agree.

1284
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,600
What I liked most about Matty's,

1285
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,800
I loved the flavours,
I loved the way he made it look.

1286
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,720
I just had a big problem with
the puff pastry.

1287
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,960
It needed longer in the oven.

1288
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,400
But let's look a little bit closer
at Tasha's.

1289
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,920
The lamination is really nice,

1290
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,280
that flake and crumbliness.

1291
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,800
The biggest issue was the curd.

1292
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,600
It didn't have that satiny
smoothness, that's for sure.

1293
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,200
So it's very close between them,

1294
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,800
but we've got to pick
the three best bakers

1295
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,960
to go through to the final.

1296
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,560
Get a fork, and we'll have a go.
Yeah, let's try again, shall we?

1297
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,840
You're going back in?

1298
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,120
We are nothing if not devoted
to duty.

1299
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,120
We've got the tea.
Bring on the cakes.

1300
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,040
Bakers, well done.

1301
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,440
That was a particularly tough week.

1302
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,960
Patisserie's not easy,

1303
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,760
but you all did amazingly.

1304
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,160
There can only be one
Star Baker, though,

1305
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,480
and this week's Star Baker is...

1306
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,640
..Josh.

1307
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,080
{\an1}APPLAUSE

1308
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,040
Ah, onto the hard bit.

1309
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,480
We'd love to take you all
through to the final,

1310
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,720
but we can't do that,
so this is really heartbreaking.

1311
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,560
The person who's leaving us is...

1312
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,200
..Tasha.

1313
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,760
Come here.

1314
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,680
{\an1}SHE SIGHS

1315
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,160
It's OK.

1316
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,560
Sorry, Tash.

1317
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,880
You did really well. Really well.
I knew it was me.

1318
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,280
Thank you.

1319
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,040
I'm just emotional.

1320
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,800
Just starting to say
goodbye to people,

1321
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,600
and that's when it just really hit,

1322
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,080
and...

1323
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,520
You done amazing, Tash. Oh, thanks.

1324
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,200
They're amazing people.
They really are friends for life.

1325
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,160
That's a really special thing
about Bake Off,

1326
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,120
it is the most supportive
and loving environment.

1327
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,320
It's changed me,
realising I can do so much more

1328
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,920
than I realised that
I was capable of.

1329
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,960
Yeah, it's a special place.

1330
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,600
I'm very lucky to be part of it.

1331
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,720
Well done, come here.
Well done, mate.

1332
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,840
Oh, my goodness.
I can't believe that at all.

1333
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,160
Star Baker, semifinal, that is...

1334
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,040
That is...incredible.

1335
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,320
PAUL: Welcome to the final.

1336
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,160
The final? My nan would be so happy.

1337
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,760
She'd have come down next week
as well, so...

1338
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,440
Yeah, really chuffed.

1339
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,640
Thanks, Paul. Come here.
Welcome to the final, eh?

1340
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,680
Thank you very much.

1341
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,680
It's so exc... I mean, obviously,
I can't get the smile off my face,
can I?

1342
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,680
So exciting. Walking out next week,

1343
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,800
and everyone, like, you know,
all the bakers'll be there,

1344
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,880
their families,
my family's going to be here.

1345
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,120
Hopefully make them
proud as well, really,

1346
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,160
with what I've done on the quiet!

1347
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,080
Hey, Matty. Well done, pal.

1348
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,240
Who'd have thought it?

1349
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,400
My mind is doing backflips.

1350
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,880
I don't know, I've never told anyone
that I feel like I'm a good baker,

1351
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,840
but I definitely am growing
in confidence.

1352
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,000
Just want to give a good account
of myself, you know?

1353
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,720
I don't want any catastrophes,

1354
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,880
and then people are looking like,
"How's he got here?"

1355
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,240
So, a fair few days of practice
coming up.

1356
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,240
Next time...

1357
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,400
There can only be one winner.

1358
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,880
THUNDER CRACKS
This is it, the storm is coming.

1359
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,880
Let's see how I get on.

1360
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,560
Eurgh! Why's it doing that?

1361
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,440
The winner of the
Great British Bake Off...

1362
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,680
Don't want it to lean.

1363
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,520
This is the part where...
CLATTERING

1364
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,560
..where I said about
trusting your instinct.

1365
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,680
I don't...I just...I don't know
with it.

1366
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,160
Oh, no, I didn't dust them in
icing sugar either, did I?

1367
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,680
..goes to...

1368
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,720
Are you a Star Baker in the making?
