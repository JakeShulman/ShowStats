1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,600
So, it's Dessert Week,
so I thought I'd make

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,880
some of my favourite puddings
just for you, Noel. So excited.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,560
Oh, good.
OK, what about this, a cheesecake?

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,080
Oh, that stinks! What's that
made from?

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,360
Well, it's a cheesecake,
so it's made of Stilton.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,440
Right. You got anything else?

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,640
Yeah, I have. What about this, then?

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,800
Is this underwear?

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,360
Well, yeah it's
a knickerbocker glory.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,400
I don't think so. Oh, man.

11
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,120
I mean,
I think you're taking these recipes

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,440
just a little bit too literally.

13
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,240
Well, can I tempt you
with my spotted dick?

14
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,760
I do not want to see that.
Oh, fair enough, then.

15
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,840
Welcome to The Great British Bake
Off.

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,560
Is that Prue or Paul's?

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,920
Last time...

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,200
Holy mackerel.

19
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,160
..the bakers took on botanicals.

20
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,760
It's recognisable, like cat pee.

21
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,600
Late bloomer Josh finally got
Star Baker.

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,440
Oh, my goodness me. Perfection.

23
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,720
Matty had a horticultural
horror show.

24
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,960
It isn't a Showstopper.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,160
As did Saku.

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,520
Your flavours are lacking.

27
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,520
But it was Dana who was guilty
of gilding the lily...

28
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,080
Is it style above substance?

29
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,080
..and she became the seventh baker
to leave the competition.

30
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,800
I'm so proud of myself.

31
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,280
I feel like I've smashed it,
Week Six!

32
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,960
Now... I'm pooing myself.
..it's Dessert Week.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,600
And I'm so excited I've brought
my own spoon.

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,240
I've brought my own spoon!

35
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,040
The bakers face
a wobbly Signature Bake...

36
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,960
It's jiggly, she's jiggly.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,880
..a race against time in
the Technical...

38
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,640
horrible feeling these are
going to be raw.

39
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,720
We're going to be right on
the buzzer, aren't we, I think?

40
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,840
..and it's bombes away in
the Showstopper.

41
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,440
You don't make meringue bombes
every day, do you?

42
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,360
No there's a reason for that.
They're hard!

43
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,040
..whose dessert-making skills
will desert them...

44
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,160
Oh, my gosh what have I done?

45
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,800
..when it comes to the crunch?

46
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
That is disgusting.
These are inedible.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,080
Oh, my gosh, it's mad.

48
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,320
Week Seven.
It's been like a life journey.

49
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,640
The imposter syndrome
has kicked in massively.

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,360
When my name's not called to go,
I've been quite surprised.

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,120
I spend my time, like, seeing,
"Have they looked at me yet?

52
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,040
"Are they trying to avoid looking at
me cos they've got to say my name?"

53
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,440
Or have they looked at me like,
"Get ready, you're going."

54
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,360
Star Baker last week,
that was really special.

55
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,760
I'm still running through it now
even a week later.

56
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,080
I like dessert, I like anything
sweet, anything savoury, every food!

57
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,880
This week is hard.
It's going to be dramatic for sure.

58
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,760
Enjoyable to watch,
not enjoyable to do.

59
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,760
Hello, bakers.
Welcome back to the tent.

60
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,120
It's Dessert Week,

61
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,760
and I'm so excited I've brought
my own spoon.

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
I'm so excited as well.

63
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,440
I've brought my own spoon,
check this out!

64
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,880
I can't wait.
What are they baking?

65
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,440
Well, the judges would like you
to bake

66
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,680
a batch of eight exquisite
creme caramels. Mmm.

67
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,600
Your creme caramels
should consist of

68
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,840
a beautifully-set baked custard
with a caramel sauce.

69
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,320
Now, you've only got two hours
and 45 minutes.

70
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,040
On your marks. Get set. Bake!

71
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,600
You know, a creme caramel
is just cold and it's gelatinous.

72
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,760
It's gross.

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,080
I love creme caramels.

74
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,840
You want it to be lovely to eat
and just sort of melt in the mouth.

75
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,200
Very retro, aren't they?

76
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,080
It sort of reminds me of,
like, being young.

77
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,360
Everything was very...brown.

78
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,920
Creme caramel, you may remember
when you were a kid.

79
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,080
It's, basically, you get
a beautiful caramel on the top,

80
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,600
falling down the side of
a silky smooth, set custard.

81
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,200
Baking a perfect custard is
really tricky.

82
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,200
When it's perfectly baked,
it will be just set.

83
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,920
It wobbles like a jelly.

84
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,160
If it overbakes,
it gets little holes in it

85
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,160
and becomes stodgy and rock hard.

86
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,800
Obviously, they can introduce
flavour into the caramel or the
custard,

87
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,600
but the caramel has to be
the star of the show.

88
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,880
You want a rich golden brown.

89
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,920
If it's too pale,
you're not going to taste it.

90
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,760
If you go to the black stage,
then it's going to taste burnt.

91
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,000
My mother used to make absolutely
perfectly baked custard

92
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,680
which her mum had taught her.

93
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,480
Took me a long time to learn that.

94
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,760
Hi, Dan. Good morning.

95
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Tell us all about your creme
caramel.

96
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,880
So I am doing the aromatic flavours
of a Thai green curry.

97
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,480
Good lord. What are you thinking?

98
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,840
What I'm thinking is... Why?

99
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,360
He's changing up the game, babes.
He's changing it up.

100
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
No, no, look. I think
it sounds really interesting.

101
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,400
{\an8}Dan's Thai-inspired creme caramels
will be flavoured

102
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,960
{\an8}with coriander root, galangal,
lemongrass and lime.

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,200
But how's the sweetness going to
work with the, the tang, spice...

104
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,960
I've worked quite hard with getting
the amount of aromatics in there

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
because if you put too much in,
it becomes quite bitter.

106
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,320
It sets, does it?

107
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,440
It's not on the firm side.
It's just on the nice...

108
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,560
On the wobble.
On the wobbly side, yeah.

109
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,960
I like it. On the Alison side. Yes!

110
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,000
We've got eight tea bags
for 800 grams of coconut milk

111
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,280
and 200 grams of milk,

112
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,600
and that's just literally going to
be left to infuse for a while.

113
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,360
So, I've just put in some lemongrass

114
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,840
and I'm putting in
some galangal now.

115
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,360
So, it's from the ginger family.

116
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,200
Whatever the flavours
the bakers are using,

117
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,720
they'll need to strike
a perfect balance...

118
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,000
Have I worried you? Yeah.

119
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,520
In a good way or a bad way? Bad.

120
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,120
..or risk overpowering
the dish's classic caramel flavour.

121
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,320
It's rosemary that I've brought from
home from my mum's garden.

122
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,920
Rosemary's an interesting one.

123
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,360
Cos you go slightly over,
it becomes medicinal.

124
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,160
Or you think of a roast. Yeah.

125
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,400
It's trying to find that balance.

126
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,000
How did you know when you'd reached
the right amount of rosemary?

127
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,600
Wing it.

128
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,120
She flies by the seat of her pants.

129
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,840
Right, I trust you, Tash.

130
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,960
{\an8}Tasha's rosemary-infused custard
will be sandwiched between

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,920
{\an8}a honey caramel and fig compote.

132
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,000
Dessert week, yes or no?

133
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,920
I say yes. You say yes?
I say no to creme caramel. Ah.

134
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,160
Have you seen the challenge videos
on YouTube?

135
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,000
No. People have to, like,
inhale them without their hands.

136
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,280
Oh... They have to, like,
suction them into their mouths.

137
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,040
Oh, no. Not sure about that.

138
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Paul's going to have to eat a lot.

139
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,720
What, without his hands?
Yeah, I'm going to tie him up.

140
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,640
I think we'd pay good money
to see... Kinky handcuffs.

141
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,120
No, I don't want to see that.
HE IMITATES WHIP CRACK

142
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,200
It's not just the judges consuming
copious creme caramels.

143
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,840
In practice, I've been doing 12.

144
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
When we was waiting to come in,

145
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,000
everyone was like,
"We're only doing eight."

146
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,360
I'm going to do 12 anyway.

147
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,360
Hopefully there's some margin
for error, then.

148
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,920
Matty's favourite eight creme
caramels will feature

149
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,840
a custard infused with chai,
coconut and vanilla,

150
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,920
though he's not entirely sure why.

151
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,800
Why chai?

152
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,240
Do you drink chai a lot, do you,
at school and stuff?

153
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,080
Not particularly.
I'm more of a coffee kind of guy.

154
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,480
So again, why chai?

155
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,120
I wanted to do something with
coconut cos I quite like the flavour

156
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,440
of coconut and I feel that it
marries quite nicely.

157
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,280
Sounds great. Thank you.

158
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,440
Matty, don't let him upset you.
Every time.

159
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,960
Thank you, Matty.
Thank you, cheers.

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,880
Why did he say that?
Do you think he likes chai?

161
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,320
It's a good question.
I don't even know if I like chai.

162
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,240
I'm nervous for you now. Good luck.

163
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,440
I'm just starting on my caramel.

164
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,600
I'm just looking for a nice,
deep amber colour.

165
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,280
Achieving a perfect caramel means
walking a tightrope.

166
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,880
It's quite a temperamental process,

167
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,000
and it takes patience,
and I've not got much of that.

168
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,240
Apply too much heat too quickly
and it will be ruined.

169
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,520
You need to be really careful.

170
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,560
If you just go 30 seconds over,
bitter.

171
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,920
It's, uh,
just getting the timing right.

172
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,200
That looks pretty good.

173
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,960
I feel like that's right.

174
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,520
But heat it too slowly...

175
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,000
It's taking forever.

176
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,880
..and it won't become caramel at
all.

177
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Feels, like, a bit crystallised.

178
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,280
I might have to redo it, you know.

179
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,360
I'm just going to redo it.

180
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,000
As Matty starts again...

181
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,440
Got the honey going in, sticky.

182
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,360
..two bakers are taking a
different approach to caramel.

183
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,640
I'm doing a cheat's way

184
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,600
because I'm just literally
using honey.

185
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,520
I'm just heating
the honey until it's reduced.

186
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,240
This is jaggery.
It belongs to the palm family.

187
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,920
We use in Sri Lanka quite a lot.

188
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,080
But for Saku, jaggery
involves an extra risk.

189
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Jaggery sets harder. Yeah.

190
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,200
It's hard to get out
of the...of a mould.

191
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,520
What point do you tip it out, then?
Still when it is hot.

192
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,720
If it goes cold, no, it's sticking.

193
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,280
You'd need a chisel and
a hammer to get them out.

194
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,400
{\an8}Using jaggery, cardamom and nutmeg,

195
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,600
{\an8}Saku's creme caramels
will be mini versions of

196
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,840
{\an8}a popular pudding from
her homeland.

197
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,040
I am making a Sri Lankan
dessert, watalappan.

198
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,680
My mum made those at home.
This is one of her favourite.

199
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,200
When I am coming here every morning,
I ring her.

200
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,480
She knows that I am making
this today.

201
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,680
Also infusing family flavours
is Josh.

202
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,440
Creme caramel was my nan's favourite

203
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,400
and also one of her favourite
flavours was plums and custard.

204
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,240
Do you know what I love about you?
You always honour your Nana.

205
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,280
I know, yeah. It's so lovely.
She'd be so proud of you.

206
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,480
{\an8}Josh's cinnamon and orange custard
will be topped

207
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,080
{\an8}with cinnamon-spiced plums
and tempered chocolate butterflies

208
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
in an attempt
to build on last week's success.

209
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,920
Hello, Star Baker. Hello.

210
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,120
That was good, wasn't it, last week?
Yeah, that was amazing.

211
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,920
That was amazing.
I was not expecting that at all.

212
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,720
So you've had a handshake, right?
Yeah.

213
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,720
And you've been Star Baker? Yeah.

214
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,000
Imagine if you win Star Baker again.
No?

215
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,840
I don't know.

216
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,800
So, when I practised it,
I overdid the honey

217
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,280
and it was rock solid,
so I want to get a balance.

218
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,640
I'm going to put that
in my ramekins.

219
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,560
Just gotta do a nice, thin caramel.

220
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,200
So I'm going to use it all,
so it's about two tablespoons.

221
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,360
Caramel take two.

222
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,600
I went too slow with it, I think,
so I'm going to speed up the heat.

223
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,560
I need it to be made now.

224
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,960
Bakers, you are halfway through.

225
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,880
This is the infused milk
for my custard.

226
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,280
So I'm just going to pass it
through a sieve

227
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,280
and then bring that together
with the eggs.

228
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,280
So, the eggs is what's
going to set it.

229
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,280
Achieving the correct balance
between whole eggs

230
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,640
and egg yolks is crucial.

231
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,480
You want your custard to have
a nice wobble

232
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,440
but you don't want it
to be too hard like rubber.

233
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,160
Not enough whole eggs,
and the custard won't set correctly.

234
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,120
Three eggs and four yolks.
Bit worried it might not set.

235
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,080
But too many and it will set firm...

236
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,280
Eight whole eggs.

237
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,880
..and lose the delicate texture
the judges are looking for.

238
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,760
It's rich, not hugely thick.

239
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,000
Still wibbly-wobbly in the middle.

240
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,120
I'm just going to gently whisk this
mixture into the egg.

241
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,080
It's quite empty in the tent now.
It's horrible.

242
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,080
Do you think you'll stay in touch?
Yeah, definitely.

243
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,080
I mean. I'm very difficult
to stay in touch with, I am,

244
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,640
cos I never answer my phone.
Spend two weeks to reply to a text.

245
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,440
Remain a little bit enigmatic
and mysterious.

246
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,280
"Where's Dan gone?" No-one knows.
No-one knows!

247
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,920
"Is Dan still alive?" Nobody knows.
Nobody knows.

248
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,600
Like Bigfoot, there was a sighting,

249
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,400
just a blurry picture of Dan
just leaving like that.

250
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,320
That will pour into my ramekin
and my caramel.

251
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,240
Caramel on the bottom,
custard on top.

252
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,080
Gotta make sure they're all
the same amount.

253
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,640
It needs to have
a little water bath around it.

254
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,440
So, the hot water bath stops
the eggs from curdling.

255
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,920
Makes me nervous that everyone
is, like, putting it in the oven

256
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,840
and I'm still making
bloomin' caramel.

257
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,640
Here we go, 35 minutes.

258
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,160
140 for about 30 to 35 minutes.

259
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,640
Be good to me.

260
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,400
I don't get why it's not working.

261
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,880
It feels like it's
crystallising again.

262
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,720
And now we actually have
a problem, so I'm going again.

263
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,640
And everyone else's
are, like, in the oven

264
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,120
and my caramel isn't even cooked.

265
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,440
As Matty attempts to conquer his
caramel for the third time...

266
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,160
Can't do anything else
until this is sorted.

267
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,440
..everyone else can turn
to their toppings.

268
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,600
I'm going to make some fig jam.

269
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,760
They were worried about my creme
caramels tasting medicinal.

270
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,560
I'm thinking maybe I add
a bit more sugar.

271
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,000
The plums I'm going to cut into
cubes, and I'm going to just

272
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,760
stew them with some orange juice
and cinnamon.

273
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,360
I don't want them to fall apart,
I want them to keep their shape.

274
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,880
Going to put some orange segments in
some orange liqueur.

275
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,480
Should go still like a citrus
tartness, but sweet as well.

276
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,520
{\an8}With orange decoration,
an orange zest,

277
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,560
{\an8}and nutmeg-infused custard,

278
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,720
Cristy is hoping her citrus flavours
will impress Paul and Prue.

279
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,280
How much has it taken over your
life, this situation? Oh, my gosh.

280
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,600
You don't stop practising,
you don't stop thinking about it,

281
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,560
you go to bed and you're
having dreams.

282
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,440
You dream about it as well? Yeah!

283
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,560
Really? It's mad, yeah...

284
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,440
What sort of dreams have you had?

285
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,520
Paul going, "It's not good enough!"
ALISON LAUGHS

286
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,120
How simple is that?
It's so annoying.

287
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,440
It's pretty much there, to be fair.

288
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,080
Probably needs longer,
but I'm very conscious of time.

289
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,320
They take 25 to 35 minutes...

290
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,920
..so I'm trying them at 25
and praying to God.

291
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,400
Bakers... You have...
Half an hour... Left.

292
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,880
That's not good.

293
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,600
That's not good at all.

294
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,000
Don't think it's going to be ready,

295
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,120
but I'm just going to do
a wobble check.

296
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,960
Here we go.

297
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,400
There's absolutely no room
for error when it comes to

298
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,600
the bake of a creme caramel.

299
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,040
They're wobbling.
Just checking the wobble.

300
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,680
Take them out a minute too early...

301
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,200
Hooray. Yeah? Yeah.

302
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,200
..and they could collapse
when de-moulded.

303
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,960
Got a nice little cheeky little
wobble on them. Oh, yeah.

304
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,520
Wobbly, but not too wobbly.

305
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,320
Wibbly-wobbly.

306
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,920
But too long,
and they will set too hard,

307
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,920
resulting in a bubbly,
scrambled egg texture.

308
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,480
I think they're basically
nearly there.

309
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,840
I'm going to give them two minutes.

310
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,560
They've still got 15 minutes to go.
Well, more than 15.

311
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
I wanted them out
in the fridge by now,

312
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,280
not still liquid in the oven.
Will they take ages to cool down?

313
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,800
Yeah. It's all about heating things
up and cooling it down.

314
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,040
You've really simplified this
show here, Noel.

315
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,680
Baking. You heard it here first.

316
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,560
Why don't we just not do either?

317
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,560
We'd be in the same situation we
were. I've had a good go at it!

318
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,320
They've all got the
wobble in the middle,

319
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,320
so I'm going to leave them
at that now.

320
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,160
They've got a slight wobble.

321
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,520
Yeah, they're cooked.

322
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,160
So, I'm just going to let them cool.

323
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,440
To obviously de-mould,
you need to get them nice and cold.

324
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,200
While most of the bakers are
cooling their creme caramels,

325
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,560
that's the last thing Saku wants.

326
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,000
Now I need to turn this out.

327
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,520
As the colder hers gets...

328
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,360
The jaggery, when it hardens,
I can't take it out, it breaks.

329
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,520
..the more likely they are
to stick to the moulds.

330
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,680
Please come.

331
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,960
{\an1}SHE SIGHS

332
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,720
Why it's not happening?

333
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,640
Yes!

334
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,360
Yes, it is.

335
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,040
{\an8}Yes, it is.

336
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,240
Time for some decor, which is
more caramel, so I can't wait.

337
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,440
Butterfly is always
synonymous with my nan.

338
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
When she was coming towards
the end, she'd always say,

339
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,800
"Whenever you see a butterfly
around, that's me watching."

340
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,320
That's so beautiful.

341
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,600
It's weird because you don't see
many butterflies any more, do you?

342
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,320
I get loads in the garden. Do you?
You've gotta have the right plants.

343
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,040
Lots of flowers,
and they like buddleia plants.

344
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,320
Well, I've got Astroturf.
SHE LAUGHS

345
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,440
I think that's where you're
going wrong.

346
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,200
Course it's working
first time, this one.

347
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,480
The one where I've got plenty
of time to sort out.

348
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,320
I want to get some spirals.

349
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,440
I'm doing little honeycomb tuiles.

350
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,360
Look, look who's here.

351
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,560
What's he doing here?

352
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,240
He shouldn't be in here now,
should he? No!

353
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,680
He's off, he's off, it's fine.
Like a wild tiger,

354
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,640
just sort of milling about.

355
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,280
When's the zookeeper coming?

356
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,920
You mean Prue?

357
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,720
Looks good, I'm happy.

358
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,320
My mum, I want her to be proud!

359
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,160
They're coming out regardless.

360
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,000
Got to rapidly cool 'em.

361
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,400
Go on Noel, tell 'em.

362
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,600
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

363
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,280
Time is ticking!

364
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,800
You can do this.

365
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,880
Yes, you can!
We believe in you.

366
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,680
{\an1}HE SIGHS

367
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,160
Flippin' hell.

368
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,240
We are turning out.

369
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,400
This is the crunch time now,
isn't it?

370
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,760
You don't know
until you de-mould it, do you?

371
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,840
Oh, this is so stressful.

372
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,600
Ideally, I'd have them in the fridge
for an hour, but here we are.

373
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,800
I've got my fingers crossed
for numerous things right now.

374
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,680
I hate this part.

375
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,920
Moment of truth.

376
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,280
It's jiggly. She's jiggly.

377
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,760
They've just got loads
of little bubbles, haven't they?

378
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,480
They're just on the edge of set.

379
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,800
I don't know what they're going
to be like. I'm very nervous.

380
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,640
Not too bad.

381
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,200
A few more, and then
I can breathe again.

382
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,880
Go, go, go.

383
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,320
That's two.

384
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,040
Hello. Oh, you're coming in at
a de-moulding time.

385
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,600
I'm like your lucky charm, aren't I?

386
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,120
No, you're not.

387
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,400
Please, come out of there. Noel!
Threaten it.

388
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,880
You've gotta come back,
you're making me scared.
Am I bad juju?

389
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,880
Am I? No, Noel, go away.

390
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,720
Come on. It's the suction.

391
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,040
Come back when they're out.
I love to watch this bit. No!

392
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,200
It's the best bit. All right,
I'll leave you. OK, come out.

393
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,360
There you go! Thank you, Jesus.

394
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,320
That's cos I went to leave. I know!

395
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,760
Oh, you bugger.

396
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,200
I've had a collapse.

397
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,560
Donkey.

398
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,560
Probably needed another minute
in the oven.

399
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,720
Should've made 12, like Matty,
shouldn't I?

400
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's pick the eight.

401
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,760
I like that one.

402
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,560
Bakers, you've got just
one minute left.

403
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,200
Better get a move on doing that,
actually.

404
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,760
Sticky nuts, I'm calling them.

405
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,960
Bee tuiles.

406
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,440
The tuiles, they are not artistic.

407
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,040
Butterfly sits on top.

408
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,280
Tried my best.
That's all you can do.

409
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,840
Bakers, your time is up.

410
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,640
What a horrible challenge.

411
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,080
Please step away from your
creme caramels.

412
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,360
Well done, kids. Well done.

413
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,760
It's in the flavour now, innit?
In the tasting.

414
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,240
That was so stressful.

415
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,360
I weren't expecting to get 'em out.

416
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,280
It's time for the bakers'
Signature creme caramels

417
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,560
to face the judgment of
Paul and Prue.

418
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,960
Hello, Dan. Hello.

419
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,720
So, these are my Thai green
curry-inspired creme caramels.

420
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,160
Don't say curry. OK.

421
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,040
Just Thai. Don't say curry.
Thai-inspired.
This is bonkers, I'm loving it.

422
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,920
Have you got curry in there? No.

423
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,440
It's sort of intriguing though,
isn't it? OK, OK.

424
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,440
It's got the wobble, which I love.
The wobble's there.

425
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,000
You're suffering from
a slight under-bake. I am.

426
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,200
That one looks a bit desperate, Dan.

427
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,200
I love that texture.

428
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,280
That's beautiful. It really is.

429
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,680
You've got your flavours spot-on.

430
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,120
It's the lemongrass that makes that.

431
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,320
It's very nearly perfect.

432
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,640
It doesn't look perfect
because they're collapsed,

433
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,720
but that flavour is lovely. Thank
you. That's great,

434
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,960
thank you very much. You've invented
a dessert, Dan.

435
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,160
Well done. Thank you.

436
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,680
The texture on the side is
pretty bad.

437
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,560
I mean, it's bubbled up quite badly.

438
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,080
And that's because you left them in
the oven too long. A bit overcooked.

439
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,360
That's boiled inside. Gosh.

440
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,320
At the moment the orange is there,
but the caramel isn't.

441
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,000
They're too solid. OK.

442
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,160
That's the big issue. Oh, OK.

443
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,000
They look really interesting.

444
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,880
I was worried about you making
caramel with honey.

445
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,160
Could it have been
a little bit thicker? Yeah.

446
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,120
There's a swimming pool of
sweetness.

447
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,760
It needs to be on the top, really.

448
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,920
That is a beautiful set.
Smooth as anything.

449
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,240
The fig comes through,
the rosemary's barely there.

450
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,720
But the flavour, it's lacking
a little bit of direction.

451
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,800
I think using honey was such
a lovely idea.

452
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,640
But everything is too sweet.

453
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,720
OK, thank you.

454
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,640
{\an8}They're so pretty. They're almost
identical.

455
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,160
And your jaggery seems to have
worked. It's nice and evenly shiny.

456
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,960
It's very sweet. Yeah.
Which I sort of expected.

457
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,560
Cardamom comes through beautifully,
but it's too thick.

458
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,200
How many eggs did you have? Eight.
Eight whole eggs?

459
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,040
Yeah. I think that could be
the problem.

460
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,640
You've got too much egg white. Hmm.
OK, yeah.

461
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,360
Straight off I think they look very,
very pretty

462
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,360
and there's a lot of finesse
to this.

463
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,640
There's a lot of bubbles in there
on the side.

464
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,160
They're slightly overbaked.

465
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,640
The spiced plum and the orange
together,

466
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,000
the taste in that is delicious,
with the sweetness level just so.

467
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,480
The plums are not as cooked
as I'd expected,

468
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,680
and that's rather nice.

469
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,640
They've got a sort of freshness
of fresh fruit.

470
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,480
Just the texture's slightly off.
It is overbaked.

471
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,080
But you can't get over
the flavour of that. Thank you.

472
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Well done, Josh.

473
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,520
They look quite attractive. I think
your caramel could have been

474
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,040
a little bit darker. You can tell by
the colour there, it's too pale.

475
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,280
Yeah. But they look nice and smooth.

476
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,000
I love the flavour. Hmm.

477
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,720
Because the chai flavour's quite
strong, it's interesting.

478
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,040
And I think it really works.

479
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,600
But they are probably
a little overbaked.

480
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,120
Looks like a frankfurter sausage.
You know, when you get the skin

481
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,840
on a frankfurter? You're not selling
it, Paul! That's enough now.

482
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,280
Tastes good, though. Well done.
No, it really tastes delicious.

483
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,600
I keep wanting to go back
for another bite. Thank you, Matty.

484
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,200
Thank you. I'd actually eat a hot
dog creme caramel.

485
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,400
It went all right, to be fair,
I think.

486
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,120
When they was commenting on
the colour of the caramel,

487
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,960
you don't know how lucky you are
to have any caramel here!

488
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,840
I wouldn't take a risk unless it was
worth taking.

489
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,640
I've created a little dessert for
myself. I'm happy I pleased Paul.

490
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,960
Oh, I'm sad.
It's not silky and smooth.

491
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,080
It is not good for me.
I will be in danger.

492
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,080
It was the bubbles.
The stupid bubbles.

493
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,920
I'm not going to be making
them again.

494
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,440
The bakers have no idea what awaits
them in the Technical Challenge.

495
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,040
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent,

496
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,160
it's time for your
Technical Challenge.

497
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,640
Today it's been set
for you by Paul Hollywood.

498
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,920
I don't know if you've noticed
but he's wearing desert boots.

499
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,160
What you think are desert boots are
actually dessert boots.

500
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,120
They're made out of
a thin layer of trifle.

501
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,680
They're new on the market.
Check those out.

502
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,240
So, Paul, have you got any words
of advice for our bakers?

503
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,200
This recipe has got three very
distinctive textures.

504
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,560
You've got to get them all right
for it to work.

505
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,280
OK, well, judges, you can leave now.
No snacks, remember,

506
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,640
leave some room for dessert,
thank you.

507
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,040
{\an1}LAUGHTER

508
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,960
Paul would love you
to make six individual orange

509
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,680
and ginger treacle puddings.

510
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,120
Your steamed sponges should be
soft and light,

511
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,880
and served with a smooth custard
and a ginger and orange syrup.

512
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,400
You've got an hour and a half,
which is plenty of time.

513
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,960
On your marks. Get set.
Bake!

514
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,640
I don't know how to make this.

515
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,080
I am following the instructions.
We'll get there.

516
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,560
I've never made anything like this
before.

517
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,240
So it's going to go real well.

518
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,120
I love a steamed pudding. It's
a proper rib-sticking pudding,

519
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,720
isn't it, like? Get it down you!

520
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,040
Paul, this is one
of my absolute favourite puddings.

521
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,240
A proper steamed sponge pudding.

522
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,360
Yeah. This has got
a beautiful golden syrup on the top.

523
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,120
Served with creme anglaise,
and then you have the ginger

524
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,840
and the orange syrup as well.
Let's go through the dangers.

525
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,920
The killer thing, I think,
with this is timing.

526
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,880
Yeah, OK. Straight away they have
to crack on with

527
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,360
the syrup that goes on the top.

528
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,840
Now we've allowed 20 minutes
with the syrup, getting it right.

529
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,480
And then they've got to think of
the sponge,

530
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,600
and it's critical that they get
the bake right.

531
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,280
40 minutes minimum. 40. 4-0.

532
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,400
Now with an hour and a half, that
doesn't give you

533
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,560
a lot of wriggle room. No.

534
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,960
Who's going to use their time
wisely?

535
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,040
Would you like to try one, Prue?
Yes, please!

536
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,120
Then you have this beautiful syrup.

537
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,320
That with the creme anglaise,
which is beautiful

538
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,520
and silky smooth. The orange,
the ginger,

539
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,720
it just blends beautiful together.
It's amazing because

540
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,000
the texture is both very moist
and yet it's light.

541
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,680
Hmm. Paul, this is heaven.

542
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,240
I'm looking forward
to six more of them.

543
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,040
And I'm going to have difficulty not
eating all of this.

544
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,080
So my syrup, make the caramel.

545
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,400
With 50g of caster sugar
and three tablespoons of water.

546
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,120
Yeah, I'm buzzing for that.
Cannot wait to make more caramel.

547
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,520
I'm mentally scarred.

548
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,720
You know your way around
a treacle pudding, don't you?

549
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,600
No. I do not. No. You're too young.
Yeah.

550
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,480
Nobody eats puddings any more,
do they?

551
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,680
Not steamed ones, do they?

552
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,720
It's like something from
the Victorian era.

553
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,720
This is nearly, nearly there.

554
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,480
Carefully pour in the boiling water.

555
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,960
Add some lemon wedge and stir until
the mixture comes to the boil.

556
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,880
Simmer to produce a golden syrup.
That's not golden.

557
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,760
So this is going to go in the bottom
of the sponge,

558
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,280
so I'm going to get this bad
boy syrupy.

559
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,600
This don't look right. It's stuck.

560
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,840
So I assume once it heats up
it will melt, maybe?

561
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,040
What's going down in the Tash
kitchen?

562
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,600
{\an1}SHE EXHALES

563
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,560
You do this every single
time you have a technical.

564
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,960
I get a massive sigh.
What's going on?

565
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,720
I don't understand why they've asked
us to make

566
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,920
a caramel and then add
a load of boiling water.

567
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Cos it makes it all juicy for when
it's in the sponge.

568
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,520
If I go there, you go here.
Let's switch.

569
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,360
I'm assuming. Ain't got a clue.

570
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,880
Make an orange and ginger
sponge batter.

571
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,160
Butter's gone in, caster sugar's
gone in. Eggs have just gone in.

572
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,120
{\an8}Let's do the stem ginger.

573
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,920
No-one's going to want
a big bit of stem ginger, you know.

574
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,760
Chopping this like a nutter.

575
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,600
Grated zest of an orange.

576
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,960
Then I'll fold through my flour.

577
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,520
How's everyone making their sponge?

578
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,040
What am I doing wrong?
Oh, look it's starting to mix in.

579
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,440
Is it? Or am I just fooling myself?

580
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,800
I think I'm just fooling myself.
It's all to the side.

581
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,360
Treacle pudding.
It's not very modern, is it?

582
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,160
It's from an era of Prue Leith,
isn't it?

583
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,600
It might be more Paul, actually.
'70s stodge.

584
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,320
Yeah, '70s stodge. Yeah, yeah.

585
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,240
Little 12-year-old Paul
with his blue eyes gleaming.

586
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,920
"Mum, mum!"
He's got a conker in one hand.

587
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,080
Yeah, that's it, yeah. And a little
school bag over his shoulder.

588
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,240
Rushes in.
Eats his treacle pudding.

589
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,600
I don't know, but it is too runny.

590
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,000
It needs to be a golden syrup
kind of a texture.

591
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,520
{\an8}I don't want to go on to too many
steps because I think this is going
to be quite a crucial bit.

592
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,560
{\an8}I want to watch this and make sure
it's OK.

593
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,840
Any delay at this stage will mean
less time to bake.

594
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,240
It's going for ages.

595
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,400
And with it needing at least 40
minutes in the oven...

596
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,960
I'm going to spend a minute or two
just getting this bang-on.

597
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,040
..this could prove disastrous.

598
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,400
Put the kettle on.

599
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,160
Bakers, it seems nuts but you're
halfway through already.

600
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,280
This is a quick one, isn't it?
Really.

601
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,960
I love a quickie. I love a...

602
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,160
I think we're about there then now.

603
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,080
Spoon some syrup into the mould.

604
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,160
It's very pale, but it's got
to go in.

605
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,280
Divide the sponge batter
between moulds.

606
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,920
I'm very aware that this isn't
ready yet.

607
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,040
What have you been doing? I know!
How's he already there?

608
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,920
Don't look at others. Stop.
Just concentrate on yourself. Yeah.

609
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
This is your week.

610
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,520
Why do you laugh when I say that?
Next week's your week.

611
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,560
Cover with paper and foil.

612
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,560
Can you tell I never did Scouts?
It says steam

613
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,320
in a bain-marie in the oven.

614
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,000
Right, my little beauties.

615
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,680
How long we are baking?
I have no idea how long.

616
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,840
Maybe I'll leave them in for 25,
30 minutes.

617
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,280
They're only small, aren't they?
Do 25 minutes.

618
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
20 minutes.

619
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,600
Yeah, so I've started with
the sponge,

620
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,000
nothing, like, extravagant,

621
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,440
just creaming the butter
and then I'll add the sugar.

622
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,720
I have no idea if that syrup is what
it should look like,

623
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,080
so we will find out when they
eat it.

624
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,000
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

625
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,280
Is that it?

626
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,320
Time is ticking!

627
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,440
Bit stressed but I shouldn't be.
Just chill out.

628
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,920
I can make the creme anglaise now.

629
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,640
I looked at the ingredients,
I'm like, "Yes! I have done this."

630
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,480
So I'm going to heat the milk
and the cream.

631
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,400
Whisk your egg yolks with your
caster sugar till nice and pale.

632
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,320
{\an8}Pour over your eggs nice and slowly.

633
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,800
{\an8}Stir it until it goes thick.

634
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,640
But not that thick.

635
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,720
It has to be pouring consistency,
I think.

636
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,680
How long do these things take
to steam?

637
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,560
I want to give that as long as
I can in there.

638
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,720
I don't want to serve them
anything underbaked.

639
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,280
Serve the puddings with
a jug of ginger and orange syrup.

640
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,800
So I've just added the orange juice
and the stem ginger.

641
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,080
Reduce to a pouring consistency.

642
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,640
Do you like technicals, Saku?

643
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,240
{\an1}SHE MOUTHS

644
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,360
Why? Because it is not the full
instructions, isn't it?

645
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,920
That's the thing. If you've never
made one... It's really hard.

646
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,240
..where do you get the knowledge?

647
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,640
Shall I tell you where you get that
knowledge from? Yes, please.

648
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,720
Just look at everyone else's.

649
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,040
Don't want to over reduce this.

650
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,720
But I don't want it too
loose either.

651
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,160
So it's now over reduced. Ah!

652
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,880
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

653
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,160
I should check these,
I'm going to check this one.

654
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,160
{\an8}Should I just take one out
and see how it's looking?

655
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,040
I don't know how I'm going to tell
they're done, cos

656
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,040
they're literally covered up,
aren't they?

657
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,200
The moment of truth.

658
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,040
Oh! It's not done.

659
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,000
They're not done.

660
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,960
Think it needs longer.
I don't know. They seem soft.

661
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,240
Turn that oven up. A little bit
more.

662
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,320
I think the bain-marie is actually
slowing down the cooking.

663
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,400
I'm going to go rogue and stick them
in without the bain-marie.

664
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,720
Oh, da-da-da-da.

665
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,600
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

666
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,080
We're going to be right on
the buzzer, aren't we, I think.

667
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,880
It's going to be a rush job.

668
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,520
Josh looks a bit scared.
Are you going to be all right?

669
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,720
Are you going to be all right,
five minutes good?

670
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,840
Got to get them out.
They're not done.

671
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,560
But they're going to have to be
done. I'm really scared now.

672
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,120
Give me strength, Lord.

673
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,800
Horrible feeling these are going
to be raw.

674
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
Oh, dear.

675
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,040
Oh, flip, they're raw. Oh!

676
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,960
{\an1}SHE GASPS

677
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,160
It's a bit uncooked at the top.

678
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,800
Oh! No. That one's raw.

679
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,960
Oh, wow. They're so raw.

680
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,760
Oh, my gosh, they can't eat this,
they're going to get ill.

681
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,760
Oh, my gosh, what have I done?

682
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,920
Bakers, you have one minute left.

683
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,160
No! Oh!

684
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,480
Oh, no!

685
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,200
This is a car crash.

686
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,800
I'm not even pouring them.

687
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,480
OK, that one's more cooked.

688
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,200
Do I have to be judged? Aw.

689
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,000
Are they meant to be raw or what?

690
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,080
Your time is up.

691
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,280
Oh, my God.

692
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,560
I can't! I can't serve that!

693
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,200
{\an1}LAUGHTER

694
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,040
Please come and place your bakes
behind your photographs

695
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,760
on the gingham table.

696
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,960
They can't eat them.

697
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,240
Oh, they're going to need a straw.

698
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,360
If any of you need a flask...

699
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,240
Aw! I can't cope.

700
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,280
{\an1}LAUGHTER

701
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,000
The judges are looking for six
impeccable treacle puddings,

702
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,640
served with a delicious syrup
and silky custard,

703
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,160
and comprising of light, airy
perfectly steamed sponges.

704
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,280
{\an1}ALISON LAUGHS

705
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,320
It's your duty.

706
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,480
That is disgusting.

707
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,800
Well, OK, let's start over here.
Those are raw.

708
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,240
These are inedible.
They really are.

709
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,760
Creme anglaise is OK.

710
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,640
{\an1}HE CHUCKLES

711
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,120
Pouring consistency.

712
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,480
Moving on. Creme anglaise is OK.

713
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,360
The syrup's not bad as
well, actually.

714
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,040
Steamed sponges are inedible.

715
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,280
That's just stodge. They needed
another quarter of an hour

716
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,320
or something.

717
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,280
Creme anglaise looks OK.

718
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,800
The syrup looks pretty good as well.
Same problem.

719
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,600
This is even worse. Uh, these are
inedible.

720
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,080
They needed much longer cooking.

721
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,000
The size of them are terrible
as well.

722
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,360
We actually have something that's
got a bake on it.

723
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,800
OK, so let's taste this.

724
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,560
The flavour's good.

725
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,600
The orange tang coming
through nicely.

726
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,320
Mm-mm.

727
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,960
This has some element of a bake.
It's the right consistency.

728
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,360
And it's the right balance of ginger
and orange.

729
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,400
Moving on to the last one.
That is terrible.

730
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,840
I think this is a bit burnt.

731
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,720
Slightly, yeah.

732
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,440
That's pretty awful. It's just
liquid. Nil points!

733
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Yeah, nil points.

734
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,840
ALISON: Paul and Prue will now rank
the puddings

735
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,440
from worst to least worst.

736
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,400
So in sixth place we have this one.

737
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,800
Matty, it's a disaster.
Oh, it is.

738
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,000
In fifth spot we have this one.
Saku, terrible. I know.

739
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,240
Fourth is Cristy and in
third place is Josh.

740
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,920
In second place we have
this one.

741
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,680
And, Dan, I'm afraid we're still on
the terrible.

742
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,360
I know. And in first place is this
one.

743
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,320
Tash. Not as terrible,

744
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,800
but pretty terrible.
But at least it was edible.

745
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,000
Thanks.

746
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,120
Anyway, you've all learnt
a little bit about how

747
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,600
to make steamed puddings.

748
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,960
At least you're all roughly on

749
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,160
the same level, do you know what
I mean? That's not a compliment!

750
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,360
Is this making you feel better?

751
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,280
You've let Prue down,
you've let me down,

752
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,400
you've let yourselves down.

753
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,080
Consider yourselves roasted.

754
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
I will take that.

755
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
A win is a win.

756
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,600
I'm trying my best.
Because I want to come back.

757
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,680
Went all right.

758
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,760
Flashbacks to being at school, that.
You know, when they're like...

759
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,440
They're worse than angry.
They're so disappointed.

760
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,920
But we got a laugh!

761
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,320
Dessert week.
It's been a roller-coaster.

762
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,600
I think the technical was

763
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,720
the worst thing I have ever judged
on Bake Off. Oh!

764
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,720
It's up there.
I was disappointed.

765
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,520
Judging that was quite difficult.

766
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,760
So I guess we have to ignore
the technical.

767
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,000
The signature they did OK.
Now you look at Dan,

768
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,920
you know, with that sort of Thai
influence there with his flavours.

769
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,240
But it worked, didn't it? It was
really odd, but it did work.

770
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,640
And Matty did OK. Josh did OK.
I think Josh did OK.

771
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,600
I think what we've got here,
we've got a split.

772
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,480
I think the girls are in trouble and
the lads are safer than the girls.

773
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,800
Even Tasha? I'm devastated.

774
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,120
She's middling, but Saku
and Cristy are in a worse position.

775
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,280
It's going to make
the show stopper exciting, I think.

776
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,760
Some of them will come out fighting

777
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,400
and some of them will be
demoralised.

778
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,640
Did I roast them a bit too much?
No. Yes.

779
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,680
A little bit.

780
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,400
Hello, bakers. Welcome back to
the tent.

781
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,760
And well done for getting to

782
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,000
the show stopper on Dessert Week
without running away.

783
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,240
Yes, there's certainly been no
deserters just yet, has there, Noel?

784
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,240
No, but it was touch-and-go
yesterday.

785
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,160
It certainly was. It certainly was.

786
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,320
So for your show stopper challenge,

787
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,880
the judges would like you to make

788
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,840
a sharing size dessert which is
encased within

789
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,560
a highly decorative meringue bombe.

790
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,320
Now that is a bombe with an "e".

791
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,440
I don't want any explosions in
the tent.

792
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,560
And I, for one, don't want to be
picking meringue out of

793
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,080
my barnet all day tomorrow.
That's very true.

794
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,880
You have four hours until we dispose
your bombes by yamming them down.

795
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,400
On your marks. Get set.
Bake!

796
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
This is the worst challenge yet.

797
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,920
My practice ones have not been
successful. I'm pooing myself.

798
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,600
The biggest challenge is going to
be making the meringue bombe itself.

799
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,040
I've done nine million meringues
this week and two worked.

800
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,720
It lives up to its name of a bombe.

801
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,480
It's a high-risk one, innit.
And potentially the last.

802
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,160
What we're asking for is
a meringue bombe.

803
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,840
It looks like a sphere,

804
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,280
and inside it any kind of
dessert they like.

805
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,040
The meringue itself is probably

806
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,600
going to be French meringue

807
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,640
because it's stable
and it's strong.

808
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,520
So French meringue is essentially
whisked egg whites with sugar.

809
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,200
And getting nice, hopefully glossy,
stiff peaks.

810
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,560
That's what I'm hoping for.

811
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,960
We've asked for a bombe shape,

812
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,280
so we're testing them on their
meringue engineering skills.

813
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,360
The most obvious is to use a mould.

814
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,760
The bakers will do it in two halves.

815
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,400
There's a terrific danger that
they'll crack.

816
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,400
Now this is dessert week,
so we are expecting mousse,

817
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,920
creams, creme diplomats,
sponge, chocolate,

818
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,080
anything that they wish,
but they must taste

819
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,680
and work amazingly well together.

820
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,960
I am making the choux buns
first, vigorously!

821
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
First thing we're going for is
a genoise sponge.

822
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,720
Once that's out the oven it frees it
up to be used for the meringue.

823
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,080
Of course it's someone's last bake.

824
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,920
After the Technical Challenge we
are expecting perfection.

825
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,080
We can't have Mr Hollywood
disappointed again.

826
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,720
He gets very bad-tempered when
he's disappointed.

827
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,480
Hi, Matty. Good morning.
Hello, Matty. Morning.

828
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,800
Tell us all about your
meringue bombe.

829
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,680
Well, I'm hoping to produce
something slightly better

830
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,320
than yesterday. Well, that'd be
good.

831
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,880
Baked would be good.
Something edible.

832
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,960
I thought I'll push the boat out and
do something a bit weird.

833
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,120
So pistachio, strawberry and basil,
so it's kind of like

834
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,200
a fusion between English summer
and Italian summer. Nice.

835
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,760
A summer sandwich cake
of pistachio cremeux

836
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,440
and strawberry and basil compote

837
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,960
mousse will sit inside
Matty's French meringue bombe.

838
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,400
I'm really concerned about
the meringue. Is it stable?

839
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,760
Icing sugar's also going in.

840
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,080
Makes it a little bit more dense,
so that hopefully it holds itself.

841
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,040
OK, well, you seem to know what
you're talking about.

842
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,080
But there again, what does
that mean?

843
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,680
You see, I've lost all faith,
you see.

844
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,520
You've got to build me back
up again.

845
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,240
Yep, yep, stiff peaks.

846
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,680
Got to do the old Bake Off thing,
haven't I?

847
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,920
Just going to put my meringue
mixture into the moulds.

848
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,520
And you don't make meringue bombes
every day, do you?

849
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,960
No, there's a reason for that.
Why?

850
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,040
They're hard.

851
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,080
This is make or break now.

852
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,960
With a spherical shape and weight of
a dessert to support...

853
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,680
I'm literally shaking.

854
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,840
..it's essential the bakers produce
strong meringue shells.

855
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,560
It's got to take quite a weight.
It's quite a big bombe, this one.

856
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,120
Any imperfections or thin
areas now...

857
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,760
Get it as even as possible.

858
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,880
..could cause cracks
and weaknesses later.

859
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,200
I've got an extra mould in case
one's cracks are too deep to mend.

860
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,640
Oh, I hope it will come in
one piece.

861
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,880
My meringue bombe today is called
the Pale Blue Dot,

862
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
based on our humble little home,
the Earth.

863
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,120
We're just basically suspended in
a galaxy.

864
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,280
All our little woes
and worries in the tent are

865
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,120
insignificant in the grand scheme of
the universe, isn't it?

866
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,720
{\an8}Beneath an Earth's crust
of chocolate genoise,

867
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,440
{\an7}Dan's trifle consists
of orange creme pat,

868
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,960
{\an7}strawberry bavarois,

869
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
{\an7}and his Earth's core

870
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,600
{\an7}of raspberry jelly.

871
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,200
These layers are quite moist.

872
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,400
So are they not going to make your
meringue too soggy?

873
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,640
That's why I've sort of put
the sponge on the outside, as

874
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,080
a bit of a barrier as well.

875
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,640
So I've tried to use really light
sort of mousses

876
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,480
and things, but I have found when
I made it, it was still quite heavy.

877
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,560
Yes. And I think with my big pie
fingers,

878
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,920
I just need to be really delicate
with the moving around of it.

879
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,000
What you going to do with your big
fingers? Well, I need

880
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,080
to turn these into patisserie
delicate fingers,

881
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,440
but I sometimes struggle with that.
Good luck, sounds good.

882
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,400
OK, thank you very much, cheers.

883
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,520
While Dan gets on
with his blue dot...

884
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,200
Just piped Macclesfield,
glorious Cheshire.

885
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,080
..Josh's aim is fixed on
a small green ball.

886
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,240
So summer months I love
to watch Wimbledon

887
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,560
and play a bit of tennis.

888
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,960
And I've got home-grown
strawberries off the garden,

889
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,320
so strawberries and cream is
the flavours.

890
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,080
It's a match made in heaven.

891
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,960
Within his tennis-themed bombe,

892
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,240
Josh will be serving up his

893
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,280
cheesecake of mascarpone whipped
cream

894
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,800
with a touch of champagne,

895
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,040
sandwiched by layers of strawberry
mousse and strawberry jam.

896
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,520
It's going to be a green ball.

897
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,600
I'm going to put, like, tennis
balls, tennis rackets,

898
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,440
strawberries on there. I'm going in.

899
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,520
I think I can fit both in at
the same time.

900
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,360
Right, meringue, it's been nice
knowing you.

901
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,360
Bake meringues low and slow.

902
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,920
Thank God they're in.

903
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,080
So I'm doing mine at 110 for
1 hour and 45 minutes.

904
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,000
That's going in for an hour
and a half.

905
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,520
But while everyone else is baking

906
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,440
both halves of their
bombes together...

907
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,640
One in the oven.

908
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,640
..Saku has decided
to bake hers separately.

909
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,520
I don't want to bake both together,
so I'm making the base later.

910
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,560
It is a flower bonnet.
There will be bees.

911
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,840
My bee is my son. He is Binera.

912
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,840
In short we all call him bee,
the buzzing bee.

913
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,960
Sometimes he's a pain in the bottom,
just like buzzing everywhere. Yeah.

914
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,680
Marzipan bumblebees will buzz around
Saku's flowery bombe,

915
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,440
and inside will be two flavours
of profiteroles,

916
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,960
passion fruit creme pat,

917
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,240
and pistachio and Irish cream.

918
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,000
Saku, yesterday you let me down.

919
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,200
Let it go. Please, let it go.

920
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,120
Exactly. Please, let it go?
Yes.

921
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,680
All right, then. Saku.
You're joking, aren't you?

922
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,960
That's too early!

923
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,400
Right, then. There's so much going
on. I've got to get another bowl.

924
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,320
I'm absolutely rinsing
the bowls already.

925
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,760
With their bombes away
and the time a-ticking...

926
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,440
Cannot relax. There's no time for
relaxing in this game, is there?

927
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,000
..the bakers must multi-task if
they're to create

928
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,840
the multitude of elements they'll
need for their dessert.

929
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,920
Speed baking... Speed merchant
for sponges, meringues, mousses.

930
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,920
These are the strawberries, they're
off my garden.

931
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,120
So these are going to be used for
multiple things. I've got

932
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,880
a jam base. I'm also going to make
a strawberry mousse on the top.

933
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,680
Just strawberries and basil for the
compote. Also goes into the mousse.

934
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,600
Raspberry puree, it is going to be

935
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,640
the molten core, so I need to get
these frozen quick.

936
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,760
Making a little hole at the bum.
If not it will collapse.

937
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
Little bum hole.

938
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,160
Hi, Tasha. Hello.
How's it going?

939
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,400
It's OK. I'm keeping it
simple-ish today.

940
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,960
I'm going with plum, ginger.

941
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,760
Paul, ginger... Paul, ginger? Yeah,
you don't want to override the...

942
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,840
Plum and ginger.
Not Paul and ginger.

943
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,440
That would be interesting,
wouldn't it?

944
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,480
I wonder what he'd actually
taste like in a bake.

945
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,960
Bet it would look good, but it would
be sour.

946
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,080
Branches of pink plum blossom will
wrap around

947
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,040
Tasha's bombe containing profiterole
plums, filled

948
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,880
with plum and ginger creme diplomat,
and topped with plum craquelin.

949
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,840
Choux pastry is a lot of arm
strength, which I don't have.

950
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,040
But Tasha isn't the only baker
filling their bombe

951
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,160
with choux pastry.

952
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,640
Just going to get my bits ready for
the choux buns.

953
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,080
There's pressure when other people
are doing the same thing,

954
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,680
which I'm thrilled about.

955
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,760
But Cristy is hoping to make her
profiteroles stand out

956
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,600
by making them stand up.

957
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,720
So I'm doing a little
mini croquembouche.

958
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
A mini croquembouche? Yes.

959
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,840
And then how's the meringue fitting
over the top of that?

960
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,600
The lid on top sort of domes over.

961
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,120
Cristy will really be hoping
to spoil the judges with

962
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,960
a croquembouche of summer berry
creme diplomat

963
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,960
protruding from a bombe covered in
multicoloured meringue kisses.

964
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,600
The kisses only take an hour.

965
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,200
So I'm going to make some
royal icing

966
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,720
and construct it like that all
round. Oh, you're going to stick

967
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,200
them on with royal icing? Yeah.

968
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,680
So it'll be sort of spiky?
Yeah.

969
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,440
Oh, lovely, it sounds quite modern.

970
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,720
Do you think this is going to help
or hinder your bake?

971
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,560
Are you going to keep that on
all day?

972
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,960
Bakers, you are halfway through.

973
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,840
Come on, meringue!

974
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,120
Mine's all cracking.

975
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,160
Round the sides, it's all come up
and left it all behind.

976
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,720
You seem so chilled out today.
I'm not going to be chilled if those

977
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,160
meringues don't work when they come
out. So what happens if these

978
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,880
meringues don't work? We panic.

979
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,440
Would that be the worst thing that
could happen? Yeah.

980
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,560
Right, OK, do you know what?
I'm going to get them out.

981
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,520
Oh, I'm so worried.

982
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,120
Yeah, they look good.
That one looks good.

983
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,640
Oh, he can use an oven!

984
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,720
Oh, not great, if I'm honest.

985
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,840
Oh, my gosh.

986
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,000
It's properly cracked.

987
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,960
I feel sick. I'm nervous.

988
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,520
Demoulding the spheres is
scary.

989
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,240
A steady hand is critical...

990
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,800
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.
Don't rush.

991
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,800
..as the smallest fracture line
could result

992
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,160
in a bombe shell explosion.

993
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,840
It's a delicate little petal,
that is.

994
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,560
Oh, it's cracking like a good 'un.

995
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,400
This one looks really nice.

996
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,360
It didn't crack.

997
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,680
Very, very thin there.
It's like a meteor's hit it.

998
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,920
Thank you, Lord Jesus. Ah!

999
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,120
{\an1}CRACKING, GASPING

1000
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,240
Oh, my God.

1001
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,600
The same is going to happen to
the others.

1002
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,880
{\an1}SHE SIGHS

1003
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
Oh, my God.

1004
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,400
I've got one, I've got one,
haven't I?

1005
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,360
It looks like a cave or something.

1006
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,400
{\an8}I'm not taking any chances.
I'm going to cut it.

1007
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,440
If two crack, then it wasn't
meant to be.

1008
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,520
It's just cracked on the inside,
not the outside,

1009
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,360
but I'm going to weld it up
with the royal icing.

1010
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,560
{\an1}LAUGHTER

1011
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,240
This is fine, this one's fine.

1012
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,400
Ooh, look at your domes.
They're good, right?

1013
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,040
Yeah, I know. They're out,
thankfully.

1014
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,000
Come on, let's show those judges.
Yeah.

1015
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,040
Let's go bang!
Put that in your pipe, Hollywood.

1016
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,400
This is the next layer on
my dessert,

1017
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,560
mascarpone and champagne filling.

1018
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,480
But while everyone else finishes off
their dessert elements...

1019
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,960
The choux needs to get in the oven
as quickly as I can get it.

1020
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,440
..Saku still has half a bombe
to bake.

1021
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,280
Uh, now I'm making
the second lot of meringue.

1022
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,880
This is the base. Oh, now I am
running behind.

1023
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,440
You couldn't break those now,
could you?

1024
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,560
Don't touch them, Noel. Don't joke.
What sort of weight could they take?

1025
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,400
A squirrel? Stop it.

1026
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,440
A gerbil? A large otter? Stop it.

1027
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,880
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

1028
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,480
I can't worry, I can't panic.

1029
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,960
It's too fiddly for panicking.

1030
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,320
I'm just using the royal icing that
I've made to just stick them all on.

1031
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,480
So I'm just piping some tennis balls
on to here.

1032
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,440
Are you making bumblebees?
I love that guy.

1033
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,520
That's queen bee. Oh, queen bee.
Ah!

1034
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,560
That's her crown. Come on.
I thought it was her lips.

1035
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,160
I thought that bee was pouting.

1036
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,920
That's the storm brewing from
the south pole, that is.

1037
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,840
So meringue bombes, Prue.

1038
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,760
I do think that all
of them sound absolutely delicious.

1039
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,560
It comes down to that meringue.

1040
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,000
This will strengthen it up.

1041
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,120
Matty and Dan's got
the trickiest position.

1042
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,800
They've all got so many layers.
Just trying to line my meringue,

1043
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,960
the Earth's crust.

1044
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,520
And those things are quite moussey.
They're mostly liquid. Yeah.

1045
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,560
What you don't want it anything too
wet touching the meringue.

1046
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,240
A few of them are using the choux.

1047
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,200
They're clever enough to put their
mixtures inside choux pastry.

1048
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,080
But they actually weigh a ton.
Yeah.

1049
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,680
I think there's a good danger that
all of them could collapse.

1050
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,120
It's quite a difficult challenge.

1051
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,840
Yeah, we want to see some good
baking. No mess ups today.

1052
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,680
And no talking about yesterday.

1053
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,720
No. OK, then.

1054
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,880
It was bad, though, wasn't it?

1055
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,920
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

1056
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,360
It's the molten core of the Earth.

1057
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,560
That'll sit in there, and my dessert
should be able to just sit in there.

1058
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,640
Now worries whether baking time
will be enough.

1059
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,320
If I take it too early,
it will crack.

1060
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,760
It's cracked all the way through.
Doesn't want to hold.

1061
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,000
I'm just going to have to prop
it up, aren't I?

1062
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,360
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

1063
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,840
NOEL WHISTLES
I'm going as fast as I can!

1064
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,040
I think we've got
the look of Wimbledon here.

1065
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,320
I'm going to forget about
the croquembouche.

1066
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,800
My health's more important
than Paul.

1067
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,080
Oh, God, maybe I've gone
a layer too high.

1068
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,520
Jesus Christ.

1069
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,040
Ah!

1070
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,000
Ah, I ruined it.

1071
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,040
All cracked.

1072
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,200
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1073
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,720
He's going to expect a flipping
croquembouche, and he's going to

1074
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,320
lift it up and see this.

1075
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,400
Lid's going on.

1076
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,680
I think it's collapsing.

1077
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,640
I'm just waiting for it to break,
basically.

1078
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,120
Heartbreaking.

1079
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,760
Bakers, your time is up.

1080
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,880
Step away from your show stoppers.

1081
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,800
It's not going to stay on its own.

1082
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,200
It's just too spherical.

1083
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,320
Well done, everyone.

1084
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,240
Well done. I'm proud of ya.

1085
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,120
No-one's coming in on that clap,
are they?

1086
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,720
Oh, God.

1087
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,320
Oh, I'm so glad it's done, though.

1088
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,080
Really tough gig, that.

1089
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,840
That was revolting.

1090
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,720
{\an8}Six meringue bombes ready
to explode.

1091
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,240
{\an8}But will the judges be blown away?

1092
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,720
It's show stopper time for our
Josh.

1093
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,560
Well, I must say,
the piping is excellent

1094
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,280
and the idea is original,
and it's beautifully done.

1095
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,320
And that is a proper dessert inside.

1096
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,840
Now it just has to taste good.

1097
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,240
Isn't that a little triumph?

1098
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,880
So you've got a shortcake base,
strawberry jam,

1099
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,920
mascarpone and whipped cream
filling,

1100
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,320
and then you've got
a strawberry mousse on top.

1101
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,440
Well, Josh, I'll tell you what,
if Wimbledon did strawberries

1102
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,880
and cream like that,
it would be fantastic.

1103
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,200
The jam gives it a nice strawberry
acidic kick.

1104
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,160
It's delicious. I think you've
created something very beautiful

1105
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,280
indeed. Well done, Josh.
Well done, Josh.

1106
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,680
Well done, buddy.

1107
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,640
I think the plum blossom is
so sweet, lovely.

1108
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,480
It does join and it is a ball.

1109
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,560
Which is not easy to do.
And the decoration,

1110
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,160
I quite like on it. Let's have
a look. Oh, my goodness. Mm!

1111
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,120
A little bowl of buns.
With craquelin on top.

1112
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,120
The craquelin's quite effective,
isn't it? Yeah.

1113
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,320
Inside we've got plum
and ginger creme diplomat.

1114
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,080
On their own it's
a slightly acidic flavour.

1115
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,400
Together with the meringue,
it does work beautiful.

1116
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,280
The idea of a bombe is you eat
a bit of the meringue as well.

1117
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,760
I like it. It's not too sweet
inside.

1118
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,720
Well done, Tasha. Thank you
very much.

1119
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,080
You know, I think
the look of it is really very good.

1120
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,800
It's quite artistic, colourful.
Yeah.

1121
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,880
Wow. The bombe itself is nice.
Inside looks a bit...

1122
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,800
Well, I say a bit. It's a lot messy.
Yeah.

1123
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,040
Maybe we'll take that bit off there.

1124
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,160
Inside is strawberry
and basil mousse,

1125
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,480
pistachio cremeux,

1126
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:07,040
strawberry and basil compote,
and pistachio genoise sponge.

1127
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:11,120
Somehow the pistachio flavour is too
rich and heavy.

1128
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,720
The basil, I'm not quite sure
I like it... OK.

1129
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,200
..with the strawberry. Yeah.

1130
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,400
The meringue is very good.

1131
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,280
I think this outside is a little
triumph.

1132
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,360
Thank you, Matty.
Thank you.

1133
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,800
I think the whole thing
looks really pretty.

1134
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,200
A little bit like a bee hive.

1135
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,440
You struggled a bit with
the base cos you've got... Yeah, mm.

1136
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,800
..several pieces because it's just..
It blasted.

1137
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,560
It's just... Now it's
blasted, yeah.

1138
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,200
It's not much of a bombe, though.

1139
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,160
It's just a few choux buns sitting
in the middle of a stand.

1140
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,400
The dark chocolate, it is pistachio
and Irish cream.

1141
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,560
And with the white chocolate,
it's passion fruit curd.

1142
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,240
The choux buns don't look good.

1143
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,400
They're a little bit flat.
You do get the Irish liqueur.

1144
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,040
It's just not strong enough.

1145
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,800
There are elements that are
really good.

1146
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,680
You just needed to do
a bit more on flavour.

1147
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,320
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1148
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,200
It's an amazingly, wonderfully

1149
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,040
ambitious thing to get
the entire world...

1150
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,640
In a meringue. ..in a meringue.

1151
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,720
Overall, I think you've created
a nice shape.

1152
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,440
There's a nice dome to that.

1153
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,640
I'll just have a quick look inside.
Oh, OK, there you go.

1154
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,080
Yep. Oh, right.
OK. That's very clever.

1155
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,080
So it is a trifle with
chocolate genoise sponge,

1156
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,640
orange creme patisserie,
a strawberry bavarois,

1157
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,440
and raspberry jelly sphere for
the middle of the Earth.

1158
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,640
I love the layers to it, cos you've
got a sharpness certainly

1159
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,800
to the jelly in the middle.

1160
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,840
The sponge on the outside is
delicious as well.

1161
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,440
The whole thing works together
lovely,

1162
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,080
and I think you've created a lovely
trifle in the centre of the Earth.

1163
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,120
What's wrong with that?
Nothing. Well done.

1164
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,080
Ah, that's great,
thank you very much.

1165
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,200
Well done!

1166
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,920
Well, you're not ever going to
expect me not to like

1167
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,120
the look of that.

1168
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,280
Colours are amazing.

1169
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,240
Quite impressive looking at that
on the outside.

1170
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,040
Can I just say something?
A bombe is nice if it's round.

1171
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,120
Do you know what? We can move them
away now.

1172
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,320
And I think it's more impressive
like that.

1173
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,760
Looks like the bombe's already
gone off.

1174
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,120
That is a bit of a mess inside.
What is that?

1175
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,920
It's actually profiteroles,
not a croquembouche.

1176
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,000
And they're filled with
a creme diplomat with berry coulis.

1177
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,080
There's too much icing, too sweet.
OK.

1178
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,320
But I love the filling.
It's nice and sharp.

1179
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,680
I think you've let yourself down
a lot with that interior.

1180
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,400
It's like the middle
wasn't important.

1181
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,680
You just chucked something in.

1182
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,720
But from the outside,
it's fantastic.

1183
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,280
Sometimes you do get pretty things
who are ugly on the inside.

1184
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,080
Oh, no!

1185
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,400
It was tough.

1186
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,640
I don't really think I've done
enough to stay in.

1187
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,640
I'd be just on the cusp
of getting into

1188
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,120
the quarterfinals. I would be
disappointed.

1189
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,240
It went better than I could ever
have hoped for,

1190
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,880
to be honest, so I've had
the biggest smile on my face.

1191
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,160
I was really pleased with that.
That went really,

1192
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,800
really well, didn't it?

1193
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,400
My meringue cracked

1194
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,040
and they didn't get
the flavour from the profiteroles.

1195
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,560
You are in danger!

1196
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,440
{\an8}Well, were you blown away by
the bombes?

1197
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,720
{\an8}Were they the comeback kids after
their technical?

1198
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,720
{\an8}Josh was my comeback kid.
That strawberry cake was beautiful.

1199
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,160
It was. Nice to see Dan come back
again this week.

1200
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,600
You opened up the Earth's core

1201
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,880
and you saw layers on layers on
layers. A very pretty design.

1202
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,760
And all beautifully
concentric, yeah.

1203
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,240
Both those guys are in line for
Star Baker. And Cristy and Saku...

1204
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,480
In real danger. ..I think one of
those two will be going home.

1205
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,280
Saku, she had no base at all.

1206
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,520
It was literally just like a cloche
over half a dozen choux buns.

1207
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,800
I wouldn't have minded that.

1208
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:08,480
The problem with Saku has been not
enough oomph in her flavours.

1209
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,000
Yeah. Where did Cristy go wrong, cos
it looked incredible, didn't it?

1210
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,040
Looks can be deceiving. That's very
true.

1211
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,000
Style above substance, cos it wasn't
very nice inside.

1212
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,920
Yeah. I think I prefer style
over substance.

1213
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,440
That's why you're not a judge.

1214
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,040
Well done, bakers,
for getting through Dessert Week.

1215
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:35,440
I've got the amazing
job of announcing Star Baker.

1216
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,120
The judges really struggled
with this one.

1217
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,520
Today's Star Baker is...

1218
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,640
..Dan.

1219
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,280
{\an1}APPLAUSE

1220
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,240
That means I've got the horrible
and really hard job,

1221
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,880
but the baker who is leaving us
this week is...

1222
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,800
..Saku.

1223
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,560
That's fine.

1224
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,600
I'm so proud of myself.

1225
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,160
We're going to miss you so much!

1226
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,920
I don't miss baking,
but I will miss them.

1227
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,680
It's really sad to leave them.

1228
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:23,480
It's a privilege to be
a part of this lovely family.

1229
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,640
Well done, Dan.
Very close, I'm sure.

1230
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,200
Thank you very much, Prue.
Appreciate it. It was really good.

1231
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,560
Nothing in it between me
and Josh, by the sounds of things.

1232
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,520
And he's a phenomenal baker,
so just to edge past him this week,

1233
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,720
it filled me with loads
of confidence and I'm super happy.

1234
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,480
I think my wife will be super
surprised.

1235
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,600
I genuinely thought I was going.

1236
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,600
I'm made up. To be able to say
you're a Bake Off quarterfinalist...

1237
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,840
I'm in the quarterfinal.

1238
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,640
Oh, my God.

1239
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,640
Can't believe it at all. To think
how far we've all come

1240
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,880
since that week one.
It's absolutely amazing.

1241
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,200
{\an1}PHONE RINGS

1242
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,560
VOICEMAIL: Welcome to the...

1243
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,840
She clearly wasn't expecting me
to get Star Baker today, was she?

1244
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,640
Next time...
I'm running around the tent!

1245
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,920
..it's the quarterfinals...

1246
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,800
PARTY HORN
..and Party Week.

1247
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,000
Go, go, go.

1248
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,880
The bakers take on Paul's all-time
favourite signature...

1249
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,120
This better be good.

1250
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,960
..an insect-inspired technical...

1251
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,080
I forgot to pipe antennas. Idiot.

1252
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,280
..and a huge...

1253
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,200
I'm behind time.
It need to be proving ages ago.

1254
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,080
This is the hardest I've
had to work.

1255
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,640
..multicoloured showstopper.

1256
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,040
Bakers, you've had four hours.

1257
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,520
It's a big bake, isn't it?
It's too big for me.

1258
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,960
