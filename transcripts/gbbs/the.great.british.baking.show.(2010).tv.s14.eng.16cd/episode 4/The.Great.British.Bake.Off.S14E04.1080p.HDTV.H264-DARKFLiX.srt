1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,855
Hey, it's chocolate week here on
The Great British Bake Off.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,415
My mum always used to say...

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,855
IMITATES FORREST GUMP:
Life is like a box of chocolates.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,815
She was from Bristol, I think.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,735
But the thing is
life is meant to be enjoyed.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,095
But all the better if you share it
with someone else.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,495
Noel, I'm not ready to share my life
with anyone.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,255
Just a little bit? welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,815
Come on, give me of those life
nuggets.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,655
Get your own life,
you little shrimp.

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,095
THEY LAUGH

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,815
Last time...

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,375
CLATTERING AND GASPING

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,335
the bakers battled on
Hollywood's home turf.

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,295
Chuff tog heck, this is a bit high
pressure.

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,655
And while Tasha's
stunning Showstopper...

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,015
You understand bread
and I like that. Wow.

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,855
Secured her second Star Baker...

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,175
I think that's a bit under.

20
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,895
Dan's was a disaster.

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,215
Absolute shocker. It's a bit flat,
innit.

22
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,775
But Abbi's stodgy Showstopper...

23
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,895
It's a bit dense.

24
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,375
Sealed her fate and she became
the third baker to leave the tent.

25
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,696
I'm going to remember it every day
for the rest of my life.

26
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,055
This time...

27
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,535
it's chocolate week.

28
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,895
I hate white chocolate,
it's the bane of my existence.

29
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,575
The bakers take on a torte in
the signature...

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,855
This looks horrible, don't it?

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,815
Tackle a high temperature
technical...

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,735
Melting, melting, melting.

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,655
And are pushed to their breaking
points...

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,695
Oh, dearie me.

35
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,735
In a chocolate box Showstopper.

36
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,495
My heart is breaking right now.

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,815
Oh, God.

38
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,895
I am stressing now.

39
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
Is Tash all right?

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,535
Take as much time as you need,
all right? OK.

41
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,815
The hottest day of the year
so far for chocolate,

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,775
and every year when they do
Bake Off it always happens.

43
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,695
There will be a lot
of fridge freezer trips.

44
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,935
You'll probably just end up seeing
me in the fridge, I can guarantee.

45
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,335
Chocolate's the thing that I reach
for when I'm...

46
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,095
When I'm stressed or upset.

47
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,015
The things that you love the most
hurt you the most.

48
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,535
I absolutely love eating chocolate,

49
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,015
but to work with it is horrible.
It's so messy,

50
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,295
it's so temperamental.

51
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,895
I don't know about chocolate.
I will have a meltdown.

52
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,655
Hello, kids, welcome back to
the tent. And this week, it is...

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,495
I can't remember. What is it
this week?

54
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,975
♪ You're sweet like chocolate

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,775
♪ Boy! ♪

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,215
That's right. It's chocolate
week, kids.

57
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,975
So for your chocolate week
signature, Paul

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,535
and Prue would like you to make

59
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,455
a luxurious chocolate torte made
without wheat flour.

60
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,975
Now they say some things can't be
torte, but this one must be.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,975
You've got two and a half hours.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,575
On your marks. Get set.

63
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,815
♪ Bake! ♪

64
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,175
My children, they love chocolate,

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,455
they love eating chocolate torte,
so I am making for them.

66
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,055
What is the difference between torte
and a cake?

67
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,456
You're asking the wrong person.
I'm going to go and find Prue.

68
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,855
Yeah, find Prue.

69
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,335
When we think of a torte
it's usually quite a rich cake,

70
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,255
a bit more dense and luxurious.

71
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,615
And that is what we want
the bakers to think of,

72
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,895
but it must not have any wheat
flour in it.

73
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,335
So they could use chestnut,
they can use ground almonds,

74
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,615
whatever they wish,

75
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,975
but it tends to make
the cake quite heavy.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,696
And so the bakers have got to be
really careful on

77
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,055
the fillings. Something light,
raspberries, strawberries, fruits.

78
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,575
It's an opportunity for the bakers

79
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,375
to show off their piping skills,
their spinning skills,

80
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,935
their moulding skills.

81
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,215
They can show off a bit.
And they should.

82
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,295
Morning, Saku. Good morning.
Hello, Saku. Good morning.

83
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,175
Saku, tell us all about your
chocolate torte.

84
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,055
I am making a Saku torte.

85
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,615
A Saku torte? Yes.

86
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,575
Of course you are. So what's in
that?

87
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,295
It's like sachertorte,

88
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,935
but instead of apricot jam
I am using a raspberry jam.

89
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,215
Instead of writing "sacher”
I am going to...

90
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,735
Write "Saku". "Saku!"

91
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,935
Saku's personalised twist on

92
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,895
the classic sachertorte will see

93
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,415
raspberry jam sandwiched between

94
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,935
cakes of dark chocolate

95
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,455
and ground almond, finished

96
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,095
with her own name hand-piped

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,815
onto dark chocolate ganache.

98
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,575
I practised three times.

99
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,735
The first time the writing went
horribly wrong. Right.

100
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,095
Where do you practise?
At your house? Yes.

101
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,415
In the middle of the night?
Around half one,

102
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,735
two o'clock. Yeah, early hours.

103
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,215
At one in the morning you're
baking... Yeah. That's fine.

104
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,255
Saku torte?

105
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,135
LAUGHTER

106
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,015
I'm popping my ground almonds into
my chocolate and egg yolks.

107
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,575
Whichever wheat flour alternative
the bakers have chosen

108
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,895
will change the flavour and texture
of the chocolate torte.

109
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,256
I'm using ground hazelnuts
and I'm also putting some cornmeal

110
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,975
in it as well. It just adds a bit of
a denser texture to the torte.

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,255
And while ground almonds are

112
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,615
the most popular choice in
the tent...

113
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,936
I think that's quite typical for
a torte.

114
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,855
If it's not broken, don't try
and fix it.

115
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,215
Not all the bakers are playing
it safe.

116
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,895
For the torte itself I'm using
ground pecans. Ground pecans?

117
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,655
They obviously let out
a little bit of oil.

118
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,256
I grind them, actually, one to one
with icing sugar, and that way I get

119
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,576
a nice crumb mixture that's very
similar to ground almonds.

120
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,775
That's really interesting.

121
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,335
If you're grinding your own nuts,
it's always difficult.

122
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,415
And painful.

123
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,495
Grind them up quick.
Less pain that way.

124
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,295
PRUE: You boys are just disgusting.

125
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,935
Josh's pecan-based torte will layer
chocolate cremeux,

126
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,695
raspberry Chantilly cream
and fresh raspberries from his

127
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,695
garden, surrounded by delicately
piped chocolate leaves.

128
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,455
Chocolate and pecans and raspberry,
they are

129
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,415
a very classic combination.
I've not seen

130
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,855
the pecans get used in the sponge
before, so I hope they like it.

131
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,375
This looks horrible, don't it?

132
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,335
Josh isn't the only baker taking
a risk.

133
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,695
What are you using in there instead
of flour?

134
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,175
Uh, egg whites, it's just relying on
egg whites, no flour.

135
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,495
Well, that's my favourite to mix,
I love that. It's so light.

136
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,855
But it's difficult not for it
to squash down.

137
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,215
If you pull it off, it'll
be perfect.

138
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,055
Hoping to perfect a flawless
flour less sponge,

139
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,935
Rowan's adding espresso
and cocoa powder,

140
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,575
and he's giving his torte
an extra caffeine kick with

141
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,215
a coffee Swiss meringue
butter cream filling.

142
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,655
I'm a coffee fiend.

143
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,695
I can't function as an adult without
my four espressos.

144
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,335
Honestly, my heart's going to
explode just from the coffee alone.

145
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,655
Whilst Rowan's getting his
daily fix...

146
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,736
Pour an extra bit in for Prue.

147
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,455
Dan's starting chocolate week...

148
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,535
Tickety-boo!

149
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,495
With something a little stronger.

150
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,375
So I'm going for
a Mexican torte this week.

151
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,695
I'm putting a Mexican liqueur in
there which is

152
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,015
a guanabana fruit.

153
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,936
And you can have a little taste if
you'd like to?

154
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,655
I think it's a bit too early,
even for me.

155
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,815
Dan's boozy Mexican torte will
combine hazelnuts,

156
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,175
dark chocolate
and guanabana liqueur,

157
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,655
topped with fresh fruit
and chilli chocolate truffles,

158
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,735
he's hoping to tickle
the judges' taste buds.

159
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,895
I think after last week I'd like
to see the old Dan come back.

160
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,255
I have sort of reset after
last week.

161
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,215
What did you do? Got naked,
looked in a mirror,

162
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,735
top of the mountain, tai chi? Yeah.

163
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,535
Thanks, Dan. Head band. Bantz.
Thank you very much. Cheers.

164
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,455
While it might be too early
for Prue,

165
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,975
Dan's found another drinking buddy.

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,655
I'm doing a ginger torte with
a good amount of booze.

167
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,975
So I've got amaretto and ginger wine
inside the torte.

168
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,695
Weird combination on its own,
but in cake it works really well.

169
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,455
Tasha's unusual ginger cocktail
will be combined

170
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,815
with dark chocolate
and ground almonds.

171
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,255
And for an even stronger spice kick,
she'll decorate

172
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,535
the torte with piped praline ganache

173
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,135
and ginger mascarpone kisses.

174
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,535
Twice Star Baker.

175
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,495
I mean, that's a big thing.
Yeah.

176
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,015
And what I like about this is you're
really pushing

177
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,335
the boat out, cos to put ginger with
chocolate is clever.

178
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,695
A little bit risky as well.
And to get that balance.

179
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,215
You're just piling on
the pressure, Paul. Yeah.

180
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
Oh, my goodness.

181
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,095
So I'm just now folding in
the French meringue.

182
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,935
To avoid serving
a flat dense torte...

183
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,815
This is quite a crucial stage.

184
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,455
Cos it's flour less, you're relying
on the egg whites, really.

185
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,295
The bakers must fully incorporate
all of the whisked egg whites.

186
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,695
To try and combat that density which
is just inherent to a torte.

187
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,015
But over mix and the torte won't
rise when baked.

188
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,015
I have practised this.
The first time it went great.

189
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,895
The second time it collapsed.
So now we're on to the third time.

190
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,255
Dana's towering three-layered
almond-based torte will be filled

191
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,455
with cherry compote, white chocolate
mascarpone butter cream

192
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,295
and candied almonds.

193
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,015
Is it going to taste
of cherry chocolate?

194
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,456
I hope so, there's a cherry compote
in the middle. You paused.

195
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,415
Why did you pause?
Cos I don't like tortes.

196
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,775
I haven't actually tasted
it myself.

197
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,175
Good luck. Thanks.
Good luck with this one. I know!

198
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,055
In on 160. It's in.

199
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,895
Bake well, be good.

200
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,255
Because it's nuts, it's
a bit dense.

201
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,295
It takes ages to bake, like 50
minutes.

202
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,975
While their chocolate tortes may be
slow to bake...

203
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,895
Till then I will make the jam.

204
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,855
The bakers have no time to lose

205
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,895
making their light flavourful
fillings.

206
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,175
So I'm making a cherry brandy
cream filling.

207
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,135
When I was younger my mum,
after Sunday lunch, used

208
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,495
to always buy a black forest
gateaux,

209
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,495
so I sort of got the inspiration
from that.

210
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,055
Recreating her favourite childhood
flavours,

211
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,455
Cristy's almond, chocolate and
cherry torte will be updated with

212
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,415
a cherry brandy Chantilly cream,

213
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,255
and finished with a white chocolate
collar and intricate decorations.

214
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,615
I've got a mould,
it's just getting them out.

215
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,455
I had a bit of a
nightmare at home. Yeah,

216
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,015
I just hope it works in the tent.

217
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,295
Yeah, I know.

218
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,615
Quite tricky. I'm going to make
a few.

219
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,735
Right, OK. A selection.

220
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,095
So we're making mousse with

221
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,775
a little bit of praline going
through it,

222
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,095
and then a chocolate cremeux
and a glaze.

223
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,015
Hopefully I'm not doing too much.

224
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,695
Matty's ambitious torte will be
topped with a chocolate

225
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,735
and hazelnut praline mousse
and chocolate cremeux,

226
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,095
all coated in a chocolate
mirror glaze.

227
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,015
He's hopeful a crown of carefully
tempered

228
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,335
chocolate shards will give him
the edge.

229
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,815
So now we're on to the cremeux.

230
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,695
Are you on time? I think so.

231
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,616
Check you out. You're like
a proper professional.

232
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,975
This is your week, innit, this week?
Stop saying that.

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,255
You said that last week
and it was an absolute calamity.

234
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,255
Praline white chocolate ganache.
That can start setting.

235
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,695
Unless each element is
set completely...

236
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,015
Have to make my ganache and get it
cool in time,

237
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,975
ready for when I do the assembly.

238
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,135
Once assembled the tortes will
slump and sag.

239
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,495
It's all about chilling it,
that's the main thing.

240
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,295
But for Nicky, getting her mousse
right is make or break.

241
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,735
It's going to have a chocolate
almond torte on top and it's got...

242
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,695
On the top? On the top.
That's brave, isn't it?

243
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,255
It is brave.
This is a wild and crazy time.

244
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,615
Have you tested this, Nicky?
I have.

245
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,775
A couple of times and it's set.

246
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,175
Nicky's topsy-turvy torte is
flavoured with vanilla rum

247
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,535
and will perch upon her
chocolate mousse.

248
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,695
Piped ganache and tempered chocolate
shards will complete

249
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,015
her precarious bake.

250
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,695
I love it when they call you brave.
Nicky the Braveheart.

251
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,095
You've just got to hope it all holds
together. Uh-huh.

252
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,935
You'll be on your horse, at that
point, painted blue.

253
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,575
Off I go!

254
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,775
Freedom!

255
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,695
Bakers, you are halfway through.
Keep baking.

256
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,095
I can work with halfway through.
I feel good.

257
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,495
Just having a little look.

258
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,855
Underbake their tortes

259
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,335
and they'll remain too dense
and claggy.

260
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,935
They're about done.
I will give them 30 more seconds.

261
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,495
Overbake and they'll become dry
and crumble apart.

262
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,335
I think I'm going to come out.

263
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,095
We're coming out the oven.

264
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,975
Call it a day. That's looking good,

265
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,455
it's got a nice crunchy top which is
what we wanted.

266
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,775
No major cracks.

267
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,215
Put my bloody tray in wrong.
Now it's got a tilt on it.

268
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,095
That is really annoying.

269
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,895
What's happened? I had a bit of
a mishap.

270
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,695
As you can see,
it's slightly slanted.

271
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,735
I don't think it looks that bad.

272
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,535
You could ski down it, couldn't you?
Or sledge down it or something.

273
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,535
A little slope. Yeah, that's it.

274
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,895
Can't use that one. All my truffles
are going to roll off.

275
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,735
Always something
to test you, isn't there?

276
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,095
Get them in the freezer,
so they're nice and solid.

277
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,415
While Dan's starting his chocolate
torte once again...

278
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,215
My kind of baking now.
Chuck it all in, hope for the best.

279
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,935
The rest of the bakers are leaving
theirs to cool...

280
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,896
But that's the main thing. If that
doesn't cool down,

281
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,575
then we're pretty much screwed.

282
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,495
Can I say that?

283
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,615
And can begin making their
exquisite decorations.

284
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,055
Guess what? More chocolate.

285
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,535
I'm tempering my chocolate.
And the better the temper,

286
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,495
the quicker the set, the nicer
the snap, the brighter it is.

287
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,016
They do like a bit of tempering.
It's like showing off in the baking

288
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,815
world. It is a little bit, isn't it?
Just tempered these shapes,

289
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,295
everyone. Check this out.

290
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,815
Prue and Paul are expecting

291
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,375
beautiful elaborate
chocolate decorations.

292
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,055
Oh, God. Act busy.

293
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,815
But the more intricate the design...

294
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,175
These are for the chocolate nest.

295
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,495
The greater the chance they
could crack.

296
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,135
Oh! OK, they're all cracking.

297
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,215
I shouldn't have chose this mould.
What is wrong with me?

298
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,775
I need to redo them.

299
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,335
How are you going, Josh? A bit of
a nozzle issue at the moment.

300
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,655
A nozzle issue? Yes, it's setting in
the nozzle.

301
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,095
What if I hold you like a baby?

302
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,935
<i>You hold him and I hold you.</i>

303
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,375
Did that work? Not really, no.

304
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,295
Surely that's not supposed
to happen?

305
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,215
LAUGHTER

306
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,095
GASPING I should go.

307
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,615
Bye-bye. Let's just go.

308
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,935
Right, are you flat and balanced?

309
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,335
Yes, you are.

310
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,015
It's going to be really tight now.

311
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,975
Bakers, I don't want to bother you,
but you've got half an hour left.

312
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,055
You've just bothered them.

313
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,975
Like a baking pirate.

314
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,935
With their chocolate
sponges cooled...

315
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,815
If it's hot it's going to melt.

316
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,375
And fillings set...

317
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,335
This is my mousse, it will be fine.

318
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,735
Assembly can begin.

319
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,855
I'm alternating praline ganache
with the mascarpone cream.

320
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,415
But the taller the torte...

321
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,735
I've got many layers going on.

322
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,175
The tougher the task.

323
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,535
So I'm making three layers.

324
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,855
Making sure I get a nice straight
cake rather than

325
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,215
a wonky one. No collapses.

326
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,575
I hope the glaze is cool, otherwise
it will just melt everything else.

327
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,975
It's actually working.

328
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,335
Ey, I love it when a plan
comes together.

329
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,415
It is a big gamble because the cake
sits on the top,

330
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,415
but we'll go large or go home.

331
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,535
A bit of unmelted chocolate.
Oh, it's just such a mess.

332
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,975
It looks like a mess, isn't it?

333
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,415
Is it supposed to look like that?

334
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,695
Yeah, it is rough and ready.

335
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,295
No, then just own it. Yeah.

336
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,175
I'm going to conceal the messy edge
with the collar.

337
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,935
Get my cake out, take two.

338
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,575
That looks a bit more like it.

339
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,175
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes left.

340
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,255
Bang it straight in the freezer.
Let's do this.

341
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,015
Now, the piping.
This is really difficult.

342
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,735
My hand's shaking.

343
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,375
SHE GASPS

344
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,855
I messed that!

345
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,255
It's not worked.

346
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,855
It's magic!

347
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,255
Need to do some decorations.
My leaves haven't worked.

348
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,095
I'm going to put some of this
on here.

349
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,415
Tickety-boo, I've just took that out
of the freezer.

350
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,855
Right. So here we go, glazing.

351
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,055
Bakers, you have only one
minute left.

352
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,495
Do we, really?
Gosh, Paul is going to hate it.

353
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,975
Popping some tempered chocolate on.

354
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,295
I'm finished. I want to eat that.

355
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,175
White chocolate first.
Then truffles.

356
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,935
It is really messy.

357
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,655
I'm so embarrassed.

358
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,215
Finished!

359
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,255
OK, bakers, that is your time up.

360
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,135
Please step away from your bakes.
Well done.

361
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,975
Where did that time go? Well done.

362
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,735
Go on, Saku.

363
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,175
Did you just put 40 raspberries
in your mouth?

364
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,575
That was massive.

365
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,095
The bakers' flour less chocolate
tortes will now face

366
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,415
the judgment of Paul and Prue.

367
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,215
Hello, Nicky. Hi, Nicky.
Hello. Hi, Nicky.

368
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,255
Straight off I think it
looks amazing.

369
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,655
Nicky, I agree. I think it's
a little work of art.

370
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,655
It's elegant, it's classy and cool.

371
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,215
And the shine is amazing.

372
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,095
Let's see what it tastes like.

373
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,415
Oh, don't.
The proof is in the pudding.

374
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,855
It is.

375
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,255
The mousse is holding its shape,
which is great.

376
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,495
Mm, the flavours are great,
really strong chocolate.

377
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,815
It probably needed a fruit in there,
like a raspberry or

378
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,055
a strawberry or something tart

379
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,415
to break down that chocolate
a little bit.

380
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,815
But I think you've done
a decent job. Thank you. Thank you.

381
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,895
WHISPERING: Very good.

382
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,415
The outside doesn't look so good.
A bit wobbly.

383
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,696
I think if you take the sides off

384
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,336
and look at the top, it looks
really nice.

385
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,135
Let's have a look at it
and see what it's like inside.

386
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,575
Is this ground almonds in here?

387
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,375
Ground almonds, ground hazelnuts.

388
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,416
The flavour of the cake
and the flavour of

389
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,775
the praline mousse work beautifully
well together

390
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,655
with that chocolate top.
It's lovely.

391
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,695
I love the height, it looks very
spectacular.

392
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,455
Oh, drop through.

393
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,215
Oh! Ooh, look at that.

394
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,695
The flavour is fantastic.
The cherry flavour's beautiful.

395
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,815
But the cherry and the mascarpone
filling that you've got

396
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,655
is a bit weak. If you'd had
overnight to set it,

397
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,975
it would have been better.

398
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,975
I like the colour, I like the shine.

399
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,575
The sides, however, are not
particularly good. Oh, dear.

400
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,975
This is definitely dessert
rather than cake.

401
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,055
It is absolutely delicious.

402
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,055
The tartness of the raspberries
come through.

403
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,415
You really get the chocolate.

404
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,495
I mean, it tastes amazing, but it's
almost like a pudding, isn't it?

405
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,815
Where are the leaves?

406
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,415
I hate that mould so much.
It's in the bin. OK.

407
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,255
It's a little bit messy where
the collar joins

408
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,215
the cake, cos you want that nice
and smooth.

409
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,095
Well, do you know what, it still
looks extremely inviting.

410
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,215
OK. Thank you, Prue.

411
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,455
The cake is a little bit dry.
OK.

412
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,735
And very crumbly.

413
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,655
I do think you need more cherries,
more cherry brandy.

414
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,175
More chocolate.
It's got no real flavour.

415
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,855
Bloody hell. Um... Does that mean
it's got no calories in it?

416
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,695
Yeah. No flavour, no calories.

417
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,775
Well, I must say I think it looks
very neat and quite original.

418
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,616
A little bit more height would have
been nicer.

419
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,375
Don't forget to try your
chilli truffle.

420
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,975
Is this going to blow my head
off, Dan? Hopefully not.

421
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,775
I don't mind the chilli.
I think the texture's too gluey.

422
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,816
It reminds me a little bit of
Mexico, but I think it's

423
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,575
a little bit overwhelming on
the alcohol.

424
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,055
Yeah, I would agree with that.

425
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,375
I'm not sure that finish looks as
good as it could.

426
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,655
Come on, I'm dying for
a bite of ginger.

427
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,095
The ginger's lovely and strong,

428
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,015
I like it. But the texture of

429
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,895
the cake is very puddingy,
too moist.

430
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,575
The ginger brings the heat,

431
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,295
but what I do get is

432
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,215
a ton of amaretto.
For me, it's drowned it.

433
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,415
It's a bit messy.

434
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,175
And the "Saku" written, it probably
needed to be little bit more stark.

435
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,920
If you'd done that in white chocolate
it would have stood out better.

436
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,655
That's very chocolaty.

437
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,055
The raspberry's coming through.

438
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,575
The chocolate's beautiful
and strong.

439
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,615
But it's a little bit too gooey in
the middle.

440
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,055
It's quite heavy,
and so you can't eat a lot of it.

441
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,535
Very elegant.
It is very elegant.

442
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,895
It's beautifully smooth,
you've got a lovely shine to it.

443
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,255
The chocolate decorations are good,
the pipework is good.

444
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,735
So let's see if it's as good inside
as it is outside.

445
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,695
That looks amazing.

446
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,015
Doesn't that look pretty?

447
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,655
I love it, it's very strong on
the coffee. Yeah.

448
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,335
I think it's beautiful. Oh, my gosh.

449
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,256
You've got a Swiss meringue
butter cream in there

450
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,615
which is like silk. And the level of
coffee is spot-on.

451
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,975
I think the sponges have
compressed a little.

452
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,535
Your cake was completely flour less,
wasn't it? Yeah.

453
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,215
That's why it's compressed a bit.

454
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,935
But overall you've done
a very good job. Oh, thank you.

455
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,655
Well done. Thank you very much. Oh!

456
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,295
What the hell?

457
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,095
That couldn't have gone
better, really.

458
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,495
It didn't go great.

459
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,775
Yeah, chocolate week,
I'm not loving all this.

460
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,455
They said it is not elegant.
I accept that.

461
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,215
Just like myself - simple.

462
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,895
That's how I like everything.

463
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,295
Prue called it elegant,
classy and cool.

464
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,895
I can go off skipping into
the meadows

465
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,575
ready for my technical.

466
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,295
Yes. Bye!

467
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,455
The bakers could practise their
Signature Bake,

468
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,935
but they have no idea what awaits
them in their chocolaty

469
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,055
Technical Challenge.

470
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,055
Welcome back, bakers.

471
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,375
It's time for your
Technical Challenge.

472
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,455
Now this challenge has been set by

473
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,095
the princess of puddings,
Prue Leith.

474
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,375
Do you have any words of wisdom?

475
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,935
Yes. When working with

476
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,935
the chocolate you need
perseverance and patience.

477
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,815
As always this challenge is
judged blind,

478
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,135
so, Prue and Paul, you may now leave
the tent, thank you.

479
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,495
They're going to do some
gymnastics.

480
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,455
Prue's got a pommel horse.
Paul's going to get in his leotard.

481
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,175
OK, so Prue would like you

482
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,295
to make six perfectly baked
individual cheesecakes.

483
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,615
Your cheesecakes must comprise of

484
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,335
a caramelised white chocolate

485
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,855
filling, on top of an oaty
biscuit base.

486
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,255
Topped with a blackcurrant jelly
and white chocolate decoration.

487
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,015
You have two hours. On your marks.
Get set.

488
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,495
B to the A to the K to the E.
Let's bake, let's bake!

489
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,895
LAUGHTER

490
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,256
I don't think that's a lot of
time, though. Two hours to make

491
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,255
a set, baked cheesecake. So there's
a lot of pressure to this.

492
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,895
Never made caramelised
white chocolate,

493
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,935
never made a cheesecake.
So basically I'm in the dark here.

494
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,615
Prue, this looks quite a complicated
technical, is it?

495
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,135
There are a few hurdles to get over.

496
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,735
The really tricky thing is
caramelising the chocolate.

497
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,055
They need to stick it in
the microwave

498
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,655
and every 30 seconds give it a stir.

499
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,615
Another 30 seconds, give it a stir,

500
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,175
until it gets this straw colour.
But don't overdo it.

501
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,575
So they could burn it? Yeah.

502
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,015
Mm, the fact that you've caramelised
the white chocolate - it's silky,

503
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,895
it's lovely, luxurious.

504
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,335
And I'm curious to see how they're
going to deal

505
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,695
with this white chocolate.

506
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,055
That could catch the bakers out,
which in turn

507
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,415
throws their timings out,
which in turn ends

508
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,655
in melting messes all over
the top.

509
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,015
You're a gloomy fellow.

510
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,615
THEY LAUGH

511
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,615
Instruction number one,

512
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,855
make the biscuit base using
the rubbing in method.

513
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,175
So I've just combined the flour
and butter.

514
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,095
Then add the oats. Number two,

515
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,455
spread the mixture out on a tray
and bake.

516
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,815
I want those oats to get
a nice bit of colour on them.

517
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,655
I don't think it's going to need
very much,

518
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,695
just get it a wee bit crisp.

519
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,655
Five minutes and then check.
Blooming hell, it's hot, innit?

520
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,975
I'll be honest with you, every time
I come to this area

521
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,415
my temperature actually goes up.

522
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,455
I do have that effect.

523
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,055
Next is move on to
the blackcurrant jelly.

524
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,335
Which very helpfully says,
"Make blackcurrant jelly".

525
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,135
Feeling jelly, jelly!
SHE LAUGHS

526
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,095
I've left some of
the blackcurrants whole for

527
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,415
a bit of texture, to be honest.

528
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,735
It's more civilised, innit,
to sieve your jelly.

529
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,455
Hello. Hello. How are you?

530
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,455
I'm good. I'm just going to squeeze
my gelatine.

531
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,095
Do you like gelatine?
No, this is a pig's trotter.

532
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,895
Oh, is that what it is?
Basically.

533
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,215
We should all be just vegan at this
point, shouldn't we?

534
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,495
Yeah, are you a vegan? No.

535
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,815
Well, there you are.

536
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,015
So now pour into the lined tray
to set.

537
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,335
That's got to go in
the fridge surely.

538
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,455
I'm getting them out.

539
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,735
Happy with the biscuit.

540
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,295
Then give it a good old blitz.

541
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,415
So I'm just going to get the biscuit
base into the mould.

542
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,295
Equal amounts.

543
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,175
The right amount in each one

544
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,495
didn't end up the way I thought it
would. That's OK.

545
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,055
Patted it down, so it's gone nice
and set. Right.

546
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,975
Next on the agenda, caramelising
some white chocolate.

547
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,895
Caramelised white chocolate.
I don't know what it is.

548
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,336
I've done a caramelised white
chocolate before. Can't remember

549
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,336
when I did it and what it was for,
but I have done one.

550
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,015
Caramelising white chocolate will

551
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,375
test the bakers' knowledge
and nerve.

552
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,815
Heat the chocolate in bursts in

553
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,215
the microwave, stirring between each
burst.

554
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,495
What's a burst?

555
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,935
Kind of like ten seconds.

556
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,495
Not long enough in the microwave

557
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,535
and it could be grainy
and unpleasant.

558
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,015
I'm literally just going to do,
like, 30 seconds bursts.

559
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,735
But white chocolate's high sugar
content means even

560
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,655
a few seconds too long could
mean disaster.

561
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,176
But I'm not going to do any more
than 20 second bursts, just cos you

562
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,895
never know, it might start burning.

563
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,775
My burst is 1 minute 30 seconds on
a medium.

564
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,135
Nothing's happening.

565
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,735
Oh! Prue did say perseverance
and patience.

566
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,015
It should go a browny colour.

567
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,055
Nothing happens. Still looks white.

568
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,895
It's starting to change texture.

569
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,735
I've burnt it. I've burnt my
chocolate.

570
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,975
Right, I'm starting again.

571
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,575
Has anyone actually managed it yet?

572
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,975
Yeah, that's me, that is.

573
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,935
I just don't want to push it
any further.

574
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,295
Yes. I think we're about there,

575
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,896
so I think I'm going to leave it
at that.

576
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,135
Looks good. I don't know if it is
the right consistency.

577
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,135
I'm going to leave it now.

578
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,535
MICROWAVE BEEPS

579
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,015
Oh, no. No!

580
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,735
It's burnt, I hate white chocolate.
It's the bane of my existence.

581
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,695
I feel like I'm going to set up
a charity

582
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,415
for everybody who's ever worked
with caramelised white chocolate.

583
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,415
Right, it's fine, we're not going to
stress too much about it.

584
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,095
Bakers, you are halfway through!

585
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,775
Right, so now I'm going to beat
the cream cheese, add the eqgg,

586
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,135
mix in my caramelised chocolate,
cornflour and cream.

587
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,495
While most of the bakers move onto
their filling...

588
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,536
I'm not sure at all what consistency
I'm looking for.

589
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,055
Rowan...
I beg of you, please work.

590
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,815
Tasha...
I need to get a wriggle on.

591
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,215
And Dana are still struggling

592
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,015
to caramelise their
white chocolate.

593
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,896
I think there'll come a point where
I just give up

594
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,455
and just use white chocolate.

595
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,055
So pour my filling over
the biscuits and bake.

596
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,935
They're going in.

597
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,935
Now, obviously there's no bake time.
I'm going to start with 30 minutes.

598
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,415
15, and then check.

599
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,815
20. Between 15 and 25 minutes.

600
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,175
So it's a fairly big window.

601
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,295
It's just getting hotter.

602
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,935
You OK? Uh, not great.

603
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,135
I'm very hot.

604
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,495
I'm sweating! I'll fan you down
if you want?

605
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,775
It's working wonders, that.

606
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,135
How long we got left of the
challenge? 45 minutes.

607
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,456
Do you reckon you've got it in you
to do another 45 minutes of that?

608
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,695
Yeah, of course I could.

609
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,655
My chocolate's caramelised

610
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,975
after chuff tog half an hour of
sodding about

611
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,216
with white chuff tog chocolate.

612
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,135
My chocolate's not great,
but I'll make them anyway.

613
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,655
My chocolate's been caramelised,
so I'm happy.

614
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,495
I've literally just put it in
the oven. It's mental.

615
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,295
God, it will be fine.

616
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,655
Sod them.

617
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,935
OK, bakers, you've got 30
minutes left.

618
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,375
My God.

619
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,175
Right, let's have a nosy.

620
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,895
I'm going to give them five
more minutes.

621
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,335
They're out, I've no idea if they're
cooked or not.

622
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,215
I'm worried about, like,
the chilling time.

623
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,215
Get the jelly on, so my jelly
doesn't melt.

624
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,535
And then the cream on, so
my cream doesn't melt.

625
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,375
I would say they're coming out.

626
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,375
They've sunk. Could be good,
could be bad.

627
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,295
I'm just going to wang them in
the freezer.

628
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,615
A couple of kids have opted
to wear jumpers today on

629
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,015
the hottest day of the year.

630
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,375
I'm sweating at the moment.
Literally. It's very hot. So am I!

631
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,215
I match my shirt. My rouge, don't I?

632
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,495
It's hot.

633
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,215
I'm really dizzy.

634
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,775
Is Tash all right?

635
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,295
It's so hot, I think I need
some air.

636
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,615
You can take as much time as you
need, all right? OK.

637
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,095
Nice and slowly, get up for me.

638
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,975
Unfortunately the heat is taking its
toll on Tasha.

639
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,775
Make sure you take nice
and slow breathing, OK?

640
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,415
And she's been advised to take
a break from the tent.

641
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,015
Is she all right?

642
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,295
Just give yourself
a couple of minutes, OK?

643
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,175
There's still a bit of
a wobble in the middle.

644
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,495
So I'm going to give it another
five minutes.

645
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,695
Two more minutes.

646
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,415
Oh, I don't know.

647
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,855
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

648
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,655
Right, I'm getting these things out.

649
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,415
They've got the jiggle which
I wanted.

650
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,775
They just need to set fully,
but we haven't got long.

651
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,575
Getting them out could be
a bit tricky.

652
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,015
Oh, what do I do?

653
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,535
I think they're all right.

654
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,895
Got a slight bit of a wobble
on them,

655
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,935
so I think we're potentially
looking OK with that.

656
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,895
Hi, darling, how are you?
I'm gutted.

657
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,775
Tasha hasn't recovered enough
to finish the challenge.

658
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,415
I had a massive migraine last night.

659
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,135
I thought I would feel
better this morning, but...

660
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,495
I can see you're not well.
Go home, sweetheart.

661
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,455
Go and rest.
Come on, I'll walk you back.

662
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,375
Oh. Come on.

663
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,815
Right, so now place set jelly on top
of each of the cheesecakes.

664
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,335
Still it is hot,
I am really worried.

665
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,135
Oh, my gosh. It's just so stressful.

666
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,855
While they're still in the freezer,
I was putting these on top.

667
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,735
It just needs maximum time in
the freezer.

668
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,095
Oh, how am I going to do this?
It will melt.

669
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,975
Right, pipe a wavy line
of Chantilly cream down

670
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,975
the middle of each of
the cheesecakes.

671
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,975
Bakers you've got one minute left,
one minute.

672
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,735
Yeah, I'm really happy.

673
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,575
Ah, it's melting.

674
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,935
They're so hot.

675
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,975
Don't know what I'm doing.

676
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,735
NOEL: Bakers...

677
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,575
Melting, melting, melting.

678
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,895
Your time...

679
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,695
Oh, my God.

680
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,720
.Is...

681
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,175
.up.

682
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,575
SIGHS

683
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,015
Please bring your cheesecakes
down to the gingham table

684
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,615
and place them behind
your photographs.

685
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,895
Prue and Paul are expecting six
identical elegantly decorated

686
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,695
cheesecakes with a silky,
caramelised white chocolate filling.

687
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,575
PAUL: OK shall we start over here
then?

688
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,855
These look relatively neat.

689
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,735
PRUE: And they all look identical.

690
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,215
Little bit dark, I think.

691
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,455
Yeah, little over baked.

692
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,695
The cheesecake filling,
it is delicious

693
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,095
but it is a little bit
too caramelised.

694
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,455
From the sublime...
PRUE CHUCKLES

695
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,175
Well, this one is not very
good-looking.

696
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,495
Everything's been piled on top while
they're still hot

697
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,775
and everything's just pouring off.

698
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,175
The biscuit base is very good.

699
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,495
It's a bit grainy,
the actual filling as well.

700
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,655
The custard filling.

701
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,655
But they all look right size,
if I'm looking for a positive.

702
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,175
Now these look quite nice,

703
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,695
although there's a big dip
in the middle.

704
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,215
This is down to bringing them
out just a little bit too early.

705
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,535
But the jelly looks good,

706
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,055
the decoration,
the pipework looks nice as well.

707
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,055
Hmm. The flavour is good.

708
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,375
The caramelisation is correct.
Yeah, it is.

709
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,855
Again rushed. It's over baked.

710
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,855
You can see how dark
the white chocolate has gone.

711
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,856
Look at the colour on that.
Yeah, it's a bit too far.

712
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,295
Again, they were rushed for time.

713
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,615
It's a shame that they've
over baked it.

714
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,015
These are very neat.

715
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,975
These are very neat.
DESSERT SNAPS

716
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,495
Nice snap. Decent colour.

717
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,135
All the layers
are very even and neat.

718
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,255
Hmm...

719
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,175
Hmm, smooth filling.

720
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,375
I think that's delicious.

721
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,375
Yeah, it's very good.
OK, moving on.

722
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,855
Again it's over baked.

723
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,935
And the jelly doesn't look
as if it's smooth.

724
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,815
It's a bit rough, that.
Let's have a look inside this.

725
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,695
It is over baked,
that white chocolate,

726
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,015
it's a little bit grainy on the
mouth. Hmm.

727
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,615
It's not as smooth as it could be.

728
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,215
This looks as if it got dropped.

729
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,255
And again, there's been a problem
with the heat

730
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,695
and everything thrown on at
the last minute.

731
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,735
The actual colour's not bad.
It's good, the filling's good.

732
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,175
The base is good.
It's nice and smooth inside.

733
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,815
It's a pity cos if this bake had
had more time,

734
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,135
I think it would've been
a really good one.

735
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,535
The oaty base is not very even.

736
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,855
This side is very thick
and that side's very thin.

737
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,895
It is.

738
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,255
Actually,
I think the filling's all right.

739
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,095
Yeah, I must say that blackcurrant
is delicious, isn't it? Hmm.

740
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,135
NOEL: Paul and Prue will now rank
the cheesecakes from least

741
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,695
to most successful.

742
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,455
OK, in eighth spot we have this
one. Saku.

743
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,615
They look terrible and over baked.
I think you ran out of time.

744
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,255
In seventh place we have this one.

745
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,695
Cristy, it's a bit of a mess.

746
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,895
But tasted good.

747
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,055
Thank you.

748
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,375
In sixth we have this one.

749
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,095
Josh, just far too dark in
the caramel and the bake.

750
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,135
ALISON: Dana is in fifth place,

751
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,455
Nicky's fourth and Rowan comes
third.

752
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,335
Wow,

753
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,615
In second spot we have this one,
whose is this?

754
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,255
Matty, these aren't too bad.
Bit of a dip in the middle.

755
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,095
Which means Dan.

756
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,855
Well, Dan, that is amazing.

757
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,775
Well done.

758
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,815
It's the only one which is perfect,
well done. Thank you.

759
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,135
Sun's shining, first in my
technical,

760
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,975
yeah it's a good end to the day.

761
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,335
Best I've done so far
and I do love cheesecake.

762
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,015
I tasted everyone's about two times
over. I feel a bit sick now.

763
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,415
That was awful.
Absolutely excruciating.

764
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,375
SHE LAUGHS

765
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,415
SAKU: Why am I laughing?
I should cry.

766
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,295
Still there. It's a little hope for
tomorrow.

767
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,615
It's a new day, new bake.

768
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,495
Still old me, we'll see.

769
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,055
SHE CHUCKLES

770
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,175
ALISON: Are you happy with how
everything's going?

771
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,735
Overall, with chocolate week,

772
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,055
I've been
a little bit underwhelmed.

773
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,615
It was difficult yesterday.

774
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,015
Tasha was so upset
that she wasn't very well.

775
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,975
Tasha unfortunately had to go.
She will be with us next week.

776
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,295
Could someone leave
because someone"s dropped out?

777
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,135
Yeah, someone still can leave.

778
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,415
Who needs to be worried today?

779
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,655
I think two people,

780
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,295
Cristy and I think Saku are in
a lot of trouble.

781
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,215
Depending on the show stopper,
I think someone may be going today.

782
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,575
Wow.

783
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,615
Good to see you, bakers,

784
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,095
welcome back it's time
for your show stopper challenge.

785
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,495
Today the judges would love you

786
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,895
to make a spectacular
edible chocolate box.

787
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,256
Now I don't know about you
but when I get a box of chocolates,

788
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,975
I throw the chocolates in
the bin and eat the box.

789
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,415
Now your edible chocolate box,

790
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,255
alongside some filled moulded
chocolates,

791
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,255
should contain an exquisite
perfectly baked chocolate cake.

792
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,615
You have four chocolaty hours.
On your marks... Get set...

793
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,735
Bake.

794
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,615
There's a lot to do in four hours.

795
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,335
I just want to get
started and do it.

796
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,695
The show stopper this week is
a chocolate box cake.

797
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,695
What we're after is to
try to find out how skilful

798
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,295
the bakers are with chocolate.

799
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,975
My biggest fear is the box.

800
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,776
If you don't get the temper right
you're making everything else harder.

801
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,615
The tempering of the chocolate is
all about rising the temperature,

802
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,975
cooling it down sufficiently,
before they start putting

803
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,735
all the components together or
the whole thing will collapse.

804
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,895
PRUE: The chocolate box is more
about precision.

805
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,255
The cake, on the other hand,
is about flavour.

806
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,495
But the wonderful thing about
chocolate is it goes with so many things.

807
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,735
PAUL: They could do whatever they
want. This is their chance to shine.

808
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,095
And there are a few bakers in
a little bit of trouble at

809
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,455
the moment and they need to create a
little bit of chocolate magic.

810
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,015
Hi, Josh. Hello.

811
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,775
So, Josh, we need to know all
about your chocolate box.

812
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,775
My chocolate box. Yes, so I shall be
doing a chemistry chocolate box.

813
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,375
What you doing, the periodic table?

814
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,776
So there's going to be a periodic
table around the edge and...

815
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,576
You are doing a periodic table. I'm
doing different elements around the edge.

816
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,055
The box is going to have chemistry
shaped cut outs all the way round it.

817
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,615
NOEL: Josh's formula for chocolate
box success includes

818
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,375
a chocolate sponge cake layered
with caramel butter cream

819
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,575
and roasted hazelnuts, topped with
salted caramel and vanilla

820
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,135
and white chocolate truffles.

821
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,055
And he's hoping his hand-piped
decorations will spark

822
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,415
a positive reaction.

823
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,935
I'm going to use the chemical
elements to write different words

824
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,695
So I'll do, like, phenethylamine,
which is like a neurotransmitter.

825
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,015
So we're going to have vanilla in
as well for your...

826
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,255
so you've got in vanilla,

827
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,615
butyric acid, which is what you've
got in milk chocolate.

828
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,376
I'm going to have a oleic acid as
well hopefully...

829
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,255
Josh, Josh, stop, stop, stop.
Sorry, sorry.

830
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,655
Enough now, enough now.
You lost me at the last roundabout.

831
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,935
LAUGHTER

832
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,735
Oh, still tempering.

833
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,455
ALISON: Whether the bakers are using
dark or trickier white chocolate...

834
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,815
Wanted the white cos I wanted
to introduce colour.

835
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,175
You can't really do that with
the darker chocolates.

836
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,255
NOEL: It needs to be well tempered
in order to build their boxes.

837
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,735
The chocolate's got to be
tempered perfectly.

838
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,135
If it isn't it'll just bend,
it'll crack, it'll snap.

839
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,695
ALISON: But with Rowan using both
dark and white...

840
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,255
We don't have perfectly tempered
chocolate, I don't think,

841
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,655
but I'm just going with it.

842
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,255
NOEL: Speed is of the essence.

843
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,095
So I'm doing a paint box
for my grandad.

844
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,575
He's an artist.

845
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,935
So I'm just creating
the wood grain now

846
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,615
and then go over it again with white
chocolate and fill in the gaps.

847
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,415
Inside Rowan's nostalgic paint box
will be a dark chocolate sponge

848
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,775
filled with multiple chocolate
orange layers,

849
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,535
including a Swiss meringue
butter cream, mousse and orange curd.

850
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,415
Raspberry and orange fondant
chocolates

851
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,775
will represent his grandad's
oil colours.

852
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,415
When you practised, have you managed
to do it well in the time?

853
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,335
It's funny you say that, Paul.
I've not quite practised this.

854
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,375
He's been doing his dissertation
remember as well.

855
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,895
I have. I've just finished
university this week.

856
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,936
Oh, my goodness. Congratulations.
So thank you. Wow.

857
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,255
It's kind of get it done as
fast as possible

858
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,095
and cover up the cracks afterwards.

859
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,055
I just want to make sure that my
panel is as thin as possible.

860
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,015
I want a nice thin delicate
box, really.

861
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,055
NOEL: While one half of the bakers are
building their boxes out of chocolate panels...

862
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,615
ROWAN: It's meant to be rustic.
It's meant to do this.

863
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,615
NOEL: Cristy, Dana, Saku and Dan
are using moulds to shape theirs.

864
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,615
Putting the chocolate into my moulds

865
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,295
is the most crucial part
of the whole thing.

866
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,215
I am doing today an edible
treasure chest filled with

867
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,575
the flavours of the Caribbean.

868
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,855
NOEL: Dan's pirate booty will see
his moulded chocolate chest

869
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,335
filled with layers of white
chocolate mousse,

870
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,895
tropical fruit jellies,
coconut dacquoise

871
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,255
and a white chocolate
genoise sponge.

872
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,215
His chocolates will be filled
with caramel

873
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,815
and rum-soaked raisins
and shaped like sea shells.

874
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,215
I love making this
because it's like dedicated

875
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,095
to my kids and stuff on the beach
and...

876
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,775
My kids are on the beach today.

877
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,295
Mine are as well, yeah. Are they?
What are we doing in a tent?

878
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,175
Why are we here?

879
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,535
ALISON: Dan's not the only baker
celebrating their inner child.

880
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,975
So I am doing a princess carriage.

881
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,055
Living my childhood dream
of wanting to be a princess,

882
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,895
which never came to life. Aw!

883
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,255
Listen, it's still early days.
It's still early days.

884
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,696
It's still early days.
You never know.

885
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,375
Dana's bringing her childhood
princess dreams to life

886
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,415
with a delicate white chocolate
carriage

887
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,455
filled with layers of chocolate
sponge,

888
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,735
salted peanut caramel and peanut
butter and cream cheese mousse.

889
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,375
Her fantasy will be complete
with a cookie dough

890
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,815
and Irish cream liqueur chocolates
alongside carefully moulded

891
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,455
chocolate decorations.

892
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,175
So I made these.

893
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,695
But the only trouble is trying
to get the leg out of the mould.

894
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,615
So far I've been unsuccessful. So
we'll see. Handy. Oh, my goodness.

895
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,576
Do you know what? It's because
it's almost midnight,

896
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,055
they're turning back into mice.
So that's the whole. Ah.

897
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,375
That's the whole situation.
Are you Cinderella?

898
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,495
I'm Cinderella today, I am.

899
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,855
NOEL: While Dana's hoping her
horses don't turn back into mice...

900
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,855
I need it out the way
so I can breathe again.

901
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,455
Cristy's trying to avoid
a broken heart.

902
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,095
I'm doing a heart chocolate box.

903
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,135
I'm dedicating it to my husband,
my little soulmate.

904
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,295
Cristy's romantic white chocolate
box will be loaded

905
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,615
with layers of hazelnut
mascarpone filling

906
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,575
and chocolate and hazelnut sponge -

907
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,935
her husband Ryan's
favourite flavours.

908
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,615
Her heart shaped chocolates will
contain hazelnut praline

909
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,895
and chocolate ganache.

910
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,535
You need to have a good one,
don't you? I do. No pressure.

911
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,175
I think if I had like something
to relax me, like a drink.

912
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,015
THEY CHUCKLE

913
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,895
If I could have a team of...
Floatation tank.

914
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,775
All right,
I can organise that. Don't worry.

915
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,695
No, I definitely can't. Yeah.
I'll get on it now. All right.

916
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,295
NOEL: After her own disappointing
first day.

917
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,615
This is the cricket bat.

918
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,735
Saku's hoping not to be BOWLED
out of the competition.

919
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,855
This box is for my daughter.
She loves cricket.

920
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,895
Saku's cylindrical chocolate
box will contain

921
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,255
a pistachio sponge filled
with chocolate cream cheese icing.

922
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,935
She's hoping her ambitious plans

923
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,295
to make three different
moulded chocolates,

924
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,295
flavoured with pistachio, raspberry
and coffee, won't leave her STUMPED.

925
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,615
What's she good at,
batting or bowling?

926
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,735
She's a spin bowler.

927
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,455
A spin bowler? That's what I used
to do when I was at school.

928
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,975
Ah. I was a spin bowler.

929
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,975
So why don't you do it now?

930
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,935
Bit old. Legs are like bread sticks.

931
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,215
THEY CHUCKLE

932
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,815
Chocolate is tempered.

933
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,455
But I'm just moulding it
round these.

934
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,255
While their box elements set...

935
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,055
NOEL: This looks like someone who
knows what they're doing.

936
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,015
SHE LAUGHS Shock horror.

937
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,815
The bakers can now focus on

938
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,455
the chocolate cake that will go
inside.

939
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,055
We're going for
a chocolate genoise sponge.

940
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,415
Hopefully it's nice,
hopefully it's moist.

941
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,935
Genoise sponge will form the base of
Matty's cake which will be layered

942
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,295
with raspberry coulis,
creme mousseline

943
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,015
and covered in a chocolate
mirror glaze.

944
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,375
He's hoping the flavours
of his pistachio

945
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,175
and lemon chocolates will keep him
in favour with the judges.

946
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,455
Now I think you are on the rise.
You have to keep going up.

947
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,055
Yeah, fingers crossed, yeah.

948
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,375
On the RISE.
Don't leave me hanging.

949
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,455
Sorry.

950
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,215
THEY LAUGH WHEEZILY

951
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,895
To RISE above this
chocolate challenge...

952
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,255
That's going in for 25 minutes.

953
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,655
As well as producing a box,
cake and multiple fillings...

954
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,695
I've never made an orange curd,
I'm not worried, are you?

955
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,095
NOEL: The bakers also have at least
one set of moulded chocolates to make.

956
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,615
This is the pistachio chocolate.

957
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,495
But while some are managing
the workload...

958
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,096
We've done that, we've done that,
we've done that, we've done that.

959
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,695
Oh, my days.

960
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,575
Nicky's hit a snag.

961
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,255
I am trying to make myself
salted caramel

962
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,615
and I am trying to bring it back
from the brink. It will work.

963
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,935
Nicky's tricky caramel will form

964
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,855
the centre of one
of her moulded chocolates,

965
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,855
while the other will be filled
with lemongrass and coconut.

966
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,255
They'll sit on top of her chai
and orange liqueur cake,

967
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,615
decked with layers of chocolate
ganache and hazelnut meringue.

968
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,415
No, it's gone over.
It'll be like toffee.

969
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,255
I'm going to be mucking about
with this for a bit, I think.

970
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,615
Bakers, you're halfway through.

971
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,815
Oh...
Oh, I'm panicking like mad now.

972
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,415
Chocolate week is my week.

973
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,335
I've had a little bit
of Rowan's chocolate,

974
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,135
I've had a little bit
of Dan's chocolate,

975
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,055
I've had a little bit
of Cristy's chocolate.

976
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,015
All I want now is your chocolate.
HE LAUGHS HEARTILY

977
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,375
I'll wait for it to melt.

978
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,255
Oh, my word.

979
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,735
It's not baked in the middle,
but I have to start the cake.

980
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,415
In practice they was, like,
double one of those sponges.

981
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,215
Yeah, I'm just going to redo it.

982
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,375
NOEL: While Matty and Saku remake
their chocolate sponges...

983
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,935
I am stressing now.

984
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,455
Rowan...

985
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,175
I'm so behind I could scream.

986
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,895
And Nicky...

987
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,935
Take three on the caramel.

988
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,175
And I haven't even done
the lemongrass bit yet.

989
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,655
Are having to scale back
their plans.

990
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,775
I've gone rogue. I'm just doing the
one. I'm going to stick to orange.

991
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,135
Do you know what?

992
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,055
Even if I got just one set
of chocolates out, I'd be happy.

993
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,135
But no matter how many chocolates
the bakers are making...

994
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,815
I'm doing a couple in silver,
couple in gold.

995
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,575
So these go inside
the treasure chest.

996
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:00,935
Paul and Prue are expecting a
thin, shiny, tempered chocolate shell.

997
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,975
Don't you just love this bit?
I love this bit.

998
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,015
It is quite fun it's just
a messy job.

999
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,375
And I'm,
I'm not a fan of cleaning so.

1000
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,855
DAN: Absolute outrageous
amount of mess I'm making today.

1001
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,535
NICKY: It's like a bomb's hit it.

1002
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,895
This is ridiculous.

1003
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,895
Oh, my God, it's really messy here
as well, isn't it? I know.

1004
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,255
What are you...?
Rowan's a mess, you're a mess.

1005
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,615
I'm going to have to do some
cleaning lessons with you lot.

1006
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,255
This is popping candy. Cos obviously
every carriage ride,

1007
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,255
there would be
fireworks somewhere.

1008
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,495
So I've got my rum
and raisins which have been

1009
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,815
macerating at home for a couple of
months.

1010
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,375
CO is copper.

1011
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,695
No, it's cobalt.

1012
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,295
You can tell I got
a D in chemistry, can't ya?

1013
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,855
NOEL: You all right, Saku?

1014
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,935
Not really.

1015
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,935
I don't think I've ever seen anyone
put anything in the oven that fast.

1016
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,215
12 minutes, go.

1017
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,695
Just breathe.

1018
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,255
SHE EXHALES That's it, breathe.

1019
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,975
EXHALES

1020
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,775
THEY CHUCKLE

1021
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,735
Bakers, you have one hour left.

1022
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,095
Shiver me timbers and help me,
I've got an hour left.

1023
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,575
I'm going to start assembling.

1024
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,095
NOEL: For the bakers with moulded
chocolate boxes...

1025
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,695
CRISTY: Let's hope this goes well.

1026
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,575
It's the moment of truth.

1027
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,495
SAKU: Oh, I'm really scared now.

1028
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,455
It's always come out of

1029
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,415
the mould and for some reason, oh,
now it's not.

1030
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,975
I'm just going to cut it out
you know. It's got to work.

1031
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,255
My heart is breaking right now.

1032
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,055
So far all right.

1033
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,655
Perfect timing, Noel, thank you.

1034
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,335
I don't want to watch you do that
again, it was too stressful.

1035
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,535
I'm shaking.

1036
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,215
I can breathe again.

1037
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,735
There we go.

1038
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,535
My life's depending on this.

1039
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,495
Whilst half the tent can now begin
constructing their cakes...

1040
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,895
DAN: Fruit in.

1041
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,935
The other half still have
to hand build their boxes.

1042
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,575
Sweating now. This is the moment.

1043
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,295
NOEL: But if the chocolate panels
haven't been properly tempered...

1044
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,655
I'm just a bit worried these
aren't tempered right.

1045
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,655
Let's see if we can actually
assemble it.

1046
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,975
They'll be too soft
and the box will collapse.

1047
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,975
It's not set properly.

1048
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,455
It's fine. It is what it is.

1049
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,895
Oh...

1050
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,495
Oh, dearie me.
I've got such shaky hands.

1051
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,375
Feels like it's doing its stuff.

1052
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,695
I've only done it once though.
100% record.

1053
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,495
HE LAUGHS

1054
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,295
Oh, this isn't tempered right.
Oh, God.

1055
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,015
I don't know what to do.

1056
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,495
Think I'm going to have
to do some more tempered chocolate.

1057
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,535
I'm just praying that
I've got enough time.

1058
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,456
My cake and my truffles are there.
I just haven't got a box.

1059
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,375
How long have we got?

1060
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,055
Bakers,
you only have half an hour left.

1061
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,855
I hope it's done.

1062
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,655
While Saku and Matty's remade
sponges are baked...

1063
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,295
How to cool this down?

1064
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,215
As well as finishing the cakes...

1065
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,695
Nothing brown and log-like looks
pleasant, does it?

1066
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,855
NOEL: Saku's still got three sets
of moulded chocolates to make.

1067
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,855
I don't know if I can finish this.

1068
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,375
Come here, you can do this.
I know you can. Oh. No.

1069
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,695
You've got this. Thank you.
You've got this.

1070
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,615
This is diabolical.

1071
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,935
Wow, you've made a sofa.
A small sofa.

1072
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,135
What's happening here?

1073
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,655
Oh, what a mare.

1074
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,695
DANA: They're lying down horses.

1075
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,535
I'll have to get
the legs out separately.

1076
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,615
Right we can do this, can't we?

1077
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,375
These chocolates have got
to come out.

1078
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,335
They are not coming out,

1079
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:23,295
they're not tempered right.
One out.

1080
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,135
JOSH: I've got some panels now at
least,

1081
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,615
it's better but I'm just short on
time now, aren't I?

1082
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,015
Two out.

1083
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,655
What can I make out of this?

1084
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,295
Boom town.

1085
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,255
Hello.
How you doing?

1086
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,535
I'm all right, yeah.

1087
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,815
They look amazing.

1088
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,175
You're smashing it today.
See you later.

1089
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,615
Take it easy, go for it.

1090
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,935
SHE LAUGHS

1091
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,255
I do not know how on earth

1092
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,855
I have managed to put
a box together.

1093
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,415
How much time we got left?

1094
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,295
Bakers,
you've just got one minute left.

1095
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,975
I've got to get Alison's name piped
on the side somewhere.

1096
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,295
ROWAN: It looks like my
grandad sat on it,

1097
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,135
instead of opened it to paint.

1098
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,655
CRISTY: Feeling happy.
I've not had a disaster.

1099
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,015
DAN: Saku, do you need a hand
with anything?

1100
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,375
Yes, take these, out of the...
Turn these out. Yeah.

1101
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,055
Go on,
you get cracking I'll do this.

1102
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,455
I can't get it off the board.

1103
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,895
Sod it mate, get it in.

1104
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,135
OK, bakers, your time...

1105
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,415
Come on, Nick.

1106
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,855
.Is...

1107
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,495
It's in, it's in.

1108
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,815
.Up.

1109
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:30,215
Please step away from your
edible chocolate box cakes.

1110
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,815
This is the worst
thing I've ever made.

1111
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,335
LAUGHS

1112
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,255
Oh, my God.

1113
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,975
NOEL: It's judgment time for
the bakers' chocolate box cakes.

1114
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,655
Matty, it's time
for your show stopper.

1115
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,935
I think your box is beautifully
engineered, but lost all its shine.

1116
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,895
Hmm. Right, let's get the top off.

1117
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,215
Well, now this is nice and shiny.

1118
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,015
Moulded chocolates are
perfectly tempered.

1119
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,655
Inside it's got
a chocolate genoise sponge,

1120
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,375
with a chocolate creme mousseling,
raspberry coulis.

1121
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,375
The raspberry's delicious.
And the textures are spot on.

1122
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,415
To put raw raspberries in often will
make it too wet,

1123
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,775
and you've done it very well.
Thank you. Well done.

1124
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,135
What's in the white chocolate?
That's like a lemon mousse

1125
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,535
and the dark chocolate's
pistachio cream.

1126
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,455
I'd pay a lot of money for
a box of those.

1127
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,055
Thank you. Good job.

1128
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,415
Well done. Thank you.

1129
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,455
Well done, you.

1130
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,695
PRUE: It's so neat and
it's so beautiful.

1131
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,815
Wow.
Oh, that looks amazing.

1132
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,415
The passion fruit is such a good
idea

1133
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,375
because it's glittery,
it looks like jewels.

1134
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,055
So this is my tropical entremets,
consisting of genoise sponge,

1135
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,975
a coconut dacquoise,
white chocolate mousse,

1136
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,255
passion fruit jelly,

1137
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,775
with salted caramel
and rum and raisin chocolates.

1138
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,095
Hmm, flavours are wonderful.

1139
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,495
They are. Really fresh, but it's not
carrying a lot of baking in there.

1140
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,295
It's really a dessert, isn't it?

1141
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,055
Your salted caramel chocolate
is delicious.

1142
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,695
Got a lovely shine on it as well.

1143
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,255
I think it's really impressive.

1144
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,615
It's more impressive from
a distance... Yeah.

1145
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,975
Because you can't see
the lack of the details. I agree.

1146
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,815
It's a shame you couldn't put
the legs on. They've had a long day.

1147
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,175
There's not much of
a shine on that cake, is there?

1148
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,375
The cake is delicious,

1149
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,095
but the nuts and
the caramel far too pale.

1150
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,415
It needs to be much richer in colour
and that brings more flavour.

1151
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,175
Have a look at one of these, Prue.

1152
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,815
So we've got cookie dough
and pretzel

1153
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,415
and an Irish liqueur cream filling.

1154
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,895
What is that?
Is it the popping candy?

1155
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,255
Oh.
ALISON: Yeah, I can hear it.

1156
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,655
It's just very sweet.

1157
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,935
It's not the neatest work that
you've ever done.

1158
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,415
No. I've had a mare.

1159
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,055
They're a bit weird in colour,
aren't they?

1160
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,455
Hmm.
What's in the blue one?

1161
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,735
That's an orange fondant.

1162
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,015
Ish. There's a hint.

1163
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:10,975
OK.

1164
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,655
It's a chocolate cake,

1165
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,975
with a chocolate orange Swiss
meringue butter cream

1166
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,135
and an orange curd.

1167
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,455
Ooh, that's delicious.

1168
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,415
The flavour's great,
but it's a bit of a mess. Yeah.

1169
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,775
Do you know what?
If we came to your house

1170
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,095
and had a slice
of that you'd think it was perfect.

1171
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,975
Ah, hmm, I'd kick off.

1172
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,535
LAUGHTER

1173
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,335
But you're not invited, Paul.
Thank you very much.

1174
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,695
Thank you.

1175
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,015
You've got a box that's not
tempered properly... Yeah.

1176
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,695
Which is why it's lost all
its shine.

1177
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,175
When you're doing piping like
this you have to be

1178
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,455
so precise and that's not
precise enough.

1179
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,375
I think the piping on this side's
really good, it says "Alison".

1180
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,615
I think it's fantastic.

1181
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,095
I think the sponge is baked
beautifully well.

1182
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,855
Not carrying a huge amount
of flavour.

1183
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,455
That's because the
hazelnuts are so strong.

1184
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,975
I would complain that
I've got too many nuts in my mouth.

1185
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,295
LAUGHTER

1186
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,815
Let's try this white one
which is again?

1187
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,215
White chocolate and vanilla

1188
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,655
and this one's got
the caramel chocolate and hazelnut.

1189
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,975
Very nice. Hmm.

1190
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,175
Oh, that's delicious.

1191
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,095
Well, I think this
is a little triumph.

1192
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,615
I think the box looks amazing.
The tempering is really impressive.

1193
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,535
The shine.
The shine is fantastic.

1194
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,695
Thank you.

1195
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,135
Where are all your truffles?
There's just three of them.

1196
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,375
Yes.

1197
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,255
They weren't quite all capped,

1198
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,735
so I thought I'll
give you three nice ones.

1199
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,415
CHUCKLES

1200
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,775
The cake, the meringue,
the nuts in there. Hmm.

1201
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,535
It is an extremely rich cake.

1202
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,295
Hmm. Do you know, I love the
richness and I love the flavours.

1203
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,575
Delicious. What is in here?

1204
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,095
Salted caramel.

1205
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,775
Certainly is.

1206
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,895
Really nice.

1207
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,375
Who's the third one for?

1208
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,655
Do you want it?

1209
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,775
Well caught. I like it.

1210
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,255
Thanks, Nicky.

1211
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,455
I love the box.
It's perfect, isn't it?

1212
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,895
Beautiful, really beautiful.

1213
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,295
Did you manage to get it out without
a crack or anything? Very good.

1214
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,655
Thank you.
Right, let's have a look at this.

1215
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,455
It's a chocolate cake with
a chocolate and mascarpone filling.

1216
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,935
Well, it's very chocolaty.

1217
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,415
I just think the texture is a bit
solid.

1218
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,735
It is, it's a bit dry in the mouth.

1219
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,015
OK.
But these are nice and shiny.

1220
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,975
The praline’s nice.
Oh, good.

1221
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,255
That's nice chocolate, yeah.

1222
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,055
Hmm, coffee's lovely.
Both very good.

1223
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,335
I think the box structurally is
very good.

1224
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,495
It's a nice looking box.

1225
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,255
It's a shame the shine's not there

1226
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,015
cos that would've
looked really good.

1227
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,735
Ah, there's the cricket bat.
Isn't that a perfect cricket bat?

1228
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,455
You've struggled a little bit
with the chocolates, haven't you?

1229
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,975
Yeah. Maybe you should've just done
one type, rather than three.

1230
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,295
See what the cake's like.

1231
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,015
Cake is milk chocolate
and a pistachio.

1232
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,535
I love the pistachio flavour.

1233
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,295
It is a bit dry.

1234
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,975
I think the flavour,
however, is beautiful.

1235
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,935
Is this one...? Coffee.

1236
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,335
Coffee. Hmm, certainly is.
I like that one.

1237
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,495
But the chocolate is a bit soft.
Still pretty delicious.

1238
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,855
Well done, Saku.
Thank you very much.

1239
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,455
Thank you. Thank you.

1240
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,775
It was far better than
what I thought,

1241
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,055
but I'm done with chocolate.

1242
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,215
No more chocolate. In my life. Ever.

1243
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,215
That was a nice way to finish
the day off,

1244
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,735
sun's out, got a result like that.

1245
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,135
I'm happy with that.
I don't know about Star Baker.

1246
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,455
But definitely as close
to getting it as I have been.

1247
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,775
I feel proud of what I presented.

1248
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,095
But I think off the back of
yesterday,

1249
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,935
I could possibly be going home.

1250
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,655
The stress ride continues.

1251
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,735
So Paul, Prue, how impressed were
you with the show stoppers?

1252
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,775
Matt's cake was one of the best
because it was light.

1253
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,135
It still tasted chocolaty
and delicious.

1254
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,295
We wanted the chocolate to be in
the cake as well as the box. Yeah.

1255
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,535
And when we did get a chocolate like
Nicky, it was really punchy.

1256
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,895
I don't know about you guys,

1257
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,575
but I was quite happy
seeing Dan come back.

1258
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,135
Well, thank goodness for that.

1259
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,855
This was utterly delicious.

1260
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,935
But there was hardly any cake in it.

1261
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,335
The one I was so
disappointed about was Rowan.

1262
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,255
His box was a complete mess.

1263
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,855
He was in line for Star Baker.

1264
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,535
So I think it ended up with
for me between Nicky and Matty.

1265
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,815
So who needs to be worried today?

1266
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,135
Definitely Cristy, definitely Saku.

1267
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,575
Coming into today,
they weren't doing particularly well

1268
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,935
and, actually, both of them
are much of a muchness.

1269
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,575
Saku's was quite dry
but the flavour was good.

1270
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,055
And Cristy's quite dry
but the flavour was good.

1271
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,815
So they're almost identical.

1272
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,615
But the fact that Tasha's not
here...

1273
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,055
We have to decide
whether someone should go,

1274
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,855
or we leave it for another week.

1275
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,335
And that's what Prue and I have to
sit and go through again

1276
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,055
and have a chat
and see where we are.

1277
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,695
I'll be honest with you, Josh,

1278
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,095
the fact that he used my name,
for me, is the winner.

1279
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,655
You need to try that,

1280
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,975
cos I guarantee you'll have
a problem with his nuts.

1281
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,695
ALISON CHUCKLES

1282
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,095
Hello, bakers.

1283
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,815
I've got a lovely job of announcing
this week's Star Baker.

1284
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:27,135
And the person who is Star Baker
this week is...

1285
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,935
.Matty.

1286
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,215
OVERLAPPING CONGRATULATIONS

1287
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,055
Unfortunately,

1288
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,695
I've got the awful job of announcing
who is leaving today.

1289
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,015
So, the baker leaving
the tent today is...

1290
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,895
none of you.

1291
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,375
You're all staying.

1292
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,735
However, next week, two bakers
will leave the tent.

1293
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,735
Thank you, guys.

1294
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,175
OVERLAPPING CHATTER

1295
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,815
I'm so happy.

1296
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,535
I am buzzing, yeah.

1297
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,855
Also a little bit of a confidence
boost as well.

1298
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,535
You were right.

1299
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,095
You have this week.

1300
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,575
Matty has been getting better and
better.

1301
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,935
I think he really
deserves Star Baker.

1302
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,775
A bit better next week,
please, Saku.

1303
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,735
I will try my best.

1304
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,135
Phew! Such a relief.

1305
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,135
Goodness gracious,
I can't remember why I'm here.

1306
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,575
I'm just so over the moon to have
got halfway, it's just mad.

1307
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,455
It was between Saku and Cristy
that was going to go,

1308
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,255
and I think with the fact that Tasha

1309
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,575
didn't do too well in
their first challenge,

1310
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,375
it wasn't fair that someone left.

1311
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,735
It's pastry week next week and the
pressure will be on all the bakers

1312
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,215
because two will be leaving.

1313
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,095
ON PHONE: Hello.
Bab, I won Star Baker.

1314
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,215
Oh, my God. Oh, I'm so proud of you.
Thank you.

1315
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,735
On the week where we thought
you were going out.

1316
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,495
We?

1317
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,775
LAUGHTER

1318
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,455
Next time..

1319
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,735
I've got cramp in my hands.

1320
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,215
It's pastry week.

1321
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,895
Two people are going home this week.

1322
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,935
Oh, I know. It's so, so scary.

1323
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,455
They'll need to keep their cool
with a steamy Signature...

1324
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,935
Oh, no.

1325
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,255
Avoid faux pas while
recreating a French classic...

1326
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,575
Look at it,
it's flat like a pancake.

1327
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,415
Oh, she's going to hate it.

1328
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,455
And demonstrate
pie-making artistry.

1329
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,015
There's a bit of a
planning issue happening.

1330
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,695
Could you grab these two ends? Yeah.

1331
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,335
And I'll grab this and we left.

1332
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,655
Oh, it's just... Look, it's broken.
Oh, God.

1333
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,695
What are we going to do?

1334
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,695
