1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,160
Hey, Alison, it's Party Bakes Week.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,320
I know, I'm so excited.
I love a good party.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,760
Please say you ordered
the bouncy castle.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,280
Course I did.
Feast your eyes on this beauty.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,560
Yes, wicked.
When can I bounce on it?

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,200
I've just got to inflate it.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,520
Oh, OK.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,320
How long's it gonna be?

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,240
It'll be ready imminently. OK.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome to the
Great British Bake Off.

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,840
I'll be back in an hour, Noel.

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,400
{\an7}HE SIGHS

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,000
{\an8}If only I hadn't lent my foot pump
to Paul for his BMX.

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,120
{\an8}Last time...

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,520
{\an8}I've brought my own spoon.

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,520
{\an8}..was Dessert Week.
SAKU GASPS

17
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,720
And despite some steamed
pudding catastrophes...

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,120
That is disgusting.

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,120
..Dan's Thai curry creme caramels

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,200
won him Star Baker
for the second time.

21
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,720
{\an1}APPLAUSE

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,200
Ahh!

23
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,360
But it was Saku whose time was up.

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,640
It's a privilege to be
a part of this lovely family.

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,280
Now...

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,600
..the quarterfinals...
Go, go, go.

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,840
..means Party Week.

28
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,360
# Let's all do the conga
La-la-la-la... #

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,320
The bakers take on a
classic celebration Signature...

30
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,480
I'm being generous
with the sausage.

31
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,120
No-one wants a small sausage.

32
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,800
..tackle a much-loved
multi-legged Technical...

33
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,960
I think you need to do it again.
Shut up.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,760
I'm never, ever going to
get this done on time.

35
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,560
..and create a colossal
show stopping spread...

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,200
This is the hardest
I've had to work

37
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,520
and I thought Biscuit Week
I had to do a fair bit.

38
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,840
..worthy of the
glitziest celebration.

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,320
The ones underneath
aren't getting cooked.

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,440
How long have we got?

41
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,200
So who will be
this week's party-pooper?

42
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,160
Let's hope no-one goes too hard
too soon.

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,920
# Woo-woo-woo,
boop-boop, boop-boo... #

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,000
And who will be the tent's
number one party animal?

45
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,240
Bakers, you've had four hours.

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,360
This is outrageous.

47
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,480
They're going to be soggy.

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,360
Choux didn't rise.

49
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,720
They're only making one cupcake.

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,880
Quarterfinals, Party Week.

51
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,200
DAN: Let's do it, team.

52
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,600
I am buzzing.

53
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,400
I'm so excited.

54
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't know how I've got here.

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,920
I'm full-on thinking, like,
impostor syndrome right now.

56
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,560
Like, it's hard to get my head
around the fact that I'm still here.

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,360
To be in the quarterfinals
is just such an honour.

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,360
I'm made up.

59
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,720
Quarterfinals, there's just
no hiding place now, is there?

60
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,720
You make an error,
they're gonna pounce on it.

61
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,600
Laser focus.

62
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,080
I felt anxious the previous weeks,

63
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,720
but this is the first time
I've felt actually really nervous.

64
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,000
As soon as you say quarterfinal,
it's a big 'un.

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
The pressure's definitely on
for this week.

66
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,360
Good morning, bakers.

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,440
I hope you're all in the mood
to celebrate

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
because it's Party Week today.

69
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,720
Come on Paul, let's do the conga.

70
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
No?

71
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,240
OK, your loss.

72
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,920
I think he's more of a sort of
Oops Upside Your Head kind of guy.

73
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,200
I agree.
So, for your Signature bake,

74
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,640
the judges would like you
to make 12 delicious sausage rolls.

75
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,800
The sausage roll,
an absolute staple for any party.

76
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,280
An essential, like pass-the-parcel,
musical chairs,

77
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,640
or putting your keys into a bowl
at the start of the evening.

78
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,080
You can use any pastry
that you feel works,

79
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,400
and the filling and the flavour
is completely open,

80
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,120
as long as it's shaped into
a sausage wrapped in pastry
before baking.

81
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,480
You have two hours.

82
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,640
We're gonna be Cake's Corner,
doing the Agadoo.

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,040
On your marks. Get set. Bake!

84
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,600
I'm from up north. I love a pastry,

85
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,120
love a sausage roll,
so I'm all over it.

86
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,320
I don't really eat 'em
all that often, if I'm honest.

87
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,640
I don't think the ones
from the shops are all that nice.

88
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,400
Can't really go wrong
with a good sausage roll.

89
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,440
I mean, it can go wrong
in many ways.

90
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,720
It's pastry.
So many ways you can go wrong.

91
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,800
It's Party Week,

92
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,360
and the Signature challenge
is my favourite challenge ever,

93
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
sausage rolls.

94
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,960
I've practised this
quite a lot at home.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,040
I don't want to say,
"Yes, they've all been consistent,"

96
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,400
cos then that means today they're
gonna be horrendous, aren't they?

97
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,960
We've said they can make
any kind of pastry they like

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,560
but I think most of them
will do a rough puff.

99
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,120
It's a shorter way
of doing puff pastry,

100
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,880
cos puff pastry takes hours.

101
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,440
It's quite hot today in the tent,
and obviously butter's going melt

102
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
very, very quickly.

103
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,040
They're going to have
to use that fridge,

104
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,520
keep it chilled all the time,

105
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,880
up until the moment they
actually put it in the oven,

106
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,520
and that will create the lamination,
flake and butteriness

107
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,920
that you need on the exterior
of a good sausage roll.

108
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Next, we go onto
the sausage filling.

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,520
When it comes to flavours,
it's got to pack a punch.

110
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,520
You want that little bit
of moisture in there as well.

111
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,560
You don't want it
too dry or too claggy.

112
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,640
The pastry won't have
much flavour to it,

113
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,800
so the filling needs to stand out.

114
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,360
You can't beat a good sausage roll.

115
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,680
I've baked millions and millions
of sausage rolls in my time,

116
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,040
so this challenge is something
I'm really looking forward to.

117
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,280
Hiya, Cristy. Morning, hello.
Hello, Cristy.

118
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,440
Right, Cristy, tell us all
about your sausage rolls.

119
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,320
My sausage roll is just
a combination of all Paul's
tutorials I've watched.

120
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,440
Oh, right.

121
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,520
Are they the videos where
he's making a sausage roll

122
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,760
but he's wearing just Speedos?

123
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,040
Not seen that one, no.

124
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,120
{\an8}Serving up her take on
Paul's rough puff pastry,

125
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,800
{\an8}Cristy's party sausage rolls
will have a classic

126
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,400
{\an8}pork and sage and onion filling,

127
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,640
{\an8}with a layer of home-made
cranberry sauce.

128
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,520
That looks like
six cloves of garlic.

129
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,880
Lots of garlic, just because
I've got lots of sausage meat.

130
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,600
I don't want it
to taste bland, you know?

131
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,680
I think it sounds lovely.

132
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,880
It does sound a classic one,
doesn't it, with the sage stuffing?

133
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,560
Sounds really good. Yeah, I like it.

134
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,280
Look forward to it. OK, great.
Thank you, Cristy.

135
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,680
Thank you, guys.

136
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,240
Not everyone is staying true
to the much-loved British classic.

137
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,800
My sausage rolls are inspired by
my love of dim sums,

138
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,520
so I'm doing a siu mai
sausage roll.

139
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
So, we're off to the Far East again.

140
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,120
We are. You love it, don't you?

141
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,560
Next you'll be saying there'll be
a soy dip to go with it.

142
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,120
There is a soy dip to go with it,
it's a dipping sauce. Unbelievable.

143
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,960
Mixing up food cultures,

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,800
Dan's dim sum-inspired
sausage rolls will have

145
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,240
{\an8}a punchy pork, prawn,
ginger and garlic filling,

146
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,800
{\an8}with Five Spice-flavoured
rough puff pastry.

147
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,040
I do like siu mai. Yeah.

148
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,240
However, sausage roll, one of my
all-time favourite foods... Well...

149
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,960
And then you blend them together.

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,240
This better be good, Dan.

151
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,200
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. Cheers.

152
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,080
"Don't let me down," I know.

153
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,760
I'm like his son, aren't I?

154
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,920
Josh is also adding ingredients
not usually found in

155
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,120
the humble sausage roll.

156
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,400
I definitely haven't put sprouts
in a sausage roll before.

157
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,680
It wouldn't be Christmas, would it,
if you didn't have sprouts?

158
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,000
We're back in Christmas?

159
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,640
Yes. Oh...

160
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
We've got Christmas.

161
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,200
I've got some turkey mince in there,
some sausage meat as well,

162
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,840
just cos the turkey can
get a bit dry.

163
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,000
I think it's a nice idea.

164
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,560
It's Christmas in a sausage roll,
which can't be a bad thing.

165
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,960
Josh's festive sausage rolls
will be filled with pork,

166
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,280
turkey, Brussels sprouts,
chestnuts and apricots,

167
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,240
along with a layer of
cranberry sauce.

168
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,440
Josh is bringing the party
with his top, look at this!

169
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,720
I know, we've gone all Christmassy.

170
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,360
How's your sausage rolls going?
This is an easy one, innit?

171
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,120
There's quite a lot that can go
wrong still.

172
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,200
What can go wrong?

173
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,320
And you've got
quarterfinal nerves as well.

174
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,920
Oh, don't be nervous,
that's why I'm here,

175
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,040
to calm you down a little bit.
Have I calmed you?

176
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,160
Yeah, you have a lot. Job done.

177
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,120
If the bakers are to achieve

178
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,400
the flaky, laminated layers
the judges expect...

179
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,200
Going to grate some more butter in,
do a little turn.

180
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,800
..their dough must get multiple
turns and oodles of butter.

181
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,440
So, this is frozen butter.

182
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,160
The key is keeping it cold,

183
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,560
otherwise the butter just melts
and then you lose the lamination.

184
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,000
You can see the butter
coming through.

185
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,440
You want it thick,
but I've got very, very warm hands,

186
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,520
so you've just got to work nice
and quickly with it.

187
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,840
Do you like making pastry?

188
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,080
Not as much as Paul.

189
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,800
It's such an odd skill.

190
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,240
"And you will be the fastest,
and you will be the most powerful,

191
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,240
"and you will be good at pastry."

192
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,800
Such a weird thing, isn't it?

193
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,440
With the sun baking the tent,

194
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,320
it's crucial doughs
go back in the fridge

195
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,280
while bakers crack on
with fillings.

196
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,960
A lot of multitasking today,

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,160
because the pastry needs
a lot of time to chill.

198
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,160
# Let's all do the conga

199
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,160
# Let's all do the conga
La-la-la-la

200
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,760
# La-la-la-la... #

201
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,880
It's Party Week!

202
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,320
Imagine the party if you win this
Bake Off.

203
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,400
We'll have a party if
I lose as well.

204
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,800
{\an8}Inspired by picnicking in the park,

205
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,520
{\an8}Tasha's sausage rolls
will be filled with pork,

206
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,240
{\an8}apple and moistened with
a layer of cider,

207
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,200
{\an8}apricot and apple sauce.

208
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,560
I'm looking forward to this.

209
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,400
This is going to taste amazing.
I hope so.

210
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,560
So, how do you feel about
the final now?

211
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,120
Do you think you're in reach?

212
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,520
Whatever happens now,
I'm really proud.

213
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,200
Yeah, but you definitely want to
win, right?

214
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,560
You're talented enough to get
yourself through to the final,

215
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,520
but it's all about
concentrating on each dish

216
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,360
and getting it absolutely correct,

217
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,200
so good luck.

218
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,800
{\an8}Tasha's not the only quarterfinal
baker opting for a fruity flavour.

219
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,760
{\an8}The apples are quite good
in getting some moisture

220
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,960
{\an8}into the sausage rolls.

221
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,800
{\an8}You can't have a dry sausage roll,
can you? That'd be gross.

222
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,040
{\an8}Matty's tweaking classic pork, sage
and onion sausage roll flavours

223
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,640
{\an8}by adding grated apple
and a touch of chilli.

224
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,440
It's kind of like a play on pork
and apple with stuffing. OK.

225
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,880
Sounds like a good idea.
Where are the chilli going?

226
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,200
I've just put, like, half a teaspoon
in the sausage meat.

227
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,600
A little added element.
Hopefully it works.

228
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,040
Fingers crossed.

229
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,400
In addition to punchy flavours
in their fillings...

230
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,800
There's some soy sauce,
ginger, garlic...

231
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,680
Definitely not traditional, no.

232
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,560
..many of the bakers are adding
a fruit sauce...

233
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,040
That is my cranberry sauce.

234
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,960
..to complement their meat
and keep the bake moist.

235
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,560
So, we have apricot sauce,

236
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,800
just to give it a little bit
of something different.

237
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Give it a good squidge.
Everything's banged in there now.

238
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,120
Hello, Dan.

239
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,920
Is this sausage roll going to bring
the party today?

240
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,240
Hopefully so, yes.

241
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,600
What's the best party
you've ever been to?

242
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,120
When I went to Ibiza when I was 20.
I've finally recovered.

243
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,680
My party now, I'm in bed by
about a good eight o'clock.

244
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,920
Me too, you're exactly like me,
that is...

245
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,000
My party is in my bed.
Yeah, I like...

246
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,360
Erm, yeah...
HE LAUGHS

247
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,360
Bakers, you are halfway through.

248
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,120
WHISPERING: That was powerful.
Thank you.

249
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,160
It's time to roll.
Nice and chilled.

250
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,440
I'm looking for about
60 centimetres, and then 15 wide.

251
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,200
Then I've got enough pastry
to fold it over then, hopefully.

252
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,840
It's so cold.

253
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,040
It's gone quite stiff.

254
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,600
I can't have it thick,
cos it'll just be not nice.

255
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,720
I don't know about you,

256
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,280
but I like quite a thick pastry
on a sausage roll.

257
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
The apricot sauce is going to go on.

258
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,440
This is still hot, so I'm going to
have to work really quickly.

259
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,400
Go, go, go.

260
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,840
Good fun, isn't it?

261
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,920
Spread a bit of cranberry sauce
to go on the inside.

262
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,480
A nice bit of sweetness round it

263
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,160
to cut through that really
savoury filling.

264
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,920
We're being generous with
the sausage.

265
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,800
No-one wants a small sausage.

266
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,520
{\an8}You want a good mouthful, don't you?
Yeah.

267
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,480
{\an8}I've given myself enough filling
to have absolutely no excuses.

268
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,400
So, this is the caramelised onions.

269
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,560
I like to make
them all individually.

270
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,360
That helps me keep it uniform.

271
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,880
Just trying to get it sort of
as equal as humanely possible.

272
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,560
I'm pleased with the pastry.

273
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,480
I think it looks really,
really nice.

274
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,400
Right, egg wash, sesame seeds,
sage leaf, sea salt,

275
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,160
and then hopefully it looks nice.

276
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,600
We're going in, yeah.

277
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,920
To prevent the carefully
incorporated butter leaking out,

278
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,880
the sausage rolls must go
into a piping hot oven

279
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,560
for the first blast of heat
to set the pastry.

280
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,200
So, I'm doing them at half
an hour at 200 degrees,

281
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,400
but we're going to flip 'em round
after 15 minutes

282
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,600
so they get an even colour.

283
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,800
They're going to go in, well,

284
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,200
probably till pretty much
near the end,

285
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,920
so 40 minutes.
RAPID BEEPING

286
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,000
OK, that's my timer saying
it's time to hurry up.

287
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,200
But not everyone's oven ready.

288
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,160
Going to have to work like
the bloody clappers now.

289
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,680
These aren't done.

290
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,600
They are not neat sausages.

291
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,520
Oh, I hope they taste good.

292
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,720
Bakers, you have 30 minutes left.

293
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,360
Oh, flipping heck.

294
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,560
Yeah, they look good.

295
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,920
Yeah, you get a bit of, like,
juices come out of it

296
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,200
but I personally love that colour

297
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,560
that you get around
the edge and on the bottom.

298
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
How they looking? They're looking
all right, pretty groovy.

299
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,480
I feel like Paul was quite
frightened that you were putting
prawn in.

300
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,080
He'll either dig his heels in
and go, "No,"

301
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,240
or he'll go, "Yeah, you've
actually surprised me there."

302
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,200
You're quite close to the final now.

303
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,840
Very, very weird. Yeah, yeah.

304
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Who do you think? Josh.

305
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,960
Yeah, I've had my eye on him
since about week three.

306
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,640
Yeah, your card's marked, sunshine.
You know what it's like.

307
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,840
They're all your friends,
but ultimately...

308
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,160
Ultimately, you wanna take 'em down.
"Going to crush you." Yeah.

309
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,840
They're OK, they're puffing up.

310
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,040
I'm just debating when to change
the racks round.

311
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,960
They're all right, to be fair.

312
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,840
Not far off being done.

313
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,080
One tray, one shelf now,

314
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,280
so that I can get
a nice even colour on them.

315
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,480
The sausage meat's squeezing out.

316
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,800
They're all soggy at the bottom.

317
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,120
This part here's horrendous, cos
you just second guess everything.

318
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,080
You don't look at them
and think they look nice,

319
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,320
you look at them and think,
"What are they going to say?"

320
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,960
The ones underneath, the ones
underneath aren't getting cooked.

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,280
How long have we got?
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

322
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,840
TASHA: Oh, my God!

323
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,480
Right, I'm going to take
them out now.

324
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,680
For Paul's most beloved bake,

325
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,920
the judges expect nothing less than
mouth-watering, delicious
fillings...

326
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,320
Could do with a bit more colour.

327
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,000
They look like they're cooked
but I just want them to get dark.

328
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,400
..and delectably rich, tender
pastry.

329
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,320
Holy mackerel. Nuclear, them.

330
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,600
Yeah, all good, look great.

331
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,240
Yeah, they look all right,
to be fair.

332
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,480
I've actually done them for
five minutes longer than normal.

333
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,120
Just thought,
an extra bit of browning.

334
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
Going to take 'em out.

335
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,320
They're going to be soggy.

336
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,480
Not the prettiest things in
the world.

337
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,480
They just don't look good.

338
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,840
They might taste amazing,
just be ugly on the outside.

339
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,560
Oh, my gosh.

340
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Bakers, that is your time
on your Signature.

341
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,880
Step way from your sausage rolls.

342
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,120
And if you've got any scraps for me,

343
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,320
I love munching on a sausage!

344
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,720
Can't wait to get involved in
Dan's sausage.

345
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,200
Ooh, me too.

346
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,880
{\an1}LAUGHTER

347
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,520
{\an8}The bakers' party sausage rolls

348
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,800
{\an8}now face the judgment
of Paul and Prue.

349
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,480
Hello, Tasha. Hi, Tash.

350
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,440
I do think they look good.

351
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,360
You can see the lamination,
it's beautiful.

352
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,200
You obviously made some very good
pastry dough

353
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,760
but you just ran out of time
somewhere along the line

354
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,240
cos they needed longer in the oven.

355
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,920
Mm, I love that. Thank you.

356
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,320
Flavour is superb.

357
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,720
The apricot works beautifully well
with it. Absolutely lovely.

358
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,040
The only issue is the bake.

359
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,360
It's too soggy.

360
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,320
It needed another ten minutes
to make that flaky and beautiful.

361
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,120
But your filling is exceptional.

362
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,720
Pop them back in the oven for
ten minutes, have 'em for lunch.

363
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,320
I'll switch it on now.

364
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
Like the colour,

365
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,080
they do look all right
with those seeds on there as well.

366
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,440
They do look good.

367
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,040
Nice bit of flake there.

368
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,800
So, it's prawns and pork, isn't it?
Yeah. Hmm.

369
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,320
It certainly tastes Chinese.

370
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,840
Um, I'm not keen on the flavour. OK.

371
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,600
It's not my favourite thing. Yeah.
The flavours are delicious,

372
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,600
I'm just not used to them
in a sausage roll.

373
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,360
Anything's allowed in pastry,
surely?

374
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,200
But not a sausage roll!

375
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,040
Thank you very much. Ah, cheers.
Thank you very much, nice one.

376
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,560
Win some, you lose some, don't you?

377
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,760
I can see a bit
of lamination there.

378
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,880
I can see it, but with a laminated
dough you expect that lamination

379
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,200
to grow so you don't end up
with gaps.

380
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,480
These are very gappy.

381
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,040
It needed longer in the oven.

382
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,160
Does it taste like Christmas Day?

383
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,000
It's got the sharpness
coming from the cranberry.

384
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,560
It's a bit dry, the sausage meat.

385
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,760
It's quite solid.

386
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,080
It is a tiny bit dry,
but I think the flavour is terrific,

387
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,560
and I like the texture,

388
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,880
but if the pastry was a little more
baked, I think it would be perfect.

389
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,240
Thank you. Well done. Thank you.

390
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,880
Happy with them?
No, at home they got a lot darker.

391
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,440
They do look a bit pale.

392
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,320
Yeah, got a bit of
a soggy bottom there.

393
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,960
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

394
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,640
They smell good.
They are a little under-baked.

395
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,720
They are.

396
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,440
I quite like the flavour.

397
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,880
I think the flavour's good and
it's well-balanced, well-seasoned.

398
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,480
The pastry is your weak link.

399
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,760
It comes down to the baking. Yeah.

400
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,720
I think that that filling
is absolutely perfect.

401
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,600
The sharpness you get from
the cranberry is delicious.

402
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,160
But I agree about the pastry,
under-baked and too thick.

403
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,720
I love the shape of them,
they're nice and round.

404
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,440
Couple of things
I really like about them.

405
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,600
One, I like the colour.

406
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,200
You've got a nice strong
bake underneath.

407
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,240
But you see the layers here,
the lamination. Yeah.

408
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,320
That's a good sign, there.

409
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,120
They do look very nice.

410
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,400
Ooh, nice crisp.

411
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,640
Nice bit of kick there
from the chilli.

412
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,240
Little bit of chilli flakes, yeah.

413
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,720
{\an1}HE GASPS

414
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
TASHA: Aww!

415
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,120
Thank you for bringing me
a sausage roll.

416
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,880
It's a very good sausage roll.

417
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,960
It's delicious.

418
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,800
The onions really work,
the apple really works.

419
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,920
The chilli is great in there.

420
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
It's really good.

421
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,640
Thank you, Matthew.

422
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,280
That went well!

423
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,880
I never thought
about getting a handshake.

424
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,400
It kind of took me by surprise.

425
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,040
I'm pretty happy with that, yeah.

426
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,440
Happy with that!

427
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,480
I fully expected worse.

428
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
I knew that they needed
baking longer.

429
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,320
Bit of a mixed bag, but, you know,

430
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,520
I've taken a few risks.

431
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,720
Some pay off, some don't.

432
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,960
Prue liked 'em.

433
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,360
Next up,

434
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,480
the bakers have no idea
what they'll be asked to make

435
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,040
in the mystery that is
the Technical challenge.

436
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,720
Welcome back for your
Technical challenge,

437
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,440
set by the life and soul of any
good shindig, it's Paul Hollywood.

438
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,440
Paul, any trinkets, nuggets
or words of wisdom?

439
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,280
You'll all know this for sure.

440
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
It's a very, very famous bake,

441
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,000
so just read the recipe carefully
and enjoy it.

442
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,040
OK, Paul and Prue are going
to take a little time out

443
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,840
before they get over-excitable
and start showing off in front
of their friends.

444
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,440
Thank you, guys. Bye-bye.

445
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,640
Paul would love you to make

446
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,080
a chocolate caterpillar cake.

447
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,440
So, your caterpillar should be made
of a chocolate Swiss roll sponge,

448
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,520
filled with a chocolate
meringue buttercream,

449
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,880
and then coated in
a silky-smooth ganache.

450
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,400
Not forgetting the chocolate
and meringue features

451
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,680
that will bring
your caterpillar to life.

452
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,600
You only have two and a half hours
for this.

453
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,640
We were going to give you
three hours,

454
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,520
but we didn't want your caterpillars
to metamorphosise into butterflies.

455
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,240
On your marks. Get set! Bake!

456
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,040
A staple of any birthday
in our house.

457
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,280
Yes, even my own.

458
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,920
Never made one, though.

459
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,520
I've had a few varieties
from a few different shops.

460
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,720
We've got 16 steps.

461
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,680
There's a lot of components
to this one.

462
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,200
So, Paul,
the famous caterpillar cake.

463
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,120
It's a terrific challenge.

464
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,400
It's a Swiss roll sponge,
which they've all done many times.

465
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,720
The trick is getting the bake right.

466
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,160
Overbaking it by a minute,
it's going to be bone dry.

467
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
What's important
is to create the ridges.

468
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,640
We've explained how
and where to cut the strips,

469
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,400
and it creates these bumps all
the way along.

470
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,560
Inside, they have the
Swiss meringue buttercream.

471
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,640
On top of that they've got to
put a ganache.

472
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,640
The decoration, this is where
they can have a little bit

473
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,720
of their artistic flair.
Have a bit of fun with it.

474
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,440
All kids love that
at a birthday party.

475
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,560
Well, I quite like it too,
give me a bit.

476
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,840
There you go.

477
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,280
It's the right proportion
of buttercream to cake

478
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,240
and that looks like
really light cake.

479
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,360
The ganache, with the buttercream,

480
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,960
with that chocolate sponge,
it's three hits of chocolate.

481
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,040
I think it's lovely.

482
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,440
On my birthday, Prue, you'll
have to make me one of these.

483
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,640
I'll have a caterpillar cake. OK.

484
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,800
Step one, "Make a chocolate
Swiss roll sponge."

485
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,640
Just whipped up my eggs and sugar

486
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,880
and I'm going to fold through
the cocoa powder and flour

487
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,880
to try and keep as much
air in as possible.

488
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,280
For the light, delicate bake
the judges expect...

489
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,680
Don't want to get any lumps,
obviously,

490
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,560
but also you don't want
to knock the air out.

491
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
..ingredients must be
gently combined.

492
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,640
Over-mix, and the baker's sponge
will be dense.

493
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,080
Happy with that.

494
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,640
Are you familiar with this cake?

495
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,120
Is there anyone who doesn't know
this cake?

496
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,400
Do you know what?
It's one of my favourite cakes ever.

497
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,480
Yeah. But the thing is,

498
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,360
can you believe
you've got to the semifinals?

499
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,120
Sorry, it's not the semifinals,
sorry.

500
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,480
That's a bit awks, ain't it?

501
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,160
Uh, I'm rushing the show on.
That's really awkward.

502
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,520
Can you believe you won?

503
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,240
{\an1}LAUGHTER

504
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,320
How does it feel?
Thank you, everyone!

505
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,760
Get it in to bake.

506
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,880
See you in a bit.

507
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,600
It doesn't give us
a bake time, as per usual.

508
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
They bake very quickly,
Swiss rolls,

509
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,400
so not going to bake it
for too long.

510
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,160
Try that for ten.
See what it looks like.

511
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,640
12 minutes, going to check it.

512
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,720
Next one is to make
the batch of Swiss meringue.

513
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,840
I've not done a Swiss meringue
for a long time, so what I'll do is

514
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,520
look over my shoulder and copy
what someone else is doing.

515
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,240
When you're making Swiss meringue,
you are whisking sugar

516
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,160
and egg white together
over a bain-marie.

517
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,960
# Piece of cake when someone
else is doing it...

518
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
# ..and you can steal it off them. #

519
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,720
How'd it go before?
Did they like yours?

520
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,280
No. Why, cos it had prawn in it?

521
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,080
It was a bit dry as well, so, yeah.

522
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,560
You've gotta make this one count.
I have gotta make this one count.

523
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,800
Anything out of the top three,
I think you're in trouble tomorrow.

524
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,360
# No room for er-ror

525
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,120
# There's not at a-all. #

526
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,720
I can see that it's starting
to get a lot thicker now.

527
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,880
Must be done,
cos it's got no sugar grains

528
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,800
and it's holding
really stiff peaks.

529
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
Happy with that.

530
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,920
Add butter to meringue
into the bowl.

531
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,400
Now I just need to
fold in the chocolate.

532
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,960
Should be delicious, though.

533
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,360
That is flipping lovely.

534
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,440
Quickly just check my sponge.

535
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,600
Feel like that's done.

536
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,480
Yeah, I'm happy with that.

537
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,320
OK, that's looking all right.

538
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,800
Cake's all cracked.

539
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,240
Bit of a bummer.

540
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,080
Hopefully be all right.

541
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,120
Bakers, you are halfway through.

542
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,280
I'm going to colour
the Swiss meringue.

543
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,040
"Divide between three small bowls.
Colour one green, red and yellow."

544
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,560
That's a lovely red colour, that is.

545
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,520
How green are we going?
Oh, it's a birthday party.

546
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,000
Really green.

547
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,520
"Pipe small seven meringue kisses
of each colour."

548
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,680
So, I take it these are going to be
for the top of the caterpillar?

549
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,600
And then you've got to pipe legs.

550
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,360
And then green antenna.

551
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,120
Swiss meringue, how long's
that going to bake for?

552
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,160
Meringue takes a long time.
Low and slow.

553
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,120
Get 'em in babes, get 'em in.

554
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,000
So, obviously you're familiar
with caterpillar cakes, right?

555
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,120
I mean I've eaten 'em,
but I've eaten loads of stuff

556
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,080
and couldn't tell you
how to make most of it.

557
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,680
I am going to do the face.

558
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,360
"Melt white chocolate,
pour into the lined cutter."

559
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,240
So, I'm going to let it set and then
puts its little features on.

560
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,480
You could have it as me.

561
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,680
You could create my face...
Shall I try? ..on your caterpillar.

562
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,600
I'd probably do you
an injustice though.

563
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,880
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

564
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,480
Come on, guys, this is serious.

565
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,480
"To create the ridges on the
caterpillar, you need to cut

566
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,920
"some strips out of a sponge."

567
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,280
"Make 13 cuts
1.5 centimetres apart."

568
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,120
I think we've just got to bite
the bullet and go for it, I think.

569
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
Right.

570
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,880
There we go.

571
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,760
Isn't going to be that way, it's
going to be that way, isn't it?

572
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,880
Like a flipping dog's dinner,
this sponge.

573
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,560
Like that.

574
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,280
"Now remove seven of
the fingers of the sponge."

575
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Five...

576
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,200
"Spread the Swiss meringue
buttercream over sponge

577
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,960
"and re-roll
from the non-ridge end."

578
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,120
What's the non-ridge end?

579
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,080
Have I gone the right way here?

580
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,720
Should have gone that way,
shouldn't I?

581
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,920
You doughnut.

582
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,160
I've done it wrong.

583
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm re-making it.

584
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,920
I'm going to try.

585
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,280
OK, let's go.

586
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,840
OK, this is not fiddly
in the slightest.

587
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,000
Now we roll.

588
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,520
Just do a bit at a time.

589
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,880
Not the prettiest of caterpillars.

590
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,080
Go on, my son.

591
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,080
Oh, yeah! OK.

592
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,800
So I might as well go with
what I've done now.

593
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,080
Going in.

594
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,960
Going to try my best.

595
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,200
{\an1}SHE SIGHS

596
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,840
Best thing I can do here is
I'll cut that off.

597
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,840
A very small caterpillar, isn't it?

598
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,120
Got a swirl.
I was expecting a better shape.

599
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,600
What will be, will be.

600
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,120
I think my cake might be a little
bit dry, but we'll move on.

601
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,520
Cover it in chocolate
and hope for the best.

602
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,720
Splodge a bit more on
just in case, eh?

603
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,360
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

604
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Flipping heck.

605
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,560
Not very long.

606
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,840
That's done.

607
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,840
"Make a chocolate ganache
to coat the cake."

608
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,920
Heating the cream to the point
where it should melt the chocolate.

609
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,880
I'm going to spread it with my
palette knife for the control.

610
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,720
Fingers crossed we are hiding
a world of sin.

611
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,040
"Create features for the face."

612
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,560
Rosy cheeks may look quite nice,
ooh!

613
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,800
This'll be the best bit of
the whole cake, I think.

614
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,960
This is Noel.

615
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,600
How big shall I make your sideburns?
Massive. Massive.

616
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,640
How big do you want your pupils?
This is going to be you. Massive.

617
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,040
Just surprise me.

618
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
Very excited.

619
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,720
It looks fairly cute.

620
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,360
MATTY: It was supposed to be
a little cuter.

621
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,600
Roll it up.
Still quite warm, you know.

622
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,800
Get it in that freezer.

623
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,360
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

624
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,560
I can't wait for a pint,
let me tell you.

625
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,120
Just gotta let it chill for, like,
a minute or something.

626
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,480
Also, there's a squirrel in
this freezer. That's not funny.

627
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,920
I don't know who did that.

628
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,840
It's gotta stop, that sort of stuff.

629
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,680
Oh, come on.
Ganache, ganache, come on.

630
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,600
Right, what do I do for the face?

631
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,400
Now, where shall I stick his face?

632
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,800
It's not quite the children's party
I was hoping for.

633
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,320
God, that's terrifying.

634
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,520
And decorate.

635
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,320
Splodge them on everywhere,
basically.

636
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,000
Legs.

637
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,920
I forgot to pipe antennas.

638
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
Idiot.

639
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,920
Bakers, you have one minute left.

640
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,400
{\an8}Right, come on, let's move it.

641
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
Get the meringues on.

642
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,960
I think you need to do it again.
Shut up!

643
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,200
I need to put the soil
round it now, don't I?

644
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,600
Soil, soil it all up.

645
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,280
Move, move, move, move.

646
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,040
Dan, can I use your crumbs?
Go for it, do you need any more?

647
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,680
Do you wanna take some of this
off mine? Oh, yeah, anything.

648
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
Yeah, let's just go for it.
Just stick that there.

649
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,320
I'm not allowed to help you, sorry.
OK.

650
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,560
I'm sorry, Noel,
but you have been done dirty.

651
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,360
He's a bit weird,
but we still love him.

652
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,600
DAN: He's a beauty!

653
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,960
Bakers, your time is up.

654
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,200
Please bring your caterpillars
down to the gingham table

655
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,160
and place them behind
your photographs.

656
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,080
If anyone buys me one
of these for my birthday

657
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,640
I'm going to literally be fuming.

658
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,920
I think I made a mistake
by doing Noel.

659
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,400
He's terrifying.

660
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,280
{\an8}It's judgment time
for the bakers' caterpillar cakes.

661
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,800
Paul and Prue are looking
for a light sponge

662
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,440
with a smooth chocolate
buttercream filling,

663
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,640
coated with a shiny ganache,
decorated with meringue features.

664
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,240
As always... OK.

665
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,360
..they have no idea
whose bake is whose.

666
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,880
Shall we start with this
strange-looking animal here?

667
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,040
This is unusual.

668
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,840
It's quite a scary-looking face,
to be honest.

669
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,800
It is quite scary,
but it's quite neat.

670
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,040
It's got lots of legs.

671
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,800
No antennae. It looks like a train.

672
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,960
The filling doesn't look too bad.

673
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,800
There's a little bit of
a swirl there.

674
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,240
Lots of buttercream in there.
Yeah, there is.

675
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,760
The chocolate in there's quite nice.

676
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,280
The sponge feels quite dry, though.

677
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,080
I think that's slightly overdone.

678
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,880
Moving on, this seems
slightly all over the place.

679
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,160
Running out of time
could have been a big problem.

680
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,920
The legs are there, no antennae.

681
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,800
This one feels
a bit softer on the sponge.

682
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,920
Yeah, it does, and a little less
buttercream, which is good.

683
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
A little less.

684
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,040
The Swiss meringue buttercream
is delicious on that

685
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,120
and the ganache is pretty good.
And the cake is good.

686
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,320
I don't think it's
particularly neat, though.

687
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,400
Moving on to this one.

688
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,680
Legs are good, antenna is there.

689
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,800
{\an1}It's got Noel's face on the front.
LAUGHTER

690
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,440
With his tongue stuck out.

691
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,720
Yeah. But it's not scary.

692
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,120
Thanks, Prue. Mine or the cake?

693
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,000
I like the decoration on this,
I think it's pretty good.

694
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,200
Yeah, I think it's good.

695
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,760
It's very light.

696
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,680
That is delicious.
That's a kid's delight.

697
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,840
I mean, that's... It's gorgeous.

698
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,480
That's a kids' birthday party,
that's amazing.

699
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,520
It's delicious. Moving on.

700
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,920
It's a bit short on legs,
this caterpillar.

701
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,080
Very much so.

702
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,080
Everything's in place,
it just looks a bit messy.

703
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,440
Oop...

704
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,280
Bit drier, that one.

705
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,040
Cake is bit drier,
but it's still delicious.

706
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,160
It is lovely.

707
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,040
This looks a bit of a mess.

708
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,840
This is a very skinny caterpillar.
It's a very small one, yeah.

709
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,320
Look at the size of those legs.

710
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,960
I don't think the baker understood
about how to make the ridges.

711
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,600
Yeah, it's very, very small.
At some kid's party,

712
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,960
they'd be a little bit disappointed
with this one.

713
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,960
It seems to be all Swiss meringue
buttercream than sponge.

714
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,920
Over-mixed, over-baked,
either-either or both.

715
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,160
Very good face, though.

716
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,520
The caterpillar cakes will now be
ranked from last to first place.

717
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,160
In fifth spot, we have this one.

718
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,440
That's me.

719
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,320
Dan, not quite sure what this is.

720
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,760
I cut my things the wrong way.
Hence it's small.

721
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,960
In fourth place we have this one.

722
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Josh. Tastes all right,
but the cake's a bit tough.

723
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,360
And in third spot, we have this one.

724
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,040
Matty, the sponge was a
little bit dry

725
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,640
but you managed to get all
the elements pretty much there.

726
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,080
In second place we have this one.

727
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,320
Who's that?

728
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,960
Cristy,
this tastes absolutely delicious

729
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,280
and it's a beautifully made sponge
but it doesn't look great.

730
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,040
I had to remake it all
and rush it. sorry.

731
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,600
And in first spot, we have this one.

732
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,680
Tasha, this is pretty good.

733
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,320
You have all the elements in place
and it's beautifully round as well.

734
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,040
That's a decent cake, well done.

735
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,320
Even if it does look like Noel.

736
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,720
First in Technical.

737
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,320
Maybe I'll just base everything on
Noel's face from now on.

738
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,720
I knew I was going to come last.

739
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,240
It's tough when you're working at
the front,

740
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,320
you can't see what everyone else is
doing behind you, can you?

741
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,800
That's the problem,
you can't copy people.

742
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,160
I mean,
it was an absolute nightmare.

743
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,040
Never want to do it again,
but I can't believe it.

744
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,400
I'm so proud of myself.

745
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,080
Party Week, Matty's definitely
bringing the party.

746
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,400
He got a handshake,

747
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,560
those sausage rolls were
off the scale.

748
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,320
They were,
but he was third in Technical,

749
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,920
so he let himself down a bit.

750
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,080
Tasha won the Technical.

751
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,400
Obviously, she slightly cheated by
using my face on a caterpillar.

752
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,840
Obviously she was going to
win with your face on it.

753
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,320
It's between Matty and Tash

754
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,480
who at the moment are
in line for Star Baker.

755
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,240
That leaves Josh,
Cristy and Dan in trouble.

756
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,360
I'm so surprised at Dan,

757
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,600
because Dan started off
the Star Baker.

758
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,040
Is there anything in the fact that
when you become Star Baker,

759
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,360
then the following week
you're rubbish?

760
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,760
Oh, darling, it's the curse of
Star Baker. It's well-known.

761
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
It's actually a real thing.

762
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,680
Also, if they win Star Baker, then
next week I turn their ovens off.

763
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,800
Welcome back, bakers,

764
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,720
to your final challenge
of Party Week.

765
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,160
Let's hope no-one goes too hard
too soon.

766
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,400
That's true.

767
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,520
Now...
SHE WHEEZES WITH LAUGHTER

768
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,840
That's my life mantra.

769
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,320
{\an1}THEY SIGH

770
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,200
So, for your Showstopper challenge,

771
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,120
the judges would like you to create

772
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,680
an incredible
anything-but-beige buffet.

773
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,840
We don't want beige,

774
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,680
so let's hope none
of you are thinking

775
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,280
of serving up my Auntie June's
living room,

776
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,200
which is a hell of a beige room.

777
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,080
Paul and Prue would love you
to create a colourful

778
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,000
and highly decorative display of
a mixture of sweet

779
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,120
and savoury party bakes.

780
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,920
You have a whopping four-and-a-half
hours to complete this task.

781
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,360
So don't waste it, party people.

782
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,880
We wanna see you twerking.

783
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,120
On your marks. Get set. Bake!

784
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,200
Stacks of work, not enough time,
living the dream,

785
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,920
what can go wrong? Everything.

786
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,360
Biggest challenge is just trying
to get all the components made

787
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,600
and give myself enough time
to get a nice decorative finish
on everything, really.

788
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:36,880
It's like order of operations.
I'm just gonna try and stay calm.

789
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,560
The bakers' tricky task is
to reinvent

790
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,880
the buffet's stale image of beige,

791
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:47,160
bland bakes by creating colourful
and highly decorative party food.

792
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,480
I am starting off with my bread.

793
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,400
I'm using beetroot just to colour,
you can't taste it at all.

794
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,840
This is gonna be a,
a couronne so a bread.

795
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,800
I've got the green colouring by
using some pureed spinach.

796
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,320
We want a mixture of savoury
and sweet.

797
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,000
At least 12 of each of them.

798
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,120
We're actually asking them to
do quite a big catering job.

799
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,000
Four-and-a-half hours is long,
isn't it?

800
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,640
I know. I, I did ask for six.
I got politely turned down.

801
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,040
To do multiple baking, it's about
your timetable.

802
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,960
While something's in
the oven or cooling or in

803
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,400
the fridge you should be cracking on
with something else.

804
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,840
If there's a dead time,
you're doing something wrong.

805
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:24,360
I'm trying to multitask,
which is far from my forte.

806
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,800
Getting close now,

807
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,280
it's semifinals next week

808
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,400
and I want to see the bakers really
show off what they can do

809
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,600
but they don't wanna push themselves

810
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,840
too much that they fall off
the cliff.

811
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,320
I do think that many great bakers
slip up

812
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,320
because they're too ambitious.

813
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,520
You can have the most
wonderful vision

814
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,040
but if you can't make it happen in

815
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,760
the time it's not gonna be
worth anything.

816
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,680
In this gigantic challenge...

817
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,320
Is that your first book?

818
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,480
Yeah, my first book, yeah,
there's only 26 things to do.

819
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,160
..Josh and Tasha are starting
with savoury breads...

820
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,680
I'm gonna make a pesto,
which I'm gonna mix into it.

821
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,760
So you've got some be
beautiful flavours.

822
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,120
..while Dan, Matty and Cristy kick
off with pastry.

823
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,040
I've got curry powder
and turmeric going in there.

824
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,120
So it'll be bright yellow.

825
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,800
That's the shortcrust pastry
for my curry pies.

826
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,120
Hello, Dan.
Good morning. Hello, Dan.

827
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,840
How we doing, all right?
Hello, hello.

828
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,600
Dan, we need to know
about your buffet.

829
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,920
So I'm doing a prehistoric-themed
anything but beige buffet today.

830
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,040
For my savoury element, I'm doing
chicken curry dinosaur feet.

831
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,280
They'll be trotting up my
presentation board.

832
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,040
For my sweet elements I'm doing some
ankylosaurus tea cakes.

833
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,400
Tell us about them.

834
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,000
Apparently they had a brain
the size of a walnut

835
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,200
so I'm putting a little walnut
on top for decoration

836
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,760
cos they had like armour on as well.

837
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,600
Yeah. And two little fondant horns
and a big grumpy face.

838
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,040
Clever.

839
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,640
Dan's giant Jurassic buffet features
not only savoury dinosaur feet

840
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,240
curry pies but sweet,
lemon shortbread fossils,

841
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,480
ankylosaurus head teacakes,

842
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,960
cake pop stones

843
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,840
and white chocolate dinosaur eggs
in chocolate nests.

844
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,000
How many things are you doing,
five, six?

845
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,040
Six. This is so ambitious.
Maybe he'll pull it off.

846
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,360
To be honest it's simple elements
done, hopefully, really
well that's what I'm hoping today.

847
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,520
Thank you very much. Thank you very
much, cheers. Thank you.

848
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,680
I've got a lot to do it appears,
doesn't it? Yeah!

849
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,560
While Dan's plan is quantity,

850
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,640
doing half as many bakes,
Josh is prioritising precision.

851
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,160
A very, very meticulous
schedule for today.

852
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,560
It's the quarterfinal
so I've planned things down

853
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,880
to it, every single ingredient is
thought through

854
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,040
and has a reason why I did it.

855
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,600
Creating his second Christmas-themed
bake of the competition,

856
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,360
Josh's festive buffet will have
sweet white chocolate

857
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,800
and coconut snowman macarons,

858
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,720
choux bun Christmas puddings
with chocolate craquelin.

859
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,120
His savoury bake will be

860
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,680
a traditional French Christmas

861
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,480
couronne wreath with cheese,

862
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,680
spinach and pesto.

863
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,920
What do you love about Christmas?

864
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,440
I love doing the themed baking
you see. So Christmas is an easy one

865
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,640
to do isn't it, cos there's so many
Christmas bakes, isn't there?

866
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,400
There's something quite
elf-like about you.

867
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,120
I've got elf socks I nearly wore
today. It's too hot.

868
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,440
Have you? I was gonna have them up
here with red and white.

869
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,200
Put 'em on for the judging.

870
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,320
When it comes to their
savoury bakes...

871
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,000
It'll be spicy,
a little bit of a kick to it.

872
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,080
..the bakers need to ensure
they deliver not only on colour

873
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,360
but delicious flavour.

874
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,200
I'm just putting madras curry powder
in it.

875
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,440
It goes really nice with
coconut milk, I've found.

876
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,920
So more than one baker's
embracing Indian flavours.

877
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,440
So we've got curry
powder, fenugreek.

878
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,480
I guess it's like a take on a balti

879
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,000
but I don't wanna call it that in
case I've, erm,

880
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,240
not quite hit the brief.
If I call it curry, it's open-ended.

881
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,400
PE teacher Matty's going sporty

882
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,200
with curry-filled colourful
cricket ball pies,

883
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,320
basketball creme brulee doughnuts,

884
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,160
green tennis ball macarons

885
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,520
and a golf course of chocolate
and orange cupcakes.

886
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,880
Oh, this is the party I wanna be at.

887
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,760
Pies, cupcakes, doughnuts.

888
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,600
Is this the sort of buffet you'd put
on for your kids at school?

889
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,240
No. No!

890
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,200
I'd have a buffet all day
long, a Chinese buffet.

891
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,880
Oh, yeah. Oh, come on.

892
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,200
If the bakers are to deliver
the kind of spread

893
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,800
the judges expect it means juggling
both savoury bakes and sweet.

894
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,680
This is pistachio
and raspberry Viennese biscuit.

895
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,840
Pretty strong flavours.

896
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,680
That is just fossil biscuits.
Trilobites and ammonites.

897
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,320
The flavours are chocolate

898
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,520
and orange, which is hopefully gonna
be quite nice.

899
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,400
Also going big on chocolate...

900
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,240
Making my Swiss roll.

901
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,640
..Cristy's celebrating
a king of confectionery.

902
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,960
The theme's Willy Wonka.

903
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,160
When I was a child that was my
favourite film so,

904
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,200
yeah, hopefully I'll do it justice.

905
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,320
Full of innovation,

906
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,840
Cristy's marvellous sweet factory
buffet will have pink chocolate

907
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,360
Swiss roll lollipops

908
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,160
and lemon meringue cupcakes

909
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,760
topped with toadstools.

910
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,880
Her savoury bake continues the theme

911
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,200
with candy cane style cheese twists

912
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,160
and spiced beef and onion patties

913
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,800
shaped as sweets.

914
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,800
It's going to be one of those things
that twists your brain.

915
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,160
It looks sweet. Yeah.

916
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,480
And it's going to be savoury.
Yeah, that sort of thing, yeah.

917
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,680
I like the sound of this.

918
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,320
I've practised loads but God knows
what'll happen in here.

919
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,640
Hopefully it'll be good.
Yeah. Thank you, Cristy.

920
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,720
Thank you, guys.

921
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,040
With one hour gone, a batch
of sweet bakes are the first

922
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,080
to hit the oven.

923
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,280
170 for 20 minutes.

924
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,400
And the bakers are on to assembling
their savoury breads and pastries.

925
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,320
Just putting my dinosaur feet
together now.

926
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,760
They're like canapes really.
Just bitesize trinkets.

927
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,880
This is the beef and onion
filling for the pastries.

928
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,320
The pies are red because they're
gonna be cricket balls.

929
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,440
I'm hoping that it dies down
a little bit,

930
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,360
it's quite vibrant at the moment.

931
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,600
Looks beautiful. Nice and green,
very well proved. This is all good.

932
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,720
I'm actually just gonna stick it
back in for

933
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,560
a bit longer.
It's not quite stretchy enough.

934
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,800
All the bread dread.
So I'm doing a farmyard party.

935
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,240
It's basically how I remember
my parties.

936
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,280
I'm sure my parents remember them as
being very stressful with a lot

937
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,360
of like six-year-olds
running around, high on sugar.

938
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,680
But, erm, I remember them being
great.

939
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,040
Tasha's farmyard buffet celebrates
parties from her childhood

940
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,160
with sweet choux bun lambs filled

941
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,920
with blackberry creme diplomat,

942
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,960
raspberry and pistachio biscuit
wagon wheels,

943
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,200
and after taking Star Baker in
Bread Week, she hopes

944
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,200
to play to her strengths with
za'atar and sumac milk bread pigs.

945
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,560
Bread Week was great week for me

946
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,320
but this is the Bake Off
and I don't wanna get complacent.

947
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,720
Cupcakes are done.

948
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,880
We're onto the doughnuts, which
I already regret deciding

949
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,280
to do cos they
need to prove twice.

950
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,160
Biscuits are done. So I'm gonna move
on to my ankylosaurus teacakes.

951
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,000
This is the candy cane twists.

952
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,440
When they're done, they'll look
quite good cos they're twisted with

953
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,800
the white dough.

954
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,360
I've got pesto, fresh tomato,

955
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,760
sundried tomatoes
and some cheese for the couronne.

956
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,240
Just gonna get these shaped

957
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,520
and then they just need
to be proved and then baked.

958
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,480
Do you think you've learnt
a lot from the tent?

959
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,920
Yeah, I've, I've learnt loads.

960
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,720
I've followed Paul for a long time.

961
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,160
When you say you've followed Paul
for a long time, do you mean online?

962
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,200
I've followed him on
the Bake Off and obviously with,

963
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,080
uh, with his books and things.

964
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,200
Yeah, sort of tailgating his car.

965
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,360
I sometimes get in his glove box.

966
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,960
He reaches in there for
a Marlboro and I go, "Ah!"

967
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,960
and he's like, "Aaah!"

968
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,680
Bakers, you are halfway through.

969
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,800
I'm behind time.
They needed to be proving ages ago.

970
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,520
Do you wanna feel?

971
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,240
I like the big one.

972
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,600
In you go, kidda.

973
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,560
Get my pies in.

974
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,640
Anything but beige, that's a hell of
a title, isn't it, for a buffet?

975
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,120
Half an hour at 180.

976
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,360
We've got curries from Dan again.

977
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,240
He's doing about six things.

978
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,240
I'd rather he does three
and smashes it out of

979
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,760
the park than six which
are adequate.

980
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,880
These are gonna be my
dinosaur eggs.

981
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,400
But some of them are more simple
than others,

982
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,720
maybe he'll pull it off.
He sometimes does.

983
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,760
I am making choux pastry now
for my choux lambs.

984
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,560
Tasha and Dan are always the ones
who are most ambitious.

985
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,400
I've gotta get an absolute
wriggle on.

986
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,720
They're in at 180
for about 20 minutes.

987
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,320
Josh is back at Christmas.

988
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,320
Christmas.
The couronne idea with the spinach,

989
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,960
it may look OK. I'm a bit concerned

990
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,120
about the flavour being
a little bit bland.

991
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,640
This is snowmen macarons.

992
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,280
Just wanted to try and show some
more skills today with these.

993
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,280
170 for 25 minutes.

994
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,760
I think when you look at Matty,
fairly straightforward.

995
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,240
What's next? Um, macarons.

996
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,560
Matty looks quite organised.

997
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,360
He does actually, he does.

998
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,280
It's the meringue for the top of
the little lemon meringue pies.

999
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,240
And Cristy,
I love her Willy Wonka theme.

1000
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,720
Yeah... Yeah.

1001
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,120
I think she's got a good idea.

1002
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,240
The only danger is over-complicating
them and therefore messing them up.

1003
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,040
I think at this stage in
the quarterfinals,

1004
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,960
starting to whittle it down
and I think it's,

1005
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,440
it's getting more
and more complicated to judge this.

1006
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,400
# Running round the tent
Running round the tent

1007
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,840
# Running round, running round
Running round the tent. #

1008
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,960
Bakers, you have one hour left
of this party.

1009
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,560
This is outrageous.

1010
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,280
We're gonna kick you out in an hour.

1011
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,560
We have to go to bed.
We've gotta get some sleep.

1012
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,280
We're getting a bit tighter on
time now with everything.

1013
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,120
Pig breads in the oven.

1014
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,000
What am I doing now? Anybody know?

1015
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,720
Oh, yeah, I'm now gonna get the
ankylosaurus teacakes filled.

1016
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,800
Pies are demoulded.
Um, macarons are in.

1017
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,800
They need 14 minutes.
So we're onto the doughnuts.

1018
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,720
Couple of minutes each side.
I just go by sight.

1019
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,640
Never used a deep fat fryer though.

1020
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,560
Yeah, I'm really pleased with
the bread,

1021
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,040
looking nice and green.
15 minutes for the macarons.

1022
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,000
Gonna quickly make the ganache
and get the jam on now for those.

1023
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,360
I just hope my twists are all right,
they're in there.

1024
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,880
I've just gotta not look, haven't I?

1025
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,400
And just let 'em do their thing.

1026
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,360
I'm just gonna roll up
the Swiss roll now.

1027
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,720
It's a big bake, isn't it?
This is a big one.

1028
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,200
It's too big for me.
You decided to do a dinosaur.

1029
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,960
I know, yeah. It was your idea.

1030
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,160
I know it was. Yeah, and it was my
idea to loads of things with it

1031
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,880
as well, wasn't it? But I'm not...
Oh, what's that, is that my two
minutes up?

1032
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,120
Yeah, that's your two minutes up.

1033
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,960
Oh, my God,
are these your dinosaur feet?

1034
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,560
Look at this. Oh, they're the best.

1035
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,880
I think I've done everything in
terms of baking things.

1036
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,680
I'm behind time,
I really need to catch up.

1037
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,120
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

1038
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,480
You've had four hours.
They're only making one cupcake.

1039
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,440
There's a, a lot to do.
Decorating snowman time now.

1040
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,040
They're done and it's good cos
the egg wash makes them look a bit

1041
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,800
like scaly sort of, don't they?
Yeah, it's pretty cool, isn't it?

1042
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,000
The lemon meringues are in
the oven so I'm just making

1043
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,920
the little toadstool toppers.

1044
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,280
Going in with the orange curd.

1045
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,600
Conscious that they will say
it's a cupcake

1046
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,840
and this is the quarterfinal.
So it's a cupcake with curd.

1047
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,120
All my elements are done.

1048
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,000
I just need to start rocking
and rolling now.

1049
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,640
I need to get a move on as I
need to brulee them as well.

1050
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,120
I want to fill the choux buns now,

1051
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,080
which are gonna form Christmas
puddings.

1052
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,960
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes left.

1053
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,560
OK, that's going in.

1054
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,680
Just covering the back of
the lollies.

1055
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,080
It's a bit messy.

1056
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,960
They're gonna be tennis balls.

1057
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,640
This is just white chocolate
this one.

1058
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,760
I'm putting a walnut on top of
the head so like

1059
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,360
an ankylosaurus armour

1060
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,800
and then just a couple
of fondant horns.

1061
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,720
This is the hardest I've had to work

1062
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,720
and I thought Biscuit Week
I had to do a fair bit.

1063
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,600
I've never worked harder
to make food

1064
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,400
and I probably never will do once
this chaos finishes.

1065
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,920
My jam didn't set. My tractor wheels
are gonna be rough.

1066
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,520
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1067
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,840
Assemble.

1068
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,240
OK, bakers, your time is up.

1069
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,080
They don't look like cricket balls

1070
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,800
but I'm happy that I got it done.

1071
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,160
It all looks a bit beige.
Tried my best.

1072
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,280
{\an8}Oh, my God, that was insane.

1073
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,480
The bakers' anything but beige
buffets

1074
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:02,000
now face the judgment of
Paul and Prue.

1075
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,080
Cristy, tell us all about your
non-beige buffet.

1076
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,360
So I've got Swiss roll lollipop,

1077
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,160
cheese and rosemary twists,

1078
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,880
spicy beef and onion patties
and then lemon meringue pies.

1079
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,680
It's a bit rough and ready. I know.

1080
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,320
Everything has got flaws.
You look at the canes,

1081
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,920
they are pretty rough.

1082
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,200
It tastes OK, but it's
not baked enough.

1083
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,080
It's a pity because I love
the flavour.

1084
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:47,200
OK, shall we try the pies?

1085
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,320
So they're meant
to represent sweets?

1086
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,600
Yeah, and they're spicy.

1087
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,760
Hmm.

1088
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,120
I love that, tastes great.

1089
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,400
I think that's delicious.

1090
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,680
Oh, OK, good.

1091
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,280
So those are the savoury ones.

1092
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,440
Yes. This is lemon meringue.

1093
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,400
Proper lemon meringue pie taste.

1094
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,800
It is, comes down to the look again.

1095
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,600
It's not the best-looking thing
I've seen.

1096
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,880
Yeah, they're a little uneven.

1097
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,800
It's Willy Wonka, guys,
it's gotta be a bit uneven.

1098
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,280
It's lovely soft cake,
I like the flavour.

1099
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,240
I think all your flavours
are lovely.

1100
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,320
OK, that's good.

1101
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,880
Everything else, when it comes to
the visual effect,

1102
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,760
has fallen short of what we expect.

1103
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,040
I agree.

1104
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,720
Matty, tell us all about
your Showstopper.

1105
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,000
We've got a cricket ball curry pie,

1106
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,520
a orange cupcake golf course,

1107
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,400
lime curd macarons

1108
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,400
and some creme brulee
doughnut basketballs.

1109
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,600
I like the colours,
you've managed to achieve

1110
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,000
a few different colours in there.

1111
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,960
Your little pies look pretty good.
They look pretty uniform.

1112
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,120
Matty, I think that you've achieved
something quite clever.

1113
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,040
You've got a different-looking
finish on every one of them.

1114
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,720
OK, let's try doughnuts.

1115
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,880
Very lovely shiny caramel, isn't it?

1116
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,040
Yeah.

1117
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,120
They taste of creme brulee
so you can have that.

1118
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,200
Oh, no.

1119
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,240
Your oil's too hot. OK.

1120
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,160
And because your oil's too hot,
it's a little bit raw inside.

1121
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,760
The flavours are good.
The texture's not good.

1122
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,520
Bit uneven, these.

1123
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,000
Lovely colour. Nice shine there.

1124
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,960
Nice flavour.

1125
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,720
That curd is so delicious,
really lovely.

1126
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,680
Right, cricket balls.

1127
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,840
Cricket ball pies, yes.

1128
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,000
That's delicious. Really nice, yeah.
Hmm. Oh, thank you.

1129
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,120
Then you have a...

1130
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,800
It's a chocolate orange cupcake.

1131
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,200
There's a little bit of
orange curd in there too.

1132
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,440
It's a lovely flavour. It works
quite well, there's a nice sharpness
coming from that orange.

1133
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,880
Quite a moist sponge that as well.

1134
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,200
I think you've got your flavours
right on most of the things.

1135
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,000
I think your textures are
slightly off. OK.

1136
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,320
Certainly on your doughnuts.

1137
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,600
But generally your flavours
have been pretty good. Hmm.

1138
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,160
Well done, Matty. Thank you.

1139
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,760
Tasha, tell us all about your
buffet, please.

1140
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,440
So this is my farmyard party.

1141
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,160
I've made milk bread,

1142
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,080
uh, pigs and blackberry creme
diplomat choux

1143
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,520
and pistachio
and raspberry flavoured Viennese

1144
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,240
whirls with a raspberry
and peach jam.

1145
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,320
I think some of these things look
quite nice.

1146
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,960
I love the little pigs.

1147
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,760
The Viennese whirls are underbaked.

1148
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,240
As soon as you pick 'em up they,
they just fall apart.

1149
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,160
They're falling to pieces. Yeah.

1150
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,440
But the flavour is
absolutely perfect.

1151
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,160
Oh, OK.

1152
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,640
Hmm, that's quite disappointing.

1153
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,360
Oh.

1154
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,360
Yeah, underwhelming.
Let's have a look at these pigs.

1155
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,480
Nice, uh, structure inside.

1156
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,200
The pigs are lovely.
I like the texture,

1157
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,720
I like the crust on them,
you are such a good bread maker.

1158
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,320
Thank you.

1159
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,280
Overall, a little underwhelmed.

1160
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,600
And they are a bit beige,
which was banned.

1161
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,360
Dan, tell us about
your Showstopper.

1162
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,680
So this is my prehistoric buffet

1163
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,200
with chicken curry dinosaur feet,
lemon biscuit fossils,

1164
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,880
strawberry marshmallow ankylosaurus

1165
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,880
and then some dinosaur eggs
with vanilla mousse.

1166
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,760
I do like the theme and everything
looks pretty neat and tidy.

1167
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,680
It's ambitious,
there's a lot of stuff going on.

1168
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,080
Shall we try the... Dinosaur feet.
..the feet?

1169
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,080
The curry is lovely.

1170
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,680
The pastry is very crumbly

1171
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,320
and actually delicious,
but it's very dry.

1172
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,000
Love the flavour, love the idea.

1173
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,360
Shall we try fossil lemon biscuits?

1174
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,560
Very nice biscuit. Um, it is beige.

1175
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,480
Right, let's have a look at these
little chocolate fellas.

1176
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,560
The flavour's overwhelmingly
chocolate, you hardly get the middle

1177
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,160
because the chocolate's quite thick.

1178
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,120
This is an authentic egg.

1179
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,160
That's very good.
Very clever, you did six things.

1180
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,400
Perhaps if you'd done four things,
you could've got them perfect.

1181
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,800
Josh, tell us all about your
non-beige buffet.

1182
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,800
We have got some Christmas
wreath couronnes,

1183
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,200
then you've got choux buns as my
Christmas puddings

1184
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,320
and then the snowmen macarons.

1185
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,600
They're neat as a pin,
they're uniform. Aren't they?

1186
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:10,200
Your little snowmen are perfectly
piped. They're absolutely lovely.

1187
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,880
The couronne look nice, even,

1188
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,760
quite tricky to do so small.

1189
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,880
Delicious actually,

1190
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,640
really soft, it's well baked.

1191
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,760
It's got a crust to it and soft
in the middle. Very delicious.

1192
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,680
Hmm, I think they work in looks
and in flavour.

1193
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,360
So we've had the savoury.

1194
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,600
They've got a caramel-like pasty
creme custard going through those.

1195
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,480
That is absolutely delicious.

1196
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,760
The vanilla level in
there is lovely.

1197
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,600
Very, very silky filling.

1198
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,920
Right, these are the coconut?

1199
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,040
Yes, those are coconut
and white chocolate ganache,

1200
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,920
and there should be
a jam right in the centre.

1201
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,480
Hmm, well, I love 'em...

1202
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,840
Josh I think you've done really
well. It's hard to fault anything.

1203
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,880
I think you've done really well
with the flavours.

1204
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,440
It's something I would go back for.
I think these are a triumph.

1205
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,400
Aren't they?
These are particularly good.

1206
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,640
Thank you. Well done, Josh.
Thank you.

1207
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,320
That was amazing, really chuffed.

1208
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,600
My favourite comment was Paul
with the couronne.

1209
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,600
To hear any comment like that
from Paul, king of bread,

1210
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,360
that's, amazing. So I will take that
with me forever.

1211
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,240
I'd say this is the most positive
I've felt after

1212
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,640
any Showstopper so I'm pretty happy.

1213
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,400
If I hadn't come first in

1214
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,720
the technical, I would be really
anxious right now.

1215
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,000
I'm pleased they liked all
the flavours

1216
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,880
so I'm just gonna focus on that.

1217
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,960
General feeling is I think
I'm bouncing around between third

1218
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,560
and fifth.

1219
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,480
It could be any one of three of us,
to be honest.

1220
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,880
{\an8}So how do you think
the Showstopper went, Prue?

1221
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,760
Who's gonna be reaching
the semifinals?

1222
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,200
If you look at that whole display,

1223
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,760
they did get the idea of colour

1224
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,920
and some of the things
were so delicious

1225
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,880
and some were so disappointing.

1226
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,680
Let's look at Cristy cos those
patties, you really liked those.

1227
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,840
The problem with Cristy's is
the way that it looks.

1228
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,320
It's just not polished enough.

1229
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,840
I thought Josh did very well.

1230
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,840
His couronne were delicious.

1231
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,080
So actually there's
a couple of people I think in line

1232
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,600
for Star Baker. I think Matty...
Matty. ..is in line.

1233
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,680
Matty. I do think Josh is there.

1234
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,200
What, for Star Baker, Josh? Yeah.

1235
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,280
But he had a particularly bad day
yesterday, didn't he?

1236
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,560
Whereas Matty got a handshake. Hmm,
Matty had a, Matty had a great.

1237
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,760
Had a really great day. Yeah,
he had a decent day yesterday.

1238
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,120
He could be one to watch.

1239
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,520
But Josh had the good sense
to just do three things

1240
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,440
and do them exquisitely, whereas
Dan on the other hand...

1241
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,840
Dan did everything.

1242
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,520
Has he done enough to survive?

1243
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,440
I think Cristy is also another one
that could go

1244
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,880
so I think it's between those two.

1245
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,760
It's so sad I can't believe we've
actually got to that stage where

1246
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,120
two really good bakers are here.
Two Star Bakers.

1247
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,960
Well, we've gotta send
a Star Baker home...

1248
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,040
Hmm. ..because they've
all been Star Baker.

1249
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,520
Well done, bakers, you really did
bring the party to the tent.

1250
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:03,680
I've got the great job of announcing
this week's Star Baker.

1251
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,040
And the Star Baker is...

1252
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,360
{\an1}DRUM ROLL

1253
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,200
..Matty.

1254
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,960
Unfortunately, I've got
the horrible job of announcing

1255
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,880
who's leaving the tent today.

1256
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,960
The baker needs to know
that when you get to this stage,

1257
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,640
you have done so, so well.

1258
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,800
And we're really, really sad
to see them go.

1259
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,880
The baker leaving the tent
today is..

1260
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,640
..Cristy.

1261
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,680
So sorry. It's OK.

1262
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,720
Oh, Cristy, you've done so well,
honestly.

1263
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,280
I'm so sorry to see Cristy go

1264
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,640
because she cares so much and she
is a really, really good baker.

1265
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,720
Well done, Cristy. Thank you.

1266
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,680
It's been such a crazy,
fast-paced experience.

1267
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,120
So now, I can sit back

1268
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:08,920
and reflect on what
an amazing time I've had.

1269
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,240
I'm really proud to have got this
far, I'm really proud.

1270
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,760
Well done, Matty. Thank you, Prue.

1271
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,520
I wasn't expecting that.

1272
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,600
I had a pretty perfect week,
the handshake, the Star Baker.

1273
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,440
I am happy for Matty.

1274
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,880
He just, just pipped Josh
to take Star Baker.

1275
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,680
It was really because he did
fantastic sausage rolls yesterday.

1276
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,800
Lara. Yeah? I won Star Baker.

1277
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,120
SQUEALS: Oh, my God!

1278
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,920
I hope this gives me
the confidence that maybe I needed,

1279
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,360
knowing what I'm up against
next week and hopefully beyond.

1280
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,960
Semifinal!

1281
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,440
Paul said lucky!

1282
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,000
But I'll take lucky!
Come on, group hug.

1283
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,080
Bring the party, yeah!

1284
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,840
Next time our four semifinalists...
Ooh!

1285
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,440
..face off over patisserie...
Don't know what's going on.

1286
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,040
..with a signature
full of finesse...

1287
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,040
It has to look like it's from a
Parisienne shop, don't it?

1288
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,400
Which isn't easy.
Oh, it's so curdled.

1289
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,760
Certainly not for me!

1290
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,360
..an apple tart technical...
CLATTERING

1291
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,400
..that demands a delicate touch...

1292
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,240
My God, I can't watch.

1293
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,040
..and a beautifully buttery
puff pastry Showstopper.

1294
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,520
Is that moving? Set!

1295
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,760
Oh, my God.

1296
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,800
There's no layers in my pastry.

1297
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,280
I just want to go to the pub.

1298
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,960
