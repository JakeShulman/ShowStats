1
00:00:02,163 --> 00:00:04,538
Now, before we get on with
Pastry Week, I just wanted

2
00:00:04,563 --> 00:00:08,179
to say how this show has inspired me to bake for
myself. Look at that. That's incredible, Alison.

3
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:12,618
It's nothing - it's just a beautifully
decorated mouth-wateringly moist fruit cake.

4
00:00:12,643 --> 00:00:14,978
It's so good, it looks like
one of Prue's cakes. Thanks.

5
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:16,579
Hi, guys, couldn't do
us a favour, could you?

6
00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:19,018
I'm looking for Prue's cake
- it's a beautifully decorated,

7
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:21,418
mouth-wateringly
moist fruit cake.

8
00:00:21,443 --> 00:00:24,098
No, no, not seen
anything like that at all,

9
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:26,898
not at all. Shall we crack
on with the show? Yeah.

10
00:00:26,923 --> 00:00:30,818
Welcome to the
Great British Bake Off!

11
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:33,258
Hang on. I think
I see Prue's cake.

12
00:00:34,523 --> 00:00:35,523
Last time...

13
00:00:36,963 --> 00:00:39,258
things got messy
in Chocolate Week.

14
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:40,178
I want everyone

15
00:00:40,203 --> 00:00:42,698
to clean after themselves
- it's an absolute disgrace.

16
00:00:42,723 --> 00:00:45,658
And whilst Nicky's torte
made her a contender...

17
00:00:45,683 --> 00:00:47,258
I think it's a
little work of art.

18
00:00:47,283 --> 00:00:49,138
she was out-boxed by Matty...

19
00:00:49,163 --> 00:00:51,578
I think your box is
beautifully engineered.

20
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:53,858
who took the
Star Baker title.

21
00:00:53,883 --> 00:00:55,258
It's got no real flavour.

22
00:00:55,283 --> 00:00:58,298
And while Cristy
and Saku struggled...

23
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:00,298
Melting! ..Tasha fell ill.

24
00:01:00,323 --> 00:01:02,618
Go and rest, come
on. I'lLl walk you back.

25
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:03,658
And they were spared.

26
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:05,618
You're all staying.

27
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:07,858
Such a relief!

28
00:01:09,363 --> 00:01:12,418
This time... I've got
cramp in my hands.

29
00:01:12,443 --> 00:01:14,698
the bakers face Pastry Week.

30
00:01:14,723 --> 00:01:15,938
I'm nervous.

31
00:01:15,963 --> 00:01:17,018
And double jeopardy.

32
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:19,378
Two people are going
home this week. I know.

33
00:01:19,403 --> 00:01:21,858
They'll need to keep
their cool... Sugar!

34
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:24,178
with a steamy signature...

35
00:01:24,203 --> 00:01:25,338
No!

36
00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:26,858
avoid a faux pas...

37
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:29,818
I think that's done... while
creating a French classic.

38
00:01:29,843 --> 00:01:32,378
I know what dauphinoise
is. What's the other word?

39
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:34,218
Pith-th-thivier.

40
00:01:34,243 --> 00:01:36,738
And demonstrate
pie-making artistry.

41
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,138
Argh!

42
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:39,818
So they're not among
the two bakers...

43
00:01:39,843 --> 00:01:42,338
There's a bit of a
plumbing issue happening.

44
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,018
who'll be leaving
the competition.

45
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:47,378
Then we lift. No, it's
just... Look, it's broken.

46
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:49,978
God. No, what do I do?

47
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:17,418
They're letting you go.
Shall I lead the way?

48
00:02:17,443 --> 00:02:20,018
I actually like pastry.

49
00:02:20,043 --> 00:02:22,298
I find it quite therapeutic.

50
00:02:22,323 --> 00:02:24,618
I love walking in. Do you? I do.

51
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:26,618
I never feel confident
about anything in my life,

52
00:02:26,643 --> 00:02:28,338
and pastry's no exception.

53
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:31,618
So I'm just kind of going to
roll with it, as I do every week.

54
00:02:31,643 --> 00:02:33,938
There's a lot that can
go wrong with pastry.

55
00:02:33,963 --> 00:02:35,378
It will be interesting,
especially

56
00:02:35,403 --> 00:02:37,098
with two people
going home this week.

57
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,898
I would love to,
like, blow their minds

58
00:02:38,923 --> 00:02:41,298
and to get Star Baker
would obviously be a dream.

59
00:02:41,323 --> 00:02:42,978
I just don't know
if it'll happen.

60
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:47,498
Bakers, you have made it

61
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:51,858
to Pastry Week, which means
you lot are the upper crust.

62
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:53,538
Now, for your
Signature Challenge,

63
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:54,978
the judges would love you

64
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:59,698
to make 12 individual
savoury picnic pies.

65
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:02,498
The fillings and flavours
are entirely your choice,

66
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:06,458
but your pies must be made
from hot-water-crust pastry

67
00:03:06,483 --> 00:03:11,658
and be attractive and
tempting to eat, just like me.

68
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:14,018
There's plenty of hot water,
so don't worry about that,

69
00:03:14,043 --> 00:03:17,138
even though someone here had
a 90-minute shower this morning.

70
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,658
Paul! You have two hours.

71
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:22,058
Which is what Paul says
when he gets in the shower.

72
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,138
On your marks. Get set. Bake!

73
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:32,098
I know that I need to
get off to a rapid start.

74
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:35,098
This is the
hot-water-crust pastry.

75
00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:38,418
Hot-water-crust pastry is
traditionally made with lard.

76
00:03:38,443 --> 00:03:40,738
Good for the hips, lard.

77
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:43,338
The other element is
butter, and that brings flavour.

78
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:46,018
You make it by pouring
almost boiling water

79
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:49,138
and melted fat into the flour.

80
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:51,178
I'm hot potato-ing right now.

81
00:03:51,203 --> 00:03:53,818
This is my onion
and spring onions.

82
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:55,698
Got to put stuff
inside that's, A,

83
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:58,178
going to be moist
to the mouth and, B,

84
00:03:58,203 --> 00:04:00,618
going to carry a lot
of punchy flavours.

85
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:02,138
I love a sausage.

86
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:04,898
The last thing is, you want
a beautiful bit of crimping on

87
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:07,258
the lid as well, which
seals in whatever

88
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:09,018
the bakers are
going to put inside.

89
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:12,338
You need to drop
the lid into the pie.

90
00:04:12,363 --> 00:04:16,698
The lid gets trapped in there
and it won't rise up and fall off.

91
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:17,938
As long as it's consistent

92
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:21,298
and seals the lid to
the side, that's good.

93
00:04:21,323 --> 00:04:22,323
No pressure!

94
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,418
Morning, Star Baker.

95
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:27,778
Morning! Hello, Matty.

96
00:04:27,803 --> 00:04:28,938
Hello. Morning.

97
00:04:28,963 --> 00:04:32,378
So, Matty, tell us about
your hot-water-crust little pies.

98
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:36,778
So it's got ricotta and
feta, a bit of garlic, some...

99
00:04:36,803 --> 00:04:38,498
Spanakopita? Yeah,
I'm glad you said it.

100
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:40,418
I-1-I couldn't... I can
never pronounce it.

101
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:42,058
Pronounce what?

102
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,098
Don't be cruel, Paul!

103
00:04:43,123 --> 00:04:44,578
Span-a-di-kopa-da? What?

104
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:51,378
Matty's take on Greek
spanakopita will be filled

105
00:04:51,403 --> 00:04:55,458
with spinach, soft cheeses,
red peppers and herbs.

106
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:57,458
Well, good luck, look
forward to this one.

107
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,818
I feel like this is your
week, babes. It's your week.

108
00:04:59,843 --> 00:05:01,578
You don't want to
fall off your throne.

109
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:02,738
Absolutely not. Yeah.

110
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:05,138
Yeah. You don't.
That would hurt.

111
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:06,538
Looking good.

112
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:08,898
And Matty's not the
only baker uniting

113
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:10,418
a continental filling

114
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,778
with this quintessentially
British pastry.

115
00:05:12,803 --> 00:05:16,018
So this is my
potato dauphinoise.

116
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:17,738
Dauphinoise, I
think, is a bit classy,

117
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:19,338
a bit elegant, it's
a bit like myself.

118
00:05:19,363 --> 00:05:21,138
That I think I am!

119
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:22,938
I'll bake that for a
good half an hour, just

120
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:26,138
so it gets nice and
crispy with all the cheese.

121
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:29,178
Dana's creamy dauphinoise
will sandwich fried onions

122
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:33,218
and melted Comte cheese,
sealed in rosemary-infused pastry,

123
00:05:33,243 --> 00:05:36,218
a recipe which echoes
a popular French bake.

124
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:37,578
Sounds like a pithivier.

125
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:38,603
What's that?

126
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:42,978
Interesting. Never
mind. Have you tested it?

127
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:45,818
I have tested it and it
has worked. In the time?

128
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:49,138
I'm literally, like, ten seconds
taking it out of the oven.

129
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:51,498
While Dana needs to
accommodate the baking

130
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:53,858
and cooling of her
dauphinoise filling...

131
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:56,578
So we've got sausage meat and
we've got some strong cheese.

132
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:57,898
Josh and Tasha...

133
00:05:57,923 --> 00:06:00,218
This is not pleasant.

134
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:02,818
are making a traditional
raw pork filling that'll cook while

135
00:06:02,843 --> 00:06:04,498
the rest of the pie bakes.

136
00:06:04,523 --> 00:06:08,818
These are the same filling
as my Christmas stuffing.

137
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:13,578
Tasha's pies will get their
Christmassy flavour from

138
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:16,858
the chopped sage in the
sausage and nutmeg in the pastry.

139
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:19,218
The double Star Baker
will be hoping to make it

140
00:06:19,243 --> 00:06:22,338
a hat-trick after being unable
to complete Chocolate Week.

141
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:23,979
I felt weird not being
here, to be honest.

142
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:26,098
Did you? Yeah, I had bad FOMO.

143
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:29,378
I bet you couldn't relax, could you? You
were thinking, what are they up to now?

144
00:06:29,403 --> 00:06:32,618
I know, it was weird. It was like,
what's it called, Stockholm syndrome?

145
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,378
It's exactly that -
Stockholm syndrome.

146
00:06:35,403 --> 00:06:39,018
And at the end of the series, if you
win you will get kidnapped by Paul.

147
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:41,338
He'll lock you in his basement.

148
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:42,978
But you'll like
it, so it'll be fine.

149
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:47,618
And while pork is
a popular choice...

150
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:51,098
These are Cumberland. From
a very reputable shop as well.

151
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:53,018
Right, how hot
are these chillies?

152
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:56,578
two bakers are
planning to spice things up.

153
00:06:56,603 --> 00:06:58,418
Chuck it all in.

154
00:06:58,443 --> 00:07:01,138
So I made these for my
kids when they were young

155
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:05,538
to go into their lunchboxes.
Not so much spice for me.

156
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:07,938
But I hope it will be
good enough for you.

157
00:07:10,803 --> 00:07:12,658
Saku is making a milder version

158
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,778
of her Sri Lankan spiced
tuna pies, which will see

159
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:19,858
a spicy potato and tuna filling
surround a whole quail's egg.

160
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:23,058
Have you worked with,
hot-water-crust pastry before?

161
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,218
Yes, when I was
practising. Right, OK.

162
00:07:26,243 --> 00:07:29,058
Was that the first time you
ever made it? Never? Yes, yeah.

163
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,418
Crimping on the top?

164
00:07:30,443 --> 00:07:31,618
Crimpling? Crimpling!

165
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:33,938
Crimpling. Crimpling,
yes. Crimping.

166
00:07:33,963 --> 00:07:36,738
But don't know how,
beautiful it will be.

167
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:40,258
All right, good luck. Good luck, Saku.
Thank you very much, Saku. Thank you.

168
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:44,258
Bakers, unbelievably, you
are halfway through already.

169
00:07:44,283 --> 00:07:45,338
God!

170
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:48,218
I just looked at my watch
and there was nothing there.

171
00:07:48,243 --> 00:07:49,618
I literally went...

172
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:52,018
That's cos I stole it.
Someone stole it off me.

173
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:55,298
With fillings made,

174
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:58,338
attention turns to the
lining in the pie tins.

175
00:07:58,363 --> 00:08:00,378
I'm eye-balling the
pastry thickness.

176
00:08:00,403 --> 00:08:02,738
Too thin and they
could split in the oven,

177
00:08:02,763 --> 00:08:05,418
but going too thick
also carries risk.

178
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,578
Because hot-water-pastry,

179
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:09,938
it's a bit thick as well, it can
be a bit stodgy, can't it, so...

180
00:08:09,963 --> 00:08:11,218
Dan's added turmeric

181
00:08:11,243 --> 00:08:13,538
and cumin to his
pastry to augment

182
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:17,098
a lamb keema filling flavoured
with his home-made spice mix.

183
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:18,618
Quite excited about this.

184
00:08:18,643 --> 00:08:21,938
Yeah, fingers crossed,
it's a bit greasy, but...

185
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:24,858
You're not going to say that
to them, are you? No, no, no!

186
00:08:24,883 --> 00:08:27,538
Little bit greasy!
Yeah. It's not that good.

187
00:08:27,563 --> 00:08:30,058
I don't mind a little bit
of grease. I don't either.

188
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,698
Well, good luck. Nice
one, Noel. Greasy Dan.

189
00:08:32,723 --> 00:08:35,458
Do you know what? I just
forgot to put the mustard in.

190
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:37,778
We're off to a
really good start.

191
00:08:37,803 --> 00:08:40,138
Filling also needs to
be tackled with care.

192
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:43,618
I am just filling up to sort
of around this mark here.

193
00:08:43,643 --> 00:08:46,978
Too little and the pies will
form an air pocket. Egg?

194
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:49,698
Too much and the filling
could ooze out during baking.

195
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:50,778
They look really good.

196
00:08:50,803 --> 00:08:52,778
I just want to make
sure I've got them in.

197
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:54,618
They're going to take
about 40 minutes or so.

198
00:08:54,643 --> 00:08:57,098
But Nicky's nowhere
near ready to bake.

199
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:58,538
It's cooked the
egg a little bit.

200
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:01,098
I don't know
whether to do it again.

201
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,898
Her hot water mix has
scrambled the egg she added

202
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:05,778
to enrich her first dough.

203
00:09:05,803 --> 00:09:09,618
I'd rather just
start again and just

204
00:09:09,643 --> 00:09:13,338
be done with it. It's fine,
it's fine, we've got this.

205
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:14,978
Nicky's blending sausage,

206
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:16,258
ham and saucisson

207
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:18,618
with five different
cheeses including Cheddar

208
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:21,738
and Reblochon, packed
into a classic pie tin.

209
00:09:21,763 --> 00:09:24,018
I love that shape.
It's old school.

210
00:09:24,043 --> 00:09:25,178
It's really lovely, that.

211
00:09:25,203 --> 00:09:26,858
Just like me!

212
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:29,378
And me. And have you
practised this, Nicky?

213
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,458
I've practised them.

214
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:32,338
I've got pies coming
out the front door.

215
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,018
Have ya? Yeah. Have
you been selling them?

216
00:09:34,043 --> 00:09:36,378
It's just too many pies.

217
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:38,698
OK, we'll leave you to
it, Nicky. It sounds great.

218
00:09:38,723 --> 00:09:41,018
Fingers crossed.

219
00:09:41,043 --> 00:09:43,538
I've got to get these in
the oven tout de suite.

220
00:09:43,563 --> 00:09:45,258
While Nicky lines her tins...

221
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:46,778
Pop the lids on,
bang 'em in the oven.

222
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:49,098
everyone else has
moved on to the lids.

223
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:51,618
Easy as pie. I'm here all week.

224
00:09:51,643 --> 00:09:53,978
But two bakers are planning
something that requires

225
00:09:54,003 --> 00:09:55,738
a more refined touch.

226
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:58,058
This is the latticing
of the pie top.

227
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,698
Providing the execution is good,

228
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:01,658
it can make the
world of difference.

229
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:03,618
It is fiddly.

230
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:07,098
I've just got to relax
cos I feel so stressed.

231
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:10,178
I just don't want
to let myself down.

232
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:13,258
Cristy's lattice lids will
conceal a filling of cream,

233
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:15,898
leek and garlic mushroom.

234
00:10:15,923 --> 00:10:17,858
I think this should be
such a good flavour.

235
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,498
You struggled a little last
week with flavour, didn't you?

236
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:22,858
We were complaining
there wasn't enough. Yeah.

237
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:26,538
And you know what? It's amazing
how much garlic mushrooms can take.

238
00:10:26,563 --> 00:10:27,858
OK, that's good, then.

239
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:30,458
Good luck, thank you, Cristy.
OK. Thank you. Good luck, darling.

240
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:32,418
To hold the fillings inside...

241
00:10:32,443 --> 00:10:34,738
Hopefully, it will all go right.

242
00:10:34,763 --> 00:10:37,618
I learned the right
word today - crimping.

243
00:10:37,643 --> 00:10:40,578
Paul is expecting the
bakers to form a neat seal.

244
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:42,378
Maybe not that.

245
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:44,698
It's always that.

246
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:46,658
I've got a little tool in
my pocket. Aye-aye!

247
00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:53,058
Think pig in blanket
- that was the vibe.

248
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,778
I'm quietly confident.

249
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:57,098
I think as soon as I say
I'm confident, it goes wrong,

250
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,418
so I don't want to say that.

251
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:01,978
Before crimping his lids
in place, Rowan's adding

252
00:11:02,003 --> 00:11:04,498
an extra topping of
smoked streaky bacon

253
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:07,698
to his Cumberland sausage
and sweet potato filling.

254
00:11:07,723 --> 00:11:10,258
Have you got a hole in the
lid? No, there's no hole in the lid.

255
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:12,778
When it steams,
where's it going to go?

256
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:14,618
On the bacon, the
bacon's raw inside,

257
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:16,378
so that steam is
there to help poach.

258
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:18,698
Right, OK. Got you. Good
luck. Thank you. Thank you.

259
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:20,018
Good luck, mate.

260
00:11:20,043 --> 00:11:21,858
Do you think that's a
bit of a clue, maybe put

261
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:24,538
a hole in it, do you think?
I feel like that's a clue.

262
00:11:24,563 --> 00:11:26,218
I might do little
pricks around it.

263
00:11:26,243 --> 00:11:29,058
Get a little prick in there. I
will. Sorted. Thanks, love.

264
00:11:30,843 --> 00:11:32,818
Once suitably ventilated...

265
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:35,698
I'm just egg-washing the
top to give it a lovely colour.

266
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:38,818
applying an egg wash should
brown up the pies when baked.

267
00:11:38,843 --> 00:11:40,338
Is it a bit thick?

268
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:41,978
Are you asking me? Yeah.

269
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:44,618
Whatever. In.

270
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,498
I didn't do egg wash.

271
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:51,498
OK, bakers, you've
got half an hour left.

272
00:11:51,523 --> 00:11:55,258
This is speed-pie-making.
Come on, Nicky!

273
00:11:55,283 --> 00:11:56,283
Oven's not on.

274
00:11:57,603 --> 00:11:59,498
Not conventional.

275
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:01,498
Should've gone in ages
ago, shouldn't they?

276
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:03,418
What? No, what you saying?

277
00:12:03,443 --> 00:12:05,778
I didn't realise
you were the baker.

278
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:08,898
How dare you? That's hot.
Do you think that's too hot?

279
00:12:08,923 --> 00:12:11,258
Possibly, but I don't
have the time now.

280
00:12:11,283 --> 00:12:12,698
They're in.

281
00:12:12,723 --> 00:12:14,978
How are you? I'm all right-ish.

282
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:16,858
Why, what's happened? Time.

283
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:18,098
Time.

284
00:12:18,123 --> 00:12:21,618
Time. I can be up two hours
before we've got to be anywhere,

285
00:12:21,643 --> 00:12:23,178
and I'm still never ready.

286
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:26,338
What you talking about? We're talking
about what time we get up in the morning.

287
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:29,698
Yeah, what time do you get up? I go
to bed quite late. Get up really early.

288
00:12:29,723 --> 00:12:31,738
It's weird. I texted you
last night at 11. I know.

289
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:33,458
You texted me back,
so you were quite late.

290
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:36,298
That's right, kids, we're
texting each other at night.

291
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,938
Just stop sending me
them pictures - I don't like it.

292
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:41,498
That's not what
you said last night!

293
00:12:41,523 --> 00:12:44,538
While some bakers have
time to wait and watch...

294
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,618
Cranberry sauce.

295
00:12:45,643 --> 00:12:47,538
others are making
their condiments.

296
00:12:47,563 --> 00:12:49,379
I'll probably just pipe
it on right at the end.

297
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:51,138
I call them
post-match picnic pies.

298
00:12:51,163 --> 00:12:54,178
They're the flavours I do
for my rugby lads after either

299
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:56,058
a training session
or a match day.

300
00:12:56,083 --> 00:13:00,778
Hopefully, in hot-water-crust pastry,
they taste as good in those as well.

301
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:03,098
Josh is hoping the
pickle will bring moisture

302
00:13:03,123 --> 00:13:04,498
to his pork and apple pies,

303
00:13:04,523 --> 00:13:07,298
while a layer of Cheddar
will be melted on top when

304
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:11,138
the pies are removed from their
tins and returned to the oven to brown.

305
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:14,898
The pastry is done
now so it won't collapse.

306
00:13:14,923 --> 00:13:17,218
Bakers, you've
got ten minutes left.

307
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:20,338
I'm going to have to get these out
now, aren't 1?7 They're oozing a bit.

308
00:13:20,363 --> 00:13:23,138
But do you know what it is,
did you put the hole in or not?

309
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:25,098
I did. Three. And
they opened up?

310
00:13:25,123 --> 00:13:26,898
Three pricks. Yeah.

311
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:30,338
So overfilled. I don't
like the look of 'em.

312
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:33,298
There's a whole
mushroom coming out here.

313
00:13:33,323 --> 00:13:34,538
Look at these.

314
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,658
You're using some
special finger protectors.

315
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,458
That is it. To poke
the pies out the bottom.

316
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:43,138
I've got a picture of Paul
wearing nothing but those.

317
00:13:43,163 --> 00:13:44,898
On his fingers?

318
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:46,378
Yeah, on his... OK.

319
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,378
Just glaze them up.

320
00:13:50,403 --> 00:13:53,418
Get all round my sides
as crispy as possible now.

321
00:13:53,443 --> 00:13:55,778
They look bad,
Noel. They look good.

322
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:59,378
No, they're overfilled. I don't
know why I'm getting like this.

323
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:01,779
I told myself I don't care. But
you really do care, don't you?

324
00:14:01,803 --> 00:14:03,378
My gosh, I need to get a life.

325
00:14:04,963 --> 00:14:06,018
It is coming out now.

326
00:14:08,603 --> 00:14:10,458
No!

327
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:13,098
It's a bit soggy on t'bottom.
They've never been soggy before.

328
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:18,778
Bakers, you only
have one minute left.

329
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:21,458
They've got to come
out, haven't they?

330
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:23,418
That one looks peng, actually.

331
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:26,538
Not as crispy as I'd like them.

332
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:29,578
Yeah, really pleased with those.

333
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:30,778
It was going so well.

334
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,298
They're not great. Gutted!

335
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:40,058
I can't wait for his beady
eyes to look at these.

336
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:51,618
Bakers, that is your time up,
please step away from your bakes.

337
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:55,219
One of 'em hasn't got a bottom, they're stuck
in the tin. Do they normally stick in the tin?

338
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:57,098
Never. Never stuck ever.

339
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:58,818
God! So I'm really
upset, actually.

340
00:15:07,603 --> 00:15:11,578
The bakers' hot-water-crust
picnic pies will now be judged

341
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:12,778
by Prue and Paul.

342
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:16,178
Hello, Matty. Hiya, Matty. Hiya.

343
00:15:16,203 --> 00:15:18,458
Tell us all about
your picnic pies.

344
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:21,898
They are based on spanakopita.

345
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:23,218
OK. They're based on them.

346
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:29,298
Bit messy.

347
00:15:29,323 --> 00:15:33,298
It's very tricky to get that lattice
looking good on such a small pie.

348
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:35,858
So there's some
feta, ricotta, spinach,

349
00:15:35,883 --> 00:15:38,578
roasted red peppers and
some sun dried tomatoes.

350
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:40,898
Good strong flavours. Lovely.

351
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:43,858
I think your lid
is a bit too thick.

352
00:15:43,883 --> 00:15:46,378
OK. Cos that takes
up maybe a third of it.

353
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,658
Yeah. Thank you. Thank
you. Cheers. Well done.

354
00:15:53,843 --> 00:15:55,498
It's a beautiful
golden-brown colour.

355
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:56,778
So we've got sausage meat,

356
00:15:56,803 --> 00:16:00,058
bacon and cranberry with apple

357
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,858
and some cranberry
sauce on the side.

358
00:16:03,483 --> 00:16:04,738
Good pastry.

359
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,818
Your mustard bottom, which
I'd never have thought of,

360
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:11,178
and I think it's a little mark
of genius, it's beautiful.

361
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,858
I think it's filled beautifully,

362
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:15,498
it's nice and thin round
the outside. Thank you.

363
00:16:15,523 --> 00:16:16,523
Cheers.

364
00:16:22,163 --> 00:16:25,378
The pastry"s a little pale on top.
Could've been a little browner.

365
00:16:25,403 --> 00:16:26,898
Bit of a soggy bottom.

366
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:28,898
Really? Yeah.

367
00:16:28,923 --> 00:16:32,938
Heart-breaking. Inside,
it's tuna, potatoes,

368
00:16:32,963 --> 00:16:38,018
leeks, carrot and onion, and
there is a quail egg as well.

369
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:39,978
I love the flavours.

370
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:43,058
And actually the filling
inside is quite nice and moist.

371
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,818
The pastry needs to
be much, much thinner.

372
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:46,018
And less soggy.

373
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:49,258
You can see right down the
bottom how wet that is there.

374
00:16:56,123 --> 00:16:57,178
It's a bit ripped

375
00:16:57,203 --> 00:16:59,458
and all over the place
at the sides, innit?

376
00:17:01,763 --> 00:17:04,298
Your flavours are beautiful.
Your pastry's nice and flaky.

377
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,858
It's nice and thin around
the outside and it's well-filled.

378
00:17:06,883 --> 00:17:08,858
It's just a little bit
dry on the mouth. OK.

379
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:11,938
I love the flavour, but it's going to
be hard work to eat that whole pie

380
00:17:11,963 --> 00:17:13,618
because it's very dense.

381
00:17:13,643 --> 00:17:14,643
OK.

382
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:21,418
I think they look
really appetising

383
00:17:21,443 --> 00:17:23,378
and if they were in a
shop window I'd buy them.

384
00:17:23,403 --> 00:17:25,418
This is potato dauphinoise

385
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:28,658
with caramelised onions
and Comte cheese.

386
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:31,818
Your sides are a little bit thick
on one side, thin on another.

387
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:34,178
Your roof is a little
bit too thick. Yeah.

388
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:35,899
But I like the flavour.
Thank you very much.

389
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:36,923
Thank you, guys.

390
00:17:42,843 --> 00:17:44,458
My, um, pies...

391
00:17:47,243 --> 00:17:48,258
I'm sorry but...

392
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:50,058
No, it's, um, that's good.

393
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,138
My pies are kind of
Christmas stuffing pies

394
00:17:53,163 --> 00:17:56,098
with chestnut, cranberry
sauce, sweet potato,

395
00:17:56,123 --> 00:17:57,938
bit of bacon, and a loose top.

396
00:17:59,683 --> 00:18:01,618
Lovely pastry. Thank you.

397
00:18:01,643 --> 00:18:04,418
It's got such a beautiful
aroma as well as flavour.

398
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:06,058
You know what?
If it had just looked

399
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,938
A bit better, you'd have had
an absolute triumph there.

400
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,178
It's bled quite a bit.

401
00:18:16,203 --> 00:18:18,498
That's the bleed in
there from the interior.

402
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:19,778
I think they're quite sweet.

403
00:18:19,803 --> 00:18:23,138
So that's sausage meat in there
with some strong Cheddar cheese

404
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:24,858
and thyme and a
bit of apple on top.

405
00:18:24,883 --> 00:18:28,538
That's the problem with
sausage mix - it'll all shrink

406
00:18:28,563 --> 00:18:30,218
and you get gaps round the edge.

407
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,898
If you'd had time, you could've
put a jelly in there or something.

408
00:18:32,923 --> 00:18:36,138
Yeah, OK. But otherwise I think
your flavours are good. Thank you.

409
00:18:40,843 --> 00:18:42,578
They're a little pale,
but I love the shape.

410
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:44,058
The mould has worked nicely

411
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,378
and you have got a good
colour underneath, just not on

412
00:18:46,403 --> 00:18:49,058
the side. Your
pastry's a bit thick.

413
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,938
And you end up with
a big hole in it as well.

414
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,338
Yeah, and it's a little
undercooked too. Yeah, it is.

415
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:56,218
So what you've got is
quite a gloopy mixture

416
00:18:56,243 --> 00:18:58,898
with your pastry being too thick
and it's a difficult thing to eat.

417
00:18:58,923 --> 00:19:00,138
It's a disaster.

418
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:01,778
It's quite sort of...
It's not your best.

419
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:04,298
No, it's not. No, it's
a bit gluey. Yeah.

420
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:06,138
Thank you very much,
Nicky. Thank you.

421
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:08,578
Don't worry about those
people. That's all right.

422
00:19:08,603 --> 00:19:10,178
Not bakers, those people.

423
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:18,658
They look even. Thank you.

424
00:19:18,683 --> 00:19:22,418
They're nice and brown.
They're really tiny. Quite elegant.

425
00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:25,978
I've made creamy leek
and mushroom pies.

426
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:28,538
You know you're so clever.
Yeah. You made a creamy sauce

427
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:30,538
and it just holds the
whole thing together.

428
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:31,618
Aw, thank you.

429
00:19:31,643 --> 00:19:34,338
It's beautifully moist
inside and crispy.

430
00:19:34,363 --> 00:19:36,858
So what I will do...

431
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,418
You're joking.

432
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,498
APPLAUSE

433
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:40,778
Well done. Well done.

434
00:19:40,803 --> 00:19:43,098
It's because you've managed
to achieve the moistness

435
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:45,058
and the flavour in a small area

436
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,858
and have that lattice
top looking so nice.

437
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:49,778
I feel like I'm in a
dream, thank you.

438
00:19:49,803 --> 00:19:51,458
Well done.

439
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:52,698
My God.

440
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:55,098
It's so easy to feel
impostor syndrome of like,

441
00:19:55,123 --> 00:19:56,578
I'm not good enough and stuff,

442
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:58,898
and then Paul goes and
gives you a handshake

443
00:19:58,923 --> 00:20:01,618
and you're just like, "What?"

444
00:20:01,643 --> 00:20:04,218
I'm so happy they
like how it tasted

445
00:20:04,243 --> 00:20:06,538
because, you know,
looks is one thing,

446
00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:08,578
what's inside is what matters.

447
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:13,298
Dear. Soggy bottom - why
it happened to me today?

448
00:20:14,403 --> 00:20:16,978
Absolute bag of pants.

449
00:20:17,003 --> 00:20:20,578
I've just gotta scoop myself
off the floor and get on with it.

450
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:28,138
For the next challenge
the ingredients

451
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:30,898
and recipe are a
gingham-guarded secret.

452
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:33,258
Hello, bakers, welcome
back to the tent.

453
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:35,578
It's time for your
technical challenge.

454
00:20:35,603 --> 00:20:36,858
And this week it's been set

455
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:39,938
for you by P Hollywood,
the pastry king.

456
00:20:39,963 --> 00:20:42,578
Now, as always, this
challenge is judged blind

457
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:44,258
so our judges will be leaving.

458
00:20:44,283 --> 00:20:46,658
But before you go, have
you got any words of advice

459
00:20:46,683 --> 00:20:49,898
for our bakers? I'm thinking
Mel Gibson in Braveheart.

460
00:20:49,923 --> 00:20:51,538
Yeah. Go for it, Paul.

461
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:55,938
The textures on the inside
and the outside must be perfect.

462
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,658
Not as stirring as I thought.
No. If I'm honest with ya.

463
00:20:58,683 --> 00:21:02,418
Maybe he should've
done it on a horse. Maybe.

464
00:21:02,443 --> 00:21:04,338
OK, judges, you
can go, thank you.

465
00:21:06,283 --> 00:21:10,898
Paul would like you to make a
decadent dauphinoise pithivier.

466
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:14,138
Now, the judges will
be looking for a buttery,

467
00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:16,738
crisp rough-puff pastry encasing

468
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:19,698
creamy potato and
caramelised onion.

469
00:21:19,723 --> 00:21:22,618
And alongside that
a blue cheese sauce.

470
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:25,378
You have two hours
and 45 minutes.

471
00:21:25,403 --> 00:21:26,778
On your marks.

472
00:21:26,803 --> 00:21:28,458
Get set.

473
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:31,218
Bake!

474
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:33,578
Goodness gracious, what is this?

475
00:21:33,603 --> 00:21:35,338
What are the chances
that was gonna happen?

476
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:38,138
I know what dauphinoise
is, what's the other word?

477
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:41,698
Pithivi... Pervivi...
Perviv... How do you say it?

478
00:21:43,963 --> 00:21:45,378
So Paul, pithivier?

479
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:47,978
It's a classic sort
of French pie.

480
00:21:48,003 --> 00:21:51,698
Now, this particular one, it's got
the dauphinoise potatoes inside.

481
00:21:51,723 --> 00:21:55,258
What we're really testing the
bakers on is the pastry itself.

482
00:21:55,283 --> 00:21:58,178
By now, our bakers should
know about rough-puff pastry.

483
00:21:58,203 --> 00:22:00,738
Yeah. The key thing when
you're making a rough puff is

484
00:22:00,763 --> 00:22:04,338
to add some frozen
butter in between each turn.

485
00:22:04,363 --> 00:22:08,938
Dough, butter, dough, butter,
creates these flaky layers.

486
00:22:11,003 --> 00:22:13,258
That's a bit of
a feast, isn't it?

487
00:22:13,283 --> 00:22:14,938
Help yourself to the sauce.

488
00:22:14,963 --> 00:22:19,298
Roquefort's such a salty blue
cheese, adds a lot of flavour.

489
00:22:19,323 --> 00:22:20,818
It's really heaven.

490
00:22:20,843 --> 00:22:23,658
This is carbs on carbs
served with cream.

491
00:22:23,683 --> 00:22:26,978
Can't wait to get back in the tent
and have nine versions of this?

492
00:22:28,923 --> 00:22:32,818
It says make the
rough-puff pastry.

493
00:22:32,843 --> 00:22:35,938
I'm just gonna add some
water, try and get a dough.

494
00:22:35,963 --> 00:22:38,298
It's just to bind
the dough together.

495
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,658
And then I can
wrap it up and chill it.

496
00:22:40,683 --> 00:22:43,018
You've done one of
these before right? Um, no.

497
00:22:43,043 --> 00:22:45,858
But I've made dauphinoise.
And I've made rough puff.

498
00:22:45,883 --> 00:22:47,658
So we're sort of
there, aren't we?

499
00:22:47,683 --> 00:22:50,178
There you go, yeah. Put it
together and what have you got?

500
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,818
Um... Dauphinoise...

501
00:22:51,843 --> 00:22:53,498
pithivier. NICKY LAUGHS

502
00:22:54,603 --> 00:22:57,378
I'm just gonna get it rolled
out to a rough rectangle.

503
00:22:57,403 --> 00:22:59,418
And then I can put my
grated butter in between.

504
00:22:59,443 --> 00:23:02,538
So I'm gonna grate the,
frozen butter onto that.

505
00:23:02,563 --> 00:23:05,138
So the butter gives
you that puffy rise.

506
00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:06,898
But a few of the bakers...

507
00:23:06,923 --> 00:23:09,898
I'm just kind of incorporating
the grated butter.

508
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:11,618
are taking a
different approach.

509
00:23:11,643 --> 00:23:15,298
Rub the butter in the
flour, knead it, roll it out.

510
00:23:15,323 --> 00:23:17,058
If they wanted
me to laminate it,

511
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,418
you'd have put it
out as a slab of butter

512
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:21,778
so if it's grated maybe
it has to be mixed in.

513
00:23:21,803 --> 00:23:25,258
Now, I'm gonna start
to fold. I'm nervous.

514
00:23:26,523 --> 00:23:30,378
So it's fold third down,
third up, turn, roll, chill.

515
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:33,938
You know when you look around and
you see what everybody else is doing

516
00:23:33,963 --> 00:23:36,258
and you think, "Have
I done the same?"

517
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:38,218
It's a bit unnerving, isn't it?

518
00:23:38,243 --> 00:23:40,578
I've grated all of
my butter in at once

519
00:23:40,603 --> 00:23:42,458
and everyone else
is laminating it in.

520
00:23:42,483 --> 00:23:46,058
I think I've worked
the butter in too much.

521
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,618
You washed your hand
yet? I know, I didn't want to.

522
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:51,218
Did he lift you off the
ground slightly? No.

523
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:54,338
What was it like, grabbing
a big bunch of sausages?

524
00:23:54,363 --> 00:23:55,938
Stop.

525
00:23:55,963 --> 00:23:58,698
I feel like the
rule here is cold.

526
00:23:58,723 --> 00:24:00,698
Cos puff pastry
does not like heat.

527
00:24:00,723 --> 00:24:03,018
As soon as it gets too warm
then it just kind of all melts

528
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:04,218
and you won't get the layers.

529
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:08,498
I'm just starting with the
filling which is simmering

530
00:24:08,523 --> 00:24:10,498
the potatoes in cream,
milk, garlic and seasoning.

531
00:24:10,523 --> 00:24:13,538
I have never made
dauphinoise potatoes in my life.

532
00:24:13,563 --> 00:24:15,898
I know someone who has - Dana.

533
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:17,779
Babes. I feel like there's
a bit more pressure now.

534
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:19,218
I love the fact
that you've made it

535
00:24:19,243 --> 00:24:22,098
and you didn't even
know what it was. I know!

536
00:24:22,123 --> 00:24:25,498
You want it just to sort
of simmer away nicely.

537
00:24:25,523 --> 00:24:28,178
Checking for tenderness.
I'm a tender little thing.

538
00:24:28,203 --> 00:24:31,298
That's simmering away,
onions are caramelising.

539
00:24:31,323 --> 00:24:33,258
I'm worried about my pastry.

540
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:37,218
This is the second turn.
So I'm doing two turns.

541
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:38,818
Which I think will be enough.

542
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:40,338
Just doing another turn.

543
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:43,058
Try and get as many
as I can in the time.

544
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:45,338
More folds.

545
00:24:45,363 --> 00:24:47,658
I'll give that five minutes.

546
00:24:47,683 --> 00:24:49,458
Argh!

547
00:24:49,483 --> 00:24:51,738
Need another plaster.

548
00:24:51,763 --> 00:24:53,418
Just grated my knuckles.

549
00:24:54,763 --> 00:24:57,778
I got blood in my pastry.
So I've had to redo it.

550
00:24:57,803 --> 00:25:00,138
Just need to get a bit
of a shimmy on now

551
00:25:00,163 --> 00:25:02,018
and just chuck it
all in and go for it.

552
00:25:03,123 --> 00:25:05,978
Bakers, you are halfway through.

553
00:25:06,003 --> 00:25:08,258
♪ Halfway through

554
00:25:08,283 --> 00:25:10,138
♪ Halfway through

555
00:25:10,163 --> 00:25:12,818
♪ Halfway through
this nightmare. ♪

556
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:14,218
Ha, ha, ha!

557
00:25:15,803 --> 00:25:18,538
I'm just getting these
potatoes out. Spot on, that.

558
00:25:18,563 --> 00:25:19,898
Still got a bit of bite to it.

559
00:25:19,923 --> 00:25:22,858
I think I overcooked my potatoes
in the middle cos I've just tried

560
00:25:22,883 --> 00:25:26,298
them, they're a bit
soft. It's so annoying.

561
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:29,218
Right, so I've finally
made my pastry.

562
00:25:29,243 --> 00:25:30,418
Done one turn.

563
00:25:30,443 --> 00:25:32,738
I'll do that again and
then I can start assembling

564
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:33,738
and I'll try and get it baked.

565
00:25:33,763 --> 00:25:35,418
While Dan performs a final turn,

566
00:25:35,443 --> 00:25:38,018
everyone else is starting
to shape their pithivier.

567
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:40,818
I've no idea how thick
to get it, to be honest.

568
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:43,178
Who do you fear in this
tent? Do you fear Saku?

569
00:25:43,203 --> 00:25:44,658
Yeah. I fear Saku.

570
00:25:44,683 --> 00:25:47,018
I wouldn't like get on't
wrong side of her, would you?

571
00:25:47,043 --> 00:25:48,779
I dunno, shall we go and
have a rolling pin fight?

572
00:25:48,803 --> 00:25:52,098
Saku. Yeah. Dan said do you
wanna have a rolling pin fight?

573
00:25:52,123 --> 00:25:53,378
Ooh!

574
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:54,898
You're a Jedi, Saku.

575
00:25:54,923 --> 00:25:56,698
I know, yeah.

576
00:25:56,723 --> 00:26:00,378
Cut a 20 centimetre round
using the smaller plate.

577
00:26:00,403 --> 00:26:01,778
Layer the potatoes,

578
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:04,618
onions with salt and pepper and
nutmeg in between each layer.

579
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:07,858
Well, I've just chucked mine on and
now I've seen people do it proper neat.

580
00:26:07,883 --> 00:26:10,178
I'm looking at Cristy's

581
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:13,018
and it actually looks like a
French person has trained

582
00:26:13,043 --> 00:26:16,818
for 70 years at the Cordon
Bleu. And then produced that.

583
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:19,138
Right, so let's move very,

584
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:21,858
very quickly. I'm just
panicking a bit now.

585
00:26:21,883 --> 00:26:24,458
What are you putting
in there? This is nutmeg.

586
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:27,978
When I was a kid, there was a rumour
that if you smoked nutmeg you'd go crazy.

587
00:26:29,403 --> 00:26:30,818
Did you try? No.

588
00:26:30,843 --> 00:26:33,378
It sounded ridiculous to me.

589
00:26:35,003 --> 00:26:37,418
I'm just gonna overload it
with all the onions basically.

590
00:26:37,443 --> 00:26:39,858
I think the onions give it
such a nice sweetness.

591
00:26:41,403 --> 00:26:44,938
It says scallop the edges. Now, I
ain't got a clue what that means.

592
00:26:44,963 --> 00:26:48,338
Is this scalloping, cos I just
know it as, like, crimping?

593
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:51,818
Scalloping? Crimping,
scalloping, it's all the same to me.

594
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,818
Knock up the edges
and then glaze and chill.

595
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:57,618
What is this knock up thing?

596
00:26:57,643 --> 00:27:00,898
Different connotations
to knock up, isn't there?

597
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:02,698
Like that?

598
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:05,778
Well, this is the dirtiest
knock up I've ever seen.

599
00:27:05,803 --> 00:27:08,098
I'm just gonna score it now.

600
00:27:08,123 --> 00:27:11,018
Carefully - not going through
the pastry. And then bake it.

601
00:27:11,043 --> 00:27:12,138
We're going in.

602
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:14,978
Don't know how it's gonna take.

603
00:27:15,003 --> 00:27:17,378
How long have we got left?

604
00:27:19,043 --> 00:27:21,818
Bakers, you have
half an hour left.

605
00:27:21,843 --> 00:27:24,139
I'd better get a move on as
well that'd be nice, wouldn't it?

606
00:27:24,163 --> 00:27:25,618
It's going quick, in't it?

607
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:32,178
So in the meantime I can
make my blue cheese sauce.

608
00:27:32,203 --> 00:27:35,258
Just smelt that cheese
and it is absolutely revolting.

609
00:27:35,283 --> 00:27:36,498
It's really pungent.

610
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:38,218
I don't like blue cheese.

611
00:27:38,243 --> 00:27:40,899
You know what? You've gotta try
it though, cos it's gotta taste good.

612
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:43,698
No. I say it all the time. But
look how mouldy it is. Look at it.

613
00:27:43,723 --> 00:27:46,498
Yours is so mouldy there's
nearly no cheese there. I know.

614
00:27:46,523 --> 00:27:49,378
It's Roquefort, isn't
it? I love Roquefort.

615
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:51,058
Super cheesy, baby.

616
00:27:52,163 --> 00:27:55,538
Well done, Dan, yours is rising.
It's got a nice colour on yours.

617
00:27:55,563 --> 00:27:56,858
Looks all right, don't it? Yeah.

618
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,178
It looks pale so I've upped
the temp by ten degrees.

619
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:01,618
Scared.

620
00:28:01,643 --> 00:28:03,618
Bakers, you've got five minutes.

621
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:05,978
Didn't use all my
potatoes. Look at it,

622
00:28:06,003 --> 00:28:09,258
it's flat like a pancake.
He's gonna hate it.

623
00:28:09,283 --> 00:28:11,578
It's so bad.

624
00:28:11,603 --> 00:28:15,058
It's not risen, has
it? It's like a frisbee.

625
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,338
So gutted, I've
just had a crap day.

626
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,138
Hello, Josh, you all right?

627
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:21,898
Um, OK. Are you
worried it's not gonna puff?

628
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:25,178
Yeah. Do you want me to burn
the tent down so that he won't see?

629
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,858
That'd be good.

630
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:29,458
I want to give it as long
as humanly possible.

631
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,818
I might take it out.

632
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:35,138
Cornish pasty, anyone?

633
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:38,458
If you like shortcrust
pastry, it's all right.

634
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,738
Bakers, you have
one minute left.

635
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:42,058
OK she's gonna have to come out.

636
00:28:43,403 --> 00:28:45,178
I'm gonna have a little gander.

637
00:28:45,203 --> 00:28:46,739
It's definitely not as
puffy as it should be.

638
00:28:46,763 --> 00:28:48,218
I'm happy with that.

639
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:49,978
Look at it, it's so ugly.

640
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:52,458
I've seen neater poos,
to be honest with you.

641
00:28:53,563 --> 00:28:56,018
I quite like the look of that.

642
00:28:56,043 --> 00:28:57,578
I don't think that's done.

643
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:01,298
God, this is revolting.

644
00:29:03,403 --> 00:29:06,778
Bakers, that is your
time up. Well done.

645
00:29:06,803 --> 00:29:08,698
Tough, that.

646
00:29:08,723 --> 00:29:10,418
Please bring your pithiviers,

647
00:29:10,443 --> 00:29:13,578
place on the table
behind your photos.

648
00:29:13,603 --> 00:29:16,698
Look at the size of Dan's.
It's like he's got a body in there.

649
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:20,818
Don't, yours is right
next to the frisbee.

650
00:29:26,363 --> 00:29:27,658
Prue and Paul are looking for

651
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,618
a perfectly domed
dauphinoise pithivier with

652
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,538
a flaky laminated
rough-puff pastry.

653
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,898
Eclectic mix. Yeah, some of
them are domed, some are not.

654
00:29:36,923 --> 00:29:40,818
Yes. And they have
no idea whose is whose.

655
00:29:40,843 --> 00:29:43,578
We'll start with this one.
That's a recognisable pithivier.

656
00:29:43,603 --> 00:29:45,939
Yes. It's got a dome, the actual
design is pretty good. Yeah.

657
00:29:45,963 --> 00:29:48,298
It's nice and crispy.
And it's a nice colour.

658
00:29:48,323 --> 00:29:50,723
Yeah, it is a nice colour.
It's certainly got a bit of flake.

659
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:54,298
The Roquefort's certainly salty.

660
00:29:54,323 --> 00:29:55,938
And it does make
the balance beautiful.

661
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:57,138
Yeah... Yeah.

662
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:59,778
Now, moving on
to this flat pizza.

663
00:29:59,803 --> 00:30:01,698
This is definitely
not domed enough.

664
00:30:01,723 --> 00:30:04,258
It needs to be much higher.
It's a bit pale though, isn't it?

665
00:30:04,283 --> 00:30:05,938
Yeah. Bit uneven too.

666
00:30:07,443 --> 00:30:08,898
Needed a stronger colour.

667
00:30:08,923 --> 00:30:11,218
I like the colour, it's nice
and strong golden brown.

668
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:12,498
Yeah, the colour's very good.

669
00:30:12,523 --> 00:30:15,378
Do you know, this pastry is
delicious but it's not quite cooked?

670
00:30:15,403 --> 00:30:16,578
No... No, it's not.

671
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:19,098
It needed a little
bit longer, doesn't it?

672
00:30:19,123 --> 00:30:21,058
I love the scallop work on this.

673
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:22,338
And it's got a dome.

674
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:24,618
Looks good underneath,
it's got a strong colour.

675
00:30:27,203 --> 00:30:30,058
Pastry's not bad,
actually. It's flaky enough.

676
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,338
It's a nice one, that.

677
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:33,338
OK, moving on,
this is a bit flat.

678
00:30:33,363 --> 00:30:35,698
And a bit under baked I think.

679
00:30:35,723 --> 00:30:38,018
Lamination looks more
bread like than flaky.

680
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:40,778
I think the potato's
a bit raw too.

681
00:30:40,803 --> 00:30:42,818
Potatoes need
a little bit longer.

682
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:45,218
There's an attempt to
get a bit of height here.

683
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:48,538
I'm not mad about the look
of it. It's a bit rough. Yeah.

684
00:30:48,563 --> 00:30:51,498
Potato's raw.
Yeah, needs longer.

685
00:30:51,523 --> 00:30:53,258
The flake's not bad.

686
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:57,218
This one, Paul,
has a lovely colour.

687
00:30:57,243 --> 00:30:59,498
Bit of height to it as well.

688
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:00,978
Nice strong bake.

689
00:31:01,003 --> 00:31:03,818
Raw potato. It is,
isn't it? It's quite raw.

690
00:31:03,843 --> 00:31:07,058
This looks like a very interesting
pie but it's not a pithivier.

691
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:09,738
No... Not a dome in sight.

692
00:31:09,763 --> 00:31:12,178
There's a bit of flake to that.

693
00:31:14,243 --> 00:31:16,258
The pastry's good. But it
needed more of a dome,

694
00:31:16,283 --> 00:31:18,818
I'm not quite sure what happened
to the rest of the potatoes.

695
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,178
It seems to be a bit uneven
on this one. Not very neat.

696
00:31:21,203 --> 00:31:23,418
But it's got flake to it.

697
00:31:25,403 --> 00:31:27,258
Spuds are all right.

698
00:31:27,283 --> 00:31:29,178
Sauce is very
tarragon-y, I love it.

699
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:32,218
It is. Blended with the blue
cheese, it works beautifully.

700
00:31:32,243 --> 00:31:36,618
The pithiviers will now
be ranked from last to first.

701
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:40,218
OK, in ninth spot we have
this one, whose is this?

702
00:31:40,243 --> 00:31:43,698
Nicky. It's too flat, there
is no crumble in there.

703
00:31:43,723 --> 00:31:45,978
In eighth place
we have this one.

704
00:31:46,003 --> 00:31:49,138
Josh, too pale, too flat.

705
00:31:49,163 --> 00:31:50,178
OK.

706
00:31:50,203 --> 00:31:52,898
Matty is seventh, Saku sixth,

707
00:31:52,923 --> 00:31:54,498
Cristy fifth,

708
00:31:54,523 --> 00:31:57,458
Rowan fourth and Tasha is third.

709
00:31:57,483 --> 00:32:00,058
In second place,

710
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:01,178
we have this one...

711
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:06,378
Dana, it looks very
pretty, the pastry's good,

712
00:32:06,403 --> 00:32:08,698
tastes good, it's a
really good pithivier.

713
00:32:08,723 --> 00:32:10,218
Thank you. Well done.

714
00:32:10,243 --> 00:32:13,098
So in first place we
have this one, Dan.

715
00:32:13,123 --> 00:32:14,978
Good old Dan.

716
00:32:16,963 --> 00:32:19,338
That's a lovely pithivier. I
love the scallop work on there,

717
00:32:19,363 --> 00:32:21,738
you've ended up with
something that tastes delicious

718
00:32:21,763 --> 00:32:23,578
and looks very
professional. Well done.

719
00:32:23,603 --> 00:32:24,578
Thank you very much. Thanks.

720
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:25,778
Well done. Well done, Dan.

721
00:32:25,803 --> 00:32:27,499
Great feeling, yeah,
pretty good, can't believe it.

722
00:32:27,523 --> 00:32:28,578
Again it's, yeah.

723
00:32:28,603 --> 00:32:30,898
Every time it happens
I'm like, "I can't believe it."

724
00:32:30,923 --> 00:32:32,778
First time I've been second.

725
00:32:32,803 --> 00:32:35,138
I'm beyond happy,
I'm over the moon.

726
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:37,058
I'll try and take
positives out of today

727
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,378
and just hope I have a
really good day tomorrow.

728
00:32:39,403 --> 00:32:41,978
Babes, come here. Aw.

729
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,338
Dearie me.

730
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:47,698
I'll have to do an awful lot
to pull it back from today.

731
00:32:54,563 --> 00:32:57,578
I don't think I've ever seen
you both eat as much as what

732
00:32:57,603 --> 00:32:59,258
I've seen in Pastry Week.

733
00:32:59,283 --> 00:33:01,618
Gotta come to my house,
every day is exactly the same.

734
00:33:01,643 --> 00:33:04,458
I think, overall, Pastry Week's
been a step up from Chocolate Week.

735
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,258
And Cristy got a handshake.

736
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:07,618
They were great pies.

737
00:33:07,643 --> 00:33:10,858
For Star Baker, I think she's
in line. Dan won the technical.

738
00:33:10,883 --> 00:33:13,339
And Tasha's come back with a
bang. And Tasha's come back as well.

739
00:33:13,363 --> 00:33:15,739
You haven't forgotten, guys, that
we're sending two people home

740
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:17,738
this week. Yes! Well,
I was thinking that.

741
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:20,058
So who, roughly, is
in danger, then? Nicky.

742
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,778
Yeah. No.

743
00:33:21,803 --> 00:33:23,579
She is so cheerful. But
she is not doing well.

744
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:25,058
Saku's in trouble
as well. Is she?

745
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:27,459
I think she struggled in the sig
and she was sixth in the technical.

746
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:29,018
I love Saku. Saku can't go.

747
00:33:29,043 --> 00:33:32,138
Rowan could drop down.
Those picnic pies were awful.

748
00:33:32,163 --> 00:33:35,018
Do you know what I think's
disappointing? Is Josh.

749
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:38,138
I can't believe Josh would be
in danger. He's been consistent.

750
00:33:38,163 --> 00:33:39,338
Well, not this week.

751
00:33:39,363 --> 00:33:41,698
I'm in love with all of them.
I want them all to do well.

752
00:33:41,723 --> 00:33:44,058
They're becoming quite
a tight little gang as well.

753
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:46,019
They are, yeah, they are.
They've got a WhatsApp group.

754
00:33:46,043 --> 00:33:48,378
Have they? Yeah, they have.
I was just wondering, when are

755
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,219
we gonna have a WhatsApp
group? Are we gonna do that?

756
00:33:50,243 --> 00:33:52,658
We haven't told her. Well, we
have one without you, Alison.

757
00:33:58,283 --> 00:34:01,258
Welcome back to the tent for
your Showstopper challenge.

758
00:34:01,283 --> 00:34:04,738
Today, the judges would love you
to make something out of pastry.

759
00:34:04,763 --> 00:34:06,498
I mean, who would've thought it?

760
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:08,498
How do they come
up with this stuff? wild.

761
00:34:08,523 --> 00:34:10,218
The judges would
like you to make

762
00:34:10,243 --> 00:34:13,738
a stunning display of
decorative sweet pies.

763
00:34:13,763 --> 00:34:17,298
Your display should include
at least three ornate pies

764
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:21,658
and be made of a
rich sweet pastry case.

765
00:34:21,683 --> 00:34:23,218
You have four hours.

766
00:34:23,243 --> 00:34:24,778
On your marks. Get set.

767
00:34:24,803 --> 00:34:25,938
Bake.

768
00:34:29,363 --> 00:34:33,738
They tasted great in practice
but practice took six hours.

769
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:39,418
I am starting with making
the sweet shortcrust pastry.

770
00:34:39,443 --> 00:34:41,738
We're asking the bakers

771
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:45,778
to produce at least three
highly decorated pies made

772
00:34:45,803 --> 00:34:48,778
with a rich sweet pastry.

773
00:34:48,803 --> 00:34:52,538
I'm just using the
traditional rub-it-in method.

774
00:34:52,563 --> 00:34:55,058
Ideally, I think it would
be nice if at least two

775
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:57,378
of them had different fillings.

776
00:34:57,403 --> 00:34:58,898
I'm starting with
my raspberry jam.

777
00:34:58,923 --> 00:35:01,658
That's the sort of
food I grew up on.

778
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,058
We want it highly
decorated, so we're expecting

779
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:07,378
a little bit of lattice work,
little bit of plaiting on the top.

780
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:11,178
I think it's perfectly legitimate
to dye some of the pastry.

781
00:35:11,203 --> 00:35:14,378
We wanna see also something
that links the three pies together.

782
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,898
I'm making sweet pies
based on my favourite

783
00:35:16,923 --> 00:35:19,258
British sitcom,
Absolutely Fabulous.

784
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,059
You can't just leave a
sweet pie in the mould or

785
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,778
the foil, they
need to bring it out,

786
00:35:22,803 --> 00:35:24,818
expose it and show
us what they've baked.

787
00:35:24,843 --> 00:35:29,938
I've got cramp in my
hands. It's really sore.

788
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:32,378
It needs to taste amazing...

789
00:35:32,403 --> 00:35:33,858
This is a vanilla pastry.

790
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:34,978
hold together

791
00:35:35,003 --> 00:35:37,738
and create that beautiful
crumble when you bite into it

792
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:40,578
with whatever
sweet filling is inside.

793
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:43,578
I've got the vision, it's just
whether I can execute it well.

794
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:45,498
What have I done to this?

795
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:48,858
Hi, Cristy. Hello, you OK?

796
00:35:48,883 --> 00:35:51,578
Hello. Right Cristy, tell us
all about your decorative pies.

797
00:35:51,603 --> 00:35:55,418
So I'm gonna try and do like a
woodland sort of display of pies.

798
00:35:55,443 --> 00:35:57,418
I'm gonna do a spiced apple pie

799
00:35:57,443 --> 00:36:01,098
and then I've got a blueberry
pie and then a raspberry

800
00:36:01,123 --> 00:36:02,978
and frangipane pie.

801
00:36:03,003 --> 00:36:04,978
Lovely, I love all
of those flavours.

802
00:36:05,003 --> 00:36:06,898
OK, good.

803
00:36:06,923 --> 00:36:08,378
After a handshake-worthy
signature,

804
00:36:08,403 --> 00:36:11,538
Cristy will be hoping her autumnal
Showstopper featuring raspberry

805
00:36:11,563 --> 00:36:15,898
frangipane and intricate
lattice work will earn her

806
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,738
top honours again today.

807
00:36:17,763 --> 00:36:20,058
When you practised,
did you time it?

808
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,658
Yeah, it's really hard to
practise for four hours around

809
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:25,138
the children so I've been
doing like really late nights and...

810
00:36:25,163 --> 00:36:26,298
Middle of the night.

811
00:36:26,323 --> 00:36:28,818
middle of... Yeah,
literally. Hope I deliver.

812
00:36:28,843 --> 00:36:34,058
Cristy's not the only baker who
found practice a little fraught.

813
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:35,938
In practice, the bottom
fell out of my pie.

814
00:36:35,963 --> 00:36:38,658
So it was just a
crust around the edge

815
00:36:38,683 --> 00:36:41,418
and then a dropped pie.
Which is why I've got parchment.

816
00:36:41,443 --> 00:36:42,538
It might not be as crisp

817
00:36:42,563 --> 00:36:44,338
but I'd rather have
a not crisp edge than

818
00:36:44,363 --> 00:36:46,658
a no edge at all, do
you know what I mean?

819
00:36:47,763 --> 00:36:50,458
Rowan's pate sablee
pies will be filled with lemon

820
00:36:50,483 --> 00:36:53,978
and blueberry and frangipane
with flaked almonds and chocolate.

821
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,338
Patsy and Eddie will appear in

822
00:36:55,363 --> 00:36:59,698
pastry relief silhouette leaving
Rowan to paint their faces by hand.

823
00:36:59,723 --> 00:37:01,338
It's Patsy.

824
00:37:01,363 --> 00:37:03,218
And what about timing,
have you got a plan?

825
00:37:03,243 --> 00:37:04,538
Um, no.

826
00:37:04,563 --> 00:37:06,898
The thing about you is you
just go with the flow, don't ya?

827
00:37:06,923 --> 00:37:09,258
Yeah. It might look
rubbish but it tastes great.

828
00:37:09,283 --> 00:37:11,179
No, but this doesn't. It's like...
I'm actually quite impressed.

829
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:12,498
I'm quite surprised.

830
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:15,738
Rowan's not alone in
celebrating the matriarchy.

831
00:37:15,763 --> 00:37:18,098
My nan, she was always
pushing me to enter the Bake Off.

832
00:37:18,123 --> 00:37:19,938
I said I would do and
then after she was ill

833
00:37:19,963 --> 00:37:22,738
and passed away I wasn't quite
ready so I waited another year.

834
00:37:22,763 --> 00:37:26,458
Josh's Showstopper is for
his late grandmother, Frieda.

835
00:37:26,483 --> 00:37:28,818
I used to do quite a bit
of baking at her house.

836
00:37:28,843 --> 00:37:31,858
Used to go out on Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, after school

837
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:34,418
and I did this from the age of
about five or six through to...

838
00:37:34,443 --> 00:37:36,898
I was still doing it when
I was doing my PhD.

839
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:38,098
That's the reason why I know

840
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,019
a lot about all the flowers
that are around here,

841
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:42,938
because she taught
me all about flowers.

842
00:37:42,963 --> 00:37:45,498
Josh is making a
sunflower with two pineapple

843
00:37:45,523 --> 00:37:47,858
and apricot flower
heads and three apple,

844
00:37:47,883 --> 00:37:49,898
blackberry and coconut leaves,

845
00:37:49,923 --> 00:37:53,138
all complete with coloured
pastry and syrup glaze.

846
00:37:53,163 --> 00:37:55,778
You seem pretty calm
about this challenge. I am.

847
00:37:55,803 --> 00:37:58,818
You weren't very happy yesterday.
Are you much calmer now doing this?

848
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:02,139
Yeah, no, I would've liked to have done a
bit better on the technical yesterday but...

849
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:04,498
You've got high standards
for yourself, haven't you?

850
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:06,099
I put too much pressure
on myself, I know.

851
00:38:06,123 --> 00:38:07,898
But hopefully this is
all right today. Yes.

852
00:38:07,923 --> 00:38:09,458
Look forward to it.
Sounds really good.

853
00:38:09,483 --> 00:38:11,058
Nice and floral.
That's all that done.

854
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,378
And Josh's grandmother
isn't the only one to get

855
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:14,858
the Showstopper treatment.

856
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:19,618
They're all flavours from my gran's
garden, cos she had apple trees,

857
00:38:19,643 --> 00:38:23,538
she had a plum tree,
there was always rhubarb.

858
00:38:23,563 --> 00:38:26,218
Her baking was like a
pair of comfy old slippers.

859
00:38:26,243 --> 00:38:30,138
Nicky's comforting pies will
be filled with apple and pear,

860
00:38:30,163 --> 00:38:32,938
plum and frangipane and
rhubarb and custard with

861
00:38:32,963 --> 00:38:35,618
a smidge of ginger,
while colourful lattice work

862
00:38:35,643 --> 00:38:38,458
and flowers should
prove a feast for the eyes.

863
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,458
I know you didn't have a
particularly decent day yesterday

864
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:43,498
but today is your day, Nicky.

865
00:38:43,523 --> 00:38:46,018
And you seem very
calm. So it all looks good.

866
00:38:46,043 --> 00:38:47,498
Calm on the surface.

867
00:38:47,523 --> 00:38:49,818
You should see what's
going on under here.

868
00:38:49,843 --> 00:38:51,059
Are the little duck legs going?

869
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,539
Let's do it. You can do it. You'll
be all right. Good luck, Nicky.

870
00:38:53,563 --> 00:38:58,058
I'm just gonna toast the nuts. I
am doing a honey baklava pie.

871
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,858
It's got pistachios
and hazelnuts

872
00:38:59,883 --> 00:39:02,738
and walnuts in an orange
syrup on the bottom base with

873
00:39:02,763 --> 00:39:05,058
an almond frangipane
on top. But, yeah...

874
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:07,458
You had me at marzipan.

875
00:39:07,483 --> 00:39:09,178
I didn't say marzipan!

876
00:39:09,203 --> 00:39:10,698
THEY LAUGH

877
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,018
Almonds - close enough.

878
00:39:12,043 --> 00:39:13,578
You had me at almond!

879
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:17,938
Her frangipane and baklava main
pie will be paired with mulled wine

880
00:39:17,963 --> 00:39:19,738
and apple miniature pies

881
00:39:19,763 --> 00:39:23,698
and decorated with a
sturdy shortcrust tree.

882
00:39:23,723 --> 00:39:26,898
I like a good chunky pastry
so that's what I'm hoping for,

883
00:39:26,923 --> 00:39:28,778
but we shall see if that works.

884
00:39:28,803 --> 00:39:31,098
When the bakers are
happy with their pastry...

885
00:39:31,123 --> 00:39:33,378
This looks like
it's rested well.

886
00:39:33,403 --> 00:39:35,098
it's time to roll...

887
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:39,778
Tell you what, this
jumper'll be coming off soon.

888
00:39:39,803 --> 00:39:42,258
About two or three millimetres
is what I'm looking for.

889
00:39:42,283 --> 00:39:47,178
before lining the pie tins to a
standard expected by the judges...

890
00:39:47,203 --> 00:39:49,138
Hello.

891
00:39:49,163 --> 00:39:51,738
Press it in. You've
just made a hole.

892
00:39:51,763 --> 00:39:54,818
SHE LAUGHS

893
00:39:54,843 --> 00:39:59,218
Ten minutes in the freezer
firms it up, then we can blind bake.

894
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:04,378
I'm making a pineapple, cherry
and rum pie and apple pie.

895
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:07,418
Apple from
Herefordshire, where I live.

896
00:40:07,443 --> 00:40:11,298
And pineapple from my
birth country Sri Lanka,

897
00:40:11,323 --> 00:40:14,858
representing a
bit of both worlds.

898
00:40:14,883 --> 00:40:17,178
Intelligence analyst
Saku is making

899
00:40:17,203 --> 00:40:18,778
an info graphic-inspired
pie display,

900
00:40:18,803 --> 00:40:19,898
built from

901
00:40:19,923 --> 00:40:21,858
a sweet shortcrust
pastry made by

902
00:40:21,883 --> 00:40:23,258
replacing some of

903
00:40:23,283 --> 00:40:25,578
the butter with cream cheese.

904
00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:27,898
I have never made pastry
with cream cheese before.

905
00:40:27,923 --> 00:40:29,338
Cream cheese. Very interesting.

906
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:30,418
It tastes better.

907
00:40:30,443 --> 00:40:32,738
Is it quite a flaky pastry?

908
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,258
It is kind of melt-in-the-mouth
kind of pastry.

909
00:40:35,283 --> 00:40:38,218
OK. Right, I look
forward to this one, Saku.

910
00:40:38,243 --> 00:40:41,378
I'm gonna get my pastry in now
cos I need to get blind-baking.

911
00:40:41,403 --> 00:40:43,338
It's only gonna go in
for about ten minutes,

912
00:40:43,363 --> 00:40:45,378
just so it's like partially
baked for the filling.

913
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:47,738
I'm not blind-baking.
Everybody else is.

914
00:40:47,763 --> 00:40:50,018
It's going in, come on.

915
00:40:50,043 --> 00:40:52,378
Ooh, actually it's not going in.

916
00:40:52,403 --> 00:40:54,258
It needs to go on a tray.

917
00:40:54,283 --> 00:40:56,618
Silly sausage that I am.

918
00:40:56,643 --> 00:40:57,978
You will fit in there,

919
00:40:58,003 --> 00:41:00,298
you will fit in there,
you won't fit in there.

920
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:01,738
How long do we have?

921
00:41:04,163 --> 00:41:07,338
I am the genie of the kettle.
You have three wishes, my child.

922
00:41:07,363 --> 00:41:08,898
Amazing. First wish -

923
00:41:08,923 --> 00:41:10,898
can you do the time
call? I'm a little bit busy.

924
00:41:10,923 --> 00:41:12,178
No problem.

925
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:15,618
Bakers, you are halfway through!

926
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:16,858
That's ages, that is.

927
00:41:16,883 --> 00:41:19,218
I'm ready to start getting
all the decoration ready.

928
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:22,738
Prue and Paul are expecting that
decoration to be highly detailed.

929
00:41:22,763 --> 00:41:24,818
So I'm just doing the leaves.

930
00:41:24,843 --> 00:41:27,178
But while the bakers
prepare these...

931
00:41:27,203 --> 00:41:29,178
I'm now making my
chocolate genoise sponge.

932
00:41:29,203 --> 00:41:30,458
and their other fillings...

933
00:41:30,483 --> 00:41:33,778
For my frangipane I've whizzed
some raspberries through there.

934
00:41:33,803 --> 00:41:36,898
they need to keep a watchful
eye on their blind-baked pastry.

935
00:41:36,923 --> 00:41:38,418
Yeah, they're looking good.

936
00:41:38,443 --> 00:41:40,458
Hopefully. well, we'll
see when | Lift these off.

937
00:41:40,483 --> 00:41:44,818
The pastry just doesn't look
right. I can't do nothing now. OK.

938
00:41:44,843 --> 00:41:45,818
I just need it partially baked

939
00:41:45,843 --> 00:41:47,778
cos it's gonna go back
in with all the fillings,

940
00:41:47,803 --> 00:41:50,338
so I don't want to get it
too kind of golden and burnt.

941
00:41:50,363 --> 00:41:52,978
Baked too long and the
pastry might become too dry

942
00:41:53,003 --> 00:41:56,938
and crumbly to attach the
decorative lid to later on.

943
00:41:56,963 --> 00:41:59,458
Dan, what an absolute
mess. I know, I'm really sorry.

944
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,898
What's going on? What's
the matter? What happened?

945
00:42:01,923 --> 00:42:03,779
It's just... Well, it's a
good sign, to be fair.

946
00:42:03,803 --> 00:42:07,018
It means that my pastry is
extremely crumbly and yummy.

947
00:42:07,043 --> 00:42:09,538
Inspired by his travels
in South America

948
00:42:09,563 --> 00:42:12,378
Dan's making a pie for
his favourite destinations.

949
00:42:12,403 --> 00:42:14,818
Cherry for Peru,
grape for Argentina

950
00:42:14,843 --> 00:42:17,818
and tropical fruits for Brazil.

951
00:42:17,843 --> 00:42:19,618
So I've just started
my decorations now.

952
00:42:19,643 --> 00:42:21,498
How many elements
have you got going on?

953
00:42:21,523 --> 00:42:23,858
About 14,600 at the moment.

954
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:26,539
It's really intricate, isn't it? It's
still a bit of a mess but go on.

955
00:42:26,563 --> 00:42:28,898
I know it is but I'll
hoover up when I'm done.

956
00:42:28,923 --> 00:42:32,938
And Dan is not the only baker
taking the judges on their travels.

957
00:42:32,963 --> 00:42:36,818
The theme is like my two
favourite places, cos I like skiing

958
00:42:36,843 --> 00:42:39,898
<i>and I also like... I
just like the.. the sea.</i>

959
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:41,698
Um, so the central pie is like

960
00:42:41,723 --> 00:42:44,578
a signpost going
to those two places.

961
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,898
Tasha's sea pie will
contain a filling of apricot

962
00:42:46,923 --> 00:42:48,378
and ricotta,

963
00:42:48,403 --> 00:42:50,338
the mountains,
chestnut and blueberries,

964
00:42:50,363 --> 00:42:52,338
while her pecan pie signpost

965
00:42:52,363 --> 00:42:56,738
will spell out her favourite
places in British sign language.

966
00:42:56,763 --> 00:42:59,218
It's almost like a
teaching moment for

967
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,098
a little bit of finger spelling.

968
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:03,858
It's really difficult
to do in pastry.

969
00:43:03,883 --> 00:43:05,378
It's a bit thinner
than I wanted.

970
00:43:05,403 --> 00:43:07,298
I made a bit of a
mistake but it's OK.

971
00:43:07,323 --> 00:43:09,658
And Matty's also
heading to the slopes.

972
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:13,578
I've been Andorra,
Sestriere and Leger in France.

973
00:43:13,603 --> 00:43:15,858
Yeah, I love it
there, it's quality.

974
00:43:17,203 --> 00:43:18,498
Matty's pies will make

975
00:43:18,523 --> 00:43:21,178
the ideal apres-ski comfort
food, filled with rhubarb

976
00:43:21,203 --> 00:43:24,018
and custard, apple and
cinnamon and plums.

977
00:43:24,043 --> 00:43:26,378
How are you using
your plums in the, pie?

978
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:29,418
So I'm gonna stew
these down slightly.

979
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:31,738
THEY LAUGH Stew down your plums?

980
00:43:31,763 --> 00:43:33,658
Indeed. Um...

981
00:43:33,683 --> 00:43:36,178
With the stem ginger, some
of the orange juice as well.

982
00:43:36,203 --> 00:43:38,458
I love ginger and
plums. It works...

983
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:39,698
THEY LAUGH

984
00:43:39,723 --> 00:43:42,018
SHE SIGHS Stop it, boys.

985
00:43:42,043 --> 00:43:44,298
Sorry, Prue. Enough!

986
00:43:44,323 --> 00:43:46,618
With pastry cases prepared...

987
00:43:46,643 --> 00:43:49,458
So this is the lemon and
blueberry kind of curd.

988
00:43:49,483 --> 00:43:51,138
it's time to assemble.

989
00:43:51,163 --> 00:43:53,578
Today is two years to the
day since she passed away.

990
00:43:53,603 --> 00:43:56,098
I hope I can do these
flavours justice today.

991
00:43:57,683 --> 00:43:59,978
It's fine, isn't it? Yeah.

992
00:44:00,003 --> 00:44:02,738
Come on, Nick. Stick
everything else on.

993
00:44:02,763 --> 00:44:05,578
I just want to get this
one in ASAP Rocky.

994
00:44:05,603 --> 00:44:08,018
I'm gonna have to, like,
move like no-one's business.

995
00:44:08,043 --> 00:44:09,738
What you doing there, egg wash?

996
00:44:09,763 --> 00:44:12,218
Yeah, bit more egg wash. I
used to egg-wash my legs.

997
00:44:12,243 --> 00:44:15,298
Did ya? Yeah. They come
up nice actually. Quite glossy.

998
00:44:15,323 --> 00:44:16,498
You have great skin, though,

999
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:18,818
I must say. We
always talk about it.

1000
00:44:18,843 --> 00:44:20,298
Like a dolphin.

1001
00:44:21,483 --> 00:44:25,178
They will go in for
about 30 minutes, I think.

1002
00:44:25,203 --> 00:44:28,178
Everything's in the oven.
Just see what happens.

1003
00:44:28,203 --> 00:44:29,658
I'm feeling so confident.

1004
00:44:29,683 --> 00:44:31,978
Watch it all crumble
at the last second.

1005
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:32,978
How long's left?

1006
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,738
Bakers, you have
half an hour left.

1007
00:44:35,763 --> 00:44:38,218
You're joking. Just
running out of time, aren't 1?

1008
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:39,498
Dan, you OK?

1009
00:44:39,523 --> 00:44:40,898
Running late like usual.

1010
00:44:40,923 --> 00:44:42,658
It's all right, don't worry.

1011
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:43,778
Cheerio.

1012
00:44:43,803 --> 00:44:48,138
I've got one flan in. I
am elated, let me tell you.

1013
00:44:48,163 --> 00:44:49,698
There's a lot of spillage.

1014
00:44:49,723 --> 00:44:52,418
There's a bit of a
PLUMBING issue happening.

1015
00:44:52,443 --> 00:44:55,978
And Dana's not the only
one who's sprung a leak.

1016
00:44:56,003 --> 00:44:57,378
I'm having a spillage. Spillage.

1017
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,138
The top's kind of separated
from the bottom on that one.

1018
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:02,779
It's quite severe. It's getting
more severe every time I look at it.

1019
00:45:02,803 --> 00:45:04,299
There's been a
spillage in the village.

1020
00:45:04,323 --> 00:45:06,858
Come on, you can do this, Nick.

1021
00:45:06,883 --> 00:45:09,138
Crank it up again, 200.

1022
00:45:09,163 --> 00:45:10,378
Look at it.

1023
00:45:10,403 --> 00:45:12,658
How the hell is that
gonna come out?

1024
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,298
I've just put the BSL
finger spelling on,

1025
00:45:16,323 --> 00:45:17,818
so it's going back in the oven.

1026
00:45:17,843 --> 00:45:20,818
I'm just hoping it
doesn't melt completely.

1027
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:24,378
Bakers, you have
15 minutes left.

1028
00:45:24,403 --> 00:45:28,258
Come on, you can do this.
Just shove that in as it is.

1029
00:45:28,283 --> 00:45:31,578
As Nicky gets her
final pie in the oven,

1030
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:34,898
the other bakers are
beginning to take theirs out.

1031
00:45:34,923 --> 00:45:36,058
I'm happy with that.

1032
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:37,898
That's a nice really
golden brown colour.

1033
00:45:40,283 --> 00:45:41,978
Where have the mountains gone?

1034
00:45:42,003 --> 00:45:46,338
This is genuinely traumatising.
I need another pair of hands.

1035
00:45:46,363 --> 00:45:47,858
It's a bit stuck.

1036
00:45:50,963 --> 00:45:53,938
No soggy bottom. Yes!

1037
00:45:53,963 --> 00:45:56,298
What do we need to do? Could
you grab these two ends? Yeah.

1038
00:45:56,323 --> 00:45:59,098
And I grab this and
we lift. It's just cracked.

1039
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,979
What's the matter? It
just broke. No, it hasn't.

1040
00:46:01,003 --> 00:46:03,338
It's just snapped,
yeah. Try one more time.

1041
00:46:03,363 --> 00:46:05,098
We'll see what
happens. Really carefully.

1042
00:46:05,123 --> 00:46:06,738
Three, two, one. That's gone,

1043
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:08,578
Yeah, no, that's split.

1044
00:46:08,603 --> 00:46:10,418
No, what do I do?

1045
00:46:13,843 --> 00:46:16,578
Serve it in the tin. There's
nothing else you can do. Shall I?

1046
00:46:16,603 --> 00:46:20,298
Yeah, and if they say anything just
say that Noel said to serve it in a tin.

1047
00:46:20,323 --> 00:46:22,298
THEY LAUGH

1048
00:46:23,923 --> 00:46:25,818
This is not happening today.

1049
00:46:28,403 --> 00:46:31,018
Bakers, you have
one minute left.

1050
00:46:31,043 --> 00:46:33,578
Argh! Disaster.

1051
00:46:35,283 --> 00:46:37,698
Wow, I've got a bit of a leak.

1052
00:46:37,723 --> 00:46:39,178
Ooh!

1053
00:46:43,323 --> 00:46:45,298
Why has this never happened?

1054
00:46:47,643 --> 00:46:49,978
Bakers, that is your time up.

1055
00:46:50,003 --> 00:46:51,458
Flipping heck.

1056
00:46:51,483 --> 00:46:54,978
Please step away from
your pastry Showstoppers.

1057
00:46:55,003 --> 00:46:57,338
Do you know what,
guys? I've tried my best.

1058
00:46:57,363 --> 00:46:58,618
This is terrible.

1059
00:46:58,643 --> 00:47:00,578
Do you want a hug? Hug.

1060
00:47:00,603 --> 00:47:03,018
A nice, sweaty hug. THEY LAUGH

1061
00:47:03,043 --> 00:47:04,538
Nicky.

1062
00:47:11,723 --> 00:47:14,658
The bakers' sweet
decorative pie Showstoppers

1063
00:47:14,683 --> 00:47:17,898
will now be judged
by Paul and Prue.

1064
00:47:21,483 --> 00:47:23,858
It's a sensational
display and I love the way

1065
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,298
you've decorated
them. Thank you.

1066
00:47:26,323 --> 00:47:28,178
Let's try the bottom one first.

1067
00:47:28,203 --> 00:47:29,778
This is apple, cinnamon...

1068
00:47:29,803 --> 00:47:31,738
And sultanas.

1069
00:47:31,763 --> 00:47:33,098
That's held together.

1070
00:47:36,763 --> 00:47:38,178
The flavour of that is spot on.

1071
00:47:38,203 --> 00:47:39,818
SHE SIGHS OK.

1072
00:47:39,843 --> 00:47:42,578
Um, it's beautifully
cooked. It's soft. This is the...

1073
00:47:42,603 --> 00:47:44,458
Raspberry and frangipane.

1074
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,858
I've never had frangipane
with raspberry in it before.

1075
00:47:48,883 --> 00:47:52,018
But that's amazing, I
love that. This is blueberry.

1076
00:47:52,043 --> 00:47:53,458
Yeah.

1077
00:47:55,243 --> 00:47:57,938
I like the blueberry. It's
intense, very American.

1078
00:47:57,963 --> 00:48:00,298
I think they're three
very good pies.

1079
00:48:00,323 --> 00:48:03,098
OK, great. Well done, Cristy.
Thank you. Well done, Cristy.

1080
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:10,698
I would be tempted to put
a glaze on this, you know.

1081
00:48:10,723 --> 00:48:13,298
Just looks a bit rough and
ready. Especially this one.

1082
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:15,218
This is the pecan pie.

1083
00:48:15,243 --> 00:48:17,058
There's a bit of, whisky
in there as well so

1084
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:19,098
a bit like an
American pecan pie.

1085
00:48:19,123 --> 00:48:21,498
I really like that.
It's beautifully crispy.

1086
00:48:23,043 --> 00:48:24,218
The mountain pie has

1087
00:48:24,243 --> 00:48:26,818
a blueberry sweet pastry
with a chestnut layer.

1088
00:48:26,843 --> 00:48:28,178
Goodness.

1089
00:48:28,203 --> 00:48:30,058
Wow, that's, vibrant.

1090
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:35,138
It's quite wet inside.
The pastry is like cake.

1091
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:36,378
OK.

1092
00:48:36,403 --> 00:48:38,698
The sunburst pie is an
apricot and ricotta pie

1093
00:48:38,723 --> 00:48:40,778
with a sweet pastry.

1094
00:48:40,803 --> 00:48:43,218
It's a lovely texture.
Tastes delicious.

1095
00:48:43,243 --> 00:48:45,178
I love the tartness
from the apricot.

1096
00:48:45,203 --> 00:48:46,258
Thank you.

1097
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:53,218
The bottom pie is
a cherry and kirsch

1098
00:48:53,243 --> 00:48:55,058
with a chocolate
sweet shortcrust.

1099
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:57,418
I quite like the
compote inside there.

1100
00:48:57,443 --> 00:48:59,738
But I don't think the
chocolate crust really works

1101
00:48:59,763 --> 00:49:02,138
with it. It's a bit
sandy and dry.

1102
00:49:02,163 --> 00:49:03,298
Next one.

1103
00:49:03,323 --> 00:49:05,218
Grape and strawberry.

1104
00:49:05,243 --> 00:49:09,698
But grapes on their own are
very subtle in flavour, so it's lost.

1105
00:49:09,723 --> 00:49:11,618
And the top pie is mango,

1106
00:49:11,643 --> 00:49:15,418
papaya and pineapple with a
lemon and lime sweet shortcrust.

1107
00:49:15,443 --> 00:49:16,978
The textures on
the base are lovely.

1108
00:49:17,003 --> 00:49:19,378
I'm not quite sure of the
textures of some of the fruit,

1109
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:21,979
cos they're not quite right. OK.
They needed a little bit more cooking.

1110
00:49:22,003 --> 00:49:23,178
Just not hitting my heights.

1111
00:49:28,843 --> 00:49:32,298
So this is my tree. You've got a
baklava pie, so we've got pistachios,

1112
00:49:32,323 --> 00:49:34,978
hazelnuts and walnuts
mixed with an orange syrup

1113
00:49:35,003 --> 00:49:37,338
and there's a
frangipane filling on top.

1114
00:49:37,363 --> 00:49:39,658
That is delicious
but it's very rich.

1115
00:49:39,683 --> 00:49:41,338
And it's very sweet.

1116
00:49:41,363 --> 00:49:44,218
I think the frangipane's too
thick. Means now it's under baked.

1117
00:49:44,243 --> 00:49:45,658
So what is this one?

1118
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:47,978
This is my mulled
wine apple pie.

1119
00:49:48,003 --> 00:49:52,498
It's got some blackcurrants
as well running through it.

1120
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:55,258
Too sour. It hits
you right there.

1121
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,818
I think it is perhaps
too powerful.

1122
00:50:03,803 --> 00:50:06,818
They're a little bit...
Broken. Just a little bit rustic.

1123
00:50:06,843 --> 00:50:10,098
Apple and blackberry
with some cinnamon.

1124
00:50:10,123 --> 00:50:12,498
Some of the top
is actually raw. OK.

1125
00:50:12,523 --> 00:50:14,818
The flavour is not bad.
Rhubarb and custard.

1126
00:50:14,843 --> 00:50:16,778
Yeah.

1127
00:50:16,803 --> 00:50:19,098
The rhubarb comes
through well there.

1128
00:50:19,123 --> 00:50:20,738
It's a very good pie.

1129
00:50:20,763 --> 00:50:21,858
Reticent to try this one.

1130
00:50:21,883 --> 00:50:23,378
It's collapsed a bit.

1131
00:50:23,403 --> 00:50:25,018
Plum and some ginger.

1132
00:50:25,043 --> 00:50:26,538
The fruit is undercooked.

1133
00:50:26,563 --> 00:50:29,258
Best one there is the rhubarb and
custard by quite a margin. Yeah.

1134
00:50:29,283 --> 00:50:30,618
Thank you.

1135
00:50:33,603 --> 00:50:39,098
Saku, what I really love about
this is it looks so simple and fresh.

1136
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:42,378
The big pie is pineapple,
cherry and rum.

1137
00:50:42,403 --> 00:50:45,178
Um, the fruit's quite raw.

1138
00:50:45,203 --> 00:50:47,538
I wouldn't go back
for a second piece.

1139
00:50:47,563 --> 00:50:49,138
Let's have a look
at the apple and...

1140
00:50:49,163 --> 00:50:50,938
Apple and cinnamon.

1141
00:50:50,963 --> 00:50:52,578
I really like the
apple. Thank you.

1142
00:50:52,603 --> 00:50:54,098
Cinnamon level's
just about right.

1143
00:50:54,123 --> 00:50:55,938
The pastry's nice and
delicate and buttery.

1144
00:50:55,963 --> 00:50:58,218
I think that's
delicious. Well done.

1145
00:50:58,243 --> 00:50:59,298
Thank you very much.

1146
00:51:04,043 --> 00:51:05,898
I mean, that is a work of art.

1147
00:51:05,923 --> 00:51:09,018
You've got a very simple
theme, but it pulls all

1148
00:51:09,043 --> 00:51:11,378
the pies together
most excellently.

1149
00:51:11,403 --> 00:51:14,498
It's a pineapple and apricot
pie, spiced with cinnamon stick,

1150
00:51:14,523 --> 00:51:16,778
star anise and it's got
some vanilla in there.

1151
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:21,818
That's really good.
It's tart, it's sweet,

1152
00:51:21,843 --> 00:51:23,258
it's crunchy,

1153
00:51:23,283 --> 00:51:25,138
it's got depth to
it. It's delicious.

1154
00:51:25,163 --> 00:51:27,218
Well, I can't fault that.

1155
00:51:27,243 --> 00:51:29,938
Thank you. The leaves
are made with a coconut,

1156
00:51:29,963 --> 00:51:31,738
apple and blackberry pie.

1157
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:34,578
That's delicious.

1158
00:51:34,603 --> 00:51:36,018
And the right texture. Yeah.

1159
00:51:36,043 --> 00:51:38,058
It holds together,
but it's moist.

1160
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:39,898
This is what we've
been looking for.

1161
00:51:39,923 --> 00:51:43,578
It's wonderful. Well done, Josh.
Well done, Josh. Thank you. Yes, Josh!

1162
00:51:48,443 --> 00:51:50,738
You've got Patsy
pretty well perfectly.

1163
00:51:50,763 --> 00:51:52,538
Eddie's less
successful, I think.

1164
00:51:52,563 --> 00:51:54,818
Eddie is filled with
cherry and vanilla.

1165
00:51:57,083 --> 00:51:59,978
I can't really...
It's so difficult.

1166
00:52:00,003 --> 00:52:01,698
THEY SNIGGER

1167
00:52:01,723 --> 00:52:03,578
This didn't happen
at home, believe me.

1168
00:52:03,603 --> 00:52:06,018
It's just pouring out.
It's not... Nothing's set.

1169
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:08,378
The pastry's very
good. Thank you.

1170
00:52:08,403 --> 00:52:10,338
Crisp, very short,

1171
00:52:10,363 --> 00:52:11,818
but it looks awful.

1172
00:52:11,843 --> 00:52:13,738
It's very clumsy. Yeah.

1173
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:15,098
You can't get it out of the tin.

1174
00:52:15,123 --> 00:52:18,978
No. Patsy is filled with
lemon and blueberry.

1175
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:21,858
Very clumsy. And you say
they were all right at home?

1176
00:52:21,883 --> 00:52:23,578
Honestly, lovely, yeah.

1177
00:52:23,603 --> 00:52:25,898
Well, this one has got
the opposite problem.

1178
00:52:25,923 --> 00:52:27,179
So this is a
chocolate frangipane

1179
00:52:27,203 --> 00:52:30,418
and just a standard almond
frangipane with flaked almonds.

1180
00:52:30,443 --> 00:52:32,738
It's very solid. Too dry.

1181
00:52:32,763 --> 00:52:35,058
Besides that... LAUGHTER

1182
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:36,858
it's pretty good. Success.

1183
00:52:41,803 --> 00:52:44,058
I think they're all very pretty.

1184
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:45,258
You've made a real effort

1185
00:52:45,283 --> 00:52:47,618
to jolly it up and I
love that, of course.

1186
00:52:47,643 --> 00:52:52,578
The first one is an apple,
pear and hazelnut pie.

1187
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:54,418
I've never had a
dry apple pie before.

1188
00:52:54,443 --> 00:52:57,538
Don't! Well, there's a first
for everything, isn't there?

1189
00:52:57,563 --> 00:53:00,498
I think partially it's
because it's so exposed.

1190
00:53:00,523 --> 00:53:02,499
All the moisture that was
in that pie... Gone, tssh!

1191
00:53:02,523 --> 00:53:03,978
has just evaporated off.

1192
00:53:04,003 --> 00:53:06,018
The second one is rhubarb,

1193
00:53:06,043 --> 00:53:08,658
custard and a wee
bit of ginger in there.

1194
00:53:08,683 --> 00:53:10,418
The custard works really well.

1195
00:53:10,443 --> 00:53:12,818
It's pretty thick but
it's absolutely set.

1196
00:53:12,843 --> 00:53:14,418
The pastry's too
thick for the filling

1197
00:53:14,443 --> 00:53:16,058
so there's hardly
any filling in there.

1198
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:17,258
Deeper pie.

1199
00:53:17,283 --> 00:53:21,898
Yeah. And then the third
one is frangipane and plum.

1200
00:53:21,923 --> 00:53:24,498
It's a punchy flavour and
it's thin, so you've got that,

1201
00:53:24,523 --> 00:53:27,178
and then the sort of plum
on top, it's about right as well.

1202
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:29,619
So actually it's quite a nice
flavour. That is delicious. Yeah.

1203
00:53:29,643 --> 00:53:30,978
Thank you.

1204
00:53:31,003 --> 00:53:34,098
I've got take a positive
that it was sort of really short

1205
00:53:34,123 --> 00:53:35,578
and nice pastry,

1206
00:53:35,603 --> 00:53:38,698
and actually she did say
that the flavours were good.

1207
00:53:38,723 --> 00:53:40,298
I was just trying
to hold it all back,

1208
00:53:40,323 --> 00:53:42,618
I was like, " my goodness,
this is incredible.”

1209
00:53:42,643 --> 00:53:44,098
They loved it. I'm so pleased.

1210
00:53:44,123 --> 00:53:46,658
If Josh got Star Baker, I'd
be over the moon for him.

1211
00:53:46,683 --> 00:53:51,058
But to even be in the mix
for Star Baker's, like, amazing.

1212
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:53,458
I thought their comments
were probably quite polite

1213
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:55,818
for what they could've
said. What a disaster!

1214
00:54:03,843 --> 00:54:05,379
Do you know what? I
am nervous for today.

1215
00:54:05,403 --> 00:54:07,858
Are ya? A double whammy. I know.

1216
00:54:07,883 --> 00:54:11,258
Who's it gonna be? Painful.
We know them all so well now.

1217
00:54:11,283 --> 00:54:14,018
I thought Rowan's
pies were so awful.

1218
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:16,338
I thought it looked a
little bit like soup as well.

1219
00:54:16,363 --> 00:54:17,658
To be honest, we needed a straw.

1220
00:54:17,683 --> 00:54:20,018
I was a bit surprised
with Dana's efforts.

1221
00:54:20,043 --> 00:54:22,698
I think she lost her edge a
little bit on the Showstopper.

1222
00:54:22,723 --> 00:54:24,738
There's an argument for
Saku to be there as well

1223
00:54:24,763 --> 00:54:27,058
but has she done enough
on her Showstopper

1224
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:28,098
to save herself?

1225
00:54:28,123 --> 00:54:29,538
And Nicky's down there as well.

1226
00:54:29,563 --> 00:54:30,698
I feel bad for Nicky. Yeah.

1227
00:54:30,723 --> 00:54:33,058
But I think she's had a
tough week, hasn't she?

1228
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:35,578
I think Star Baker's between
a couple of people as well.

1229
00:54:35,603 --> 00:54:37,898
I think Cristy, Josh.

1230
00:54:37,923 --> 00:54:40,698
I think Josh's
sunflower was as perfect

1231
00:54:40,723 --> 00:54:43,058
a piece of pastry as
you could hope for.

1232
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:44,779
And Cristy, I think
she's had... Yeah, yeah.

1233
00:54:44,803 --> 00:54:47,178
Yeah... A much better week
generally. Yeah, she has.

1234
00:54:47,203 --> 00:54:50,059
What happens now? You go and eat all of the
rest of the pies? I'm not eating any more.

1235
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,378
If I expand any more

1236
00:54:51,403 --> 00:54:53,898
I'm gonna take someone's
eye out with that button.

1237
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,818
THEY LAUGH

1238
00:54:57,763 --> 00:55:01,138
Prue and Paul have decided
who will be this week's Star Baker,

1239
00:55:01,163 --> 00:55:05,018
and which two bakers will
be leaving the competition.

1240
00:55:05,043 --> 00:55:08,458
Now, I've got the
great job of announcing

1241
00:55:08,483 --> 00:55:10,218
this week's Star Baker,

1242
00:55:10,243 --> 00:55:12,658
and this is someone
who the judges thought

1243
00:55:12,683 --> 00:55:14,298
was consistent throughout.

1244
00:55:14,323 --> 00:55:17,178
So, this week's Star Baker is...

1245
00:55:20,043 --> 00:55:21,818
Cristy.

1246
00:55:21,843 --> 00:55:23,658
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Well done!

1247
00:55:23,683 --> 00:55:26,218
Thank you, thank you.

1248
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:28,058
I knew that was coming.

1249
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:31,058
That means I've
got the horrible job

1250
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:33,378
of announcing who's leaving us.

1251
00:55:33,403 --> 00:55:35,378
And, as you know, two people

1252
00:55:35,403 --> 00:55:37,978
will be going this week.

1253
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:41,538
And the people that are
leaving us this week are...

1254
00:55:46,563 --> 00:55:49,338
Nicky and Rowan.

1255
00:55:49,363 --> 00:55:52,498
Come here. Come here!

1256
00:55:52,523 --> 00:55:54,178
It's been a blast.

1257
00:55:54,203 --> 00:55:55,538
That wasn't your week, was it?

1258
00:55:55,563 --> 00:55:58,258
What did I say? It was like
a bag of pants this week.

1259
00:55:58,283 --> 00:55:59,778
So...

1260
00:55:59,803 --> 00:56:02,138
I shall miss you so
much. I had a lovely time.

1261
00:56:02,163 --> 00:56:04,458
I can't stay in after
a bag of pants.

1262
00:56:04,483 --> 00:56:06,298
There's no way!

1263
00:56:06,323 --> 00:56:07,858
Can I have a hug?

1264
00:56:07,883 --> 00:56:09,698
Aww. I'm absolutely gutted.

1265
00:56:09,723 --> 00:56:11,138
Everyone has just been fab.

1266
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:13,498
I mean, saying goodbye
is the worst part about this,

1267
00:56:13,523 --> 00:56:16,298
not the absolute roast I
got at the Showstopper.

1268
00:56:16,323 --> 00:56:18,938
I promise I can bake.
Come here, Paul!

1269
00:56:18,963 --> 00:56:21,658
I think Rowan went
because of that Showstopper.

1270
00:56:21,683 --> 00:56:24,138
We've had a blast, haven't
we? We've had an absolutely...

1271
00:56:24,163 --> 00:56:26,778
And the other person who's
had a really bad week is Nicky.

1272
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:28,379
It's been really sad
to let two of them go.

1273
00:56:28,403 --> 00:56:31,018
Another one? Thank you so much.

1274
00:56:31,043 --> 00:56:33,418
I've got this boost, which
I've probably needed,

1275
00:56:33,443 --> 00:56:36,378
cos I think sometimes,
when you're a mum,

1276
00:56:36,403 --> 00:56:38,698
everything's for everyone else

1277
00:56:38,723 --> 00:56:41,058
and you sort of put
your dreams on hold.

1278
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:44,538
Star Baker and a handshake.
That's more than most people get.

1279
00:56:44,563 --> 00:56:48,898
And it means than Paul and
Prue maybe even could imagine.

1280
00:56:48,923 --> 00:56:50,258
Next week...

1281
00:56:50,283 --> 00:56:53,178
I'm very pleased that
I can come back.

1282
00:56:53,203 --> 00:56:56,578
Having said that, I need
to up my game...

1283
00:56:56,603 --> 00:56:58,098
to survive.

1284
00:56:59,363 --> 00:57:00,738
Next time...

1285
00:57:00,763 --> 00:57:02,058
Go, girl!

1286
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:03,178
it's Botanicals Week...

1287
00:57:03,203 --> 00:57:05,058
It's recognisable. Like cat pee.

1288
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:07,418
and things get spicy in
the Signature...

1289
00:57:07,443 --> 00:57:09,419
In life I'd say I'm quite spicy.
Probably not in baking.

1290
00:57:09,443 --> 00:57:11,778
There's a race against time in
the Technical.

1291
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,698
What the hell is this?
I've got no recipe.

1292
00:57:13,723 --> 00:57:16,618
and the bakers take on
a blooming marvellous Showstopper.

1293
00:57:16,643 --> 00:57:17,938
Dandelion syrup.

1294
00:57:17,963 --> 00:57:19,298
This is crazy.

1295
00:57:19,323 --> 00:57:21,098
Who will come up smelling of roses?

1296
00:57:21,123 --> 00:57:22,778
Absolutely heavenly.

1297
00:57:22,803 --> 00:57:25,298
And who will be weeded out of
the competition?

1298
00:57:25,323 --> 00:57:27,178
It's broken!

1299
00:57:27,203 --> 00:57:29,458
That was the wrong thing
to do, wasn't it?

1300
00:57:49,363 --> 00:57:53,338
