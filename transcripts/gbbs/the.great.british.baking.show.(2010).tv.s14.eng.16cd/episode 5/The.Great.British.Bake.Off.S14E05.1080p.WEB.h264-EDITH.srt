1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Now, before we get on
with Pastry Week, I just wanted

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,960
to say how this show has inspired me
to bake for myself. Look at that.
That's incredible, Alison.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,160
Oh, it's nothing -
it's just a beautifully decorated
mouth-wateringly moist fruit cake.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,560
It's so good, it looks like
one of Prue's cakes. Oh, thanks.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,400
Hi, guys, couldn't do us
a favour, could you?

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,880
I'm looking for Prue's cake -
it's a beautifully decorated,

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,240
mouth-wateringly moist fruit cake.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,920
No, no, not seen anything
like that at all,

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,720
not at all. Shall we crack
on with the show? Yeah.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,680
Welcome to
the Great British Bake Off!

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,160
Hang on. I think I see Prue's cake.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Last time...

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,960
..things got messy
in Chocolate Week.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I want everyone

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,520
to clean after themselves -
it's an absolute disgrace.

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,520
And whilst Nicky's torte
made her a contender...

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,120
I think it's a little work of art.

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,960
..she was out-boxed by Matty...

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,440
I think your box is
beautifully engineered.

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,680
..who took the Star Baker title.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,080
It's got no real flavour.

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,160
And while Cristy
and Saku struggled...

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,120
Melting! ..Tasha fell ill.

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,240
Go and rest, come on.
I'll walk you back.

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,520
And they were spared.

26
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,480
You're all staying.

27
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,720
Phew, such a relief!

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,280
This time...
I've got cramp in my hands.

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,440
..the bakers face Pastry Week.

30
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,800
I'm nervous.

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
And double jeopardy.

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,080
Two people are going home
this week. Oh, I know.

33
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,720
They'll need to keep their cool...
Oh, sugar!

34
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,040
..with a steamy signature...

35
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,200
Oh, no!

36
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,680
..avoid a faux pas...

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,640
I think that's done.
..while creating a French classic.

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,240
I know what dauphinoise is.
What's the other word?

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,040
Pith-th-thivier.

40
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,600
And demonstrate
pie-making artistry.

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,960
Argh!

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,640
So they're not among
the two bakers...

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,200
There's a bit of
a plumbing issue happening.

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,840
..who'll be leaving the competition.

45
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,240
Then we lift. Oh, no,
it's just... Look, it's broken.

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,880
Oh, God. Oh, no, what do I do?

47
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,280
They're letting you go.
Shall I lead the way?

48
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,880
I actually like pastry.

49
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,960
I find it quite therapeutic.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,360
I love walking in. Do you? I do.

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,480
I never feel confident about
anything in my life,

52
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,160
and pastry's no exception.

53
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,440
So I'm just kind of going to roll
with it, as I do every week.

54
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,680
There's a lot that can go wrong
with pastry.

55
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,200
It will be interesting, especially

56
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,920
with two people going home
this week.

57
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,720
I would love to, like,
blow their minds

58
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,160
and to get Star Baker would
obviously be a dream.

59
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,880
I just don't know if it'll happen.

60
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,320
Bakers, you have made it

61
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,640
to Pastry Week, which means
you lot are the upper crust.

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,400
Now, for your Signature Challenge,

63
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,800
the judges would love you

64
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,520
to make 12 individual
savoury picnic pies.

65
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,320
The fillings and flavours
are entirely your choice,

66
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,280
but your pies must be made
from hot-water-crust pastry

67
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,480
and be attractive
and tempting to eat, just like me.

68
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,720
There's plenty of hot water,
so don't worry about that,

69
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,000
even though someone here had
a 90-minute shower this morning.

70
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,480
Paul! You have two hours.

71
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,960
Which is what Paul says
when he gets in the shower.

72
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,040
On your marks. Get set. Bake!

73
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,960
I know that I need to
get off to a rapid start.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,920
This is the hot-water-crust pastry.

75
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,280
Hot-water-crust pastry is
traditionally made with lard.

76
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,480
Good for the hips, lard.

77
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,160
The other element is butter,
and that brings flavour.

78
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,880
You make it by pouring
almost boiling water

79
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,000
and melted fat into the flour.

80
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
I'm hot potato-ing right now.

81
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,680
This is my onion and spring onions.

82
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,520
Got to put stuff inside that's, A,

83
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,000
going to be moist
to the mouth and, B,

84
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,480
going to carry a lot
of punchy flavours.

85
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,960
Oh, I love a sausage.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,720
The last thing is, you want a
beautiful bit of crimping on

87
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,120
the lid as well,
which seals in whatever

88
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,840
the bakers are going to put inside.

89
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,160
You need to drop the lid
into the pie.

90
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,480
The lid gets trapped in there
and it won't rise up and fall off.

91
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,760
As long as it's consistent

92
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,160
and seals the lid to
the side, that's good.

93
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
No pressure!

94
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,280
Morning, Star Baker.

95
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,640
Morning! Hello, Matty.

96
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,760
Hello. Morning.

97
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,200
So, Matty, tell us about your
hot-water-crust little pies.

98
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,520
So it's got ricotta and feta,
uh, a bit of garlic, some...

99
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,320
Spanakopita?
Yeah, I'm glad you said it.

100
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,280
I-I-I couldn't...
I can never pronounce it.

101
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,920
Pronounce what?

102
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
Don't be cruel, Paul!

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,480
Span-a-di-kopa-da? What?

104
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,200
{\an8}Matty's take on Greek spanakopita
will be filled

105
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,280
{\an8}with spinach, soft cheeses,
red peppers and herbs.

106
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,280
Well, good luck,
look forward to this one.

107
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,400
I feel like this is your week,
babes. It's your week.

108
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
You don't want to fall off
your throne.

109
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
Absolutely not. Yeah.

110
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah. You don't. That would hurt.

111
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,360
Looking good.

112
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,760
And Matty's not
the only baker uniting

113
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,240
a continental filling

114
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,640
with this quintessentially
British pastry.

115
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,840
So this is my potato dauphinoise.

116
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,560
Dauphinoise, I think,
is a bit classy,

117
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,200
a bit elegant,
it's a bit like myself.

118
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,960
That I think I am!

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,760
I'll bake that for a
good half an hour, just

120
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,960
so it gets nice
and crispy with all the cheese.

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
{\an8}Dana's creamy dauphinoise
will sandwich fried onions

122
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,040
{\an8}and melted Comte cheese, sealed
in rosemary-infused pastry,

123
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,080
{\an8}a recipe which echoes
a popular French bake.

124
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,440
Sounds like a pithivier.

125
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
What's that?

126
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,800
Oh, interesting. Never mind.
Have you tested it?

127
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,640
I have tested it and it has worked.
In the time?

128
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,960
I'm literally, like, ten seconds
taking it out of the oven.

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,240
While Dana needs to
accommodate the baking

130
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,600
and cooling of her
dauphinoise filling...

131
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,440
So we've got sausage meat
and we've got some strong cheese.

132
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,760
..Josh and Tasha...

133
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,000
This is not pleasant.

134
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,680
..are making a traditional
raw pork filling that'll cook while

135
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,320
the rest of the pie bakes.

136
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,480
These are the same filling
as my Christmas stuffing.

137
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,400
{\an8}Tasha's pies will get their
Christmassy flavour from

138
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,680
{\an8}the chopped sage in the sausage
and nutmeg in the pastry.

139
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,040
{\an8}The double Star Baker
will be hoping to make it

140
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,160
{\an8}a hat-trick after being unable
to complete Chocolate Week.

141
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,840
I felt weird not being here,
to be honest.

142
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,880
Did you? Yeah, I had bad FOMO.

143
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,160
I bet you couldn't relax,
could you? You were thinking,
what are they up to now?

144
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,440
I know, it was weird.
It was like, what's it
called, Stockholm syndrome?

145
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,200
It's exactly that -
Stockholm syndrome.

146
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,880
And at the end of the series, if you
win you will get kidnapped by Paul.

147
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,040
He'll lock you in his basement.

148
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,880
But you'll like it,
so it'll be fine.

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,160
And while pork is
a popular choice...

150
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,960
These are Cumberland.
From a very reputable shop as well.

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,840
Right, how hot are these chillies?

152
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,440
..two bakers are planning
to spice things up.

153
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,240
Chuck it all in.

154
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,960
So I made these
for my kids when they were young

155
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,200
to go into their lunchboxes.
Not so much spice for me.

156
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,840
But I hope it will be
good enough for you.

157
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,480
{\an8}Saku is making a milder version

158
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,600
{\an8}of her Sri Lankan spiced
tuna pies, which will see

159
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,680
{\an8}a spicy potato and tuna filling
surround a whole quail's egg.

160
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,880
Have you worked with,
uh, hot-water-crust pastry before?

161
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,040
Yes, when I was practising.
Right, OK.

162
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,920
Was that the first time you ever
made it? Never? Yes, yeah.

163
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,280
Crimping on the top?

164
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,480
Crimpling? Crimpling!

165
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,600
Crimpling. Crimpling, yes. Crimping.

166
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,520
But don't know how,
uh, beautiful it will be.

167
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,080
All right, good luck.
Good luck, Saku. Thank you
very much, Saku. Thank you.

168
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Bakers, unbelievably, you are
halfway through already.

169
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
Oh, God!

170
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,080
I just looked at my watch
and there was nothing there.

171
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,440
I literally went...

172
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,920
That's cos I stole it.
Oh, someone stole it off me.

173
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,120
With fillings made,

174
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,160
attention turns to
the lining in the pie tins.

175
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
I'm eye-balling
the pastry thickness.

176
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,400
Too thin and they could
split in the oven,

177
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,280
but going too thick
also carries risk.

178
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,400
Because hot-water-pastry,

179
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,800
it's a bit thick as well, it can
be a bit stodgy, can't it, so...

180
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,080
{\an8}Dan's added turmeric

181
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,320
{\an8}and cumin to his pastry to augment

182
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,960
{\an8}a lamb keema filling flavoured
with his home-made spice mix.

183
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,440
{\an8}Quite excited about this.

184
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,760
Yeah, fingers crossed,
it's a bit greasy, but...

185
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,680
You're not going to say that
to them, are you? No, no, no!

186
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,360
Little bit greasy!
Yeah. It's not that good.

187
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,880
I don't mind a little bit
of grease. I don't either.

188
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,520
Well, good luck. Nice one,
Noel. Greasy Dan.

189
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,320
Ah, do you know what? I just
forgot to put the mustard in.

190
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,480
We're off to a really good start.

191
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,840
Filling also needs to be tackled
with care.

192
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,440
I am just filling up
to sort of around this mark here.

193
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,800
Too little and the pies will
form an air pocket. Egg?

194
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,560
Too much and the filling
could ooze out during baking.

195
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
They look really good.

196
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,600
I just want to make sure
I've got them in.

197
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,440
They're going to take about
40 minutes or so.

198
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,960
But Nicky's nowhere
near ready to bake.

199
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,360
It's cooked the egg a little bit.

200
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,920
I don't know whether
to do it again.

201
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,760
Her hot water mix has scrambled
the egg she added

202
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,600
to enrich her first dough.

203
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,440
I'd rather just start again
and just

204
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,200
be done with it. It's fine,
it's fine, we've got this.

205
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,840
Nicky's blending sausage,

206
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,080
ham and saucisson

207
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,440
{\an8}with five different cheeses
including Cheddar

208
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,600
{\an8}and Reblochon, packed into
a classic pie tin.

209
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,880
I love that shape. It's old school.

210
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,040
It's really lovely, that.

211
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,680
Just like me!

212
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,240
And me.
And have you practised this, Nicky?

213
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
I've practised them.

214
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,160
I've got pies coming
out the front door.

215
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,880
Have ya? Yeah. Have you
been selling them?

216
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,200
Oh. It's just too many pies.

217
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,560
OK, we'll leave you to it,
Nicky. It sounds great.

218
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,680
Fingers crossed.

219
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,400
I've got to get these in
the oven tout de suite.

220
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,080
While Nicky lines her tins...

221
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,600
Pop the lids on,
bang 'em in the oven.

222
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,960
..everyone else has
moved on to the lids.

223
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,440
Easy as pie. I'm here all week.

224
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,840
But two bakers are planning
something that requires

225
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,560
a more refined touch.

226
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,720
This is the latticing
of the pie top.

227
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,560
Providing the execution is good,

228
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,520
it can make the world of difference.

229
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,440
It is fiddly.

230
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,920
I've just got to relax
cos I feel so stressed.

231
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,000
I just don't want to
let myself down.

232
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,120
{\an8}Cristy's lattice lids will
conceal a filling of cream,

233
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,720
{\an8}leek and garlic mushroom.

234
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,680
I think this should be
such a good flavour.

235
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,320
You struggled a little last week
with flavour, didn't you?

236
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,440
We were complaining there
wasn't enough. Yeah.

237
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,400
And you know what? It's amazing how
much garlic mushrooms can take.

238
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,680
OK, that's good, then.

239
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,320
Good luck, thank you, Cristy. OK.
Thank you. Good luck, darling.

240
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,280
To hold the fillings inside...

241
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,400
Hopefully, it will all go right.

242
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,440
I learned the right word
today - crimping.

243
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,440
..Paul is expecting the bakers
to form a neat seal.

244
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,240
Maybe not that.

245
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,320
It's always that.

246
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,560
I've got a little tool in my pocket.
Aye-aye!

247
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,920
Think pig in blanket -
that was the vibe.

248
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,600
I'm quietly confident.

249
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,920
I think as soon as I say
I'm confident, it goes wrong,

250
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,040
so I don't want to say that.

251
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,800
{\an8}Before crimping his lids in place,
Rowan's adding

252
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,320
{\an8}an extra topping
of smoked streaky bacon

253
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,520
{\an8}to his Cumberland sausage
and sweet potato filling.

254
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,080
Have you got a hole in the lid?
No, there's no hole in the lid.

255
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,600
When it steams,
where's it going to go?

256
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,440
On the bacon,
the bacon's raw inside,

257
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,200
so that steam is there
to help poach.

258
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,440
Oh, right, OK. Got you. Good luck.
Thank you. Thank you.

259
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,840
Good luck, mate.

260
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,680
Do you think that's a bit
of a clue, maybe put

261
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,400
a hole in it, do you think?
I feel like that's a clue.

262
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,040
I might do little pricks around it.

263
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,960
Get a little prick in there.
I will. Sorted. Thanks, love.

264
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
Once suitably ventilated...

265
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,520
I'm just egg-washing the top
to give it a lovely colour.

266
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,680
..applying an egg wash should
brown up the pies when baked.

267
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,200
Is it a bit thick?

268
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,880
Are you asking me? Yeah.

269
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,520
Whatever. In.

270
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,320
Oh, I didn't do egg wash.

271
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,320
OK, bakers,
you've got half an hour left.

272
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,120
This is speed-pie-making.
Come on, Nicky!

273
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Oven's not on.

274
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,320
Not conventional.

275
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
Should've gone in ages ago,
shouldn't they?

276
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,240
What? No, what you saying?

277
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,360
I didn't realise you were
the baker.

278
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,720
How dare you? Oh, that's hot.
Do you think that's too hot?

279
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,120
Possibly, but I don't
have the time now.

280
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,560
They're in.

281
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,680
How are you? I'm all right-ish.

282
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Why, what's happened? Oh, time.

283
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,920
Time.

284
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,480
Time. I can be up two hours
before we've got to be anywhere,

285
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,960
and I'm still never ready.

286
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,120
What you talking about?
We're talking about what time
we get up in the morning.

287
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,520
Yeah, what time do you get up?
I go to bed quite late.
Get up really early.

288
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,560
It's weird. I texted you
last night at 11. I know.

289
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,280
You texted me back,
so you were quite late.

290
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,120
That's right, kids,
we're texting each other at night.

291
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,760
Just stop sending me them pictures -
I don't like it.

292
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,320
That's not what you
said last night!

293
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,400
While some bakers have
time to wait and watch...

294
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Cranberry sauce.

295
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,360
..others are making
their condiments.

296
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,240
I'll probably just pipe it
on right at the end.

297
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,960
I call them post-match picnic pies.

298
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,040
They're the flavours I do
for my rugby lads after either

299
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,840
a training session or a match day.

300
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,600
Hopefully, in hot-water-crust
pastry, they taste as good
in those as well.

301
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,680
Josh is hoping the pickle
will bring moisture

302
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
to his pork and apple pies,

303
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,120
{\an8}while a layer of Cheddar will
be melted on top when

304
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,960
the pies are removed from their tins
and returned to the oven to brown.

305
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,760
The pastry is done now
so it won't collapse.

306
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,920
Bakers, you've got ten minutes left.

307
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,160
I'm going to have to get these out
now, aren't I? They're oozing a bit.

308
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,960
But do you know what it is,
did you put the hole in or not?

309
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,960
I did. Three.
Oh. And they opened up?

310
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,720
Three pricks. Yeah.

311
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,160
Oh, so overfilled.
I don't like the look of 'em.

312
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,160
There's a whole mushroom
coming out here.

313
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,360
Look at these.

314
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,480
You're using some special
finger protectors.

315
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,280
That is it.
To poke the pies out the bottom.

316
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,000
I've got a picture
of Paul wearing nothing but those.

317
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,760
On his fingers?

318
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,280
Yeah, on his... OK.

319
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,200
Just glaze them up.

320
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Get all round my sides as
crispy as possible now.

321
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,520
Oh, they look bad, Noel.
They look good.

322
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,200
No, they're overfilled. I don't
know why I'm getting like this.

323
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,640
I told myself I don't care.
But you really do care, don't you?

324
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,280
Oh, my gosh, I need to get a life.

325
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,920
It is coming out now.

326
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,280
Oh, no!

327
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,000
It's a bit soggy on t'bottom.
They've never been soggy before.

328
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,600
Bakers, you only have
one minute left.

329
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,320
They've got to come out,
haven't they?

330
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,280
That one looks peng, actually.

331
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,400
Not as crispy as I'd like them.

332
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Yeah, really pleased with those.

333
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,680
It was going so well.

334
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,120
They're not great. Gutted!

335
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,960
Oh, I can't wait for his beady eyes
to look at these.

336
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,400
Bakers, that is your time up,
please step away from your bakes.

337
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,080
One of 'em hasn't got a bottom,
they're stuck in the tin.
Do they normally stick in the tin?

338
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,960
Never. Never stuck ever.

339
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,720
God! So I'm really upset, actually.

340
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,440
The bakers' hot-water-crust
picnic pies will now be judged

341
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,680
by Prue and Paul.

342
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,040
Hello, Matty. Hiya, Matty. Hiya.

343
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,320
Tell us all about your picnic pies.

344
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,760
They are based on spanakopita.

345
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,120
OK. They're based on them.

346
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
{\an8}Bit messy.

347
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,120
It's very tricky to get that lattice
looking good on such a small pie.

348
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,680
So there's some feta,
ricotta, spinach,

349
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,440
roasted red peppers
and some sundried tomatoes.

350
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,640
Good strong flavours. Lovely.

351
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,680
I think your lid is
a bit too thick.

352
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,200
OK. Cos that takes up
maybe a third of it.

353
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,560
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
Cheers. Well done.

354
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,360
{\an8}It's a beautiful
golden-brown colour.

355
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,640
So we've got sausage meat,

356
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,880
bacon and cranberry with apple

357
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,760
and some cranberry sauce
on the side.

358
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,560
Good pastry.

359
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,640
Your mustard bottom,
which I'd never have thought of,

360
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,040
and I think it's a little
mark of genius, it's beautiful.

361
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,680
I think it's filled beautifully,

362
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,360
it's nice and thin
round the outside. Thank you.

363
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Cheers.

364
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,240
The pastry's a little pale on top.
Could've been a little browner.

365
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,760
Bit of a soggy bottom.

366
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,720
Really? Yeah.

367
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,760
Heart-breaking. Inside,
it's tuna, potatoes,

368
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,880
leeks, carrot and onion,
and there is a quail egg as well.

369
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,800
I love the flavours.

370
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,880
And actually the filling inside
is quite nice and moist.

371
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,680
The pastry needs to be much,
much thinner.

372
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,840
And less soggy.

373
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,160
You can see right down
the bottom how wet that is there.

374
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's a bit ripped

375
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
and all over the place
at the sides, innit?

376
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,120
Your flavours are beautiful.
Your pastry's nice and flaky.

377
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,680
It's nice and thin around the
outside and it's well-filled.

378
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,640
It's just a little bit dry
on the mouth. Ah, OK.

379
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,800
I love the flavour,
but it's going to be hard work
to eat that whole pie

380
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,480
because it's very dense.

381
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
OK.

382
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,240
{\an8}I think they look really appetising

383
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,240
and if they were in
a shop window I'd buy them.

384
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,240
This is potato dauphinoise

385
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,480
with caramelised onions
and Comte cheese.

386
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,640
Your sides are a little bit thick
on one side, thin on another.

387
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,760
Your roof is a little
bit too thick. Yeah.

388
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,760
But I like the flavour.
Thank you very much.

389
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Thank you, guys.

390
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,360
My, um, pies...

391
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
I'm sorry but...

392
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,880
No, it's, um, that's good.

393
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,960
Uh, my pies are kind
of Christmas stuffing pies

394
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,960
with chestnut, cranberry sauce,
sweet potato,

395
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,840
bit of bacon, and a loose top.

396
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,440
Lovely pastry. Thank you.

397
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,280
It's got such a beautiful aroma
as well as flavour.

398
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,880
You know what? If it had just looked

399
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,840
a bit better, you'd have had
an absolute triumph there. Mm.

400
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,000
{\an8}It's bled quite a bit.

401
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,200
That's the bleed in there
from the interior.

402
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,600
I think they're quite sweet.

403
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,000
So that's sausage meat in there
with some strong Cheddar cheese

404
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,680
and thyme and a bit of apple on top.

405
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,400
That's the problem
with sausage mix - it'll all shrink

406
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,040
and you get gaps round the edge.

407
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,720
If you'd had time, you could've put
a jelly in there or something.

408
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,040
Yeah, OK. But otherwise I think your
flavours are good. Thank you.

409
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,440
{\an8}They're a little pale,
but I love the shape.

410
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,880
The mould has worked nicely

411
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,040
and you have got a good colour
underneath, just not on

412
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,880
the side. Your pastry's a bit thick.

413
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,760
And you end up with
a big hole in it as well.

414
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,160
Yeah, and it's a little
undercooked too. Yeah, it is.

415
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,040
So what you've got is
quite a gloopy mixture

416
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,760
with your pastry being too thick
and it's a difficult thing to eat.

417
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,960
It's a disaster.

418
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,600
It's quite sort of...
It's not your best.

419
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,120
No, it's not.
No, it's a bit gluey. Yeah.

420
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,960
Thank you very much, Nicky.
Thank you.

421
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,440
Don't worry about those people.
That's all right.

422
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,080
Not bakers, those people.

423
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,480
{\an8}They look even. Thank you.

424
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,240
They're nice and brown.
They're really tiny. Quite elegant.

425
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,800
I've made creamy
leek and mushroom pies.

426
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,360
You know you're so clever.
Yeah. You made a creamy sauce

427
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
and it just holds
the whole thing together.

428
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
Aw, thank you.

429
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,200
It's beautifully moist inside
and crispy.

430
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,720
Hmm. So what I will do...

431
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,280
You're joking.

432
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,360
{\an1}APPLAUSE

433
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,600
Well done. Well done.

434
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,960
It's because you've managed
to achieve the moistness

435
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,880
and the flavour in a small area

436
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,680
and have that lattice top
looking so nice.

437
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,640
I feel like I'm in a dream,
thank you.

438
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,320
Well done.

439
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,520
Oh, my God.

440
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,960
It's so easy to feel impostor
syndrome of like,

441
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,400
I'm not good enough and stuff,

442
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,480
and then Paul goes and gives you
a handshake

443
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,480
and you're just like, "What?"

444
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,040
I'm so happy they like how it tasted

445
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,360
because, you know,
looks is one thing,

446
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
what's inside is what matters.

447
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,200
Oh, dear. Soggy bottom -
why it happened to me today?

448
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,800
Absolute bag of pants.

449
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,480
I've just gotta scoop myself off
the floor and get on with it.

450
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,960
For the next challenge
the ingredients

451
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,720
and recipe are a
gingham-guarded secret.

452
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,040
Hello, bakers, welcome
back to the tent.

453
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,360
It's time
for your technical challenge.

454
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,680
And this week it's been set

455
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,760
for you by P Hollywood,
the pastry king.

456
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,440
Now, as always, this challenge is
judged blind

457
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,080
so our judges will be leaving.

458
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,480
But before you go, have you got any
words of advice

459
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,760
for our bakers? I'm thinking
Mel Gibson in Braveheart.

460
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,360
Yeah. Go for it, Paul.

461
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,760
The textures on the inside
and the outside must be perfect.

462
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,480
Not as stirring as I thought.
No. If I'm honest with ya.

463
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,240
Maybe he should've done it on
a horse. Maybe.

464
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,240
OK, judges,
you can go, thank you.

465
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,720
Paul would like you to make
a decadent dauphinoise pithivier.

466
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,000
Now, the judges will be looking
for a buttery,

467
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,560
crisp rough-puff pastry encasing

468
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,520
creamy potato
and caramelised onion.

469
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,480
And alongside that
a blue cheese sauce.

470
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,240
You have two hours and 45 minutes.

471
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,640
On your marks.

472
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,320
Get set.

473
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,040
Bake!

474
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,240
Oh, goodness gracious,
what is this?

475
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,160
What are the chances that was
gonna happen?

476
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,960
I know what dauphinoise is,
what's the other word?

477
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,600
Pithivi... Pervivi... Perviv...
How do you say it?

478
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,240
So Paul, pithivier?

479
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,800
It's a classic sort of French pie.

480
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,520
Now, this particular one, it's got
the dauphinoise potatoes inside.

481
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,080
What we're really testing the bakers
on is the pastry itself.

482
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,000
By now, our bakers should know about
rough-puff pastry.

483
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,560
Yeah. The key thing when you're
making a rough puff is

484
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,160
to add some frozen butter
in between each turn.

485
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,840
Dough, butter, dough, butter,
creates these flaky layers.

486
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,040
That's a bit of a feast, isn't it?

487
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,760
Help yourself to the sauce.

488
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,120
Roquefort's such a salty blue
cheese, adds a lot of flavour.

489
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,640
It's really heaven.

490
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,480
This is carbs on carbs served
with cream.

491
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,880
Can't wait to get back in the tent
and have nine versions of this?

492
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,640
It says make the rough-puff pastry.

493
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,760
I'm just gonna add some water,
try and get a dough.

494
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,920
It's just to bind
the dough together.

495
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,400
And then I can wrap it up
and chill it.

496
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,760
You've done one
of these before right? Um, no.

497
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,720
Oh. But I've made dauphinoise.
And I've made rough puff.

498
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,480
So we're sort of there, aren't we?

499
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,040
There you go, yeah. Put it together
and what have you got?

500
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,640
Um... Dauphinoise...

501
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,400
..pithivier.
NICKY LAUGHS

502
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm just gonna get it rolled out
to a rough rectangle.

503
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,240
And then I can put my grated butter
in between.

504
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,360
So I'm gonna grate the, uh,
frozen butter onto that.

505
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,000
So the butter gives you
that puffy rise.

506
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,720
But a few of the bakers...

507
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,760
I'm just kind of incorporating
the grated butter.

508
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,440
..are taking a different approach.

509
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,160
Rub the butter in the flour,
knead it, roll it out.

510
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,880
If they wanted me to laminate it,

511
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,960
you'd have put it out as a slab of
butter

512
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,320
so if it's grated maybe
it has to be mixed in.

513
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,160
Now, I'm gonna start to fold.
I'm nervous.

514
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,200
So it's fold third down,
third up, turn, roll, chill.

515
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,760
You know when you look around and
you see what everybody else is doing

516
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,080
and you think, "Oh, have I done
the same?"

517
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,040
It's a bit unnerving, isn't it?

518
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,120
I've grated all
of my butter in at once

519
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,280
and everyone else is
laminating it in.

520
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,880
I think I've worked
the butter in too much.

521
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,440
You washed your hand yet?
I know, I didn't want to.

522
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,040
Did he lift you off
the ground slightly? No.

523
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,200
What was it like,
grabbing a big bunch of sausages?

524
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,800
Stop.

525
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,560
I feel like the rule here is cold.

526
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,520
Cos puff pastry does not like heat.

527
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,840
As soon as it gets too warm then it
just kind of all melts

528
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,120
and you won't get the layers.

529
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,080
I'm just starting with
the filling which is simmering

530
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,320
the potatoes in cream, milk,
garlic and seasoning.

531
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,400
I have never made dauphinoise
potatoes in my life.

532
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,720
I know someone who has - Dana.

533
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,640
Babes. I feel like there's
a bit more pressure now.

534
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,040
I love the fact that you've made it

535
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,920
and you didn't even know what
it was. I know!

536
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,320
You want it just to sort
of simmer away nicely.

537
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,000
Checking for tenderness.
I'm a tender little thing.

538
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,160
That's simmering away,
onions are caramelising.

539
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,080
I'm worried about my pastry.

540
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,080
This is the second turn.
So I'm doing two turns.

541
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,680
Which I think will be enough.

542
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,160
Just doing another turn.

543
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,920
Try and get as many as I can in
the time.

544
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,200
More folds.

545
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,520
I'll give that five minutes.

546
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,320
Argh!

547
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,520
Need another plaster.

548
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,320
Just grated my knuckles.

549
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,600
I got blood in my pastry.
So I've had to redo it.

550
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,760
Just need to get a bit of
a shimmy on now

551
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,920
and just chuck it all in
and go for it.

552
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,840
Bakers, you are halfway through.

553
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,000
# Halfway through

554
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,000
# Halfway through

555
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,680
# Halfway through this nightmare. #

556
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,120
Ha, ha, ha!

557
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,400
I'm just getting these potatoes out.
Spot on, that.

558
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,720
Still got a bit of bite to it.

559
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,680
I think I overcooked my potatoes
in the middle cos I've just tried

560
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,120
them, they're a bit soft.
It's so annoying.

561
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,080
Right, so I've finally made
my pastry.

562
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,240
Done one turn.

563
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,320
I'll do that again and then
I can start assembling

564
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,600
and I'll try and get it baked.

565
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,240
While Dan performs a final turn,

566
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,840
everyone else is starting
to shape their pithivier.

567
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,640
I've no idea how thick to get it,
to be honest.

568
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,040
Who do you fear in this tent?
Do you fear Saku?

569
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,480
Yeah. I fear Saku.

570
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,760
I wouldn't like get on't wrong
side of her, would you?

571
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,600
I dunno, shall we go and have
a rolling pin fight?

572
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,960
Saku. Yeah. Dan said do you wanna
have a rolling pin fight?

573
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,240
Ooh!

574
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,760
You're a Jedi, Saku.

575
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,520
I know, yeah.

576
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,240
Cut a 20 centimetre round using
the smaller plate.

577
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,600
Layer the potatoes,

578
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,400
onions with salt and pepper
and nutmeg in between each layer.

579
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,720
Well, I've just chucked mine on
and now I've seen people do it
proper neat.

580
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,960
I'm looking at Cristy's

581
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,840
and it actually looks like
a French person has trained

582
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,680
for 70 years at the Cordon Bleu.
And then produced that.

583
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,760
Right, so let's move very,

584
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,680
very quickly.
I'm just panicking a bit now.

585
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,240
What are you putting in there?
This is nutmeg.

586
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,880
When I was a kid, there was
a rumour that if you smoked nutmeg
you'd go crazy.

587
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,680
Did you try? No.

588
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,280
Oh. It sounded ridiculous to me.

589
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,240
I'm just gonna overload it
with all the onions basically.

590
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,760
I think the onions give it such
a nice sweetness.

591
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,760
It says scallop the edges. Now, I
ain't got a clue what that means.

592
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,160
Is this scalloping, cos I just
know it as, like, crimping?

593
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,640
Scalloping? Crimping, scalloping,
it's all the same to me.

594
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,680
Knock up the edges
and then glaze and chill.

595
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,440
What is this knock up thing?

596
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,760
Different connotations
to knock up, isn't there?

597
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,520
Ah, like that?

598
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,640
Well, this is the dirtiest knock up
I've ever seen.

599
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,880
I'm just gonna score it now.

600
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,880
Carefully - not going through
the pastry. And then bake it.

601
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,040
We're going in.

602
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,840
Don't know how it's gonna take.

603
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,280
How long have we got left?

604
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,640
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

605
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,920
I'd better get a move on as well
that'd be nice, wouldn't it?

606
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,520
It's going quick, in't it?

607
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,000
So in the meantime I can make my
blue cheese sauce.

608
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,120
Just smelt that cheese and
it is absolutely revolting.

609
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,360
It's really pungent.

610
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,040
I don't like blue cheese.

611
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,720
You know what? You've gotta try it
though, cos it's gotta taste good.

612
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,520
No. I say it all the time. But look
how mouldy it is. Look at it.

613
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,320
Yours is so mouldy there's nearly no
cheese there. I know.

614
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,240
It's Roquefort, isn't it?
I love Roquefort.

615
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,960
Super cheesy, baby.

616
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,400
Oh, well done, Dan, yours is rising.
It's got a nice colour on yours.

617
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,680
Looks all right, don't it? Yeah.

618
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,040
It looks pale so I've upped
the temp by ten degrees.

619
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,480
Scared.

620
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,440
Bakers, you've got five minutes.

621
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,720
Didn't use all my potatoes.
Look at it,

622
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,120
it's flat like a pancake.
Oh, he's gonna hate it.

623
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,200
Oh, it's so bad.

624
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,920
It's not risen, has it?
It's like a frisbee.

625
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,200
So gutted, I've just had a crap day.

626
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,960
Hello, Josh, you all right?

627
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,720
Um, OK. Are you worried it's not
gonna puff?

628
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,040
Yeah. Do you want me to burn
the tent down so that he won't see?

629
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,680
Oh, that'd be good.

630
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,360
I want to give it as long as
humanly possible.

631
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,680
I might take it out.

632
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,880
Cornish pasty, anyone?

633
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,320
If you like shortcrust pastry, it's
all right.

634
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,440
Bakers, you have one minute left.

635
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,960
OK she's gonna have to come out.

636
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm gonna have a little gander.

637
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,600
It's definitely not as puffy as it
should be.

638
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,080
I'm happy with that.

639
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,800
Look at it, it's so ugly.

640
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,360
I've seen neater poos,
to be honest with you.

641
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,880
Oh, I quite like the look of that.

642
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,480
I don't think that's done.

643
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,200
God, this is revolting.

644
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,640
Bakers, that is your time up.
Well done.

645
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,560
Tough, that.

646
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,240
Please bring your pithiviers,

647
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,400
place on the table behind
your photos.

648
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,600
Look at the size of Dan's.
It's like he's got a body in there.

649
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,720
Don't, yours is right next to
the frisbee.

650
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,480
Prue and Paul are looking for

651
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,440
a perfectly domed dauphinoise
pithivier with

652
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,360
a flaky laminated
rough-puff pastry.

653
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,720
Eclectic mix. Yeah, some of them are
domed, some are not.

654
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,640
Yes. And they have no idea whose
is whose.

655
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,400
We'll start with this one.
That's a recognisable pithivier.

656
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,760
Yes. It's got a dome, the actual
design is pretty good. Yeah.

657
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,960
It's nice and crispy.
And it's a nice colour.

658
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,400
Yeah, it is a nice colour.
It's certainly got a bit of flake.

659
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,120
Hmm, the Roquefort's certainly
salty.

660
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,800
And it does make
the balance beautiful.

661
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah... Yeah.

662
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,600
Now, moving on to this flat pizza.

663
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,520
This is definitely not
domed enough.

664
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,120
It needs to be much higher.
It's a bit pale though, isn't it?

665
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,840
Yeah. Bit uneven too.

666
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,720
Needed a stronger colour.

667
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,920
I like the colour, it's nice
and strong golden brown.

668
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,320
Yeah, the colour's very good.

669
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,240
Do you know, this pastry is
delicious but it's not quite cooked?

670
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,400
No... No, it's not.

671
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,960
It needed a little bit longer,
doesn't it?

672
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,920
I love the scallop work on this.

673
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,160
And it's got a dome.

674
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,400
Looks good underneath,
it's got a strong colour.

675
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,920
Hmm, pastry's not bad, actually.
It's flaky enough.

676
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,200
It's a nice one, that.

677
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,200
OK, moving on, this is a bit flat.

678
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,520
And a bit underbaked I think.

679
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,880
Lamination looks more bread like
than flaky.

680
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,600
I think the potato's a bit raw too.

681
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
Hmm, potatoes need
a little bit longer.

682
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,040
There's an attempt to get
a bit of height here.

683
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,400
I'm not mad about the look of it.
It's a bit rough. Yeah.

684
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,360
Potato's raw. Yeah, needs longer.

685
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,160
The flake's not bad.

686
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,080
This one, Paul, has a lovely colour.

687
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,280
Bit of height to it as well.

688
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,800
Nice strong bake.

689
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,640
Raw potato. Hmm, it is, isn't it?
It's quite raw.

690
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,920
This looks like a very interesting
pie but it's not a pithivier.

691
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,600
No...Not a dome in sight.

692
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,080
There's a bit of flake to that.

693
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,080
The pastry's good.
But it needed more of a dome,

694
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,640
I'm not quite sure what happened
to the rest of the potatoes.

695
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,040
It seems to be a bit uneven on
this one. Not very neat.

696
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,200
But it's got flake to it.

697
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,120
Hmm, spuds are all right.

698
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,000
Sauce is very tarragon-y, I love it.

699
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,040
It is. Blended with the blue cheese,
it works beautifully.

700
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,160
The pithiviers will now be ranked
from last to first.

701
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,040
OK, in ninth spot we have this one,
whose is this?

702
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,560
Nicky. It's too flat,
there is no crumble in there.

703
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,840
In eighth place we have this one.

704
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,000
Josh, too pale, too flat.

705
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
OK.

706
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,760
Matty is seventh, Saku sixth,

707
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,360
Cristy fifth,

708
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,320
Rowan fourth and Tasha is third.

709
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,920
In second place,

710
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,080
we have this one...

711
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,200
Dana, it looks very pretty,
the pastry's good,

712
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,280
tastes good,
it's a really good pithivier.

713
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,040
Thank you. Well done.

714
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,960
So in first place we have this
one, Dan.

715
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,880
Good old Dan.

716
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,160
That's a lovely pithivier.
I love the scallop work on there,

717
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,560
you've ended up
with something that tastes delicious

718
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,440
and looks very professional.
Well done.

719
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,440
Thank you very much. Thanks.

720
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,600
Well done. Well done, Dan.

721
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,360
Great feeling, yeah, pretty
good, can't believe it.

722
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Again it's, uh, yeah.

723
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,760
Every time it happens I'm
like, "I can't believe it."

724
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,600
First time I've been second.

725
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,960
I'm beyond happy,
I'm over the moon.

726
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,880
I'll try and take positives
out of today

727
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,160
and just hope I have
a really good day tomorrow.

728
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,840
Oh, babes, come here. Aw.

729
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,160
Oh, dearie me.

730
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,600
I'll have to do an awful lot
to pull it back from today.

731
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,440
I don't think I've ever seen you
both eat as much as what

732
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,080
I've seen in Pastry Week.

733
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,400
Gotta come to my house,
every day is exactly the same.

734
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,320
I think, overall, Pastry Week's been
a step up from Chocolate Week.

735
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,120
And Cristy got a handshake.

736
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,440
They were great pies.

737
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,680
For Star Baker, I think she's in
line. Dan won the technical.

738
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,160
And Tasha's come back with a bang.
And Tasha's come back as well.

739
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,560
You haven't forgotten, guys, that
we're sending two people home

740
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,560
this week. Oh, yes!
Well, I was thinking that.

741
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,680
So who, roughly, is in danger, then?
Nicky.

742
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,600
Yeah. Oh. Oh, no.

743
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,440
She is so cheerful.
But she is not doing well.

744
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,880
Saku's in trouble as well. Is she?

745
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,320
Oh! I think she struggled in the sig
and she was sixth in the technical.

746
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,840
I love Saku. Saku can't go.

747
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,960
Rowan could drop down.
Those picnic pies were awful.

748
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,840
Do you know what I think's
disappointing? Is Josh.

749
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,000
I can't believe Josh would be in
danger. He's been consistent.

750
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,160
Well, not this week.

751
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,440
I'm in love with all of them.
I want them all to do well.

752
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,680
They're becoming quite a tight
little gang as well.

753
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,840
They are, yeah, they are.
They've got a WhatsApp group.

754
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,000
Have they? Yeah, they have.
I was just wondering, when are

755
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
we gonna have a WhatsApp group?
Are we gonna do that?

756
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,560
Oh, we haven't told her. Well, we
have one without you, Alison.

757
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,080
Welcome back to the tent
for your Showstopper challenge.

758
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,600
Today, the judges would love you
to make something out of pastry.

759
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,320
I mean, who would've thought it?

760
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,360
How do they come up with this stuff?
Wild.

761
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,040
The judges would like you to make

762
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,560
a stunning display
of decorative sweet pies.

763
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,120
Your display should include at least
three ornate pies

764
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,520
and be made of a rich sweet
pastry case.

765
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,080
You have four hours.

766
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,640
On your marks. Get set.

767
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,840
Bake.

768
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,640
They tasted great in practice
but practice took six hours.

769
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,000
I am starting with making
the sweet shortcrust pastry.

770
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,360
We're asking the bakers

771
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,640
to produce at least three
highly decorated pies made

772
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,600
with a rich sweet pastry.

773
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,360
I'm just using
the traditional rub-it-in method.

774
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,920
Ideally, I think it would be nice if
at least two

775
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,240
of them had different fillings.

776
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,720
I'm starting with my raspberry jam.

777
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,480
That's the sort
of food I grew up on.

778
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,880
We want it highly decorated,
so we're expecting

779
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,200
a little bit of lattice work,
little bit of plaiting on the top.

780
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,000
I think it's perfectly legitimate
to dye some of the pastry.

781
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,200
We wanna see also something that
links the three pies together.

782
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,720
I'm making sweet pies based on
my favourite

783
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,040
British sitcom,
Absolutely Fabulous.

784
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,920
You can't just leave
a sweet pie in the mould or

785
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,600
the foil, they need to bring it out,

786
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,640
expose it and show us what
they've baked.

787
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,800
I've got cramp in my hands.
It's really sore.

788
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,240
It needs to taste amazing...

789
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,720
This is a vanilla pastry.

790
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,800
..hold together

791
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,560
and create that beautiful crumble
when you bite into it

792
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,400
with whatever sweet filling
is inside.

793
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,440
I've got the vision, it's just
whether I can execute it well.

794
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,400
What have I done to this?

795
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,680
Hi, Cristy. Hello, you OK?

796
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,400
Hello. Right Cristy, tell us all
about your decorative pies.

797
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,280
So I'm gonna try and do like a
woodland sort of display of pies.

798
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,240
I'm gonna do a spiced apple pie

799
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,960
and then I've got a blueberry
pie and then a raspberry

800
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,800
and frangipane pie.

801
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Lovely,
I love all of those flavours.

802
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,760
OK, good.

803
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,200
After a handshake-worthy signature,

804
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,360
Cristy will be hoping her autumnal
Showstopper featuring raspberry

805
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,560
frangipane and intricate lattice
work will earn her

806
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
top honours again today.

807
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,880
When you practised, did you time it?

808
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,480
Yeah, it's really hard
to practise for four hours around

809
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,000
the children so I've been doing like
really late nights and...

810
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,120
Middle of the night.

811
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,640
..middle of... Yeah, literally.
Hope I deliver.

812
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,880
Cristy's not the only baker who
found practice a little fraught.

813
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,760
In practice, the bottom fell
out of my pie.

814
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,480
So it was just a crust around
the edge

815
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,280
and then a dropped pie.
Which is why I've got parchment.

816
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,360
It might not be as crisp

817
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,160
but I'd rather have
a not crisp edge than

818
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,560
a no edge at all, do
you know what I mean?

819
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,280
Rowan's pate sablee pies will be
filled with lemon

820
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,840
and blueberry and frangipane
with flaked almonds and chocolate.

821
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,160
Patsy and Eddie will appear in

822
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,520
pastry relief silhouette leaving
Rowan to paint their faces by hand.

823
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,160
Oh, it's Patsy.

824
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,080
And what about timing,
have you got a plan?

825
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,360
Um, no.

826
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,600
The thing about you is you just
go with the flow, don't ya?

827
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,800
Yeah. It might look rubbish
but it tastes great.

828
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,040
No, but this doesn't. It's like...
I'm actually quite impressed.

829
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,320
I'm quite surprised.

830
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,560
Rowan's not alone in celebrating
the matriarchy.

831
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,920
My nan, she was always pushing me
to enter the Bake Off.

832
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,760
I said I would do
and then after she was ill

833
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,560
and passed away I wasn't quite ready
so I waited another year.

834
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,280
Josh's Showstopper is for his
late grandmother, Frieda.

835
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,440
I used to do quite
a bit of baking at her house.

836
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,680
Used to go out on Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, after school

837
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,240
and I did this from the age of
about five or six through to...

838
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,760
I was still doing it when
I was doing my PhD.

839
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,920
That's the reason why I know

840
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,840
a lot about all the flowers
that are around here,

841
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,760
because she taught me all about
flowers.

842
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,320
Josh is making a sunflower
with two pineapple

843
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,680
and apricot flower heads
and three apple,

844
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,720
blackberry
and coconut leaves,

845
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,960
all complete with coloured pastry
and syrup glaze.

846
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,600
You seem pretty calm about this
challenge. I am.

847
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,600
You weren't very happy yesterday.
Are you much calmer now doing this?

848
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,960
Yeah, no, I would've liked to have
done a bit better on
the technical yesterday but...

849
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,080
You've got high standards
for yourself, haven't you?

850
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,920
I put too much pressure on myself,
I know.

851
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,720
But hopefully this is
all right today. Yes.

852
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,280
Look forward to it. Sounds really
good.

853
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,880
Nice and floral. That's all
that done.

854
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,160
And Josh's grandmother
isn't the only one to get

855
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,680
the Showstopper treatment.

856
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,440
They're all flavours from my gran's
garden, cos she had apple trees,

857
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,360
she had a plum tree,
there was always rhubarb.

858
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,040
Her baking was like
a pair of comfy old slippers.

859
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,960
{\an8}Nicky's comforting pies will be
filled with apple and pear,

860
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,760
{\an8}plum and frangipane and rhubarb
and custard with

861
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,440
{\an8}a smidge of ginger, while colourful
lattice work

862
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,280
{\an8}and flowers should prove a feast
for the eyes.

863
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,320
I know you didn't have
a particularly decent day yesterday

864
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,320
but today is your day, Nicky.

865
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,880
And you seem very calm.
So it all looks good.

866
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,320
Calm on the surface.

867
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,440
You should see what's going on
under here.

868
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,880
Are the little duck legs going?

869
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,360
Let's do it. You can do it. You'll
be all right. Good luck, Nicky.

870
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,920
I'm just gonna toast the nuts.
I am doing a honey baklava pie.

871
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,680
It's got pistachios and hazelnuts

872
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,560
and walnuts in an orange syrup
on the bottom base with

873
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,680
an almond frangipane on top.
But, yeah...

874
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,320
Oh, you had me at marzipan.

875
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,040
I didn't say marzipan!

876
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,560
{\an1}THEY LAUGH

877
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,880
Almonds - close enough.

878
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,400
You had me at almond!

879
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,800
{\an8}Her frangipane and baklava main pie
will be paired with mulled wine

880
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,560
{\an8}and apple miniature pies

881
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,520
{\an8}and decorated with
a sturdy shortcrust tree.

882
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,760
I like a good chunky pastry
so that's what I'm hoping for,

883
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,600
but we shall see if that works.

884
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,880
When the bakers are happy
with their pastry...

885
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,120
This looks like it's rested well.

886
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,920
..it's time to roll...

887
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,600
Tell you what, this jumper'll
be coming off soon.

888
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,080
About two or three millimetres is
what I'm looking for.

889
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:47,040
..before lining the pie tins to
a standard expected by the judges...

890
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,960
Oh! Hello.

891
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,600
Press it in.
You've just made a hole.

892
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,640
{\an1}SHE LAUGHS

893
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,920
Ten minutes in the freezer
firms it up, then we can blind bake.

894
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,200
I'm making a pineapple,
cherry and rum pie and apple pie.

895
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,240
Apple from Herefordshire,
where I live.

896
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,160
And pineapple from my birth country
Sri Lanka,

897
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,720
representing a bit of both worlds.

898
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,040
{\an8}Intelligence analyst Saku is making

899
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,640
{\an8}an infographic-inspired pie display,

900
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,760
{\an8}built from

901
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,720
{\an8}a sweet shortcrust pastry made by

902
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,120
{\an8}replacing some of

903
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,280
{\an8}the butter with cream cheese.

904
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,480
I have never made pastry
with cream cheese before.

905
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,200
Cream cheese. Very interesting.

906
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,280
It tastes better.

907
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,480
Is it quite a flaky pastry?

908
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,080
It is kind of
melt-in-the-mouth kind of pastry.

909
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,040
Oh, OK. Right, I look forward
to this one, Saku.

910
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,200
I'm gonna get my pastry in now
cos I need to get blind-baking.

911
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,160
It's only gonna go in
for about ten minutes,

912
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
just so it's like partially baked
for the filling.

913
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,600
I'm not blind-baking.
Everybody else is.

914
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,760
It's going in, come on.

915
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,240
Ooh, actually it's not going in.

916
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,120
It needs to go on a tray.

917
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,480
Silly sausage that I am.

918
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,800
You will fit in there,

919
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,080
you will fit in there,
you won't fit in there.

920
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,640
How long do we have?

921
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,200
I am the genie of the kettle.
You have three wishes, my child.

922
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,720
Amazing. First wish -

923
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,760
can you do the time call?
I'm a little bit busy.

924
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,040
No problem.

925
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,480
Bakers, you are halfway through!

926
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,680
That's ages, that is.

927
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,920
I'm ready to start getting all
the decoration ready.

928
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,600
Prue and Paul are expecting that
decoration to be highly detailed.

929
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,640
So I'm just doing the leaves.

930
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,840
But while the bakers prepare
these...

931
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,040
I'm now making my chocolate
genoise sponge.

932
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,280
..and their other fillings...

933
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,600
For my frangipane I've whizzed some
raspberries through there.

934
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,760
..they need to keep a watchful eye
on their blind-baked pastry.

935
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,240
Yeah, they're looking good.

936
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
Hopefully. Well, we'll see when
I lift these off.

937
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,440
The pastry just doesn't look right.
I can't do nothing now. OK.

938
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,640
I just need it partially baked

939
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,600
cos it's gonna go back in
with all the fillings,

940
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,160
so I don't want to get it too kind
of golden and burnt.

941
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,800
ALISON: Baked too long and
the pastry might become too dry

942
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,760
and crumbly to attach
the decorative lid to later on.

943
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,280
Dan, what an absolute mess.
I know, I'm really sorry.

944
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,720
What's going on?
What's the matter? What happened?

945
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,600
It's just... Well, it's a good sign,
to be fair.

946
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,840
It means that my pastry
is extremely crumbly and yummy.

947
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,360
{\an8}Inspired by his travels in
South America

948
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,240
{\an8}Dan's making a pie for his favourite
destinations.

949
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,680
{\an8}Cherry for Peru, grape for Argentina

950
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,640
{\an8}and tropical fruits for Brazil.

951
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,440
So I've just started
my decorations now.

952
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,360
How many elements have you got
going on?

953
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,640
About 14,600 at the moment.

954
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,360
It's really intricate, isn't it?
It's still a bit of a mess
but go on.

955
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,600
I know it is but I'll hoover up when
I'm done.

956
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,760
And Dan is not the only baker taking
the judges on their travels.

957
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,640
The theme is like my two favourite
places, cos I like skiing

958
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,760
and I also like...
I just like the...the sea.

959
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,520
Um, so the central pie is like

960
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,400
a signpost
going to those two places.

961
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,760
{\an8}Tasha's sea pie will contain
a filling of apricot

962
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,200
{\an8}and ricotta,

963
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,200
{\an8}the mountains, chestnut
and blueberries,

964
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,160
{\an8}while her pecan pie signpost

965
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,440
{\an8}will spell out her favourite places
in British sign language.

966
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,080
It's almost like
a teaching moment for

967
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,920
a little bit of finger spelling.

968
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,720
It's really difficult
to do in pastry.

969
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,200
It's a bit thinner than I wanted.

970
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,120
I made a bit of a mistake
but it's OK.

971
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,320
And Matty's also heading
to the slopes.

972
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,400
I've been Andorra,
Sestriere and Leger in France.

973
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,560
Yeah, I love it there,
it's quality.

974
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,320
{\an8}Matty's pies will make

975
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,000
{\an8}the ideal apres-ski comfort food,
filled with rhubarb

976
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,840
{\an8}and custard,
apple and cinnamon and plums.

977
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,040
{\an8}How are you using your plums in
the, uh, pie?

978
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,240
So I'm gonna stew these
down slightly.

979
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,480
THEY LAUGH
Stew down your plums?

980
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,480
Indeed. Um...

981
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,040
With the stem ginger,
some of the orange juice as well.

982
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,240
I love ginger and plums. It works...

983
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,520
{\an1}THEY LAUGH

984
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,600
SHE SIGHS
Stop it, boys.

985
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,080
Sorry, Prue. Enough!

986
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,280
With pastry cases prepared...

987
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,320
So this is the lemon
and blueberry kind of curd.

988
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,960
..it's time to assemble.

989
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,400
Today is two years to
the day since she passed away.

990
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,000
I hope I can do these flavours
justice today.

991
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,760
It's fine, isn't it? Yeah.

992
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,560
Come on, Nick.
Stick everything else on.

993
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,400
I just want to get this one in
ASAP Rocky.

994
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,880
I'm gonna have to, like, move like
no-one's business.

995
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,560
What you doing there, egg wash?

996
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,040
Yeah, bit more egg wash.
I used to egg-wash my legs.

997
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,160
Did ya? Yeah. They come up nice
actually. Quite glossy.

998
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,320
You have great skin, though,

999
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,400
I must say.
We always talk about it.

1000
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,200
Like a dolphin.

1001
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,000
They will go in
for about 30 minutes, I think.

1002
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,040
Everything's in the oven.
Just see what happens.

1003
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,480
I'm feeling so confident.

1004
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,600
Watch it all crumble at
the last second.

1005
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,840
How long's left?

1006
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,560
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

1007
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,080
Oh, you're joking.
Just running out of time, aren't I?

1008
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,360
Dan, you OK?

1009
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,760
Running late like usual.

1010
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,520
It's all right, don't worry.

1011
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,600
Cheerio.

1012
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:48,000
I've got one flan in.
I am elated, let me tell you.

1013
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,520
There's a lot of spillage.

1014
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,240
There's a bit of
a PLUMBING issue happening.

1015
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,840
And Dana's not the only one
who's sprung a leak.

1016
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,200
I'm having a spillage. Spillage.

1017
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,960
The top's kind of separated from
the bottom on that one. Oh.

1018
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,600
It's quite severe. It's getting more
severe every time I look at it.

1019
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,160
There's been a spillage in
the village.

1020
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,720
Come on, you can do this, Nick.

1021
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,840
Crank it up again, 200.

1022
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,200
Look at it.

1023
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,400
How the hell is that gonna
come out?

1024
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,960
I've just put the BSL
finger spelling on,

1025
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,640
so it's going back in the oven.

1026
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,680
I'm just hoping it doesn't
melt completely.

1027
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,200
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

1028
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,080
Come on, you can do this.
Just shove that in as it is.

1029
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,400
As Nicky gets her final pie
in the oven,

1030
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,760
the other bakers are beginning
to take theirs out.

1031
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,880
I'm happy with that.

1032
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,800
That's a nice really golden
brown colour.

1033
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,800
Where have the mountains gone?

1034
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,160
This is genuinely traumatising.
I need another pair of hands.

1035
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,760
It's a bit stuck.

1036
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,760
No soggy bottom. Yes!

1037
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,080
What do we need to do? Could you
grab these two ends? Yeah.

1038
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,920
And I grab this and we lift.
Oh, it's just cracked.

1039
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,800
What's the matter? It just broke.
No, it hasn't.

1040
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,880
It's just snapped, yeah.
Try one more time.

1041
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,960
We'll see what happens.
Really carefully.

1042
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,600
Three, two, one. That's gone,

1043
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,440
Yeah, no, that's split.

1044
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,320
Oh, no, what do I do?

1045
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,360
Oh, serve it in the tin.
There's nothing else you can do.
Shall I?

1046
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,160
Yeah, and if they say anything just
say that Noel said to serve it
in a tin.

1047
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,200
{\an1}THEY LAUGH

1048
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,720
Oh, this is not happening today.

1049
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,880
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1050
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,480
Argh! Disaster.

1051
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,560
Oh, wow,
I've got a bit of a leak.

1052
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,080
Ooh!

1053
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,200
Why has this never happened?

1054
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,840
Bakers, that is your time up.

1055
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,280
Flipping heck.

1056
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,800
Please step away from your
pastry Showstoppers.

1057
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,200
Do you know what, guys?
I've tried my best.

1058
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,480
This is terrible.

1059
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,400
Do you want a hug? Hug.

1060
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,880
A nice, sweaty hug.
THEY LAUGH

1061
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,440
Oh, Nicky.

1062
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,520
The bakers' sweet decorative pie
Showstoppers

1063
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,800
will now be judged by Paul and Prue.

1064
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,720
It's a sensational display
and I love the way

1065
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,160
you've decorated them. Thank you.

1066
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,040
Let's try the bottom one first.

1067
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,640
This is apple, cinnamon...

1068
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,600
And sultanas.

1069
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,000
That's held together.

1070
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,000
The flavour of that is spot on.

1071
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,640
SHE SIGHS
OK.

1072
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,440
Um, it's beautifully cooked.
It's soft. This is the...

1073
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,360
Raspberry and frangipane.

1074
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,680
I've never had frangipane
with raspberry in it before.

1075
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,880
But that's amazing,
I love that. This is blueberry.

1076
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,360
Yeah.

1077
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,760
I like the blueberry.
It's intense, very American.

1078
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,880
I think they're three very
good pies.

1079
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,000
OK, great. Well done, Cristy.
Thank you. Well done, Cristy.

1080
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,520
I would be tempted to put
a glaze on this, you know.

1081
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,160
Just looks a bit rough and ready.
Especially this one.

1082
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,040
This is the pecan pie.

1083
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,920
There's a bit of, uh,
whisky in there as well so

1084
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,920
a bit like an American pecan pie.

1085
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,360
I really like that.
It's beautifully crispy.

1086
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,880
Hmm.

1087
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,040
The mountain pie has

1088
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,680
a blueberry sweet pastry
with a chestnut layer.

1089
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,040
Goodness.

1090
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,960
Wow, that's, uh, vibrant.

1091
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,000
It's quite wet inside.
The pastry is like cake.

1092
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,200
Hmm. OK.

1093
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,520
The sunburst pie is an apricot
and ricotta pie

1094
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,600
with a sweet pastry.

1095
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,040
It's a lovely texture.
Tastes delicious.

1096
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,040
Mm, I love the tartness from
the apricot.

1097
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,160
Thank you.

1098
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,040
The bottom pie is a cherry
and kirsch

1099
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,880
with
a chocolate sweet shortcrust.

1100
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,960
I quite like the compote
inside there.

1101
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,400
But I don't think
the chocolate crust really works

1102
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,000
with it. It's a bit sandy and dry.

1103
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,160
Next one.

1104
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,040
Grape and strawberry.

1105
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,560
But grapes on their own are very
subtle in flavour, so it's lost.

1106
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,440
And the top pie is mango,

1107
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,280
papaya and pineapple with
a lemon and lime sweet shortcrust.

1108
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,800
The textures on the base are lovely.

1109
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,920
I'm not quite sure of the textures
of some of the fruit,

1110
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,840
cos they're not quite right. OK.
They needed a little bit more
cooking.

1111
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,080
Just not hitting my heights.

1112
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,120
So this is my tree. You've got
a baklava pie, so we've got
pistachios,

1113
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,800
hazelnuts and walnuts mixed
with an orange syrup

1114
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,120
and there's a frangipane filling
on top.

1115
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,480
That is delicious
but it's very rich.

1116
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,160
Mm-hm. And it's very sweet.

1117
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,080
I think the frangipane's too thick.
Means now it's underbaked.

1118
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,520
So what is this one?

1119
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,720
This is my mulled wine apple pie.

1120
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,320
It's got some blackcurrants as well
running through it.

1121
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,080
Too sour.
It hits you right there.

1122
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,720
I think it is perhaps too powerful.
Mm-hm.

1123
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,640
They're a little bit... Broken.
Just a little bit rustic.

1124
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,920
Apple and blackberry
with some cinnamon.

1125
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,320
Some of the top is actually raw.
OK.

1126
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,600
The flavour is not bad.
Rhubarb and custard.

1127
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,600
Yeah.

1128
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,720
The rhubarb comes through
well there. Mm.

1129
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,600
It's a very good pie.

1130
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,720
Reticent to try this one.

1131
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,240
It's collapsed a bit.

1132
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,880
Plum and some ginger.

1133
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,360
The fruit is undercooked.

1134
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,120
Best one there is the rhubarb
and custard by quite a margin. Yeah.

1135
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,520
Thank you.

1136
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,920
Saku, what I really love about this
is it looks so simple and fresh.

1137
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,240
The big pie is pineapple,
cherry and rum.

1138
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,000
Um, the fruit's quite raw.

1139
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,240
I wouldn't go back for
a second piece.

1140
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,000
Let's have a look at the apple
and...

1141
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,760
Apple and cinnamon.

1142
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,440
I really like the apple.
Thank you.

1143
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,920
Cinnamon level's just about right.

1144
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,800
The pastry's nice and delicate
and buttery.

1145
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,080
I think that's delicious. Well done.

1146
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,200
Thank you very much.

1147
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,720
I mean, that is a work of art.

1148
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,880
You've got a very simple theme,
but it pulls all

1149
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,200
the pies together most excellently.

1150
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,320
It's a pineapple and apricot pie,
spiced with cinnamon stick,

1151
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,680
star anise and it's got some vanilla
in there.

1152
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,680
That's really good.
It's tart, it's sweet,

1153
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,080
it's crunchy,

1154
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,000
it's got depth to it.
It's delicious.

1155
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,040
Well, I can't fault that.

1156
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,800
Thank you.
The leaves are made with a coconut,

1157
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,640
apple and blackberry pie.

1158
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,440
That's delicious.

1159
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,880
And the right texture. Yeah.

1160
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,880
It holds together, but it's moist.

1161
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,680
This is what we've been
looking for.

1162
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,480
It's wonderful. Well done, Josh.
Well done, Josh. Thank you.
Yes, Josh!

1163
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,560
You've got Patsy pretty
well perfectly.

1164
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,360
Eddie's less successful, I think.

1165
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,520
Eddie is filled with cherry
and vanilla.

1166
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,840
I can't really... It's so difficult.

1167
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,520
{\an1}THEY SNIGGER

1168
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,400
This didn't happen at home,
believe me.

1169
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,880
It's just pouring out.
It's not... Nothing's set.

1170
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,240
The pastry's very good. Thank you.

1171
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,200
Crisp, very short,

1172
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,680
but it looks awful.

1173
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,600
It's very clumsy. Yeah.

1174
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,920
You can't get it out of the tin.

1175
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,800
No. Patsy is filled with lemon
and blueberry.

1176
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,720
Very clumsy. And you say they were
all right at home?

1177
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,400
Honestly, lovely, yeah.

1178
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,520
Well, this one has got
the opposite problem.

1179
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,000
So this is a chocolate frangipane

1180
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,280
and just a standard almond
frangipane with flaked almonds.

1181
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,400
It's very solid. Too dry.

1182
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,920
Besides that...
LAUGHTER

1183
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,760
..it's pretty good. Success.

1184
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,760
I think they're all very pretty.

1185
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,080
You've made a real effort

1186
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,320
to jolly it up and I love that,
of course.

1187
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:52,400
The first one is an apple,
pear and hazelnut pie.

1188
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,240
I've never had a dry apple
pie before.

1189
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,360
Oh, don't! Oh, well, there's a first
for everything, isn't there?

1190
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,320
I think partially
it's because it's so exposed.

1191
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,360
All the moisture that was in
that pie... Gone, tssh!

1192
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,840
..has just evaporated off.

1193
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,840
The second one is rhubarb,

1194
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,520
custard and a wee bit
of ginger in there.

1195
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,240
The custard works really well.

1196
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,640
It's pretty thick
but it's absolutely set.

1197
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,240
The pastry's too thick for
the filling

1198
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,920
so there's hardly any filling
in there.

1199
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,080
Deeper pie.

1200
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:21,720
Yeah. And then the third one is
frangipane and plum.

1201
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,320
It's a punchy flavour
and it's thin, so you've got that,

1202
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,000
and then the sort of plum on top,
it's about right as well.

1203
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,480
So actually it's quite a nice
flavour. That is delicious. Yeah.

1204
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,800
Thank you.

1205
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,960
Oh, I've got take a positive that it
was sort of really short

1206
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,400
and nice pastry,

1207
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,520
and actually she did say that
the flavours were good.

1208
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,120
I was just trying
to hold it all back,

1209
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,280
I was like, "Oh,
my goodness, this is incredible."

1210
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,920
Oh, they loved it. I'm so pleased.

1211
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,480
If Josh got Star Baker, I'd be over
the moon for him.

1212
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:50,800
But to even be in the mix
for Star Baker's, like, amazing.

1213
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,280
I thought their comments were
probably quite polite

1214
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,720
for what they could've said.
What a disaster!

1215
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,200
Do you know what? I am nervous
for today.

1216
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,680
Are ya? A double whammy.
I know.

1217
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,080
Who's it gonna be? Painful.
We know them all so well now.

1218
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,840
I thought Rowan's pies were
so awful.

1219
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,120
I thought it looked
a little bit like soup as well.

1220
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,480
To be honest, we needed a straw.

1221
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,560
I was a bit surprised
with Dana's efforts.

1222
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,520
I think she lost her edge
a little bit on the Showstopper.

1223
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,560
There's an argument for Saku
to be there as well

1224
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,880
but has she done enough on
her Showstopper

1225
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,960
to save herself?

1226
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,400
And Nicky's down there as well.

1227
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,520
I feel bad for Nicky. Yeah.

1228
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,680
But I think she's had
a tough week, hasn't she?

1229
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,440
I think Star Baker's between
a couple of people as well.

1230
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,520
I think Cristy, Josh.

1231
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,520
I think Josh's sunflower was
as perfect

1232
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,760
a piece of pastry as you could hope
for.

1233
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,600
And Cristy, I think she's had...
Yeah, yeah.

1234
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,720
Yeah. ..A much better week
generally. Yeah, she has.

1235
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,920
What happens now? You go and eat all
of the rest of the pies?
I'm not eating any more.

1236
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,200
If I expand any more

1237
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,760
I'm gonna take someone's eye
out with that button.

1238
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,720
{\an1}THEY LAUGH

1239
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,960
Prue and Paul have decided who
will be this week's Star Baker,

1240
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,840
and which two bakers will be
leaving the competition.

1241
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,320
Now, I've got the great job
of announcing

1242
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,040
this week's Star Baker,

1243
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,520
and this is someone who
the judges thought

1244
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,160
was consistent throughout.

1245
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,080
So, this week's Star Baker is...

1246
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,640
..Cristy.

1247
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,520
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Well done!

1248
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,080
Thank you, thank you.

1249
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,880
I knew that was coming.

1250
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,920
Oh, that means I've got
the horrible job

1251
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,240
of announcing who's leaving us.

1252
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,240
And, as you know, two people

1253
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,800
will be going this week.

1254
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,440
And the people that are
leaving us this week are...

1255
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,200
..Nicky and Rowan.

1256
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,360
Come here. Come here!

1257
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,040
It's been a blast.

1258
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,360
That wasn't your week, was it?

1259
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,120
What did I say? It was like a
bag of pants this week.

1260
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,600
So...

1261
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,800
I shall miss you so much.
I had a lovely time.

1262
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,280
I can't stay in after a
bag of pants.

1263
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,160
There's no way!

1264
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,720
Can I have a hug?

1265
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,560
Aww. I'm absolutely gutted.

1266
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,960
Everyone has just been fab.

1267
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,080
I mean, saying goodbye is
the worst part about this,

1268
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,120
not the absolute roast I got
at the Showstopper.

1269
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,760
I promise I can bake.
Oh, come here, Paul!

1270
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,480
I think Rowan went because
of that Showstopper.

1271
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,960
Oh, we've had a blast, haven't we?
We've had an absolutely...

1272
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,600
And the other person who's had a
really bad week is Nicky.

1273
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,240
It's been really sad to
let two of them go.

1274
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,840
Another one? Thank you so much.

1275
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,240
I've got this boost, which
I've probably needed,

1276
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,240
cos I think sometimes,
when you're a mum,

1277
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,360
everything's for everyone else

1278
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,640
and you sort of put your
dreams on hold.

1279
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,360
Star Baker and a handshake. That's
more than most people get.

1280
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,520
And it means than Paul and Prue
maybe even could imagine.

1281
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,080
Next week...

1282
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,000
I'm very pleased that
I can come back.

1283
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,440
Having said that, I need
to up my game...

1284
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,000
..to survive.

1285
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,600
Next time...

1286
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,920
Go, girl!

1287
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,040
..it's Botanicals Week...

1288
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,880
It's recognisable. Like cat pee.

1289
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,960
..and things get spicy in
the Signature...

1290
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,240
In life I'd say I'm quite spicy.
Probably not in baking.

1291
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,520
There's a race against time in
the Technical.

1292
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,520
What the hell is this?
I've got no recipe.

1293
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,480
..and the bakers take on
a blooming marvellous Showstopper.

1294
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,800
Dandelion syrup.

1295
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,160
This is crazy.

1296
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,960
Who will come up smelling of roses?

1297
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,600
Absolutely heavenly.

1298
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,160
And who will be weeded out of
the competition?

1299
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,000
It's broken!

1300
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,080
That was the wrong thing
to do, wasn't it?

1301
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,240
