{\an1}GODFATHER THEME-STYLE MUSIC

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,040
Don Paul-eone.

3
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,400
Is it done?

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,280
I put a loaf of bread in his bed.

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,760
Good, he won't sleep for weeks.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,480
Crumbs in the bed are a nightmare.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,360
I have news.
A new addition to the family.

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,680
Breadfather.

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,160
It's day one of series 14.

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,800
Why has it taken so long
to come to see me?

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,600
I don't mean to brag, Breadfather,

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,880
but I've been very busy.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,480
Daytime TV, hosting the Baftas

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,800
and I was in a Stormzy video.

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,960
He's a Grime artist. Ah!

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,480
The Breadfather often says
that joining this family

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,440
is like making
the perfect loaf of bread.

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,280
In order to rise, you first have
to prove.

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,440
Someone call?

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,360
No, no, I said prove, not Prue.

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,160
My mistake.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,000
What do you say, Breadfather,
is she in?

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,600
Welcome to the family. Yes!

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,880
Do you want to do the honours?

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,120
Welcome to The Great British Bake
Off.

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
Thank you.

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,000
Are you eating dough balls again?

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,480
MUFFLED: They're stuck
to the inside of my cheeks!

{\an1}BIRD KEENS

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,480
I don't really know how
I got here?

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,680
Feel like I'm a bit lost.

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,400
You know you can do experience days?

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,320
It feels like I'm on one of them.

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,600
Oh, I'm really terrified.

35
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,800
Thousands of amateur bakers
from across Britain applied.

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,640
I had success at my village show.

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,680
And that made me think,
"Give it a shot".

38
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,880
You know, what's
the worst that can happen?!

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,080
12 have made it
to the Bake Off tent.

40
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,840
Is this really happening?

41
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,440
My little tum is going
like a washing machine.

42
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,200
Over the next ten weeks, they'll
face 30 brand-new challenges.

43
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,240
I'm thinking one week at a time,
one bake at a time.

44
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,520
If it goes wrong,
we'll just key Paul's car.

45
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,560
Every aspect of their baking skill
will be tested.

46
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
{\an1}SHE GASPS

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,040
I was not expecting my
first technical to go like this!

48
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,880
And everything they bake
will be judged by Prue Leith...

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,600
That is the cutest little cake.

50
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,880
..and Paul Hollywood.

51
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,120
It looks like it's been run over!

52
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,880
I feel like I'll just get lost
in Paul's eyes, to be honest.

53
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,800
We'll have to keep
it PG, unfortunately.

54
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,240
I can't see.

55
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,560
ALISON HAMMOND: Each week,

56
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,760
those that rise
will be crowned Star Baker.

57
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,080
Can you believe it?! Yes.
This is huge!

58
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,240
Stop ramping up the pressure!

59
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,480
Those that crumble...

60
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,360
Baking for my life.

61
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,640
..will leave the tent.

62
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,800
Ah, it's lovely out there.

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,800
But who will go on to win?

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,920
Why this is doing to me?

65
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,000
It's gonna take you ages
to wash that off.

66
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,320
You're putting me off my stride!

67
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,640
The Great British Bake Off.

68
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,920
So, Nicky, tell us
about your beaver.

69
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,280
{\an1}CRESCENDO OF GIGGLES

70
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,880
It's cake week, and,
after three challenges,

71
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,000
we'll crown our first Star Baker

72
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,640
but one baker will
have to leave the tent.

73
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,520
Hello, bakers. Welcome,
lovely to see you all.

74
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,960
Welcome to the tent.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,360
Now, before we start,
I know what you're thinking.

76
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,440
Things look a little bit
different this year.

77
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,280
That's right - Paul's
had his beard reshaped.

78
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,800
I think it's a triumph, personally.

79
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,120
Also, we have a new host,

80
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,080
so let's welcome
to the tent Alison.

81
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,200
Ah, thanks, Noel. Hi, everyone!

82
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,320
I am so excited
to be joining the show and,

83
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,840
I'm just thrilled to meet you
bakers. It's lovely to see you all.

84
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,560
Also, can I introduce you to Daryl,

85
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,320
a BSL interpreter
for one of the bakers?

86
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,000
BOTH: Welcome to the tent.
Thank you.

87
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,360
It's time for your first-ever
Signature Challenge.

88
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,120
The judges would like you
to make a vertical layer cake.

89
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,680
Now, the judges are looking
for perfectly baked sponge

90
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,600
which will be rolled with
a filling so that, when sliced,

91
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,440
it will reveal neat,
vertical layers.

92
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,920
You've got two hours.

93
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,880
This is the bit you're most looking
forward to, isn't it?

94
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,040
I can't wait. Let me get ready.

95
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,840
Shall we hold hands?
OK, let's do it together.

96
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,400
You wanna kick it off? Yeah.

97
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,480
On your marks...

98
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
..Get set...

99
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,040
..Bake!

100
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,840
That was amazing.
THEY CHUCKLE

101
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,280
Hoo-hoo!

102
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,000
It's actually happening!

103
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,000
Just trying to process it all
at the moment, to be honest.

104
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,680
It's just a mad experience.

105
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,280
I am baking for my life. Ha-ha!

106
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,520
How long have we got left?

107
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,920
I've only just started
but I'm already panicking.

108
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,600
Vertical layered cake.

109
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,920
It's a bit like
a Swiss roll standing up.

110
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,920
So, you cut into it, you
see these very strong lines.

111
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,040
We want cleanly defined
vertical layers of cake,

112
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,680
filling, cake, filling, cake.

113
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,920
We expect a bit of height
to these cakes.

114
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
Colour, plenty of flavours.

115
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,280
Now if the bakers say
"I've got apple in here,

116
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,600
"I've got pineapple in there,

117
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,040
"I've got lemon in there,"
I wanna taste it.

118
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,920
If the bakers don't
get their cakes

119
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,360
into the oven in time, get them out,
get them cool before they fill them

120
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,960
and decorate them, then
they're going to be too warm.

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,280
They will lose shape,
they'll slump

122
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,560
or we'll have
a complete disaster.

123
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,760
Morning, Rowan.
How are you doing?

124
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,600
Oh, my gosh! It's real. Hello.

125
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,880
What are you gonna be making?

126
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,240
I am making chocolate
and raspberry vertical cake.

127
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,240
It's inspired by a birthday cake
I made for my 21st

128
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,400
which was actually a wedding cake.

129
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,280
21-year-old Rowan
from West Yorkshire

130
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,840
is this year's youngest baker

131
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,960
and is studying English
at university.

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,600
Put it back in the right place
or the librarian'll kill you.

133
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,120
His vertical wedding cake will see
dark chocolate sponge wrap around

134
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,120
a raspberry Swiss buttercream.

135
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,680
You had a wedding cake for your
21st birthday? Yeah. I love you.

136
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,480
It's because you're worth it,
isn't it, babes?

137
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,000
That's the thing. Self-love.

138
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,640
Whilst Rowan plans to tie
the knot with himself...

139
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,280
Nervous as anything.

140
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,880
..Nicky's aiming to marry
two classic flavours.

141
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,800
It's a orange and lemon cake

142
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,840
because myself and my sister
used to play a skipping game to

143
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,360
"Oranges and lemons
sing the bells of St Clement's."

144
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,800
Nicky grew up in Dundee

145
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,440
and after a career in the skies,
she's landed in the West Midlands,

146
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,800
close to her granddaughters
Edie and Matilda.

147
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,800
En garde! Hai!

148
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,800
She hopes to take off
in the competition with

149
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,680
a blood orange Swiss roll sponge,

150
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,000
lemon curd and an orange
and rosemary syrup.

151
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,520
Cabin crew.

152
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,520
Does that mean you're gonna present
all your bakes

153
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,600
on a little rectangle tray?!

154
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,200
There you go, Paul.
Drop it down.

155
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,120
Paul, put your seat belt
on and try this!

156
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,560
{\an1}NICKY GUFFAWS

157
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,840
Dan's also hoping to land
a British classic.

158
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,480
I'm doing a rhubarb
and custard cake today,

159
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,280
with rhubarb out of my garden.

160
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,760
Dan is a resources planner
and lives in Cheshire

161
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,320
with his wife Natalie
and sons Sam and Rory.

162
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
Oh, Rory.

163
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,200
As well as growing rhubarb

164
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,880
he's recently begun
brewing his own beer.

165
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,600
Tastes absolutely awful.

166
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,800
He'll add fresh rhubarb compote
to his filling

167
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,880
and cover his cake
in cream cheese icing.

168
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,040
What about decoration?

169
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,480
I've poached some rhubarb slices

170
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,600
and they're just gonna go round
the outside,

171
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,680
so it's very pink and very me.

172
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,600
Good luck, mate.
Thank you very much.

173
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,600
I just wanna tell you
one little thing.

174
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
I don't like rhubarb,

175
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,760
so please don't take offence
if I don't eat it.

176
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,680
I'm gonna win you over.
Honestly, I'll win you over!

177
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,280
It derives from Jaffa Cake

178
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,720
which I used to have all the time
as a kid.

179
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,240
So the main stars are the dark
chocolate and the blood orange.

180
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,080
Amos is a delicatessen manager
from Nottingham

181
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,760
and still bakes
with his mum, Antoinette.

182
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,640
His vertical Jaffa Cake features
blood orange and dark chocolate

183
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,640
in two contrasting decorative drips.

184
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,000
There's blood orange flavour in
the actual sponge, as well.

185
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,960
I think I'm going
a bit ahead of myself

186
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,720
so I need to slow down, maybe.

187
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,040
That's what my mum always says -
"Slow down."

188
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,760
The judges are expecting
a light, fluffy sponge

189
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,840
but it still needs
to be flexible enough to roll.

190
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,400
I've gone for a classic Swiss roll
recipe, really. Nothing fancy!

191
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,960
But not everyone's gone
for a classic.

192
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,240
I'm making a genoise sponge

193
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,560
because I always see genoise
on Bake Off.

194
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,280
It's just a Swiss roll on its end.

195
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,320
And I can't help but think...

196
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,760
..why?

197
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,280
Tasha lives in London

198
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,840
and, before working for
a children's charity,

199
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,320
she was a ski instructor in Japan.

200
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,640
{\an1}SHE LAUGHS

201
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,280
She'll attempt to roll her black
sesame genoise sponge around

202
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,200
a sharp lime and yuzu curd.

203
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,400
Are you happy?

204
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,200
No. I'm looking round

205
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,400
and everyone else has gone
for a more robust sponge.

206
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,600
Just don't look into
Paul's eyes, that's all.

207
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,880
He's tried standing there, like,
several times now

208
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,200
and I've just been a bit like...

209
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,600
What was his face like?
I don't wanna do an impression,

210
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,600
but I kind of do. Yeah, go on -
do an impression of Paul.

211
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,560
That's it! That's it! It's perfect.

212
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,480
The thin sponge for
a vertical layer cake

213
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,520
bakes in a matter of minutes.
Wish me luck.

214
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,200
A fraction too long in the oven

215
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,560
and it will crack
as soon as it's rolled.

216
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,560
But for his giant
wedding cake... Ugh!

217
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,880
..Rowan will need to perfectly bake
three sponges at the same time.

218
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,640
We'll make it work.

219
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,080
Do you think that'll work?

220
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,280
And Cristy is aiming just as high.

221
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,160
Try and get 'em all in
at the same time.

222
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,680
I'm making a lemon meringue, like,
vertical cake

223
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,800
so sort of based on my mum's
lemon meringue recipe.

224
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,440
Cristy grew up in East London with
her dad Rod and her mum Michelle.

225
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,320
She now has four children
of her own and works as a PA.

226
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,040
Her sponge,
curd and buttercream will feature

227
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,960
three different types of lemon.

228
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,160
Limoncello, lemon juice, lemon zest.

229
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,400
If they don't taste the lemons

230
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,120
then I don't know what
the hell I've done wrong.

231
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,520
Saku is also planning
a family favourite.

232
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,200
I am making lemon
and blueberry vertical layer cake.

233
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,600
Have you made it before?

234
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,840
Several times. This is
my husband's favourite cake.

235
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,400
Saku is an intelligence analyst
and lives in Hereford

236
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,560
where she plays for
a local cricket team

237
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,480
started by her daughter, Therindi.

238
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,280
Shot.
Shot.

239
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,200
Her cake will feature
a sharp lemon cream cheese icing

240
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,720
and blueberry buttercream.

241
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,440
Blueberry often
has very pale flavour.

242
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,600
Are you adding essence or anything
to boost it up a bit?

243
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,520
I made a blueberry reduction

244
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,520
so I am using that
to the buttercream.

245
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,320
I love the idea of the flavours.
They do sound very good.

246
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,120
Are you a little bit nervous?

247
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,480
Lot nervous!
Awww!

248
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,200
Here you are, come here, come here.

249
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,680
Ah, thank you very much.

250
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,920
Is that better? Is that better?
That's really better. Yes.

251
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Yeah? Much better. OK.

252
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,120
You'll be fine, then. Ah. Thank you,
Paul. Thank you very much. Aww!

253
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,920
Good luck.
Thank you!

254
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,640
Can you believe it?!

255
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,160
Yes! Made my day.

256
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,480
I am making chocolate orange cake

257
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,560
in honour of my father, really.

258
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,840
He served in the Second World War

259
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,680
and he was a prisoner of war.

260
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,760
Because he was on starvation rations

261
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,400
I think he became
quite indulgent after that

262
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,160
so he'd be stocking up
on Christmas chocolates

263
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
from about October onwards.

264
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,720
Keith is a chartered accountant
and lives in Hampshire

265
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,080
with his partner Sue
and their poodle, Maisie.

266
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,840
Maisie, give us the ball.
HE LAUGHS

267
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,960
He's making a ganache by melting
his dad's favourite chocolate

268
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,640
and he's adding a little extra touch

269
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,160
to his whipped cream filling
for someone else.

270
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,440
I've put some orange liqueur
in there.

271
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,480
And, normally, you put a bit less
than the recipe suggests. Ah!

272
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,120
But I'm not sure
that dialling down the booze

273
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
is gonna float Prue's boat, is it?

274
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,360
Should've gone way over!

275
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,680
It's time for your first-ever
time call.

276
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,560
Oh, can I do it? Is that all right?
Yes, of course.

277
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,480
You don't mind? I'll just support
you while you do it. Thank you.

278
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,520
Bakers, you're halfway through.
You have one hour left.

279
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,880
I don't even need to be here
any more. You got this.

280
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,880
No, don't! Come back, come back!

281
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,600
Cake out time, no going back.

282
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,160
Time and heat are now
the bakers' two biggest worries.

283
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Can't see a thing!
SHE GUFFAWS

284
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,880
I can't see.

285
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,760
The sooner they can begin
cooling their sponges...

286
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,840
I think that's done.

287
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,360
..the less chance
their vertical layer cakes

288
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,960
will collapse when filled.

289
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,640
OK, my top one's gonna come out.
My other two aren't.

290
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,040
Really happy. So far!

291
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,720
Think my sponges aren't done.

292
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,240
One of them's done really well and
then the bottom one has just sunk.

293
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,960
Tasha's gamble on a genoise sponge
doesn't seem to be paying off.

294
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,560
It's all tipped over the...

295
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,240
Oh, I know why.
SHE GASPS

296
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,000
Tasha, you're an idiot. OK.

297
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,200
Mm. I used the wrong rack,

298
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,520
so it's tilted all
the mixture to one side.

299
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,360
It means that some of the layers
won't be the same thickness.

300
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,960
But I'm not gonna tell them that!

301
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,240
So now I'm just rolling up my sponge

302
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,880
then I'm gonna quickly
get it chilled,

303
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,080
so that whilst they're cooling
they've got a nice rolled-up shape.

304
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,800
Result! Ha-ha! Get in.
SHE CHUCKLES

305
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,800
So wonky. I can work around it.

306
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,080
I think.

307
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,720
The bakers need to use every minute

308
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,560
that their rolled sponges
are cooling

309
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,080
to perfect the fillings that will
sandwich their vertical layers.

310
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,400
Mm.

311
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,640
Blueberry buttercream.

312
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,720
Yes, lovely!

313
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,720
In with rhubarb creme pat, just
putting some custard powder in it

314
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,800
to give it that proper, authentic
retro rhubarb and custard flavour

315
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,560
cos we didn't really have creme
pat when I was a kid. Sorry, Mum!

316
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,360
For their filling,
one baker has gone

317
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,480
a little further
than their back garden.

318
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,120
I'm using as much, like,
foraged stuff as I can

319
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,880
so they're wild blackcurrants
and wild poppy seeds.

320
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,880
Wild poppy seeds are unusual.

321
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,840
When Abbi isn't working at
an organic farm in Cumbria

322
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,200
she forages for ingredients
to add to her home baking.

323
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,560
Oh, and a little slug. Just give it
a little wash before we use it.

324
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,480
As well as the poppy seeds
and blackcurrants for her sponge

325
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,400
and buttercream, Abbi has also
foraged for her decoration.

326
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,360
Those are gorse petals. Did you
forage these as well? I did.

327
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,880
It must feel so nice when you forage
your own fruit and veg.

328
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,960
Yeah, definitely. And then you make
your own cakes.

329
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,680
It's lovely, isn't it?
Absolutely, yeah.

330
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,440
When I hear some of the flavour
combinations, I'm like, wow.

331
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,920
Where have you thought of that?

332
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,800
It's a take on a tiramisu,

333
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,720
so it's a coffee cake
with coffee mascarpone cream.

334
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,800
Sports fanatic Matty is a PE teacher

335
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,080
and lives and works
in Cambridgeshire.

336
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,240
The punchy coffee flavour in his
sponge and mascarpone filling

337
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,720
should be balanced with
a light vanilla buttercream.

338
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,160
The buttercream looks like
someone's sick.

339
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,640
Don't zoom in on that.

340
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,280
Curdled my buttercream.

341
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,640
Matty will have
to restart his buttercream...

342
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,160
But I'm hiding the terror
through the smile.

343
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,320
..and he's not the only one
attempting to balance a coffee kick.

344
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,040
I only drink caramel lattes

345
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,560
so I'm doing a coffee sponge
with salted caramel buttercream.

346
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,760
Dana is a database administrator

347
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,520
and lives in Essex
with her cockapoo, Gracie.

348
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,600
Her salted caramel buttercream
will fill a coffee sponge

349
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,080
soaked with coffee syrup.

350
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,400
Because the caramel's quite sweet

351
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,520
so I wanna balance out
the flavours.

352
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,200
Look at me getting all
Mastercheffy. I love it!

353
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,400
MasterChef?! We don't want that
here. We're on Bake Off now.

354
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,640
Look at me getting all Bake-Offy.

355
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,160
This isn't MasterChef here, all
right? It's all about the Bake Off.

356
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,520
It's all the wrong programme!

357
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,880
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

358
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,760
This is buttercream take two.

359
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,160
Goes quick, don't it?
Tell me about it.

360
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,480
The bakers' time and heat issues
now get even harder.

361
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
She's a beauty.

362
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,800
Fill and roll their
sponges too late...

363
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,000
Chill out.

364
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,960
..they won't have time
to perfect their decoration.

365
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,080
It's pretty much there.
I think it's at room temperature.

366
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,160
But fill and roll a warm sponge...

367
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,600
If anything is remotely warm,
it's game over.

368
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,000
..and their vertical layer cake
will collapse.

369
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,800
What's the best thing to do?

370
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,200
It's a waiting game now, isn't it?

371
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,080
Let's try a bit of your ganache.

372
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,680
Oh, it's fab.

373
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,200
Oh, my gosh I need a drink.

374
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,520
I could do with a caramel latte,
not gonna lie.

375
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,400
Quick slug of coffee.

376
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,720
Can I have a cup of tea, please?

377
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,040
All right, yeah. Do or die now.

378
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,840
I think my sponges are
sufficiently cooled

379
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,480
that I can put the filling in now.

380
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,680
Unless the ratio of filling
to sponge is completely even...

381
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,280
I've got my black sesame cream

382
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,560
and now I'm gonna add
the yuzu curd.

383
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,360
..the bakers won't achieve
the perfect vertical stripes

384
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,920
that the judges have demanded.

385
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,920
Blueberry reduction goes first,

386
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,720
then the blueberry buttercream.

387
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,600
It does come up lovely. I like it.

388
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,920
I can't give that to anyone.

389
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,920
Matty's second attempt
at the buttercream

390
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,680
has gone about as well as his first.

391
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,840
I've just not been patient enough
with making this warm enough.

392
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,080
How's it going?

393
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,400
I keep curdling my buttercream.

394
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,160
Just a baking competition,
don't worry about it.

395
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,320
Cheers.
NOEL LAUGHS

396
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,800
If it goes wrong we'll just
key Paul's car.

397
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,960
Right, moment of truth.

398
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,480
The slightest crack in
the sponge at this stage...

399
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,040
Oh, we've got a bit
of naughtiness here.

400
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,600
..and once stood on its end,
gravity will force it open...

401
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,720
I'm almost there.

402
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,920
..making the cake lean...

403
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
Behave.

404
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
..or worse.

405
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,280
Look at that. So clever.

406
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,960
I didn't realise it was like
a roll like that.

407
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,440
Like a Russian doll.

408
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,320
I'm going to put them
all in each other,

409
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,280
so it's gonna be huge and tall.

410
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,960
And whilst some are going
for scale...

411
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,400
Just gonna wrap
the other two sponges round that.

412
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,880
Have I got one more to do?
Oh, yeah.

413
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,920
..Josh has focused on design.

414
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,360
So there's the two different
coloured sponges.

415
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
And they should hopefully
sort of alternate.

416
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,040
Josh is a chemical biology researcher
living in Leicestershire.

417
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,480
He tests his bakes at
his local rugby club.

418
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,560
No soggy bottoms here Josh!

419
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,320
{\an8}He'll roll his alternating coloured
sponges around passion fruit curd

420
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,280
{\an8}and coconut buttercream.

421
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,040
Baking rugby player. Yeah.

422
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,840
Once a month, usually, I take them
into the changing rooms...

423
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,840
Basically, 20 or 30 naked men
try out your food.

424
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,080
Yeah! In the changing rooms,
whilst covered in mud.

425
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,840
I'm in trouble.
It's just all sticking to the paper.

426
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,920
This is the first time it's happened
like this. Oh, how cliche.

427
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,280
And Amos isn't the only
one struggling.

428
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,560
This is cracking.

429
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,720
I don't really know why
I did a genoise.

430
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,000
Ah, don't do this for me.

431
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,640
Why this is doing to me?

432
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,760
Why? See it's sticking.

433
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,720
Oh, my god.

434
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,840
Look at that precious little...fella.

435
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,840
Very stressful.

436
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,680
The thing is, everyone wants
a handshake from Paul

437
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,640
and you've already had a hug.
Oh, exactly.

438
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,240
So you don't need a handshake now,
do you? Yes!

439
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,800
Where can you go from a hug?

440
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,040
Home.

441
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,600
15 minutes left.

442
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,240
Time's against us a wee bit now.

443
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,920
I'm no longer using buttercream.

444
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,280
I never want to see it again.

445
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,680
And we're gonna use more coffee
mascarpone cream.

446
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,160
I think we have enough.

447
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
It's not a circle
so I'm piping tactically.

448
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Thickest crumb coat
you've ever seen in your life

449
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,600
to try and disguise
what's going on.

450
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,560
I've got shaky hands.

451
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,960
Rhubarb slices,
like trimming my hedge.

452
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,480
Try and make it look attractive.

453
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,440
So I've got some light pink,
some dark pinks.

454
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,720
Oh, it's so messy.

455
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,440
I don't want to overdo it.

456
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,520
I wish I liked rhubarb.
I'd be all over that, babes.

457
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,840
I've tried to raise my prettiness
game in the last year or so.

458
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,000
Is it not your forte, prettiness?
So I'm rather hoping...

459
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,080
No. It's one of the reasons
it's taken me 14 years to apply.

460
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,600
It's a bit lopsided.

461
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,560
I think it's fair to say there's
prettier drip cakes on display.

462
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,160
My chocolate drip is splitting.

463
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,240
One minute.

464
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,320
Oh, my God.

465
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,480
Just to make it look
a little bit civilised.

466
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,480
It's not quite as I envisaged.

467
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,280
Oh, my God.

468
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,320
Bakers, your time is up.

469
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,960
Please step away from your
vertical layer cakes.

470
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,080
Well done.

471
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,880
I feel like I've run a marathon.

472
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,480
{\an8}That looks so good.

473
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,040
{\an8}I could put my face in that.

474
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,000
{\an8}Do you think I'll get
away with that?

475
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,920
{\an8}It's leaning.

476
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,520
{\an8}The bakers will now face
the judgement of Paul and Prue

477
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,640
{\an8}for the very first time.

478
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,480
Hello, Rowan. Hello. Hi, Rowan.

479
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,920
It's tall, isn't it?

480
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,120
I don't go in halves.

481
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,240
I'm not quite sure
I'm going to get it all out.

482
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh, there you go.
Oh, no! Oh, OK.

483
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,760
Now that is a perfect example
of a vertical cake.

484
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,560
I like it. Do you? Yeah. Oh!

485
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,200
It's delicate. Yeah!

486
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,800
But the flavours are there.

487
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,280
Buttercream's terrific.
Well done, Rowan. Thank you.

488
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,680
Just be aware of the strength of
flavours that you're putting in.

489
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,880
Well, the colours work.

490
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Vibrant, I think the
cake looks amazing.

491
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,760
But I actually think you've
overbaked your sponges.

492
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,880
But the flavour is sensational.

493
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,040
{\an8}Obviously there's been issues
with the drip effect.

494
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,360
Look at that.

495
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,720
The layers just aren't even enough.

496
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,800
The chocolate dominates.
There's not a lot of orange.

497
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
OK.

498
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,120
I think it looks lovely.

499
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,920
It's good height to it as well. Wow.

500
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,240
Beautiful lines. Oh, thank you.

501
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,240
I think it's delicious.

502
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,480
Oh, do you?

503
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
I think, your flavour,
you are 60% there,

504
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,040
don't be afraid to really punch us
in the teeth with citrus flavours.

505
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,200
{\an8}Looks like a barrel.

506
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,680
{\an8}Bit like me actually.

507
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,120
But I don't think it's terrible.
Well, that's good!

508
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,960
He's dabbing with faint praise.

509
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,280
He doesn't think it's terrible.

510
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,840
I quite like the layers,
they're pretty even.

511
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,640
Yes, the layers are good.

512
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,520
The flavour is very subtle
and it is delicious.

513
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,240
It's just not punchy enough.

514
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,400
Maybe it's one of these that
kind of just grows on you.

515
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,720
Like a fungus.

516
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Paul!

517
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,400
Doing well. Barrel, fungus...
Like a beautiful fungus.

518
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,160
Can't take him anywhere.

519
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,960
I like that informal
cornucopia look.

520
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,920
Very nice vertical stripes.

521
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,280
This is the wild poppy, isn't it?

522
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,680
Yeah, wild poppyseeds.

523
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,920
It's delicious.

524
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,640
I think the flavour's come through,
they're nice and punchy.

525
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,880
The balance of the
texture of the cake

526
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,560
and the buttercream is beautiful.

527
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,680
Thank you.

528
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,520
{\an8}It's a bit messy. Yes.

529
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,960
{\an8}The piping's not particularly good.

530
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,560
{\an8}Well, those are pretty good stripes.

531
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,160
I must say, the flavour's lovely.

532
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,360
Not too salty.

533
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,040
Don't make a face like that.
It is a bit wobbly.

534
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,600
I like the colours,
I think it's stark.

535
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,120
Let's have a look at this
wobbly tower. Wow.

536
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,560
Well, the stripes are there.

537
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,680
Ooh. What's happened?

538
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,400
I got the sharpness from
the outside... Ah.

539
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,400
Ah, creme pattiss... ..which brings
that sour and the sweet together.

540
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,560
Love the flavours.

541
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,680
Well, I think the real
achievement is to get real flavour

542
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,120
out of blueberries, which
are really not the easiest fruit

543
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,040
to make taste great.

544
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,240
It's coffee cake and a mascarpone
cream that ended up being on

545
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,800
the outside as well as the inside

546
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,800
due to my inability
to make a buttercream.

547
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,920
OK.
LAUGHTER

548
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,160
That'd wake you up in the morning.

549
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,560
It certainly is strong.

550
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
That coffee level is perfect.

551
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,560
It's a muscular cake.

552
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,760
Yeah.

553
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,840
It's very nice.

554
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,440
You've made a hefty, muscular,
powerful cake.

555
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,640
Dan, that is the cutest little cake.

556
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,120
Looks like a circus tent.
Yeah, it does doesn't it? Yeah.

557
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,000
Beautiful stripes, Dan.
Look at those lines.

558
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
Well done. Thank you.

559
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,080
That is rhubarb and custard.

560
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,400
It's a beautiful cake,
it's very light.

561
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,400
And with the creme pat and the
rhubarb, the slice is quite moreish.

562
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,440
Think you've done a good job.
Oh, thanks, Paul. Cheers.

563
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,200
Tiny circus tent. I know, yeah.
Loved it. Brilliant.

564
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,520
{\an8}I think it looks so dramatic

565
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,880
{\an8}and the colours are
so strong contrasting,

566
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,840
{\an8}and they look so wonderful.

567
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,160
Is this just cream, then?

568
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,280
It's whipped cream

569
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,360
with that orange liqueur
I mentioned.

570
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,560
It's delicious.

571
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,960
Oh, my God.
Absolutely delicious.

572
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,480
The cream is so light against
the density of the chocolate

573
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,480
and then that orange liqueur...
It is absolutely delicious.

574
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,320
I could happily eat all of that.

575
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,960
Well done, Keith. Thank you.
Thank you, Keith.

576
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,480
Nailed it.

577
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,760
Boozy Prue.

578
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,080
Dear me.

579
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,120
Did you sit on it?

580
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,040
There were some problems.

581
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,400
But, you know what?
Its flavour might save it.

582
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,120
Well you've certainly got
the stripes.

583
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,400
I think you've got too much filling
to cake, though.

584
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,760
That is very unusual.

585
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,280
And rather delicious.

586
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,520
Thank you.

587
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,880
But, if you'd used less of the
filling and more of the sponge,

588
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,400
that would've been
absolutely brilliant.

589
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,000
I think it looks terrible...

590
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,400
..but I love the flavours
and the textures of it.

591
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,880
Well done. Thank you.

592
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,760
Hope you softened some
of Paul's rudeness.

593
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,920
It was such a mixed bag

594
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,160
but it was definitely leaning on
the side of bad.

595
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,800
I've learnt a lot today
which I will bring

596
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,880
week after week
after week, hopefully.

597
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,440
I'm flabbergasted.

598
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,520
I was worried that I wouldn't
measure up.

599
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,160
The only way is probably that way
now, isn't it, to be fair?

600
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,400
Each week, the bakers
will face a second challenge

601
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,800
that's a gingham-clad mystery.

602
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,520
It's time for your technical
challenge, which today has been set

603
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,960
for you by the big boss man,
Paul Hollywood.

604
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,520
Bakers, this is the most iconic
Bake Off cake.

605
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,280
It has to look amazing on
the outside,

606
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,720
and inside it's got to taste
and look good too.

607
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,440
Phew. As ever, the technical
challenge will be judged blind

608
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,720
so we're gonna have to ask these two
lovelies to pop outside the tent.

609
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,040
Bye. Paul's gonna go and
look at some denim samples.

610
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,240
So, Paul would like you to make

611
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,760
the Great British Bake Off
chocolate cake.

612
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,520
You know, the one with
the famous missing raspberry.

613
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,600
{\an1}EXCITED LAUGHTER
Whatever happened to that raspberry?

614
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,360
I've got it right here
in this golden box.

615
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,720
That's my pension.

616
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,920
I'll be selling that on eBay.

617
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,480
The judges are looking
for two layers of moist... Moist.

618
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,800
..choc...

619
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,040
..chocolate sponge,

620
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,560
covered and filled with a silky
smooth chocolate ganache...

621
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,280
Ganache.
..topped with the fresh raspberries.

622
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,840
You have two hours. On your marks.

623
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,360
Get set. Bake!

624
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,080
The bakers have all been given
the same ingredients

625
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,400
and a pared-down recipe.

626
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,440
Straight away,
I know what this cake looks like.

627
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,800
I mean, I've been watching
the show since such a young age,

628
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,560
and that dreaded raspberry,
so I can finally rectify it.

629
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,960
To be honest, I've never
really clocked anything

630
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,680
other than the raspberry, so it's
news to me that it was a cake.

631
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,920
It feels quite strange to be doing
the iconic Bake Off cake

632
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,240
on Bake Off. It's very meta.

633
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,760
I recognise this cake.

634
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,840
It's probably one of
the most famous cakes in the UK.

635
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,680
It is actually
a chocolate fudge cake,

636
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
but it comes down to the ganache.

637
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,840
Got to cool your ganache down
to a point, but not cold,

638
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,080
because it'll be solid.

639
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,240
When it comes into contact
with the sponge,

640
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,080
if it's warm,
it's just gonna run out.

641
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,760
They can use the fridges.

642
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,200
The issue when you use the
fridge with ganache,

643
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,840
you can matte the chocolate.

644
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,040
And we want shiny.

645
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,320
Let's take a slice of this, Prue.

646
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,440
Straight away you see
the ganache smack in the middle.

647
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,160
It's beautifully set,
and it's soft and luscious,

648
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,320
but not pouring out like a volcano.

649
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,560
This is a chocoholic's dream.

650
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,400
Don't have any more, Prue.
I can't help it.

651
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,920
We've gotta go in
and have 12 of these in a minute.

652
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,440
Well, you've more discipline
than I have.

653
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,560
"Melt and combine the chocolate,
butter and hot water."

654
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,120
While that's going,
I'm gonna make a start

655
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,760
on putting together all the
wet ingredients.

656
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,440
We've got sour cream,
vegetable oil, eggs and butter.

657
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,080
This is the iconic cake.

658
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,040
You see this cake every single time
you watch Bake Off.

659
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,200
This is huge.
Stop ramping up the pressure!

660
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,840
"Incorporate the melted
chocolate mixture

661
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,640
"before combining with
the dry ingredients."

662
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,920
Just using the spatula
to fold it through.

663
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,920
Um, I feel like I've made a mistake.

664
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,760
I might have used twice as much
chocolate for the actual cake,

665
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,840
but I'm just kind
of hoping that it's fine.

666
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,800
Everyone loves a good
chocolate cake, so...

667
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,920
In the oven.

668
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,040
You're going in, mate.
Goodbye. See you laters.

669
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,920
It just says, "Bake,"
so it's very helpful.

670
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,080
Love that Paul, don't you?

671
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,840
I'll be baking the cakes
for 35 minutes.

672
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,120
This is already set to 35.
Do you think that's a sign?

673
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,560
I'll try 30 first.

674
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,080
Or 35?

675
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
35!

676
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,440
"Make the ganache
filling slash icing."

677
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,960
Not much to say
about ganache. really.

678
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,600
It's not afraid to be itself.

679
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,280
I feel like I'm slightly at
an unfair advantage

680
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,080
as I made ganache this morning.

681
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,240
Feels like cheating.

682
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,880
That's why everyone was
staring at you, Keith. Is it?

683
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,320
It's looking good,
looking silky smooth.

684
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,800
That's lovely and glossy. Could have
a bath in that, couldn't you?

685
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,440
I'm hesitant to put it in
the fridge.

686
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,080
I want to keep it as
shiny as possible,

687
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,920
but I think if I stick it
in the fridge,

688
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,200
it might not be shiny anymore.

689
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,880
Pop that there for a sec.

690
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,560
I think it's gonna take
a really long time to cool.

691
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,920
I'll be utilising the fridge.

692
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,600
Probably gonna go all wrong,
but I'm chilling.

693
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,040
I've put the ganache in
the freezer.

694
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,280
Otherwise all the ganache is
gonna get a bit splodgy.

695
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,520
Bakers, you have one hour.

696
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,640
There's a good chocolate whiff
in this area.

697
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,800
How many times have you checked?
I'm up to 450 now.

698
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,600
How do you feel about things,

699
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,080
probably been up since about four,
haven't you?

700
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,560
Yeah. Half three, I woke up.

701
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,320
Do you lie in bed sometimes thinking
about what you're gonna do?

702
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,400
I'm like, "Oh, my God
I can't switch off now," but...

703
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,240
Does it go better when you're
imagining it? Yes, every time.

704
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,320
Paul starts crying.

705
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,840
Yeah, yeah. Prue faints.

706
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,600
Worship me! I know.

707
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,280
I think I'll give the top one
a little poke.

708
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,400
Well, you want it, like,
quite light and airy.

709
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,320
There was an emphasis on
the word "moist."

710
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,800
It should come out with
a few crumbs attached.

711
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,880
Aye-aye.

712
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,640
Coming out clean...

713
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,880
..and aye-aye.

714
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,360
Gonna get them out. I'm doing it.

715
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,640
Reasonably happy with them.

716
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,760
They're looking OK.

717
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,520
They look OK. I mean, they're baked.

718
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,080
{\an1}SHE GASPS

719
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,960
It wouldn't be Bake Off without
somebody wafting one of these.

720
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,160
The most important thing is
to get chilled as quick as possible

721
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,400
so the ganache doesn't
just run all out of it.

722
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,760
Come on wind. Now, yes. This way.

723
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,440
I just put it in the fridge.

724
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,680
The amount of time I have is
very disconcerting.

725
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,120
I was not expecting my first
technical to go like this.

726
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,400
Just sitting about, looking at
bumblebees out the side of the tent.

727
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,960
Ah, it's lovely out there.

728
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,800
{\an8}Alison, would you like a sign name?

729
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,320
{\an8}I would love a sign name.

730
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,480
{\an8}Like, Alison?

731
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,720
{\an8}Alison? Yeah?

732
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,760
{\an8}I love it.

733
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,280
Have you got a sign name
for Paul Hollywood?

734
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,520
You have, haven't you?

735
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,640
What is it?

736
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,760
I have problems getting my words
out sometimes. Yeah.

737
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,280
I tried to say, "Paul Hollywood,"
and I came out with, "Pollywood."

738
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,680
Pollywood? Ha!

739
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,840
So now I call him Polly,

740
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,920
so, like, it's Polly like a parrot.

741
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,760
Polly.

742
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,400
This is Paul?

743
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,280
Little Polly. Polly, Paul.

744
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,920
I love it!
But you can't tell him!

745
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,240
I won't tell him, I promise.

746
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,520
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

747
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,400
"Assemble the cake,
sandwich in the sponges,

748
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,520
"and icing the cake with
a smooth coating of ganache."

749
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,760
The thing with ganache is that if
you put it on a warm cake...

750
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,000
..it will melt.

751
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,000
They're a little,
tiniest little bit warm.

752
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,280
If I was at home,
I'd have left them for an hour.

753
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,200
But I haven't got an hour, so gonna
have to roll with them, I think.

754
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,800
Wait till it's cold.

755
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,120
Five more minutes.

756
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,040
It would just be too warm.

757
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,840
This is the ganache
to sandwich the cake.

758
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,280
The ganache has set
a bit too much in the fridge.

759
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,520
Feel like I might even put my
ganache in the microwave.

760
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,080
It's curdling all of a sudden
and I don't know why.

761
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,880
It was fine and now it's split,
and I've been putting in

762
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,440
and out of the fridge
and maybe it's just not liked it.

763
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,960
I'm getting really impatient.

764
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,920
Especially when everyone else is,
like, cracking on as well.

765
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,480
PLANE WHIRRS
Guys, time is ticking.
You've got 15 minutes.

766
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,520
Can you hear that plane circling?
That's Paul Hollywood.

767
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,560
They're, like, room temperature.

768
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,280
Just going for it.

769
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,560
Silky smooth.

770
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,160
My beautiful ganache, which has
been perfect, has slightly split,

771
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,320
so I'm just gonna add in
a little bit of butter

772
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,880
and that should bring it back
into emulsion.

773
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,240
I can't remember if the
finish is straight-edged

774
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,200
or if it's got, like,
a full ripple to it.

775
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,040
It needs to be really,
really good because it's so iconic.

776
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,760
Yeah, you've gotta do the
cake justice, haven't you?

777
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,880
So determined for it not
to look like someone's sat on it.

778
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,480
OK, you've got
five minutes left, bakers.

779
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,480
Five minutes left? OK...

780
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,960
Onto the iconic raspberry.

781
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,800
Am I adding the missing raspberry?

782
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,320
{\an1}SHE GASPS

783
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,080
It doesn't say whether
to include the raspberry or not.

784
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,240
Raspberry, on or off? On. Yeah.

785
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,560
You're gonna replace the missing
raspberry? It needs to be done.

786
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,160
How many sleepless nights I've
had over that missing raspberry...

787
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,840
Really? Terrible.
Like, "Why did they do that?"

788
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,440
I know it's got one missing,
so I've left the perfect gap.

789
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,400
Got my one raspberry missing as well
in the middle.

790
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,880
I can't let myself
miss out a raspberry.

791
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,480
I've watched it for so many years.

792
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,680
Why? Where's that missing raspberry?

793
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,320
It's here.

794
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,240
It's here, you can put
it on if you want.

795
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,680
I'm not gonna do it for you.

796
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,080
OK bakers, one minute.

797
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,760
I've got wobbles.

798
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,840
Finito.

799
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,600
Quite pleased with it.
It's like on t'picture.

800
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,760
{\an8}Oh, God.

801
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,600
{\an8}Quick, shove it off.

802
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,920
{\an8}It's broken.

803
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,240
I am happy with it,
but it's just my ganache.

804
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,600
Quick, we can do this. Mend it.

805
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,080
Bakers, your time is up.

806
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,240
We're good. We're good. We're done.

807
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,640
Please bring your cakes
down to the front

808
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,800
and place them behind your
own photograph.

809
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,360
God, they look grand.
God, everyone's is beautiful.

810
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,840
Did you do a missing raspberry?

811
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,960
Yeah, did you? Yeah!

812
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,440
This is looking good, isn't it?

813
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,320
Yeah, they're good, aren't they?
So good.

814
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,760
{\an8}How dare they be this good
this quickly? I know!

815
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,800
Time to welcome the judges back in.

816
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,560
We've missed you, Prue. We have.

817
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,080
Paul and Prue are looking for
moist and light chocolate sponges,

818
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,320
coated in a perfectly set,
smooth and shiny ganache.

819
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,440
And they have no idea
whose is whose.

820
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,560
PAUL: It's going to be difficult,
I'm telling you now.

821
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,240
We will be nit picking.

822
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,760
Right, we'll start with this one.

823
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,320
Straight off, no shine.

824
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,800
It's messy round there as well.

825
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
But let's have a look inside.

826
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,760
Wow.

827
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,000
I can't believe we're
going to have to taste

828
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,160
12 of these chocolate cakes.

829
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,640
{\an1}LAUGHTER

830
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,520
That's a nice flavour.
It's a shame about the colour.

831
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,480
Moving on to number two.
Now, I like this.

832
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,280
The sharpness across the top.

833
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,560
That ganache, it has got a shine
and it is neat on the bottom.

834
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,080
It's a good-looking cake.
It's very clean. Let's have a look.

835
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,720
It's really good
chocolate fudge cake.

836
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,200
Wrong colour ganache.

837
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,960
The colour's too milky.

838
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,880
And messy.

839
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,840
Mm. Yeah, nicely made.

840
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,840
Moving on, they've taken
the wrong raspberry out.

841
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,160
That's the one. The missing
raspberry's at the edge. It is.

842
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,920
It's really beautiful cake.

843
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,520
Moving on to the next one,
you can see the crease.

844
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,320
It shouldn't look as if there are
two cakes in there. Should be one.

845
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,600
That ganache inside
is still very liquid.

846
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,040
This is a bit messy.

847
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,040
It's not bad, though,
cos it's a nice shine.

848
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,640
Nice sponge again.

849
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,560
The ganache is nearly there.

850
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,160
It's beautifully neat.
It has got a shine to it. Yeah.

851
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,160
That's a beautiful cake. It is.

852
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,560
This is the right colour.

853
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,920
But it's a bit matte, isn't it?

854
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,800
Mm, it's not as shiny as some.

855
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,880
Still a bit warm, that ganache.
Still liquid. Mm.

856
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,560
OK, moving on to this one.

857
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,680
You can definitely see
it's two cakes stacked.

858
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,960
It's got a waistband round it.

859
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,520
The ganache inside is still liquid.

860
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,120
I like the neatness of this.

861
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,120
Yeah, very clean, the sides
are absolutely straight.

862
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,080
Oh, hello. Ah, that looks good.

863
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,880
Good amount of ganache, and
it's solid as well. And it's set.

864
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,120
Moving on to the next one,

865
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,120
it's a little bit light,
a little bit matte.

866
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,520
Not quite set.

867
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,240
No, timing again.
Great taste though.

868
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,960
Doesn't look totally smooth,
the ganache. It's not light enough.

869
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,640
Looks a bit dense, doesn't it?

870
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,400
I know it is a fudge cake
but it's too fudgy.

871
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,760
Paul and Prue will now rank
the cakes from 12th to 1st place.

872
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,360
You can all obviously make
a good, big chocolate cake.

873
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,720
It's going to be tight.

874
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,560
In 12th place, we have this one.

875
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Who is this?

876
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,520
It's me. Dana, the texture's
a little bit dense.

877
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,720
In 11th spot, we have this one.

878
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,320
Tasha, the fat rim of chocolate
running around the middle

879
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,560
is the big problem.

880
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,640
And then in 10th place,
we have this one.

881
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,240
Nicky, it's a nice cake
but the colour's not right.

882
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,000
NOEL: Rowan is 9th,
Josh 8th, Matty is 7th,

883
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,120
Cristy 6th, Saku is 5th,
Keith is 4th and Abbi takes 3rd.

884
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,280
And then runner-up,
in second place...

885
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,640
..is this one. Who's that?

886
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,240
Amos, it's nice and shiny,
the cake is light,

887
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,600
ganache is set.

888
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,120
Don't have any complaints
about it at all.

889
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,040
The winner is Dan.

890
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,280
{\an1}APPLAUSE

891
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,000
That's a great looking cake.
Well done. Thank you very much.

892
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,440
Nice. Amazing. Really good.

893
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,080
I am pretty much on cloud nine,
to be honest.

894
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,000
So, so happy. I really am, yeah.

895
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,480
I don't really compare,
you know, having babies

896
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,360
to, uh, baking a good cake...

897
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,400
It's not disastrous.
I'll take better than last.

898
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,120
Coming last is not the nicest.

899
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,560
Oh, it's silly getting
emotional over it.

900
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,280
It's just cake,
at the end of the day.

901
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,320
My signature looked
like someone sat on it

902
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,400
and, coming 11th in
the technical, I'm not safe.

903
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,320
{\an8}Just one challenge remains
before we learn who will be

904
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,440
{\an8}our first Star Baker and
who will be leaving the tent.

905
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,920
{\an8}Class of 2023

906
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,440
are brilliant, aren't they?

907
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,720
Paul giving people hugs - what
the hell? What's happened? I know.

908
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,520
What's happened to you?
I don't know.

909
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,080
Did you have a breakdown?

910
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,680
Bit worrying, isn't it?

911
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,160
There's quite a few of them
in line for Star Baker.

912
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,840
Especially the lads.
Keith. Dan. Dan. They're strong.

913
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,680
Abbi's in that realm as well.
Cristy.

914
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,040
To be honest it's difficult
to rate them

915
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,800
because those technicals
were all beautiful.

916
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,760
Is that the closest technical
we've ever had?

917
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,400
There's almost nothing
to choose between them.

918
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,920
Dana, who was last in technical,
is always in a precarious position.

919
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,440
Tasha struggled a little bit
as well in both challenges.

920
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,760
I don't think Amos did massively
well in the signature.

921
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,400
But there's a huge bunch
that could possibly leave

922
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,000
after the Showstopper. I'm really...

923
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,680
How many are you
going to get rid of, Paul?

924
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,400
You know we're only
allowed to send one. Ten.

925
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,320
Morning, bakers. This is your
first Showstopper Challenge.

926
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,520
Prue and Paul would like you to
create an incredible cake,

927
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,480
shaped and decorated in the form
of an animal of your choosing.

928
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,080
Now, it could be anything from
a cat-tenberg to a...

929
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,440
Snake-well tart.

930
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,360
Now, you've got four hours for this.

931
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,880
On your marks. Get set. Bake!

932
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,240
I am so nervous.
I can't even cope right now.

933
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,440
So many elements going on here.
So many.

934
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,920
I'm concerned that
the cake itself could collapse.

935
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,840
I need to get this right.
I don't want to go home.

936
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,880
Now the bakers get
their first chance

937
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,360
to show off, to make a cake
that resembles an animal.

938
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,920
Because the animals are going to be
probably quite big,

939
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,560
they can use puffed rice
to create certain elements

940
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,000
but the main body has to be sponge.

941
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,040
I think there's a real danger
the bakers get so obsessed

942
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,760
with how their animal looks
that they'll forget

943
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,080
that it has to taste amazing.

944
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,280
If I was going to do
an animal cake...

945
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,840
Silverback gorilla.

946
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,440
Hello, Keith. Hello, Keith.
Morning, Paul. Morning, Prue.

947
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,000
How you doing, you all right?
Morning, Noel.

948
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,720
Tell us about your animal cake.

949
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,640
My animal cake is

950
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,280
a small poodle that
I'm a kind of step-father to.

951
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,360
{\an8}ALISON: Keith's 13-year-old
poodle, Maisie,

952
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,520
{\an8}will be built from lemon
and orange sponges

953
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,240
{\an8}and her ageing coat will be made

954
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,840
{\an8}with charcoal coloured
orange buttercream.

955
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,920
She's not a thing of rare beauty.

956
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,840
Are you trying to tell us
if your cake looks terrible,

957
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,960
it's just because she's old?
Get out clause.

958
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,400
You've seen straight
through me, Prue. Yes.

959
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,200
I am baking my dog, Gracie.

960
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,080
My little angel.

961
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,200
And it's going to be made
out of her favourite flavours -

962
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,480
banana and peanut butter.

963
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,600
I tell a lie - her favourite
flavours is chicken and beef

964
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,000
but I can't really
put that in a cake.

965
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,840
After a difficult first day,
Dana is hoping to avoid

966
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,960
the doghouse by adding
a cinnamon crumble

967
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,480
to her Gracie banana cake

968
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,680
filled with peanut buttercream.

969
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,440
I've practised this.

970
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,000
Let's just say it's a good thing
dogs love you unconditionally

971
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,120
cos she did not look herself.

972
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,960
Dana and Keith aren't the only ones
putting their faith

973
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,320
in a four-legged friend.

974
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,520
Is that your dog? Well, it was.
He went to sleep last month.

975
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,360
Aw. He was nearly 18, so he's 17,
so... Oh, wow. He did really well.

976
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,760
This is actually quite a lot of
pressure, really, to get this right.

977
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,880
It is a bit, yeah, yeah.

978
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,280
{\an8}Dan's planning to
immortalise his dog, Bruno,

979
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,000
{\an8}by decorating rich chocolate
sponges, layered with ganache

980
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,880
in a two-tone chocolate
French buttercream.

981
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,520
And his family have no idea.

982
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,720
So I practised the first one at home
and I put him in the fridge,

983
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,680
cos obviously I was trying to
hide it from everybody.

984
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,800
Unbeknown to my mum, she opened
the fridge door and went,

985
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,200
"What's Bruno doing in the fridge?"

986
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,360
So obviously my eldest then's
like, "What you on about?"

987
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,480
Charged over to the fridge,

988
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,920
obviously the dog's sat
in the fridge, isn't he?

989
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,240
Whilst the judges will
expect animal cakes

990
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,600
that are light and delicious...

991
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,040
Whoo. Ah.

992
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,760
..to avoid collapse, the bakers will

993
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,280
need to create sponge
that's just robust enough

994
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,520
to survive being carved
into a lifelike shape.

995
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,320
This is my very dense sponge

996
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,520
which is great for carving.

997
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,760
Dense sponge?

998
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,840
Yes.

999
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,840
Dense sponge is
not really appetising.

1000
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,600
But with the caramel,
that changes everything.

1001
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,280
ALISON: Amos aims to carve this
sturdy caramel sponges,

1002
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,160
sandwiched with apple buttercream,

1003
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,640
into a killer whale.

1004
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,960
Have you ever seen one in real life?

1005
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,360
Yes, I went to go and see one

1006
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,520
and the weather was too bad
so it got cancelled.

1007
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,200
No. So I've still yet to see them.

1008
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,320
We're going to see one today though.
You're going to see one today.

1009
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,600
Cristy's making a sponge
for an aquatic species

1010
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,600
that's a little easier to spot.

1011
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,880
I'm making a duck because,
when my eldest daughter, Ava,

1012
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,240
was younger, that's something
we used to do,

1013
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,400
always go to the pond
to feed the ducks.

1014
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,240
Cristy's sponges, made with
fresh and frozen raspberries,

1015
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,000
{\an8}will be sandwiched with raspberry

1016
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,320
{\an8}and almond liqueur jam

1017
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,640
{\an8}and then carved and decorated

1018
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,280
{\an8}to look like a mallard.

1019
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,080
Who's tasted this at home?
Oh, all of them.

1020
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,960
And what did they say? All the kids?

1021
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,680
Yeah, they... Did they love it?
It's my daughter's favourite sponge

1022
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,120
so they like it anyway but
they've seen the duck, yeah,

1023
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,480
I think they think I'm
losing my mind, to be honest.

1024
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,360
Cristy's duck won't be
alone on the river.

1025
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,480
My animal cake is a beaver.

1026
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,040
NOEL AND PRUE: A beaver?! A beaver.

1027
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,960
Why did you choose a beaver?

1028
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,920
I dressed up once as a beaver.

1029
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,280
I'm not even sure I know
what a beaver looks like so...

1030
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,440
{\an1}LAUGHTER

1031
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,160
Stop it!

1032
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,240
Quite sort of shapely.

1033
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,960
Nicky's future in the competition
rests on a chocolate and rum sponge

1034
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,840
sandwiched with a blackberry jam.

1035
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,600
And she's even given
her beaver a name.

1036
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,040
The lovely Norman.

1037
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,760
Norman the beaver?
Norman the beaver.

1038
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,240
You've won already.

1039
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,320
Congratulations. Well done.

1040
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,480
You got the shake.

1041
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,440
Thank you!

1042
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,200
Right they're going in.

1043
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,040
With multiple sponges
needed to create

1044
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,000
the building blocks
for their animals...

1045
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,840
Get in there. ..the bakers will
need to juggle batch baking...

1046
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,480
Bake well, little cakes.

1047
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,640
..as well as varying oven times.

1048
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,320
I'm baking them for...30 minutes.

1049
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,720
But Tasha has more
to juggle than anyone else.

1050
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,840
Six sponges.
Just a lot to deal with.

1051
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,320
They'll have to be OK -
I haven't got time to remake them.

1052
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,160
Tasha's six-sponge giant robin

1053
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,080
will have a dark chocolate
and ginger filling

1054
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,000
featuring another of
her unusual ingredients.

1055
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,080
Tahini?

1056
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,920
Tahini. Tahini. Love tahini.

1057
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,080
Tahini in a cake -
I've never had that.

1058
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,200
How big is it? Is it going to be
bigger than a robin, I presume?

1059
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,640
It's about that tall.

1060
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,240
Oh, big. Standing up or flying?

1061
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,040
It'll only be flying if it falls.

1062
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,640
To prevent their animal cakes
from falling,

1063
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,200
the bakers will need a filling

1064
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,440
that not only holds their
construction together...

1065
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,440
Got quite a thick ganache
so I can sort of set it

1066
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,440
and it stays quite rigid
when I carve it.

1067
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,840
..but that also complements
the flavours in their sponge.

1068
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,720
450g of peanut butter went in
my peanut butter frosting.

1069
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,120
Well, in my opinion, I think
it's quite subtle, the taste.

1070
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,200
This is my filling, buttercream.

1071
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,560
But it's just not tasting right
so I keep adding more tahini.

1072
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,240
Norman's coming to life
with a vanilla buttercream

1073
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,360
with some vanilla rum thrown in.

1074
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,440
A boozy beaver! That is the best.

1075
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,960
And Nicky's not the only one
hitting the bottle.

1076
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,800
I'm making a lobster.

1077
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,080
Flavours are inspired
by my favourite cocktail.

1078
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,800
Rowan's memories of seaside trips
when he was a boy

1079
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,640
will be recreated with a lobster

1080
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,160
that has the grown-up taste

1081
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,560
of a Cosmopolitan,

1082
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,840
with Valencian orange sponge,

1083
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,080
sharp lime curd

1084
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,640
and a cherry coulis.

1085
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,200
Paul and Prue yesterday
said my flavours were good,

1086
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,280
but intensify them, don't be scared.

1087
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,840
So I'm not.

1088
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,440
This just makes me want to
put vodka in it, to be honest.

1089
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,520
Bakers, you are halfway through.
You have two hours left.

1090
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,640
Hey, I'm happy.

1091
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,200
Boom.

1092
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,720
Oh, not ready.

1093
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,840
While some sponges are ready
to cool and then carve...

1094
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,800
They're browning
in spots on the top

1095
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,960
which is not what
they've ever done before.

1096
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,240
..Nicky and Amos
could be falling behind.

1097
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,840
And they're not alone.

1098
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,280
Tad bit under. Hurry up, cake.

1099
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,720
Saku needs to bake two huge orange
and poppy seed sponges

1100
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,480
for a sea turtle
that she's given a Sri Lankan name.

1101
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,200
Tikiri the turtle.
Tikiri is "little" in my language,

1102
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,320
as well as it is my husband
and my son's middle name.

1103
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,320
But they are
very big people for me.

1104
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,240
Just take these edges off...

1105
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,680
..before Paul sees.

1106
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,840
They are what they are.

1107
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,640
Lovely.

1108
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,520
Just need to start to
build up the body of the dog.

1109
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,240
This is my engineering background
hopefully coming into effect today.

1110
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,200
Never built many dogs -
that's the problem.

1111
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:13,000
So these need to cool down
the quickest they ever can.

1112
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,040
Whilst Amos could
finally be on his way

1113
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,920
to constructing a killer whale,

1114
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,400
Abbi has chosen
to build on dry land.

1115
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,080
I'm making a Herdwick sheep.
In fact, here he is.

1116
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,000
Herbet the Herdwick sheep
will be carved from ginger sponge,

1117
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,720
sandwiched with salted caramel
Italian meringue buttercream,

1118
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,240
rhubarb jam and
a hazelnut praline crunch.

1119
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,880
It's a very easy template
compared to some of

1120
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,000
the other bakers, cos
it's just a fat, round sheep.

1121
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,800
I'm just going to cut out some ovals

1122
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,960
and then stack them up
on top of each other.

1123
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,480
Grazing in the next field will be

1124
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,440
something a little
more complicated.

1125
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,040
That was just my little plan.

1126
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,280
I like precision with all
the weighing everything out.

1127
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,800
I said I'd do a cake for my mum.
This year she's 60.

1128
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,280
She said she'd like a highland cow
cos it's her favourite animal.

1129
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,080
We've got fluffy toys
and cushion covers

1130
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,920
and she's got mugs with it on.

1131
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,040
Josh's mum's highland cow
will be made with coffee,

1132
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,520
date and walnut sponges,

1133
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,280
filled with maple syrup caramel

1134
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,680
and cream cheese icing.

1135
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,560
I've got quite a stiff
filling for it

1136
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,240
because the head of
the cow is heavier

1137
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,560
and I didn't want to do
any sort of supports in there,

1138
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,880
I want to have it
as a free-standing cake.

1139
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,240
Amos is also hoping
to build his killer whale

1140
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,880
without any supports.

1141
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,600
# Be brave, Amos

1142
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,360
# As my mum would say. #

1143
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,840
But without support,

1144
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,000
the taller animal cakes
run the risk of extinction.

1145
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,720
We'll start to hold them
together with some dowels.

1146
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,360
I think it works.

1147
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,520
Today is no time to be scared.

1148
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,240
Oh, the buttercream's too soft.

1149
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,680
WHISPERS: The whole thing
is just moving.

1150
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,200
Stay, Bruno.

1151
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,760
Never did what he's told.

1152
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,640
{\an7}BLEEP

1153
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,240
{\an8}Amos' killer whale cake
is drowning in dense sponge

1154
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,000
{\an8}and melting buttercream.

1155
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,240
I'm just trying to prop it up
so it stays stiff in the fridge

1156
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,760
{\an8}so then eventually
I'll be able to carve it.

1157
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,760
Otherwise there's no whale.

1158
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,440
How's Free Willy going?

1159
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,720
It's all going wrong.

1160
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,080
If you want, I've got a black
and white sweatshirt -

1161
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,320
I'll be your killer whale.
Perfect. Please.

1162
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,960
I'll just sit cross-legged
on the wave.

1163
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,080
We can winch me in.

1164
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,360
Some bakers have planned
to build animal cakes

1165
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,160
with more than just
carved sponge and buttercream.

1166
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,080
I'm just making the head
out of modelling chocolate.

1167
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,320
It's a bit soft.

1168
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:41,160
Then I'm going to mix in puffed rice
to sculpt the sheep's head.

1169
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,400
This is for the turtle head.
It's very sticky.

1170
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,760
It is the stickiest
substance known to man.

1171
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,680
It's going to take you ages
to wash that off.

1172
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,480
June, I expect.

1173
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,360
Making Gracie's tennis ball.

1174
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,920
She doesn't know how to do catch,

1175
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,920
so I'll throw the ball, she'll
take it, won't bring it back.

1176
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,800
She'll just play with it
and then expect me to go get it.

1177
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,200
She's high status.

1178
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,360
She's a diva.

1179
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,160
This is the head and the legs.

1180
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,320
{\an1}SNORT-LAUGHING

1181
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,400
Can't you tell?

1182
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,920
There's just one hour remaining.

1183
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,000
Going to be tight.

1184
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,520
I should be assembling by now.

1185
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,640
Gee whizz, we'd better get cracking.

1186
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,640
I'm going to give it five minutes,

1187
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,320
and hopefully it will stiffen up.

1188
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,000
This is Herbert's head.

1189
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,800
Even if the bakers have completed
their basic animal structures...

1190
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,320
Just worried about my cake leaning.

1191
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,880
..Prue and Paul will be looking
for impressive decoration.

1192
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,320
I don't know if that's going
to freak out the judges.

1193
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,120
"Hi, Rowan, what have you made?"
A dead lobster.

1194
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,680
He's alive. Norman lives.

1195
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,080
This part's pretty difficult.

1196
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,560
Milk chocolate and dark
chocolate buttercream.

1197
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,920
Looks a bit like
a rogue animal at the moment.

1198
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,880
There'll be some tahini
in the buttercream as well,

1199
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,200
to pipe the feathers.

1200
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,560
ALISON: But before
he can pipe his finish...

1201
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,400
It's bad times, innit? Cos
everyone's already on their way.

1202
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,600
..Matty has had another issue
with buttercream.

1203
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,680
Oh, let me guess what you're making.

1204
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,840
For that colour,
are you making an elephant?

1205
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,040
It's supposed to be a black dog.

1206
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,240
Oh.

1207
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,040
Matty is attempting to recreate

1208
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,000
his family's cocker spaniel, Marty,

1209
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,080
with lemon sponges filled with
lemon curd and fresh raspberries

1210
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,920
{\an8}and a black coat made from
Swiss meringue buttercream.

1211
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,320
What you going to do? It's grey!

1212
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,360
We'll pretend he's not black.

1213
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,840
Have you got no more food colouring
that's black? Yeah, there is

1214
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,800
but, like, I don't want to spend
half an hour trying to get black.

1215
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,760
There are grey dogs out there.

1216
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,680
Thankfully.

1217
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,640
These are legs.
And that will be the head.

1218
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,840
I'll have to cover his head
in fondant.

1219
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,920
Not very thin, not very thick.

1220
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,280
{\an1}SHE LAUGHS

1221
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,120
ALISON: Fondant is heavy.

1222
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,040
This is always the nervy bit
for me just because

1223
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,680
once it's on you,
you're pretty much committed.

1224
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,560
Its weight can press down
on the sponge beneath...

1225
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,080
So, come in nice and tight.

1226
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,000
..making the cake dense and heavy.

1227
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,560
I'm just moulding in with my fingers
just the detail of her eyes.

1228
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,240
Something that Amos
is yet to worry about.

1229
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,120
Got carving to do
then I've got assembly.

1230
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,640
It's not going to be ready.

1231
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,280
I've run out of red buttercream...

1232
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,240
..which makes the front look messy

1233
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,960
and I know that's
going to annoy them.

1234
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,520
Come on, Norman. We can do this.

1235
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,320
Still got to buttercream
the whole thing.

1236
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,880
Painting bit is the hardest part.

1237
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,400
These are indentations,
I need to put green.

1238
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,280
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

1239
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,800
OK.

1240
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,560
So many wonderful
creatures out there.

1241
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,960
It's like Noel's Ark.

1242
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,760
I've got more like that.

1243
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,200
So I'm going to do, like,
an isomalt pond.

1244
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,160
So I've got a photograph of her
eyes, and then blown it up

1245
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,520
and then got it transferred
into edible paper.

1246
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,520
I just can't.

1247
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,760
Absolutely nothing
that can be done now.

1248
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,040
I'll just do some texture.

1249
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,120
I just need to keep on going.

1250
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,040
Several coats to go.

1251
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,000
Oh, God better get a shift on.

1252
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,320
Try and get some black on there

1253
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,840
but that's probably
going to weigh it down.

1254
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,480
Oh, my word.

1255
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,680
He does have a little face coming.

1256
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,960
I'm not done.
I just need... I need...

1257
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,440
I don't know what I need.

1258
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,480
I'd like to neaten him up a lot
but we are where we are.

1259
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,080
Try and make it look
somewhat pretty.

1260
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,160
Oh, he's so cute.

1261
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,280
Then the teeth.

1262
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,640
I'm now really worried. Time?

1263
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,280
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

1264
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,680
{\an1}SHE GASPS

1265
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,880
Got a dog over here.

1266
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,080
We're getting there.

1267
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,360
White chocolate spaghetti.

1268
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,200
Just got to try...
get the head done for her.

1269
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,560
One minute left.

1270
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,840
Come on, you can do this.

1271
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,080
We can give him a tail.

1272
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,960
Go on, Norms. Got it.

1273
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,520
Your time is up.

1274
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,840
This is awesome.

1275
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,400
Look at that robin.

1276
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,600
{\an1}HEAVY SIGH

1277
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,400
Piece of poo.

1278
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,440
{\an8}It's judgment time for
the show-stopping animal cakes.

1279
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,400
Cristy, would you like
to bring up your Showstopper?

1280
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,680
It's beautifully conceived.

1281
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,040
PAUL: I love the colours of it

1282
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,520
and I love that river
the duck's sitting on.

1283
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,760
This is isomalt lake.

1284
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,520
LOUD CRACK
Oh.

1285
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,040
You've broken his lake.

1286
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,560
Oh, that's beautiful.

1287
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,680
That is a raspberry cake.
Isn't that lovely?

1288
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,560
Oh, that's gorgeous, yeah.

1289
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,320
And the raspberry's really tart.

1290
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,240
It cuts through the sweetness
of the white chocolate.

1291
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,400
It hits the side of your... Yeah.

1292
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,440
It's lovely.
I must not eat any more of it.

1293
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,360
{\an8}This is Maisie. And she's

1294
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,200
bursting with excitement.

1295
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,560
Look at her little face.

1296
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,600
{\an1}LAUGHTER

1297
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,880
Rough and ready.

1298
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,040
She'd take that.

1299
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:35,480
She's made from lemon and orange
sponge cake with lemon buttercream.

1300
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,080
Far more elegant inside
than it is outside.

1301
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,600
Yes.

1302
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,360
Delicious.

1303
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,840
It's a straightforward cake
and you've got the right level

1304
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,760
of flavours
running through each layer.

1305
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,800
Not oversweet, just full of flavour,
so well done, Keith. Well done.

1306
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,160
It looks like it's been run over.

1307
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,280
{\an1}LAUGHTER

1308
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,600
Really nice cake.
I like the flavour of the filling.

1309
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,640
I've never seen
a spaniel that colour though.

1310
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,080
Me either.
LAUGHTER

1311
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,760
Oh, right, yeah.

1312
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,920
That's really impressive.
It's really good.

1313
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,240
It's orange sponge,

1314
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,720
lime curd and a cherry
Swiss meringue buttercream.

1315
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,040
It's almost tutti frutti,

1316
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,480
where you've got several
flavours all in one

1317
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,800
and you can't identify any of them.

1318
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,800
Mm, yeah, I know, I was
struggling with what it was.

1319
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,240
But it is delicious. It is nice.

1320
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,280
It's astonishing to look at.

1321
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,720
It's just beautiful.
It's so accurate. It's amazing.

1322
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,800
That could be turtle shell.

1323
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,320
This is orange and poppy seed cake

1324
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,840
with orange buttercream.

1325
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,360
It's quite stodgy.

1326
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,000
Mm. And it's overbaked
quite dramatically.

1327
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,040
I think this is a classic case
of style over substance.

1328
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,120
He's totally adorable.

1329
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,960
Let's see how he tastes.

1330
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,360
Sorry. Oh! Aw!

1331
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,880
Cake looks great.

1332
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,240
Rich chocolate with milk
chocolate ganache

1333
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,520
and milk chocolate
and dark chocolate buttercream.

1334
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,880
Buttercream on the outside
goes beautifully with the chocolate,

1335
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,680
so the whole thing is very moreish.

1336
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,800
Mm, and very, very intense.

1337
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,240
I think you've done Bruno
very proud.

1338
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,800
Oh, brilliant. Yeah, I think so.
Amazing. Thank you.

1339
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,240
It's charming,

1340
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,560
and I love the way one of her eyes
is completely gone with the fringe.

1341
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,760
The coffee and the date work well

1342
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,240
but there's quite
a lot of buttercream in this.

1343
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,600
Quite flat here. What happened?

1344
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,400
Um, she's quite a flat dog.
LAUGHTER

1345
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,320
She is - she doesn't have
much body to her.

1346
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,840
I need to feed her a bit more.

1347
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,160
It's banana cake topped
with a cinnamon crumble

1348
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,160
and with peanut butter
frosting in between.

1349
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,000
That's a strong peanut, that.

1350
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,800
The peanut's quite dominant.

1351
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,160
I'm not getting any banana.

1352
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,360
I think less peanut
would've been better.

1353
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,520
Go on, Gracie.

1354
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,080
She'll love you!

1355
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,480
You can eat that now, Dan.

1356
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,240
Straight off, it looks great.

1357
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,360
It's got real character to it
in the face.

1358
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,920
Paul is now going to
cut his head off I dare say.

1359
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,400
I'll go into its rear quarter.

1360
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,800
He is a ginger sponge,
salted caramel buttercream,

1361
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,800
rhubarb jam, a hazelnut brittle

1362
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,640
and then black sesame buttercream.

1363
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,640
The rhubarb jam is excellent
and so is the cake.

1364
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,320
You've got a sharpness
from that rhubarb,

1365
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,800
so the ginger and the rhubarb marry,

1366
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,960
and then you have that
hazelnut which is delicious.

1367
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,040
With a bit of crunch.
You've done a really good job, Abbi.

1368
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,640
Thank you very much.

1369
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,360
Amos, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

1370
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,000
PAUL: You can see what it is.

1371
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,360
It's a shame everything's
sort of slipped slightly.

1372
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,760
Caramel sponge and then
we have an apple buttercream.

1373
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,800
Your cake looks a little doughy,
as if it's become compressed.

1374
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,720
It's tough as old boots.

1375
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,880
And on top of that, you've got the
weight of everything going round it

1376
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,520
so it's concertinaed up.

1377
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,560
It's bone dry as well.

1378
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,080
Because you've kept it in the oven.

1379
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:54,280
Very stodgy, oversweet.

1380
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,200
Not your best day.

1381
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,800
Not in the slightest.

1382
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,400
Nicky, can you bring your
Showstopper up, please?

1383
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,560
Here we go, Norman.

1384
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,760
So, Nicky,
tell us about your beaver.

1385
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,080
{\an1}LAUGHTER

1386
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,440
All right, I'll try again.

1387
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,320
So, Nicky, tell us about
your Showstopper.

1388
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,440
Norman is made out
of chocolate cake.

1389
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,080
He's got a blackberry jam

1390
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,600
and he's got a chocolate ganache

1391
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,080
that's got some rum in it.

1392
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:38,080
Straight out of a cartoon,
isn't he? Yes, it's beautiful.

1393
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:41,160
Very heavy on the fondant on
the outside, really thick.

1394
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,040
It's quite a solid cake, Nicky.

1395
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,960
Do you think you overbaked it?

1396
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,400
A little, but... A lot. A lot.

1397
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,400
Texture's all wrong, unfortunately.

1398
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,040
It is solid

1399
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:02,080
and it shouldn't be bone dry.
It's a real shame.

1400
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,160
Tasha, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

1401
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,320
That is incredible.

1402
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,440
Thank you.

1403
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,560
It's sensational.

1404
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,040
The pipework, the colour,
the stance,

1405
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,120
you know instantly what it is.

1406
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,640
This robin has personality.

1407
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,560
So I've made a tahini sponge

1408
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,240
with a chocolate, ginger
and tahini buttercream.

1409
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,920
I think of tahini
as a savoury flavour

1410
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,320
and this is a cake,

1411
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,520
and it's not too savoury
and it's not too sweet -

1412
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,000
it's just very delicious.

1413
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,560
I don't like that, Tasha.

1414
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,800
I love it.

1415
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,480
PRUE LAUGHS
God, what a relief.

1416
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,120
I thought I was going to
have my first big battle

1417
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,480
with Paul Hollywood on Bake Off

1418
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,400
because I would've gone to the wall
to defend you if he meant it.

1419
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,160
I love the flavour of the tahini.

1420
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,640
And actually, the tahini
with the chocolate,

1421
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,840
you've got a nice balance
between the two.

1422
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,360
And it's such a big cake.

1423
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,840
That's a lot of work in that.

1424
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,560
I think you've done
a fantastic job.

1425
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,000
Thank you so much.

1426
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:43,400
Wow! That was so much better
than I could've ever imagined.

1427
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,120
It's a complete disaster.

1428
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,320
Where do I rank?

1429
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,560
Bottom?

1430
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,600
Literally praying to all
the gods out there,

1431
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,840
fingers and toes crossed.

1432
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,800
I would be over the moon
if I was here next week.

1433
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:59,120
But it would also be a shock.

1434
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:04,280
So it's been Alison's
first week in the tent.

1435
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,280
It's been lovely. Slotted right in.
I love our bakers as well.

1436
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,400
I really don't want to see
anyone go today.

1437
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,120
Dan's done very well again.

1438
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,360
And Cristy.
And I think Abbi has as well.

1439
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,560
Abbi's done really well.

1440
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,920
But it is going to be tricky
to decide who's going to go home.

1441
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,520
For instance, Amos. Yeah.

1442
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,560
When you looked at his orca,
the problem was it was so dense.

1443
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:26,080
So I think it automatically puts
Amos in a very difficult position.

1444
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,200
I have to put Dana
into that position.

1445
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,240
The peanut overwhelmed everything.

1446
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,960
There is somebody else who struggled
over the last couple of days.

1447
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,160
Which would be Nicky. Was Nicky.

1448
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,520
Her beaver looked amazing
but it was bone dry.

1449
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:39,760
Yeah. I don't like dry beavers,
do you?

1450
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,120
Hate dry beavers.
Am I in a Carry On film?

1451
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,360
Look, stop this.

1452
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,560
Congratulations, Bakers -

1453
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,720
you've got to the end of Cake Week.

1454
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:06,800
Now, I've got the lovely job of
announcing Star Baker of the week.

1455
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,120
The first Star Baker is...

1456
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,440
..D to the A to the N,
you know it's Dan!

1457
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:19,920
Congratulations.

1458
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,320
Unfortunately, that leaves me
with such a horrible job

1459
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,640
cos it's the first week,
and we're just getting to know you,

1460
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,080
but sadly someone does have to go.

1461
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,080
And that person is...

1462
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,280
..Amos. I'm sorry.

1463
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,560
{\an1}INDISTINCT

1464
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,040
Sorry, mate. You did a good job.

1465
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,560
It was obviously the Showstopper
that stopped my show.

1466
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:58,120
As soon as I heard my name,
I came out of my body.

1467
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,960
Sorry. I'm fine. Sorry.

1468
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,160
You were amazing.
Thank you. Thanks very much.

1469
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,520
NICKY: I'm shocked that I'm here

1470
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,680
and I'm really, really sad for Amos.

1471
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:27,800
What a warm-hearted,
lovely man he is.

1472
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:31,800
Tomorrow, what you'll remember
is you got into Bake Off.

1473
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,440
It's been amazing being in
that group of people, walking in

1474
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:39,760
that tent on that first day and it's
softening the blow a little bit.

1475
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,480
Well done, Dan. Oh, thank you
so much. You were so good.

1476
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:47,280
Just surreal. Surreal, honestly.
The dog did us proud.

1477
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,320
And he won me Star Baker,
so nice one, Bruno.

1478
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,760
ABBI: I'm really pleased for Dan.

1479
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,200
They say that you're going to
be like a family and I was like,

1480
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,240
"No," but actually, like, you are.

1481
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,160
The thought of losing just one
of these people is devastating.

1482
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,920
The thought that we're all
going to, one by one,

1483
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:04,160
drop off is like, oh, my goodness.

1484
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,440
Next time...

1485
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,640
Oh, hurry up.

1486
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,480
..the bakers brace for biscuits.

1487
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,080
Very concerned about this.

1488
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,360
With a sticky signature...

1489
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,880
I don't think it would
be this messy.

1490
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,000
..a tricky technical...

1491
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,600
I don't know when they're
going to be ready.

1492
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,920
..and a mind-bending illusion
biscuit Showstopper...

1493
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,440
Chuffing heck. This is so realistic.

1494
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,120
..who will take the biscuit..

1495
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,080
It's absolutely delicious. It is.

1496
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,120
..and whose cookie...
Cristy?

1497
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,600
..will finally crumble?

1498
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,960
Have you used my biscuit dough?

1499
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,880
SHE GASPS
You have!

1500
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,480
Are you a Star Baker in the making?
