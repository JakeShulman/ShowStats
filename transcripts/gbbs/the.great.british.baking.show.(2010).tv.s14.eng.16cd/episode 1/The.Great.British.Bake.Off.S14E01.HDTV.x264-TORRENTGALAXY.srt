1
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:25,138
Don Paul-eone.

2
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:29,538
Is it done?

3
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,418
I put a loaf of bread in his bed.

4
00:00:31,443 --> 00:00:32,898
Good, he won't sleep for weeks.

5
00:00:32,923 --> 00:00:35,658
Crumbs in the bed are a nightmare.

6
00:00:35,683 --> 00:00:38,458
I have news.
A new addition to the family.

7
00:00:40,963 --> 00:00:42,778
Breadfather.

8
00:00:45,803 --> 00:00:48,338
It's day one of series 14.

9
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:50,938
Why has it taken so long
to come to see me?

10
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:52,738
I don't mean to brag, Breadfather,

11
00:00:52,763 --> 00:00:54,018
but I've been very busy.

12
00:00:54,043 --> 00:00:56,618
Daytime TV, hosting the Baftas

13
00:00:56,643 --> 00:00:58,938
and I was in a Stormzy video.

14
00:00:58,963 --> 00:01:02,138
He's a Grime artist.

15
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:04,658
The Breadfather often says
that joining this family

16
00:01:04,683 --> 00:01:06,618
is like making
the perfect loaf of bread.

17
00:01:06,643 --> 00:01:10,418
In order to rise, you first have
to prove.

18
00:01:10,443 --> 00:01:11,578
Someone call?

19
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:13,498
No, no, I said prove, not Prue.

20
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:15,338
My mistake.

21
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:18,138
What do you say, Breadfather,
is she in?

22
00:01:18,163 --> 00:01:20,738
Welcome to the family. Yes!

23
00:01:20,763 --> 00:01:22,058
Do you want to do the honours?

24
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,258
Welcome to The Great British Bake
Off.

25
00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:26,258
Thank you.

26
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:29,178
Are you eating dough balls again?

27
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:31,578
They're stuck
to the inside of my cheeks!

28
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:38,618
I don't really know how
I got here?

29
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:39,778
Feel like I'm a bit lost.

30
00:01:42,243 --> 00:01:44,538
You know you can do experience days?

31
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,458
It feels like I'm on one of them.

32
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:48,698
I'm really terrified.

33
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:54,938
Thousands of amateur bakers
from across Britain applied.

34
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:56,818
I had success at my village show.

35
00:01:56,843 --> 00:01:58,858
And that made me think,
"Give it a shot".

36
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:01,218
You know, what's
the worst that can happen?!

37
00:02:01,243 --> 00:02:04,218
12 have made it
to the Bake Off tent.

38
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:06,018
Is this really happening?

39
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,618
My little tum is going
like a washing machine.

40
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:14,378
Over the next ten weeks, they'll
face 30 brand-new challenges.

41
00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:18,418
I'm thinking one week at a time,
one bake at a time.

42
00:02:18,443 --> 00:02:20,698
If it goes wrong,
we'll just key Paul's car.

43
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:25,698
Every aspect of their baking skill
will be tested.

44
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:29,218
I was not expecting my
first technical to go like this!

45
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:32,018
And everything they bake
will be judged by Prue Leith...

46
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:33,738
That is the cutest little cake.

47
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:35,018
...and Paul Hollywood.

48
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:37,338
It looks like it's been run over!

49
00:02:37,363 --> 00:02:40,058
I feel like I'll just get lost
in Paul's eyes, to be honest.

50
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,938
We'll have to keep
it PG, unfortunately.

51
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,378
I can't see.

52
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:45,738
Each week,

53
00:02:45,763 --> 00:02:48,098
those that rise
will be crowned Star Baker.

54
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:50,418
Can you believe it?! Yes.
This is huge!

55
00:02:50,443 --> 00:02:52,378
Stop ramping up the pressure!

56
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:53,618
Those that crumble...

57
00:02:53,643 --> 00:02:55,498
Baking for my life.

58
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:56,778
...will leave the tent.

59
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:57,938
It's lovely out there.

60
00:02:57,963 --> 00:02:59,938
But who will go on to win?

61
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:02,258
Why this is doing to me?

62
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,138
It's gonna take you ages
to wash that off.

63
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:05,458
You're putting me off my stride!

64
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:07,818
The Great British Bake Off.

65
00:03:07,843 --> 00:03:10,098
So, Nicky, tell us
about your beaver.

66
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:40,058
It's cake week, and,
after three challenges,

67
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,378
we'll crown our first Star Baker

68
00:03:42,403 --> 00:03:44,738
but one baker will
have to leave the tent.

69
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,658
Hello, bakers. Welcome,
lovely to see you all.

70
00:03:51,683 --> 00:03:53,138
Welcome to the tent.

71
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:55,538
Now, before we start,
I know what you're thinking.

72
00:03:55,563 --> 00:03:57,898
Things look a little bit
different this year.

73
00:03:57,923 --> 00:04:00,418
That's right - Paul's
had his beard reshaped.

74
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:02,938
I think it's a triumph, personally.

75
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:05,298
Also, we have a new host,

76
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:07,218
so let's welcome
to the tent Alison.

77
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:10,378
Thanks, Noel. Hi, everyone!

78
00:04:10,403 --> 00:04:12,738
I am so excited
to be joining the show and,

79
00:04:12,763 --> 00:04:15,978
I'm just thrilled to meet you
bakers. It's lovely to see you all.

80
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:18,738
Also, can I introduce you to Daryl,

81
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:21,498
a BSL interpreter
for one of the bakers?

82
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:24,178
Welcome to the tent.
Thank you.

83
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:27,538
It's time for your first-ever
Signature Challenge.

84
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:31,298
The judges would like you
to make a vertical layer cake.

85
00:04:31,323 --> 00:04:34,858
Now, the judges are looking
for perfectly baked sponge

86
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:38,778
which will be rolled with
a filling so that, when sliced,

87
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:42,578
it will reveal neat,
vertical layers.

88
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:44,098
You've got two hours.

89
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:46,018
This is the bit you're most looking
forward to, isn't it?

90
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:47,218
I can't wait. Let me get ready.

91
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:48,978
Shall we hold hands?
OK, let's do it together.

92
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:50,538
You wanna kick it off? Yeah.

93
00:04:50,563 --> 00:04:51,618
On your marks...

94
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:52,658
...Get set...

95
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:54,218
...Bake!

96
00:04:54,243 --> 00:04:56,978
That was amazing.

97
00:04:57,003 --> 00:04:58,418
Hoo-hoo!

98
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:01,178
It's actually happening!

99
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:04,138
Just trying to process it all
at the moment, to be honest.

100
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:05,818
It's just a mad experience.

101
00:05:05,843 --> 00:05:08,378
I am baking for my life. Ha-ha!

102
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:11,898
How long have we got left?

103
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:15,058
I've only just started
but I'm already panicking.

104
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,778
Vertical layered cake.

105
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:20,138
It's a bit like
a Swiss roll standing up.

106
00:05:20,163 --> 00:05:23,098
So, you cut into it, you
see these very strong lines.

107
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:26,178
We want cleanly defined
vertical layers of cake,

108
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:28,858
filling, cake, filling, cake.

109
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:31,178
We expect a bit of height
to these cakes.

110
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:32,498
Colour, plenty of flavours.

111
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:34,418
Now if the bakers say
“I've got apple in here,

112
00:05:34,443 --> 00:05:35,778
“I've got pineapple in there,

113
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:38,218
“I've got lemon in there,"
I wanna taste it.

114
00:05:38,243 --> 00:05:40,098
If the bakers don't
get their cakes

115
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:43,538
into the oven in time, get them out,
get them cool before they fill them

116
00:05:43,563 --> 00:05:46,138
and decorate them, then
they're going to be too warm.

117
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:48,498
They will lose shape,
they'll slump

118
00:05:48,523 --> 00:05:50,858
or we'll have
a complete disaster.

119
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,178
Morning, Rowan.
How are you doing?

120
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:54,738
My gosh! It's real. Hello.

121
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:56,058
What are you gonna be making?

122
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,418
I am making chocolate
and raspberry vertical cake.

123
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:01,378
It's inspired by a birthday cake
I made for my 21st

124
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,698
which was actually a wedding cake.

125
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:05,418
21-year-old Rowan
from West Yorkshire

126
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:07,018
is this year's youngest baker

127
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:09,378
and is studying English
at university.

128
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:11,778
Put it back in the right place
or the librarian'll kill you.

129
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:15,258
His vertical wedding cake will see
dark chocolate sponge wrap around

130
00:06:15,283 --> 00:06:17,298
a raspberry Swiss butter cream.

131
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:21,858
You had a wedding cake for your
21st birthday? Yeah. I love you.

132
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,618
It's because you're worth it,
isn't it, babes?

133
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:26,178
That's the thing. Self-love.

134
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:29,778
Whilst Rowan plans to tie
the knot with himself...

135
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:31,458
Nervous as anything.

136
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:35,018
...Nicky's aiming to marry
two classic flavours.

137
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:36,978
It's a orange and lemon cake

138
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:41,018
because myself and my sister
used to play a skipping game to

139
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:44,498
"Oranges and lemons
sing the bells of St Clement's."

140
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:45,978
Nicky grew up in Dundee

141
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:49,618
and after a career in the skies,
she"s landed in the West Midlands,

142
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,938
close to her granddaughters
Edie and Matilda.

143
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:53,978
En garde! Hai!

144
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:55,938
She hopes to take off
in the competition with

145
00:06:55,963 --> 00:06:57,858
a blood orange Swiss roll sponge,

146
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:01,138
lemon curd and an orange
and rosemary syrup.

147
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:02,698
Cabin crew.

148
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,658
Does that mean you're gonna present
all your bakes

149
00:07:04,683 --> 00:07:07,778
on a little rectangle tray?!

150
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,378
There you go, Paul.
Drop it down.

151
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:11,258
Paul, put your seat belt
on and try this!

152
00:07:12,763 --> 00:07:16,018
Dan's also hoping to land
a British classic.

153
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:18,618
I'm doing a rhubarb
and custard cake today,

154
00:07:18,643 --> 00:07:20,458
with rhubarb out of my garden.

155
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,938
Dan is a resources planner
and lives in Cheshire

156
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:25,458
with his wife Natalie
and sons Sam and Rory.

157
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:26,498
Rory.

158
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:28,378
As well as growing rhubarb

159
00:07:28,403 --> 00:07:31,018
he's recently begun
brewing his own beer.

160
00:07:31,043 --> 00:07:32,778
Tastes absolutely awful.

161
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:35,978
He'll add fresh rhubarb compote
to his filling

162
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:39,018
and cover his cake
in cream cheese icing.

163
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:40,178
What about decoration?

164
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:41,658
I've poached some rhubarb slices

165
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:43,978
and they're just gonna go round
the outside,

166
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:44,858
so it's very pink and very me.

167
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:46,778
Good luck, mate.
Thank you very much.

168
00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:48,738
I just wanna tell you
one little thing.

169
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:49,818
I don't like rhubarb,

170
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:52,178
so please don't take of fence
if I don't eat it.

171
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:54,818
I'm gonna win you over.
Honestly, I'll win you over!

172
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:56,458
It derives from Jaffa Cake

173
00:07:56,483 --> 00:07:58,898
which I used to have all the time
as a kid.

174
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:02,418
So the main stars are the dark
chocolate and the blood orange.

175
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:05,258
Amos is a delicatessen manager
from Nottingham

176
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:07,938
and still bakes
with his mum, Antoinette.

177
00:08:07,963 --> 00:08:11,778
His vertical Jaffa Cake features
blood orange and dark chocolate

178
00:08:11,803 --> 00:08:13,818
in two contrasting decorative drips.

179
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:17,178
There's blood orange flavour in
the actual sponge, as well.

180
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:19,098
I think I'm going
a bit ahead of myself

181
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,898
so I need to slow down, maybe.

182
00:08:20,923 --> 00:08:23,178
That's what my mum always says -
"Slow down."

183
00:08:25,123 --> 00:08:27,938
The judges are expecting
a light, fluffy sponge

184
00:08:27,963 --> 00:08:31,018
but it still needs
to be flexible enough to roll.

185
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:35,578
I've gone for a classic Swiss roll
recipe, really. Nothing fancy!

186
00:08:35,603 --> 00:08:38,098
But not everyone's gone
for a classic.

187
00:08:38,123 --> 00:08:40,418
I'm making a genoise sponge

188
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:43,698
because I always see genoise
on Bake Off.

189
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:47,418
It's just a Swiss roll on its end.

190
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,458
And I can't help but think...

191
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:50,858
...why?

192
00:08:56,363 --> 00:08:57,458
Tasha lives in London

193
00:08:57,483 --> 00:08:59,978
and, before working for
a children's charity,

194
00:09:00,003 --> 00:09:02,458
she was a ski instructor in Japan.

195
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,418
She'll attempt to roll her black
sesame genoise sponge around

196
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:09,338
a sharp lime and yuzu curd.

197
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:10,538
Are you happy?

198
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:12,378
No. I'm looking round

199
00:09:12,403 --> 00:09:15,578
and everyone else has gone
for a more robust sponge.

200
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:17,938
Just don't look into
Paul's eyes, that's all.

201
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:20,258
He's tried standing there, like,
several times now

202
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:21,378
and I've just been a bit like...

203
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:23,778
What was his face like?
I don't wanna do an impression,

204
00:09:23,803 --> 00:09:26,698
but I kind of do. Yeah, go on -
do an impression of Paul.

205
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:33,738
That's it! That's it! It's perfect.

206
00:09:33,763 --> 00:09:36,658
The thin sponge for
a vertical layer cake

207
00:09:36,683 --> 00:09:39,658
bakes in a matter of minutes.
wish me luck.

208
00:09:39,683 --> 00:09:41,378
A fraction too long in the oven

209
00:09:41,403 --> 00:09:43,658
and it will crack
as soon as it's rolled.

210
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,738
But for his giant
wedding cake...

211
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:52,098
...Rowan will need to perfectly bake
three sponges at the same time.

212
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:53,778
We'll make it work.

213
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:55,218
Do you think that'll work?

214
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:57,538
And Cristy is aiming just as high.

215
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:01,338
Try and get 'em all in
at the same time.

216
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:04,858
I'm making a lemon meringue, like,
vertical cake

217
00:10:04,883 --> 00:10:09,258
so sort of based on my mum's
lemon meringue recipe.

218
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:12,618
Cristy grew up in East London with
her dad Rod and her mum Michelle.

219
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:15,498
She now has four children
of her own and works as a PA.

220
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:18,178
Her sponge,
curd and butter cream will feature

221
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:20,098
three different types of lemon.

222
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:24,418
Limoncello, lemon juice, lemon zest.

223
00:10:24,443 --> 00:10:25,578
If they don't taste the lemons

224
00:10:25,603 --> 00:10:28,298
then I don't know what
the hell I've done wrong.

225
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:30,698
Saku is also planning
a family favourite.

226
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:34,338
I am making lemon
and blueberry vertical layer cake.

227
00:10:34,363 --> 00:10:35,778
Have you made it before?

228
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:39,018
Several times. This is
my husband's favourite cake.

229
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:41,578
Saku is an intelligence analyst
and lives in Hereford

230
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:43,898
where she plays for
a local cricket team

231
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:45,658
started by her daughter, Therindi.

232
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:47,458
Shot.
Shot.

233
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:50,338
Her cake will feature
a sharp lemon cream cheese icing

234
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:51,898
and blueberry butter cream.

235
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:54,618
Blueberry often
has very pale flavour.

236
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:57,738
Are you adding essence or anything
to boost it up a bit?

237
00:10:57,763 --> 00:10:59,698
I made a blueberry reduction

238
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:01,698
so I am using that
to the butter cream.

239
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:04,458
I love the idea of the flavours.
They do sound very good.

240
00:11:04,483 --> 00:11:06,298
Are you a little bit nervous?

241
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:08,618
Lot nervous!
Awww!

242
00:11:08,643 --> 00:11:11,338
Here you are, come here, come here.

243
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:12,858
Thank you very much.

244
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:15,178
Is that better? Is that better?
That's really better. Yes.

245
00:11:15,203 --> 00:11:17,138
Yeah? Much better. OK.

246
00:11:17,163 --> 00:11:20,298
You'll be fine, then. Thank you,
Paul. Thank you very much. Aww!

247
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:23,058
Good luck.
Thank you!

248
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,778
Can you believe it?!

249
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:27,298
Yes! Made my day.

250
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:29,618
I am making chocolate orange cake

251
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:31,898
in honour of my father, really.

252
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,178
He served in the Second World War

253
00:11:34,203 --> 00:11:35,818
and he was a prisoner of war.

254
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:38,138
Because he was on starvation rations

255
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:40,578
I think he became
quite indulgent after that

256
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:43,298
so he'd be stocking up
on Christmas chocolates

257
00:11:43,323 --> 00:11:45,378
from about October onwards.

258
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:47,898
Keith is a chartered accountant
and lives in Hampshire

259
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:50,258
with his partner Sue
and their poodle, Maisie.

260
00:11:50,283 --> 00:11:51,938
Maisie, give us the ball.

261
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:56,098
He's making a ganache by melting
his dad's favourite chocolate

262
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:57,818
and he's adding a little extra touch

263
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,338
to his whipped cream filling
for someone else.

264
00:12:00,363 --> 00:12:02,698
I've put some orange liqueur
in there.

265
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,658
And, normally, you put a bit less
than the recipe suggests.

266
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,258
But I'm not sure
that dialling down the booze

267
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:10,298
is gonna float Prue's boat, is it?

268
00:12:10,323 --> 00:12:12,538
Should've gone way over!

269
00:12:14,123 --> 00:12:15,858
It's time for your first-ever
time call.

270
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:17,738
Can I do it? Is that all right?
Yes, of course.

271
00:12:17,763 --> 00:12:21,658
You don't mind? I'll just support
you while you do it. Thank you.

272
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:25,698
Bakers, you're halfway through.
You have one hour left.

273
00:12:25,723 --> 00:12:28,018
I don't even need to be here
any more. You got this.

274
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:30,018
No, don't! Come back, come back!

275
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:31,778
Cake out time, no going back.

276
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:35,338
Time and heat are now
the bakers' two biggest worries.

277
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:37,298
Can't see a thing!

278
00:12:38,803 --> 00:12:40,058
I can't see.

279
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,898
The sooner they can begin
cooling their sponges...

280
00:12:41,923 --> 00:12:44,218
I think that's done.

281
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:46,538
...the less chance
their vertical layer cakes

282
00:12:46,563 --> 00:12:48,138
will collapse when filled.

283
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:50,778
OK, my top one's gonna come out.
My other two aren't.

284
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,178
Really happy. So far!

285
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:56,898
Think my sponges aren't done.

286
00:12:56,923 --> 00:13:00,418
One of them's done really well and
then the bottom one has just sunk.

287
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:05,098
Tasha's gamble on a genoise sponge
doesn't seem to be paying off.

288
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:06,738
It's all tipped over the...

289
00:13:06,763 --> 00:13:08,378
I know why.

290
00:13:08,403 --> 00:13:11,138
Tasha, you're an idiot. OK.

291
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:13,458
I used the wrong rack,

292
00:13:13,483 --> 00:13:16,698
so it's tilted all
the mixture to one side.

293
00:13:16,723 --> 00:13:20,498
It means that some of the layers
won't be the same thickness.

294
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:22,058
But I'm not gonna tell them that!

295
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:25,418
So now I'm just rolling up my sponge

296
00:13:25,443 --> 00:13:27,058
then I'm gonna quickly
get it chilled,

297
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:31,458
so that whilst they're cooling
they've got a nice rolled-up shape.

298
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:34,898
Result! Ha-ha! Get in.

299
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,938
So wonky. I can work around it.

300
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:40,218
I think.

301
00:13:40,243 --> 00:13:41,898
The bakers need to use every minute

302
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:43,738
that their rolled sponges
are cooling

303
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:47,218
to perfect the fillings that will
sandwich their vertical layers.

304
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:51,778
Blueberry butter cream.

305
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:54,898
Yes, lovely!

306
00:13:54,923 --> 00:13:57,898
In with rhubarb creme pat, just
putting some custard powder in it

307
00:13:57,923 --> 00:14:00,978
to give it that proper, authentic
retro rhubarb and custard flavour

308
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:04,738
cos we didn't really have creme
pat when I was a kid. Sorry, Mum!

309
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:06,538
For their filling,
one baker has gone

310
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:08,898
a little further
than their back garden.

311
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:11,298
I'm using as much, like,
foraged stuff as I can

312
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:14,018
so they're wild blackcurrants
and wild poppy seeds.

313
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:16,058
Wild poppy seeds are unusual.

314
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,018
When Abbi isn't working at
an organic farm in Cumbria

315
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:22,378
she forages for ingredients
to add to her home baking.

316
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,738
And a little slug. Just give it
a little wash before we use it.

317
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:28,658
As well as the poppy seeds
and blackcurrants for her sponge

318
00:14:28,683 --> 00:14:32,578
and butter cream, Abbi has also
foraged for her decoration.

319
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:35,538
Those are gorse petals. Did you
forage these as well? I did.

320
00:14:35,563 --> 00:14:39,058
It must feel so nice when you forage
your own fruit and veg.

321
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,418
Yeah, definitely. And then you make
your own cakes.

322
00:14:41,443 --> 00:14:42,858
It's lovely, isn't it?
Absolutely, yeah.

323
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,578
When I hear some of the flavour
combinations, I'm like, wow.

324
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:47,058
Where have you thought of that?

325
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,978
It's a take on a tiramisu,

326
00:14:49,003 --> 00:14:52,858
so it's a coffee cake
with coffee mascarpone cream.

327
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:55,978
Sports fanatic Matty is a PE teacher

328
00:14:56,003 --> 00:14:59,258
and lives and works
in Cambridgeshire.

329
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:02,418
The punchy coffee flavour in his
sponge and mascarpone filling

330
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,898
should be balanced with
a light vanilla butter cream.

331
00:15:05,923 --> 00:15:08,298
The butter cream looks like
someone's sick.

332
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:10,778
Don't zoom in on that.

333
00:15:10,803 --> 00:15:12,458
Curdled my butter cream.

334
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:14,818
Matty will have
to restart his butter cream...

335
00:15:14,843 --> 00:15:17,338
But I'm hiding the terror
through the smile.

336
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:20,458
...and he's not the only one
attempting to balance a coffee kick.

337
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:22,218
I only drink caramel lattes

338
00:15:22,243 --> 00:15:25,698
so I'm doing a coffee sponge
with salted caramel butter cream.

339
00:15:25,723 --> 00:15:28,018
Dana is a database administrator

340
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:30,698
and lives in Essex
with her cockapoo, Gracie.

341
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:33,738
Her salted caramel butter cream
will fill a coffee sponge

342
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:35,218
soaked with coffee syrup.

343
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:36,578
Because the caramel's quite sweet

344
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,938
so I wanna balance out
the flavours.

345
00:15:38,963 --> 00:15:40,378
Look at me getting all
Mastercheffy. I love it!

346
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:42,698
MasterChef?! we don't want that
here. We're on Bake Off now.

347
00:15:42,723 --> 00:15:43,818
Look at me getting all Bake-Offy.

348
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,298
This isn't MasterChef here, all
right? It's all about the Bake Off.

349
00:15:46,323 --> 00:15:47,618
It's all the wrong program me!

350
00:15:50,163 --> 00:15:54,018
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

351
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:55,938
This is butter cream take two.

352
00:15:55,963 --> 00:15:58,338
Goes quick, don't it?
Tell me about it.

353
00:15:58,363 --> 00:16:01,618
The bakers' time and heat issues
now get even harder.

354
00:16:01,643 --> 00:16:02,698
She's a beauty.

355
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:05,018
Fill and roll their
sponges too late...

356
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:06,178
Chill out.

357
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:09,138
...they won't have time
to perfect their decoration.

358
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:11,458
It's pretty much there.
I think it's at room temperature.

359
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:13,338
But fill and roll a warm sponge...

360
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:16,778
If anything is remotely warm,
it's game over.

361
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:19,098
...and their vertical layer cake
will collapse.

362
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:21,938
What's the best thing to do?

363
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:24,338
It's a waiting game now, isn't it?

364
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:26,178
Let's try a bit of your ganache.

365
00:16:28,243 --> 00:16:29,818
It's fab.

366
00:16:29,843 --> 00:16:32,378
My gosh I need a drink.

367
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:34,698
I could do with a caramel latte,
not gonna lie.

368
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:36,498
Quick slug of coffee.

369
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:41,818
Can I have a cup of tea, please?

370
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:49,298
All right, yeah. Do or die now.

371
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:51,978
I think my sponges are
sufficiently cooled

372
00:16:52,003 --> 00:16:54,658
that I can put the filling in now.

373
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:57,818
Unless the ratio of filling
to sponge is completely even...

374
00:16:57,843 --> 00:17:00,458
I've got my black sesame cream

375
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:02,818
and now I'm gonna add
the yuzu curd.

376
00:17:02,843 --> 00:17:05,498
...the bakers won't achieve
the perfect vertical stripes

377
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:07,058
that the judges have demanded.

378
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,058
Blueberry reduction goes first,

379
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,858
then the blueberry butter cream.

380
00:17:10,883 --> 00:17:13,738
It does come up lovely. I like it.

381
00:17:13,763 --> 00:17:17,098
I can't give that to anyone.

382
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,058
Matty's second attempt
at the butter cream

383
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,858
has gone about as well as his first.

384
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:23,978
I've just not been patient enough
with making this warm enough.

385
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:25,218
How's it going?

386
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:27,578
I keep curdling my butter cream.

387
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:29,338
Just a baking competition,
don't worry about it.

388
00:17:29,363 --> 00:17:31,698
Cheers.

389
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:33,978
If it goes wrong we'll just
key Paul's car.

390
00:17:35,563 --> 00:17:38,058
Right, moment of truth.

391
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:43,658
The slightest crack in
the sponge at this stage...

392
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:46,218
We've got a bit
of naughtiness here.

393
00:17:46,243 --> 00:17:49,738
...and once stood on its end,
gravity will force it open...

394
00:17:49,763 --> 00:17:52,018
I'm almost there.

395
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:54,058
...making the cake lean...

396
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,098
Behave.

397
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:56,138
...or worse.

398
00:17:56,163 --> 00:17:57,458
Look at that. So clever.

399
00:17:57,483 --> 00:18:00,098
I didn't realise it was like
a roll like that.

400
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:01,618
Like a Russian doll.

401
00:18:01,643 --> 00:18:04,458
I'm going to put them
all in each other,

402
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,458
so it's gonna be huge and tall.

403
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:08,138
And whilst some are going
for scale...

404
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:10,578
Just gonna wrap
the other two sponges round that.

405
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:13,018
Have I got one more to do?
Yeah.

406
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:15,098
.Josh has focused on design.

407
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:17,538
So there's the two different
coloured sponges.

408
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,578
And they should hopefully
sort of alternate.

409
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:23,218
Josh is a chemical biology researcher
living in Leicestershire.

410
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:25,618
He tests his bakes at
his local rugby club.

411
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:28,738
No soggy bottoms here Josh!

412
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:32,458
He'll roll his alternating coloured
sponges around passion fruit curd

413
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:34,418
and coconut butter cream.

414
00:18:34,443 --> 00:18:36,218
Baking rugby player. Yeah.

415
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:39,018
Once a month, usually, I take them
into the changing rooms...

416
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:43,018
Basically, 20 or 30 naked men
try out your food.

417
00:18:43,043 --> 00:18:46,178
Yeah! In the changing rooms,
whilst covered in mud.

418
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:51,018
I'm in trouble.
It's just all sticking to the paper.

419
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:54,018
This is the first time it's happened
like this. How cliche.

420
00:18:55,203 --> 00:18:57,498
And Amos isn't the only
one struggling.

421
00:18:57,523 --> 00:18:59,818
This is cracking.

422
00:18:59,843 --> 00:19:02,138
I don't really know why
I did a genoise.

423
00:19:02,163 --> 00:19:06,138
Don't do this for me.

424
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:08,778
Why this is doing to me?

425
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:13,098
Why? See it's sticking.

426
00:19:13,123 --> 00:19:15,858
My god.

427
00:19:15,883 --> 00:19:18,138
Look at that precious little...fella.

428
00:19:18,163 --> 00:19:20,018
Very stressful.

429
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:21,858
The thing is, everyone wants
a handshake from Paul

430
00:19:21,883 --> 00:19:23,818
and you've already had a hug.
Exactly.

431
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:27,378
So you don't need a handshake now,
do you? Yes!

432
00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:28,938
Where can you go from a hug?

433
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:30,138
Home.

434
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:33,738
15 minutes left.

435
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:35,378
Time's against us a wee bit now.

436
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:38,058
I'm no longer using butter cream.

437
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,458
I never want to see it again.

438
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:42,818
And we're gonna use more coffee
mascarpone cream.

439
00:19:42,843 --> 00:19:44,338
I think we have enough.

440
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:47,378
It's not a circle
so I'm piping tactically.

441
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,418
Thickest crumb coat
you've ever seen in your life

442
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:52,738
to try and disguise
what's going on.

443
00:19:52,763 --> 00:19:55,738
I've got shaky hands.

444
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:59,098
Rhubarb slices,
like trimming my hedge.

445
00:19:59,123 --> 00:20:01,658
Try and make it look attractive.

446
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:04,578
So I've got some light pink,
some dark pinks.

447
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,858
It's so messy.

448
00:20:06,883 --> 00:20:08,618
I don't want to overdo it.

449
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:11,698
I wish I liked rhubarb.
I'd be all over that, babes.

450
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:15,018
I've tried to raise my prettiness
game in the last year or so.

451
00:20:15,043 --> 00:20:17,378
Is it not your forte, prettiness?
So I'm rather hoping...

452
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:21,178
No. It's one of the reasons
it's taken me 14 years to apply.

453
00:20:22,883 --> 00:20:24,698
It's a bit lopsided.

454
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:30,698
I think it's fair to say there's
prettier drip cakes on display.

455
00:20:30,723 --> 00:20:33,298
My chocolate drip is splitting.

456
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:34,378
One minute.

457
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:35,498
My God.

458
00:20:35,523 --> 00:20:37,778
Just to make it look
a little bit civilised.

459
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:42,578
It's not quite as I envisaged.

460
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,418
My God.

461
00:20:46,443 --> 00:20:49,418
Bakers, your time is up.

462
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:54,058
Please step away from your
vertical layer cakes.

463
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:56,218
Well done.

464
00:20:56,243 --> 00:20:58,018
I feel like I've run a marathon.

465
00:20:58,043 --> 00:20:59,618
That looks so good.

466
00:20:59,643 --> 00:21:01,218
I could put my face in that.

467
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:03,138
Do you think I'll get
away with that?

468
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:05,018
It's leaning.

469
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,658
The bakers will now face
the judgement of Paul and Prue

470
00:21:13,683 --> 00:21:15,938
for the very first time.

471
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:17,578
Hello, Rowan. Hello. Hi, Rowan.

472
00:21:21,883 --> 00:21:23,058
It's tall, isn't it?

473
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,298
I don't go in halves.

474
00:21:24,323 --> 00:21:26,658
I'm not quite sure
I'm going to get it all out.

475
00:21:26,683 --> 00:21:28,178
There you go.
No! OK.

476
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:31,858
Now that is a perfect example
of a vertical cake.

477
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:40,698
I like it. Do you? Yeah.

478
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:42,338
It's delicate. Yeah!

479
00:21:42,363 --> 00:21:43,978
But the flavours are there.

480
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,458
Buttercream's terrific.
Well done, Rowan. Thank you.

481
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:49,778
Just be aware of the strength of
flavours that you're putting in.

482
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:55,058
Well, the colours work.

483
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,098
Vibrant, I think the
cake looks amazing.

484
00:21:57,123 --> 00:21:59,898
But I actually think you've
over baked your sponges.

485
00:21:59,923 --> 00:22:02,138
But the flavour is sensational.

486
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:07,178
Obviously there's been issues
with the drip effect.

487
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:08,498
Look at that.

488
00:22:08,523 --> 00:22:09,898
The layers just aren't even enough.

489
00:22:09,923 --> 00:22:12,938
The chocolate dominates.
There's not a lot of orange.

490
00:22:12,963 --> 00:22:13,938
OK.

491
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:17,258
I think it looks lovely.

492
00:22:17,283 --> 00:22:19,058
It's good height to it as well. Wow.

493
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,338
Beautiful lines. Thank you.

494
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,378
I think it's delicious.

495
00:22:25,403 --> 00:22:26,578
Do you?

496
00:22:28,003 --> 00:22:30,578
I think, your flavour,
you are 60% there,

497
00:22:30,603 --> 00:22:34,138
don't be afraid to really punch us
in the teeth with citrus flavours.

498
00:22:36,963 --> 00:22:38,338
Looks like a barrel.

499
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:39,858
Bit like me actually.

500
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:42,258
But I don't think it's terrible.
Well, that's good!

501
00:22:42,283 --> 00:22:45,098
He's dabbing with faint praise.

502
00:22:45,123 --> 00:22:46,458
He doesn't think it's terrible.

503
00:22:46,483 --> 00:22:47,978
I quite like the layers,
they're pretty even.

504
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:49,738
Yes, the layers are good.

505
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:54,658
The flavour is very subtle
and it is delicious.

506
00:22:54,683 --> 00:22:56,418
It's just not punchy enough.

507
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:59,538
Maybe it's one of these that
kind of just grows on you.

508
00:22:59,563 --> 00:23:00,818
Like a fungus.

509
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:02,898
Paul!

510
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,538
Doing well. Barrel, fungus...
Like a beautiful fungus.

511
00:23:06,563 --> 00:23:08,258
Can't take him anywhere.

512
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:16,058
I like that informal
cornucopia look.

513
00:23:17,243 --> 00:23:19,058
Very nice vertical stripes.

514
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,418
This is the wild poppy, isn't it?

515
00:23:20,443 --> 00:23:21,778
Yeah, wild poppyseeds.

516
00:23:24,883 --> 00:23:26,098
It's delicious.

517
00:23:26,123 --> 00:23:28,818
I think the flavour's come through,
they're nice and punchy.

518
00:23:28,843 --> 00:23:31,138
The balance of the
texture of the cake

519
00:23:31,163 --> 00:23:32,698
and the butter cream is beautiful.

520
00:23:32,723 --> 00:23:33,778
Thank you.

521
00:23:37,363 --> 00:23:38,658
It's a bit messy. Yes.

522
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,098
The piping's not particularly good.

523
00:23:41,123 --> 00:23:43,658
Well, those are pretty good stripes.

524
00:23:46,803 --> 00:23:48,298
I must say, the flavour's lovely.

525
00:23:48,323 --> 00:23:49,458
Not too salty.

526
00:23:53,243 --> 00:23:56,218
Don't make a face like that.
It is a bit wobbly.

527
00:23:56,243 --> 00:23:57,778
I like the colours,
I think it's stark.

528
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,258
Let's have a look at this
wobbly tower. Wow.

529
00:24:00,283 --> 00:24:01,658
Well, the stripes are there.

530
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:05,858
Ooh. What's happened?

531
00:24:05,883 --> 00:24:08,578
I got the sharpness from
the outside...

532
00:24:08,603 --> 00:24:11,538
Creme patties... ..which brings
that sour and the sweet together.

533
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:12,738
Love the flavours.

534
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:15,858
Well, I think the real
achievement is to get real flavour

535
00:24:15,883 --> 00:24:19,258
out of blueberries, which
are really not the easiest fruit

536
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:21,138
to make taste great.

537
00:24:25,483 --> 00:24:28,378
It's coffee cake and a mascarpone
cream that ended up being on

538
00:24:28,403 --> 00:24:29,978
the outside as well as the inside

539
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:31,978
due to my inability
to make a butter cream.

540
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,258
OK.

541
00:24:39,523 --> 00:24:41,298
That'd wake you up in the morning.

542
00:24:41,323 --> 00:24:42,698
It certainly is strong.

543
00:24:42,723 --> 00:24:44,738
That coffee level is perfect.

544
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:46,698
It's a muscular cake.

545
00:24:46,723 --> 00:24:47,898
Yeah.

546
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:50,218
It's very nice.

547
00:24:50,243 --> 00:24:54,538
You've made a hefty, muscular,
powerful cake.

548
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:02,978
Dan, that is the cutest little cake.

549
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,338
Looks like a circus tent.
Yeah, it does doesn't it? Yeah.

550
00:25:05,363 --> 00:25:07,138
Beautiful stripes, Dan.
Look at those lines.

551
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:09,138
Well done. Thank you.

552
00:25:14,483 --> 00:25:16,258
That is rhubarb and custard.

553
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:18,618
It's a beautiful cake,
it's very light.

554
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:22,578
And with the creme pat and the
rhubarb, the slice is quite moreish.

555
00:25:22,603 --> 00:25:24,618
Think you've done a good job.
Thanks, Paul. Cheers.

556
00:25:24,643 --> 00:25:27,298
Tiny circus tent. I know, yeah.
Loved it. Brilliant.

557
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:32,698
I think it looks so dramatic

558
00:25:32,723 --> 00:25:35,018
and the colours are
so strong contrasting,

559
00:25:35,043 --> 00:25:36,978
and they look so wonderful.

560
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,298
Is this just cream, then?

561
00:25:38,323 --> 00:25:39,458
It's whipped cream

562
00:25:39,483 --> 00:25:41,738
with that orange liqueur
I mentioned.

563
00:25:42,603 --> 00:25:43,738
It's delicious.

564
00:25:43,763 --> 00:25:46,138
My God.
Absolutely delicious.

565
00:25:46,163 --> 00:25:49,658
The cream is so light against
the density of the chocolate

566
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:52,618
and then that orange liqueur...
It is absolutely delicious.

567
00:25:52,643 --> 00:25:54,498
I could happily eat all of that.

568
00:25:54,523 --> 00:25:56,098
Well done, Keith. Thank you.
Thank you, Keith.

569
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:57,618
Nailed it.

570
00:25:57,643 --> 00:25:58,858
Boozy Prue.

571
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,178
Dear me.

572
00:26:08,763 --> 00:26:10,218
Did you sit on it?

573
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:14,138
There were some problems.

574
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:18,578
But, you know what?
Its flavour might save it.

575
00:26:18,603 --> 00:26:21,298
Well you've certainly got
the stripes.

576
00:26:21,323 --> 00:26:24,498
I think you've got too much filling
to cake, though.

577
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:28,898
That is very unusual.

578
00:26:28,923 --> 00:26:30,378
And rather delicious.

579
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:32,698
Thank you.

580
00:26:32,723 --> 00:26:37,098
But, if you'd used less of the
filling and more of the sponge,

581
00:26:37,123 --> 00:26:39,538
that would've been
absolutely brilliant.

582
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:41,098
I think it looks terrible...

583
00:26:42,683 --> 00:26:45,538
...but I love the flavours
and the textures of it.

584
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:47,058
Well done. Thank you.

585
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,858
Hope you softened some
of Paul's rudeness.

586
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,098
It was such a mixed bag

587
00:26:57,123 --> 00:27:00,338
but it was definitely leaning on
the side of bad.

588
00:27:00,363 --> 00:27:02,978
I've learnt a lot today
which I will bring

589
00:27:03,003 --> 00:27:06,018
week after week
after week, hopefully.

590
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:08,618
I'm flabbergasted.

591
00:27:08,643 --> 00:27:10,978
I was worried that I wouldn't
measure up.

592
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:13,258
The only way is probably that way
now, isn't it, to be fair?

593
00:27:15,243 --> 00:27:17,538
Each week, the bakers
will face a second challenge

594
00:27:17,563 --> 00:27:20,978
that's a gingham-clad mystery.

595
00:27:21,003 --> 00:27:24,698
It's time for your technical
challenge, which today has been set

596
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:27,138
for you by the big boss man,
Paul Hollywood.

597
00:27:27,163 --> 00:27:31,698
Bakers, this is the most iconic
Bake Off cake.

598
00:27:31,723 --> 00:27:33,458
It has to look amazing on
the outside,

599
00:27:33,483 --> 00:27:35,898
and inside it's got to taste
and look good too.

600
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:38,618
As ever, the technical
challenge will be judged blind

601
00:27:38,643 --> 00:27:41,898
so we're gonna have to ask these two
lovelies to pop outside the tent.

602
00:27:41,923 --> 00:27:45,138
Bye. Paul's gonna go and
look at some denim samples.

603
00:27:46,443 --> 00:27:48,418
So, Paul would like you to make

604
00:27:48,443 --> 00:27:50,938
the Great British Bake Off
chocolate cake.

605
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:53,698
You know, the one with
the famous missing raspberry.

606
00:27:53,723 --> 00:27:56,058
Whatever happened to that raspberry?

607
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:59,498
I've got it right here
in this golden box.

608
00:27:59,523 --> 00:28:00,858
That's my pension.

609
00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:03,178
I'll be selling that on eBay.

610
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:07,618
The judges are looking
for two layers of moist... Moist.

611
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:08,898
...choc...

612
00:28:10,843 --> 00:28:12,218
...chocolate sponge,

613
00:28:12,243 --> 00:28:15,738
covered and filled with a silky
smooth chocolate ganache...

614
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:18,418
Ganache.
..topped with the fresh raspberries.

615
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:20,978
You have two hours. On your marks.

616
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:22,458
Get set. Bake!

617
00:28:24,763 --> 00:28:27,218
The bakers have all been given
the same ingredients

618
00:28:27,243 --> 00:28:28,578
and a pared-down recipe.

619
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:30,618
Straight away,
I know what this cake looks like.

620
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:32,978
I mean, I've been watching
the show since such a young age,

621
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:36,738
and that dreaded raspberry,
so I can finally rectify it.

622
00:28:36,763 --> 00:28:39,138
To be honest, I've never
really clocked anything

623
00:28:39,163 --> 00:28:41,858
other than the raspberry, so it's
news to me that it was a cake.

624
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:45,058
It feels quite strange to be doing
the iconic Bake Off cake

625
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:47,338
on Bake Off. It's very meta.

626
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:49,938
I recognise this cake.

627
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:53,018
It's probably one of
the most famous cakes in the UK.

628
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:54,818
It is actually
a chocolate fudge cake,

629
00:28:54,843 --> 00:28:56,898
but it comes down to the ganache.

630
00:28:56,923 --> 00:28:59,978
Got to cool your ganache down
to a point, but not cold,

631
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:01,258
because it'll be solid.

632
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:03,618
When it comes into contact
with the sponge,

633
00:29:03,643 --> 00:29:05,218
if it's warm,
it's just gonna run out.

634
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,938
They can use the fridges.

635
00:29:06,963 --> 00:29:09,338
The issue when you use the
fridge with ganache,

636
00:29:09,363 --> 00:29:10,978
you can matte the chocolate.

637
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:12,178
And we want shiny.

638
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:14,498
Let's take a slice of this, Prue.

639
00:29:14,523 --> 00:29:17,618
Straight away you see
the ganache smack in the middle.

640
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:20,298
It's beautifully set,
and it's soft and luscious,

641
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:22,578
but not pouring out like a volcano.

642
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:24,898
This is a chocoholic's dream.

643
00:29:24,923 --> 00:29:26,578
Don't have any more, Prue.
I can't help it.

644
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:29,098
We've gotta go in
and have 12 of these in a minute.

645
00:29:29,123 --> 00:29:31,538
Well, you've more discipline
than I have.

646
00:29:34,723 --> 00:29:38,738
"Melt and combine the chocolate,
butter and hot water."

647
00:29:38,763 --> 00:29:40,298
While that's going,
I'm gonna make a start

648
00:29:40,323 --> 00:29:41,938
on putting together all the
wet ingredients.

649
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:46,578
We've got sour cream,
vegetable oil, eggs and butter.

650
00:29:46,603 --> 00:29:48,258
This is the iconic cake.

651
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:51,218
You see this cake every single time
you watch Bake Off.

652
00:29:51,243 --> 00:29:54,378
This is huge.
Stop ramping up the pressure!

653
00:29:54,403 --> 00:29:57,018
"Incorporate the melted
chocolate mixture

654
00:29:57,043 --> 00:29:59,818
"before combining with
the dry ingredients.”

655
00:29:59,843 --> 00:30:03,058
Just using the spatula
to fold it through.

656
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:06,098
Um, I feel like I've made a mistake.

657
00:30:06,123 --> 00:30:09,938
I might have used twice as much
chocolate for the actual cake,

658
00:30:09,963 --> 00:30:12,298
but I'm just kind
of hoping that it's fine.

659
00:30:12,323 --> 00:30:13,938
Everyone loves a good
chocolate cake, so...

660
00:30:13,963 --> 00:30:15,098
In the oven.

661
00:30:15,123 --> 00:30:18,218
You're going in, mate.
Goodbye. See you laters.

662
00:30:18,243 --> 00:30:20,058
It just says, "Bake,"”
so it's very helpful.

663
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,258
Love that Paul, don't you?

664
00:30:21,283 --> 00:30:24,018
I'll be baking the cakes
for 35 minutes.

665
00:30:24,043 --> 00:30:27,258
This is already set to 35.
Do you think that's a sign?

666
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,658
I'll try 30 first.

667
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:32,418
Or 357

668
00:30:32,443 --> 00:30:33,298
55!

669
00:30:33,323 --> 00:30:35,658
"Make the ganache
filling slash icing."

670
00:30:35,683 --> 00:30:37,098
Not much to say
about ganache. really.

671
00:30:37,123 --> 00:30:38,778
It's not afraid to be itself.

672
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:41,418
I feel like I'm slightly at
an unfair advantage

673
00:30:41,443 --> 00:30:43,218
as I made ganache this morning.

674
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:44,418
Feels like cheating.

675
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:47,058
That's why everyone was
staring at you, Keith. Is it?

676
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,498
It's looking good,
looking silky smooth.

677
00:30:49,523 --> 00:30:51,978
That's lovely and glossy. Could have
a bath in that, couldn't you?

678
00:30:52,003 --> 00:30:53,618
I'm hesitant to put it in
the fridge.

679
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,258
I want to keep it as
shiny as possible,

680
00:30:55,283 --> 00:30:57,058
but I think if I stick it
in the fridge,

681
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:58,338
it might not be shiny anymore.

682
00:30:58,363 --> 00:31:00,058
Pop that there for a sec.

683
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:02,698
I think it's gonna take
a really long time to cool.

684
00:31:02,723 --> 00:31:04,098
I'll be utilising the fridge.

685
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:05,778
Probably gonna go all wrong,
but I'm chilling.

686
00:31:05,803 --> 00:31:07,218
I've put the ganache in
the freezer.

687
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:10,378
Otherwise all the ganache is
gonna get a bit splodgy.

688
00:31:11,523 --> 00:31:14,618
Bakers, you have one hour.

689
00:31:16,163 --> 00:31:18,818
There's a good chocolate whiff
in this area.

690
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,898
How many times have you checked?
I'm up to 450 now.

691
00:31:23,363 --> 00:31:24,778
How do you feel about things,

692
00:31:24,803 --> 00:31:27,218
probably been up since about four,
haven't you?

693
00:31:27,243 --> 00:31:28,738
Yeah. Half three, I woke up.

694
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:31,498
Do you lie in bed sometimes thinking
about what you're gonna do?

695
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,858
I'm like, "My God
I can't switch off now,” but...

696
00:31:33,883 --> 00:31:37,378
Does it go better when you're
imagining it? Yes, every time.

697
00:31:37,403 --> 00:31:38,458
Paul starts crying.

698
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:39,978
Yeah, yeah. Prue faints.

699
00:31:40,003 --> 00:31:41,778
Worship me! I know.

700
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:44,458
I think I'll give the top one
a little poke.

701
00:31:44,483 --> 00:31:46,818
Well, you want it, like,
quite light and airy.

702
00:31:46,843 --> 00:31:48,498
There was an emphasis on
the word "moist.”

703
00:31:48,523 --> 00:31:50,938
It should come out with
a few crumbs attached.

704
00:31:50,963 --> 00:31:52,018
Aye-aye.

705
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,778
Coming out clean...

706
00:31:53,803 --> 00:31:55,018
...and aye-aye.

707
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:56,498
Gonna get them out. I'm doing it.

708
00:31:56,523 --> 00:31:57,778
Reasonably happy with them.

709
00:31:57,803 --> 00:31:58,898
They're looking OK.

710
00:31:58,923 --> 00:32:00,658
They look OK. I mean, they're baked.

711
00:32:02,283 --> 00:32:05,138
It wouldn't be Bake Off without
somebody wafting one of these.

712
00:32:05,163 --> 00:32:08,338
The most important thing is
to get chilled as quick as possible

713
00:32:08,363 --> 00:32:10,658
so the ganache doesn't
just run all out of it.

714
00:32:10,683 --> 00:32:13,858
Come on wind. Now, yes. This way.

715
00:32:15,043 --> 00:32:16,618
I just put it in the fridge.

716
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,978
The amount of time I have is
very disconcerting.

717
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,338
I was not expecting my first
technical to go like this.

718
00:32:21,363 --> 00:32:24,538
Just sitting about, looking at
bumblebees out the side of the tent.

719
00:32:24,563 --> 00:32:26,098
It's lovely out there.

720
00:32:26,123 --> 00:32:27,938
Alison, would you like a sign name?

721
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:29,458
I would love a sign name.

722
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:30,618
Like, Alison?

723
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:31,858
Alison? Yeah?

724
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:32,938
I love it.

725
00:32:32,963 --> 00:32:35,418
Have you got a sign name
for Paul Hollywood?

726
00:32:35,443 --> 00:32:36,658
You have, haven't you?

727
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:37,818
What is it?

728
00:32:37,843 --> 00:32:40,178
I have problems getting my words
out sometimes. Yeah.

729
00:32:40,203 --> 00:32:43,418
I tried to say, "Paul Hollywood,"
and I came out with, "Pollywood."

730
00:32:43,443 --> 00:32:44,818
Pollywood? Ha!

731
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:47,098
So now I call him Polly,

732
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:49,018
so, like, it's Polly like a parrot.

733
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:51,898
Polly.

734
00:32:51,923 --> 00:32:53,538
This is Paul?

735
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:55,458
Little Polly. Polly, Paul.

736
00:32:55,483 --> 00:32:57,058
I love it!
But you can't tell him!

737
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:59,378
I won't tell him, I promise.

738
00:32:59,403 --> 00:33:02,698
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

739
00:33:02,723 --> 00:33:04,578
"Assemble the cake,
sandwich in the sponges,

740
00:33:04,603 --> 00:33:07,698
"and icing the cake with
a smooth coating of ganache.”

741
00:33:07,723 --> 00:33:10,898
The thing with ganache is that if
you put it on a warm cake...

742
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:12,178
...it will melt.

743
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:14,178
They're a little,
tiniest little bit warm.

744
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:16,538
If I was at home,
I'd have left them for an hour.

745
00:33:16,563 --> 00:33:19,338
But I haven't got an hour, so gonna
have to roll with them, I think.

746
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:20,938
Wait till it's cold.

747
00:33:20,963 --> 00:33:22,258
Five more minutes.

748
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:24,218
It would just be too warm.

749
00:33:24,243 --> 00:33:27,018
This is the ganache
to sandwich the cake.

750
00:33:27,043 --> 00:33:29,458
The ganache has set
a bit too much in the fridge.

751
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:31,818
Feel like I might even put my
ganache in the microwave.

752
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,258
It's curdling all of a sudden
and I don't know why.

753
00:33:34,283 --> 00:33:37,058
It was fine and now it's split,
and I've been putting in

754
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:40,578
and out of the fridge
and maybe it's just not liked it.

755
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:43,138
I'm getting really impatient.

756
00:33:43,163 --> 00:33:46,138
Especially when everyone else is,
like, cracking on as well.

757
00:33:46,163 --> 00:33:49,658
PLANE WHIRRS Guys, time is
ticking. You've got 15 minutes.

758
00:33:49,683 --> 00:33:52,618
Can you hear that plane circling?
That's Paul Hollywood.

759
00:33:54,003 --> 00:33:55,698
They're, like, room temperature.

760
00:33:55,723 --> 00:33:57,418
Just going for it.

761
00:33:57,443 --> 00:33:58,738
Silky smooth.

762
00:33:58,763 --> 00:34:02,338
My beautiful ganache, which has
been perfect, has slightly split,

763
00:34:02,363 --> 00:34:04,698
so I'm just gonna add in
a little bit of butter

764
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:06,058
and that should bring it back
into emulsion.

765
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:08,418
I can't remember if the
finish is straight-edged

766
00:34:08,443 --> 00:34:10,378
or if it's got, like,
a full ripple to it.

767
00:34:10,403 --> 00:34:13,218
It needs to be really,
really good because it's so iconic.

768
00:34:13,243 --> 00:34:14,938
Yeah, you've gotta do the
cake justice, haven't you?

769
00:34:14,963 --> 00:34:17,298
So determined for it not
to look like someone's sat on it.

770
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:19,618
OK, you've got
five minutes left, bakers.

771
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:21,618
Five minutes left? OK...

772
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:24,098
Onto the iconic raspberry.

773
00:34:24,123 --> 00:34:26,938
Am I adding the missing raspberry?

774
00:34:28,523 --> 00:34:31,178
It doesn't say whether
to include the raspberry or not.

775
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:34,418
Raspberry, on or off? On. Yeah.

776
00:34:34,443 --> 00:34:36,778
You're gonna replace the missing
raspberry? It needs to be done.

777
00:34:36,803 --> 00:34:39,338
How many sleepless nights I've
had over that missing raspberry...

778
00:34:39,363 --> 00:34:42,018
Really? Terrible.
Like, "Why did they do that?"

779
00:34:42,043 --> 00:34:44,618
I know it's got one missing,
so I've left the perfect gap.

780
00:34:44,643 --> 00:34:46,578
Got my one raspberry missing as well
in the middle.

781
00:34:46,603 --> 00:34:49,018
I can't let myself
miss out a raspberry.

782
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:50,618
I've watched it for so many years.

783
00:34:50,643 --> 00:34:52,898
Why? Where's that missing raspberry?

784
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:54,498
It's here.

785
00:34:54,523 --> 00:34:56,378
It's here, you can put
it on if you want.

786
00:34:56,403 --> 00:34:57,818
I'm not gonna do it for you.

787
00:34:57,843 --> 00:35:00,218
OK bakers, one minute.

788
00:35:00,243 --> 00:35:01,898
I've got wobbles.

789
00:35:01,923 --> 00:35:03,018
Finito.

790
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:05,738
Quite pleased with it.
It's like on t'picture.

791
00:35:05,763 --> 00:35:06,898
God.

792
00:35:06,923 --> 00:35:08,738
Quick, shove it off.

793
00:35:08,763 --> 00:35:11,098
It's broken.

794
00:35:11,123 --> 00:35:13,418
I am happy with it,
but it's just my ganache.

795
00:35:13,443 --> 00:35:15,738
Quick, we can do this. Mend it.

796
00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:19,218
Bakers, your time is up.

797
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,538
We're good. We're good. We're done.

798
00:35:21,563 --> 00:35:23,898
Please bring your cakes
down to the front

799
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:26,978
and place them behind your
own photograph.

800
00:35:27,003 --> 00:35:28,498
God, they look grand.
God, everyone's is beautiful.

801
00:35:28,523 --> 00:35:29,978
Did you do a missing raspberry?

802
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,098
Yeah, did you? Yeah!

803
00:35:31,123 --> 00:35:32,618
This is looking good, isn't it?

804
00:35:32,643 --> 00:35:34,498
Yeah, they're good, aren't they?
So good.

805
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:36,858
How dare they be this good
this quickly? I know!

806
00:35:40,123 --> 00:35:42,938
Time to welcome the judges back in.

807
00:35:42,963 --> 00:35:44,658
We've missed you, Prue. We have.

808
00:35:45,963 --> 00:35:49,258
Paul and Prue are looking for
moist and light chocolate sponges,

809
00:35:49,283 --> 00:35:52,498
coated in a perfectly set,
smooth and shiny ganache.

810
00:35:52,523 --> 00:35:55,618
And they have no idea
whose is whose.

811
00:35:55,643 --> 00:35:57,938
It's going to be difficult,
I'm telling you now.

812
00:35:57,963 --> 00:36:00,378
We will be nit picking.

813
00:36:00,403 --> 00:36:01,898
Right, we'll start with this one.

814
00:36:01,923 --> 00:36:03,458
Straight off, no shine.

815
00:36:03,483 --> 00:36:04,938
It's messy round there as well.

816
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,978
But let's have a look inside.

817
00:36:07,003 --> 00:36:08,938
Wow.

818
00:36:08,963 --> 00:36:11,258
I can't believe we're
going to have to taste

819
00:36:11,283 --> 00:36:13,298
12 of these chocolate cakes.

820
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:18,698
That's a nice flavour.
It's a shame about the colour.

821
00:36:18,723 --> 00:36:20,618
Moving on to number two.
Now, I like this.

822
00:36:20,643 --> 00:36:22,458
The sharpness across the top.

823
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:25,738
That ganache, it has got a shine
and it is neat on the bottom.

824
00:36:25,763 --> 00:36:29,258
It's a good-looking cake.
It's very clean. Let's have a look.

825
00:36:29,283 --> 00:36:31,858
It's really good
chocolate fudge cake.

826
00:36:31,883 --> 00:36:33,338
Wrong colour ganache.

827
00:36:33,363 --> 00:36:35,098
The colour's too milky.

828
00:36:35,123 --> 00:36:37,018
And messy.

829
00:36:37,043 --> 00:36:39,018
Yeah, nicely made.

830
00:36:39,043 --> 00:36:41,018
Moving on, they've taken
the wrong raspberry out.

831
00:36:41,043 --> 00:36:45,378
That's the one. The missing
raspberry's at the edge. It is.

832
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,098
It's really beautiful cake.

833
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:49,698
Moving on to the next one,
you can see the crease.

834
00:36:49,723 --> 00:36:52,498
It shouldn't look as if there are
two cakes in there. Should be one.

835
00:36:52,523 --> 00:36:55,738
That ganache inside
is still very liquid.

836
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:57,218
This is a bit messy.

837
00:36:57,243 --> 00:36:59,138
It's not bad, though,
cos it's a nice shine.

838
00:37:01,003 --> 00:37:02,778
Nice sponge again.

839
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,738
The ganache is nearly there.

840
00:37:04,763 --> 00:37:08,298
It's beautifully neat.
It has got a shine to it. Yeah.

841
00:37:08,323 --> 00:37:10,298
That's a beautiful cake. It is.

842
00:37:10,323 --> 00:37:11,698
This is the right colour.

843
00:37:11,723 --> 00:37:13,058
But it's a bit matte, isn't it?

844
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:14,978
It's not as shiny as some.

845
00:37:15,003 --> 00:37:19,018
Still a bit warm, that ganache.
Still liquid.

846
00:37:19,043 --> 00:37:20,738
OK, moving on to this one.

847
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:23,058
You can definitely see
it's two cakes stacked.

848
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:25,098
It's got a waistband round it.

849
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:27,658
The ganache inside is still liquid.

850
00:37:27,683 --> 00:37:29,298
I like the neatness of this.

851
00:37:29,323 --> 00:37:32,258
Yeah, very clean, the sides
are absolutely straight.

852
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,258
Hello. That looks good.

853
00:37:34,283 --> 00:37:38,018
Good amount of ganache, and
it's solid as well. And it's set.

854
00:37:38,043 --> 00:37:39,298
Moving on to the next one,

855
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,258
it's a little bit light,
a little bit matte.

856
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:42,698
Not quite set.

857
00:37:42,723 --> 00:37:45,338
No, timing again.
Great taste though.

858
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:50,098
Doesn't look totally smooth,
the ganache. It's not light enough.

859
00:37:50,123 --> 00:37:51,818
Looks a bit dense, doesn't it?

860
00:37:51,843 --> 00:37:54,498
I know it is a fudge cake
but it's too fudgy.

861
00:37:55,843 --> 00:38:00,218
Paul and Prue will now rank
the cakes from 12th to 1st place.

862
00:38:00,243 --> 00:38:03,498
You can all obviously make
a good, big chocolate cake.

863
00:38:03,523 --> 00:38:04,858
It's going to be tight.

864
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:08,698
In 12th place, we have this one.

865
00:38:08,723 --> 00:38:09,778
Who is this?

866
00:38:09,803 --> 00:38:12,658
It's me. Dana, the texture's
a little bit dense.

867
00:38:12,683 --> 00:38:15,898
In 11th spot, we have this one.

868
00:38:15,923 --> 00:38:19,458
Tasha, the fat rim of chocolate
running around the middle

869
00:38:19,483 --> 00:38:20,738
is the big problem.

870
00:38:20,763 --> 00:38:24,818
And then in 10th place,
we have this one.

871
00:38:24,843 --> 00:38:28,418
Nicky, it's a nice cake
but the colour's not right.

872
00:38:28,443 --> 00:38:32,178
Rowan is 9th,
Josh 8th, Matty is 7th,

873
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:37,298
Cristy 6th, Saku is 5th,
Keith is 4th and Abbi takes 3rd.

874
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:41,658
And then runner-up,
in second place...

875
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:43,978
...is this one. Who's that?

876
00:38:44,003 --> 00:38:48,378
Amos, it's nice and shiny,
the cake is light,

877
00:38:48,403 --> 00:38:49,778
ganache is set.

878
00:38:49,803 --> 00:38:52,258
Don't have any complaints
about it at all.

879
00:38:52,283 --> 00:38:54,138
The winner is Dan.

880
00:38:58,203 --> 00:39:01,138
That's a great looking cake.
Well done. Thank you very much.

881
00:39:01,163 --> 00:39:03,618
Nice. Amazing. Really good.

882
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:06,218
I am pretty much on cloud nine,
to be honest.

883
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,178
So, so happy. I really am, yeah.

884
00:39:08,203 --> 00:39:10,618
I don't really compare,
you know, having babies

885
00:39:10,643 --> 00:39:13,538
to, baking a good cake...

886
00:39:13,563 --> 00:39:17,538
It's not disastrous.
I'll take better than last.

887
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,298
Coming last is not the nicest.

888
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,738
It's silly getting
emotional over it.

889
00:39:21,763 --> 00:39:23,458
It's just cake,
at the end of the day.

890
00:39:23,483 --> 00:39:26,498
My signature looked
like someone sat on it

891
00:39:26,523 --> 00:39:31,498
and, coming 11th in
the technical, I'm not safe.

892
00:43:37,803 --> 00:43:40,498
Just one challenge remains
before we learn who will be

893
00:43:40,523 --> 00:43:43,578
our first Star Baker and
who will be leaving the tent.

894
00:43:43,603 --> 00:43:45,058
Class of 2023

895
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:46,618
are brilliant, aren't they?

896
00:43:46,643 --> 00:43:48,978
Paul giving people hugs - what
the hell? What's happened? I know.

897
00:43:49,003 --> 00:43:50,658
What's happened to you?
I don't know.

898
00:43:50,683 --> 00:43:52,218
Did you have a breakdown?

899
00:43:52,243 --> 00:43:53,858
Bit worrying, isn't it?

900
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:56,338
There's quite a few of them
in line for Star Baker.

901
00:43:56,363 --> 00:44:00,018
Especially the lads.
Keith. Dan. Dan. They're strong.

902
00:44:00,043 --> 00:44:01,858
Abbi's in that realm as well.
Cristy.

903
00:44:01,883 --> 00:44:04,218
To be honest it's difficult
to rate them

904
00:44:04,243 --> 00:44:06,978
because those technicals
were all beautiful.

905
00:44:07,003 --> 00:44:08,938
Is that the closest technical
we've ever had?

906
00:44:08,963 --> 00:44:10,578
There's almost nothing
to choose between them.

907
00:44:10,603 --> 00:44:14,098
Dana, who was last in technical,
is always in a precarious position.

908
00:44:14,123 --> 00:44:16,618
Tasha struggled a little bit
as well in both challenges.

909
00:44:16,643 --> 00:44:19,938
I don't think Amos did massively
well in the signature.

910
00:44:19,963 --> 00:44:22,538
But there's a huge bunch
that could possibly leave

911
00:44:22,563 --> 00:44:24,178
after the Showstopper. I'm really...

912
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,858
How many are you
going to get rid of, Paul?

913
00:44:25,883 --> 00:44:28,498
You know we're only
allowed to send one. Ten.

914
00:44:33,363 --> 00:44:38,498
Morning, bakers. This is your
first Showstopper Challenge.

915
00:44:38,523 --> 00:44:41,698
Prue and Paul would like you to
create an incredible cake,

916
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:46,658
shaped and decorated in the form
of an animal of your choosing.

917
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:50,218
Now, it could be anything from
a cat-tenberg to a...

918
00:44:50,243 --> 00:44:51,578
Snake-well tart.

919
00:44:51,603 --> 00:44:53,498
Now, you've got four hours for this.

920
00:44:53,523 --> 00:44:57,058
On your marks. Get set. Bake!

921
00:44:57,083 --> 00:45:00,418
I am so nervous.
I can't even cope right now.

922
00:45:00,443 --> 00:45:03,618
So many elements going on here.
So many.

923
00:45:03,643 --> 00:45:07,098
I'm concerned that
the cake itself could collapse.

924
00:45:07,123 --> 00:45:10,018
I need to get this right.
I don't want to go home.

925
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:13,058
Now the bakers get
their first chance

926
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:17,538
to show off, to make a cake
that resembles an animal.

927
00:45:17,563 --> 00:45:20,098
Because the animals are going to be
probably quite big,

928
00:45:20,123 --> 00:45:23,698
they can use puffed rice
to create certain elements

929
00:45:23,723 --> 00:45:26,178
but the main body has to be sponge.

930
00:45:26,203 --> 00:45:29,218
I think there's a real danger
the bakers get so obsessed

931
00:45:29,243 --> 00:45:31,898
with how their animal looks
that they'll forget

932
00:45:31,923 --> 00:45:34,258
that it has to taste amazing.

933
00:45:34,283 --> 00:45:38,618
If I was going to do
an animal cake...

934
00:45:38,643 --> 00:45:39,938
Silverback gorilla.

935
00:45:41,243 --> 00:45:43,618
Hello, Keith. Hello, Keith.
Morning, Paul. Morning, Prue.

936
00:45:43,643 --> 00:45:45,138
How you doing, you all right?
Morning, Noel.

937
00:45:45,163 --> 00:45:46,858
Tell us about your animal cake.

938
00:45:46,883 --> 00:45:48,818
My animal cake is

939
00:45:48,843 --> 00:45:52,458
a small poodle that
I'm a kind of step-father to.

940
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,818
Keith's 13-year-old
poodle, Maisie,

941
00:45:54,843 --> 00:45:56,658
will be built from lemon
and orange sponges

942
00:45:56,683 --> 00:45:58,418
and her ageing coat will be made

943
00:45:58,443 --> 00:46:00,978
with charcoal coloured
orange butter cream.

944
00:46:01,003 --> 00:46:03,298
She's not a thing of rare beauty.

945
00:46:03,323 --> 00:46:06,018
Are you trying to tell us
if your cake looks terrible,

946
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:08,378
it's just because she's old?
Get out clause.

947
00:46:08,403 --> 00:46:11,538
You've seen straight
through me, Prue. Yes.

948
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:15,338
I am baking my dog, Gracie.

949
00:46:15,363 --> 00:46:17,258
My little angel.

950
00:46:17,283 --> 00:46:19,578
And it's going to be made
out of her favourite flavours -

951
00:46:19,603 --> 00:46:20,658
banana and peanut butter.

952
00:46:20,683 --> 00:46:23,018
I tell a lie - her favourite
flavours is chicken and beef

953
00:46:23,043 --> 00:46:24,178
but I can't really
put that in a cake.

954
00:46:24,203 --> 00:46:27,018
After a difficult first day,
Dana is hoping to avoid

955
00:46:27,043 --> 00:46:29,338
the doghouse by adding
a cinnamon crumble

956
00:46:29,363 --> 00:46:30,618
to her Gracie banana cake

957
00:46:30,643 --> 00:46:32,898
filled with peanut butter cream.

958
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:34,618
I've practised this.

959
00:46:34,643 --> 00:46:37,138
Let's just say it's a good thing
dogs love you unconditionally

960
00:46:37,163 --> 00:46:39,458
cos she did not look herself.

961
00:46:39,483 --> 00:46:42,098
Dana and Keith aren't the only ones
putting their faith

962
00:46:42,123 --> 00:46:43,498
in a four-legged friend.

963
00:46:43,523 --> 00:46:45,858
Is that your dog? well, it was.
He went to sleep last month.

964
00:46:45,883 --> 00:46:49,538
Aw. He was nearly 18, so he's 17,
so... Wow. He did really well.

965
00:46:49,563 --> 00:46:51,898
This is actually quite a lot of
pressure, really, to get this right.

966
00:46:51,923 --> 00:46:53,058
It is a bit, yeah, yeah.

967
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:55,458
<i>Dan's planning to
immortalise his dog, Bruno,</i>

968
00:46:55,483 --> 00:46:58,178
by decorating rich chocolate
sponges, layered with ganache

969
00:46:58,203 --> 00:47:01,018
in a two-tone chocolate
French butter cream.

970
00:47:01,043 --> 00:47:02,698
And his family have no idea.

971
00:47:02,723 --> 00:47:05,058
So I practised the first one at home
and I put him in the fridge,

972
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:06,858
cos obviously I was trying to
hide it from everybody.

973
00:47:06,883 --> 00:47:09,178
Unbeknown to my mum, she opened
the fridge door and went,

974
00:47:09,203 --> 00:47:10,378
"What's Bruno doing in the fridge?"

975
00:47:10,403 --> 00:47:12,698
So obviously my eldest then's
like, "What you on about?"

976
00:47:12,723 --> 00:47:13,658
Charged over to the fridge,

977
00:47:13,683 --> 00:47:16,018
obviously the dog's sat
in the fridge, isn't he?

978
00:47:17,323 --> 00:47:19,618
Whilst the judges will
expect animal cakes

979
00:47:19,643 --> 00:47:21,898
that are light and delicious...

980
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:23,178
Whoo.

981
00:47:23,203 --> 00:47:24,938
...to avoid collapse, the bakers will

982
00:47:24,963 --> 00:47:27,458
need to create sponge
that's just robust enough

983
00:47:27,483 --> 00:47:30,658
to survive being carved
into a lifelike shape.

984
00:47:30,683 --> 00:47:33,458
This is my very dense sponge

985
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:35,738
which is great for carving.

986
00:47:35,763 --> 00:47:36,898
Dense sponge?

987
00:47:36,923 --> 00:47:38,018
Yes.

988
00:47:38,043 --> 00:47:40,018
Dense sponge is
not really appetising.

989
00:47:40,043 --> 00:47:42,778
But with the caramel,
that changes everything.

990
00:47:42,803 --> 00:47:45,418
Amos aims to carve this
sturdy caramel sponges,

991
00:47:45,443 --> 00:47:47,298
sandwiched with apple butter cream,

992
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:48,778
into a killer whale.

993
00:47:48,803 --> 00:47:50,098
Have you ever seen one in real life?

994
00:47:50,123 --> 00:47:51,538
Yes, I went to go and see one

995
00:47:51,563 --> 00:47:53,858
and the weather was too bad
so it got cancelled.

996
00:47:53,883 --> 00:47:55,378
No. So I've still yet to see them.

997
00:47:55,403 --> 00:47:58,498
We're going to see one today though.
You're going to see one today.

998
00:47:58,523 --> 00:48:00,818
Cristy's making a sponge
for an aquatic species

999
00:48:00,843 --> 00:48:02,778
that's a little easier to spot.

1000
00:48:02,803 --> 00:48:06,058
I'm making a duck because,
when my eldest daughter, Ava,

1001
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,418
was younger, that's something
we used to do,

1002
00:48:08,443 --> 00:48:10,778
always go to the pond
to feed the ducks.

1003
00:48:10,803 --> 00:48:13,378
Cristy's sponges, made with
fresh and frozen raspberries,

1004
00:48:13,403 --> 00:48:15,138
will be sandwiched with raspberry

1005
00:48:15,163 --> 00:48:16,458
and almond liqueur jam

1006
00:48:16,483 --> 00:48:17,778
and then carved and decorated

1007
00:48:17,803 --> 00:48:19,458
to look like a mallard.

1008
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:21,218
Who's tasted this at home?
All of them.

1009
00:48:21,243 --> 00:48:23,138
And what did they say? All the kids?

1010
00:48:23,163 --> 00:48:25,858
Yeah, they... Did they love it?
It's my daughter's favourite sponge

1011
00:48:25,883 --> 00:48:28,298
so they like it anyway but
they've seen the duck, yeah,

1012
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:30,658
I think they think I'm
losing my mind, to be honest.

1013
00:48:30,683 --> 00:48:33,498
Cristy's duck won't be
alone on the river.

1014
00:48:33,523 --> 00:48:35,778
My animal cake is a beaver.

1015
00:48:35,803 --> 00:48:38,178
A beaver?! A beaver.

1016
00:48:38,203 --> 00:48:40,098
Why did you choose a beaver?

1017
00:48:40,123 --> 00:48:42,018
I dressed up once as a beaver.

1018
00:48:44,323 --> 00:48:47,418
I'm not even sure I know
what a beaver looks like so...

1019
00:48:48,603 --> 00:48:50,298
Stop it!

1020
00:48:50,323 --> 00:48:52,618
Quite sort of shapely.

1021
00:48:52,643 --> 00:48:56,098
Nicky's future in the competition
rests on a chocolate and rum sponge

1022
00:48:56,123 --> 00:48:58,018
sandwiched with a blackberry jam.

1023
00:48:58,043 --> 00:49:00,738
And she's even given
her beaver a name.

1024
00:49:00,763 --> 00:49:02,218
The lovely Norman.

1025
00:49:02,243 --> 00:49:03,898
Norman the beaver?
Norman the beaver.

1026
00:49:03,923 --> 00:49:05,338
You've won already.

1027
00:49:06,763 --> 00:49:08,458
Congratulations. Well done.

1028
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:10,738
You got the shake.

1029
00:49:10,763 --> 00:49:12,578
Thank you!

1030
00:49:12,603 --> 00:49:14,378
Right they're going in.

1031
00:49:14,403 --> 00:49:16,218
With multiple sponges
needed to create

1032
00:49:16,243 --> 00:49:18,178
the building blocks
for their animals...

1033
00:49:18,203 --> 00:49:20,978
Get in there. ..the bakers will
need to juggle batch baking...

1034
00:49:21,003 --> 00:49:22,618
Bake well, little cakes.

1035
00:49:22,643 --> 00:49:24,898
...as well as varying oven times.

1036
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:28,498
I'm baking them for...30 minutes.

1037
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:31,898
But Tasha has more
to juggle than anyone else.

1038
00:49:31,923 --> 00:49:35,018
Six sponges.
Just a lot to deal with.

1039
00:49:35,043 --> 00:49:37,458
They'll have to be OK -
I haven't got time to remake them.

1040
00:49:37,483 --> 00:49:39,338
Tasha's six-sponge giant robin

1041
00:49:39,363 --> 00:49:41,258
will have a dark chocolate
and ginger filling

1042
00:49:41,283 --> 00:49:44,138
featuring another of
her unusual ingredients.

1043
00:49:44,163 --> 00:49:45,218
Tahini?

1044
00:49:45,243 --> 00:49:47,098
Tahini. Tahini. Love tahini.

1045
00:49:47,123 --> 00:49:49,458
Tahini in a cake -
I've never had that.

1046
00:49:49,483 --> 00:49:52,338
How big is it? Is it going to be
bigger than a robin, I presume?

1047
00:49:52,363 --> 00:49:53,778
It's about that tall.

1048
00:49:53,803 --> 00:49:56,378
Big. Standing up or flying?

1049
00:49:56,403 --> 00:49:58,138
It'll only be flying if it falls.

1050
00:50:00,443 --> 00:50:02,778
To prevent their animal cakes
from falling,

1051
00:50:02,803 --> 00:50:04,378
the bakers will need a filling

1052
00:50:04,403 --> 00:50:06,738
that not only holds their
construction together...

1053
00:50:06,763 --> 00:50:08,618
Got quite a thick ganache
so I can sort of set it

1054
00:50:08,643 --> 00:50:10,618
and it stays quite rigid
when I carve it.

1055
00:50:10,643 --> 00:50:14,018
...but that also complements
the flavours in their sponge.

1056
00:50:14,043 --> 00:50:17,898
450qg of peanut butter went in
my peanut butter frosting.

1057
00:50:17,923 --> 00:50:20,258
Well, in my opinion, I think
it's quite subtle, the taste.

1058
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,578
This is my filling, butter cream.

1059
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:25,738
But it's just not tasting right
so I keep adding more tahini.

1060
00:50:25,763 --> 00:50:28,378
Norman's coming to life
with a vanilla butter cream

1061
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:31,458
with some vanilla rum thrown in.

1062
00:50:32,683 --> 00:50:35,618
A boozy beaver! That is the best.

1063
00:50:35,643 --> 00:50:38,098
And Nicky's not the only one
hitting the bottle.

1064
00:50:38,123 --> 00:50:39,978
I'm making a lobster.

1065
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,338
Flavours are inspired
by my favourite cocktail.

1066
00:50:42,363 --> 00:50:44,938
Rowan's memories of seaside trips
when he was a boy

1067
00:50:44,963 --> 00:50:46,778
will be recreated with a lobster

1068
00:50:46,803 --> 00:50:48,298
that has the grown-up taste

1069
00:50:48,323 --> 00:50:49,698
of a Cosmopolitan,

1070
00:50:49,723 --> 00:50:50,978
with Valencian orange sponge,

1071
00:50:51,003 --> 00:50:52,218
sharp lime curd

1072
00:50:52,243 --> 00:50:53,818
and a cherry coulis.

1073
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:56,338
Paul and Prue yesterday
said my flavours were good,

1074
00:50:56,363 --> 00:50:58,618
but intensify them, don't be scared.

1075
00:50:58,643 --> 00:51:00,018
So I'm not.

1076
00:51:00,043 --> 00:51:02,618
This just makes me want to
put vodka in it, to be honest.

1077
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:06,658
Bakers, you are halfway through.
You have two hours left.

1078
00:51:06,683 --> 00:51:08,938
Hey, I'm happy.

1079
00:51:08,963 --> 00:51:10,338
Boom.

1080
00:51:10,363 --> 00:51:11,898
Not ready.

1081
00:51:11,923 --> 00:51:15,018
While some sponges are ready
to cool and then carve...

1082
00:51:15,043 --> 00:51:16,978
They're browning
in spots on the top

1083
00:51:17,003 --> 00:51:19,338
which is not what
they've ever done before.

1084
00:51:19,363 --> 00:51:21,618
...Nicky and Amos
could be falling behind.

1085
00:51:22,723 --> 00:51:23,938
And they're not alone.

1086
00:51:26,443 --> 00:51:29,458
Tad bit under. Hurry up, cake.

1087
00:51:29,483 --> 00:51:32,898
Saku needs to bake two huge orange
and poppy seed sponges

1088
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,658
for a sea turtle
that she's given a Sri Lankan name.

1089
00:51:36,683 --> 00:51:41,378
Tikiri the turtle.
Tikiri is "little" in my language,

1090
00:51:41,403 --> 00:51:45,698
as well as it is my husband
and my son's middle name.

1091
00:51:47,163 --> 00:51:50,458
But they are
very big people for me.

1092
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:53,378
Just take these edges off...

1093
00:51:53,403 --> 00:51:54,818
...before Paul sees.

1094
00:51:54,843 --> 00:51:57,098
They are what they are.

1095
00:51:57,123 --> 00:51:58,818
Lovely.

1096
00:51:58,843 --> 00:52:02,698
Just need to start to
build up the body of the dog.

1097
00:52:02,723 --> 00:52:06,418
This is my engineering background
hopefully coming into effect today.

1098
00:52:06,443 --> 00:52:08,298
Never built many dogs -
that's the problem.

1099
00:52:10,723 --> 00:52:15,178
So these need to cool down
the quickest they ever can.

1100
00:52:15,203 --> 00:52:17,178
Whilst Amos could
finally be on his way

1101
00:52:17,203 --> 00:52:20,098
to constructing a killer whale,

1102
00:52:20,123 --> 00:52:22,578
Abbi has chosen
to build on dry land.

1103
00:52:22,603 --> 00:52:26,258
I'm making a Herdwick sheep.
In fact, here he is.

1104
00:52:26,283 --> 00:52:29,178
Herbet the Herdwick sheep
will be carved from ginger sponge,

1105
00:52:29,203 --> 00:52:32,898
sandwiched with salted caramel
Italian meringue butter cream,

1106
00:52:32,923 --> 00:52:35,418
rhubarb jam and
a hazelnut praline crunch.

1107
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:38,058
It's a very easy template
compared to some of

1108
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:41,138
the other bakers, cos
it's just a fat, round sheep.

1109
00:52:41,163 --> 00:52:42,978
I'm just going to cut out some ovals

1110
00:52:43,003 --> 00:52:45,298
and then stack them up
on top of each other.

1111
00:52:45,323 --> 00:52:46,658
Grazing in the next field will be

1112
00:52:46,683 --> 00:52:48,578
something a little
more complicated.

1113
00:52:48,603 --> 00:52:50,218
That was just my little plan.

1114
00:52:50,243 --> 00:52:52,578
I like precision with all
the weighing everything out.

1115
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:54,978
I said I'd do a cake for my mum.
This year she's 60.

1116
00:52:55,003 --> 00:52:57,458
She said she'd like a highland cow
cos it's her favourite animal.

1117
00:52:57,483 --> 00:53:00,218
We've got fluffy toys
and cushion covers

1118
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:02,098
and she's got mugs with it on.

1119
00:53:02,123 --> 00:53:05,178
Josh's mum's highland cow
will be made with coffee,

1120
00:53:05,203 --> 00:53:06,658
date and walnut sponges,

1121
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,418
filled with maple syrup caramel

1122
00:53:08,443 --> 00:53:09,858
and cream cheese icing.

1123
00:53:09,883 --> 00:53:12,738
I've got quite a stiff
filling for it

1124
00:53:12,763 --> 00:53:15,418
because the head of
the cow is heavier

1125
00:53:15,443 --> 00:53:17,778
and I didn't want to do
any sort of supports in there,

1126
00:53:17,803 --> 00:53:20,138
I want to have it
as a free-standing cake.

1127
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,458
Amos is also hoping
to build his killer whale

1128
00:53:22,483 --> 00:53:24,018
without any supports.

1129
00:53:24,043 --> 00:53:25,738
# Be brave, Amos

1130
00:53:25,763 --> 00:53:27,458
# As my mum would say. #

1131
00:53:28,843 --> 00:53:30,018
But without support,

1132
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:33,178
the taller animal cakes
run the risk of extinction.

1133
00:53:33,203 --> 00:53:37,858
We'll start to hold them
together with some dowels.

1134
00:53:37,883 --> 00:53:39,498
I think it works.

1135
00:53:39,523 --> 00:53:41,738
Today is no time to be scared.

1136
00:53:44,203 --> 00:53:47,418
The buttercream's too soft.

1137
00:53:47,443 --> 00:53:51,818
The whole thing
is just moving.

1138
00:53:51,843 --> 00:53:53,338
Stay, Bruno.

1139
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:54,858
Never did what he's told.

1140
00:54:02,443 --> 00:54:05,378
Amos' killer whale cake
is drowning in dense sponge

1141
00:54:05,403 --> 00:54:07,178
and melting butter cream.

1142
00:54:07,203 --> 00:54:09,538
I'm just trying to prop it up
so it stays stiff in the fridge

1143
00:54:09,563 --> 00:54:11,898
so then eventually
I'll be able to carve it.

1144
00:54:11,923 --> 00:54:13,858
Otherwise there's no whale.

1145
00:54:16,283 --> 00:54:17,578
How's Free Willy going?

1146
00:54:17,603 --> 00:54:19,898
It's all going wrong.

1147
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,258
If you want, I've got a black
and white sweatshirt -

1148
00:54:22,283 --> 00:54:24,618
I'll be your killer whale.
Perfect. Please.

1149
00:54:24,643 --> 00:54:27,098
I'll just sit cross-legged
on the wave.

1150
00:54:27,123 --> 00:54:29,338
We can winch me in.

1151
00:54:30,323 --> 00:54:32,658
Some bakers have planned
to build animal cakes

1152
00:54:32,683 --> 00:54:35,338
with more than just
carved sponge and butter cream.

1153
00:54:35,363 --> 00:54:38,218
I'm just making the head
out of modelling chocolate.

1154
00:54:38,243 --> 00:54:39,498
It's a bit soft.

1155
00:54:39,523 --> 00:54:43,338
Then I'm going to mix in puffed rice
to sculpt the sheep's head.

1156
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,578
This is for the turtle head.
It's very sticky.

1157
00:54:46,603 --> 00:54:48,938
It is the stickiest
substance known to man.

1158
00:54:48,963 --> 00:54:50,818
It's going to take you ages
to wash that off.

1159
00:54:50,843 --> 00:54:52,618
June, I expect.

1160
00:54:52,643 --> 00:54:54,498
Making Gracie's tennis ball.

1161
00:54:54,523 --> 00:54:56,098
She doesn't know how to do catch,

1162
00:54:56,123 --> 00:54:59,098
so |'ll throw the ball, she'll
take it, won't bring it back.

1163
00:54:59,123 --> 00:55:01,938
She'll just play with it
and then expect me to go get it.

1164
00:55:01,963 --> 00:55:03,338
She's high status.

1165
00:55:03,363 --> 00:55:04,458
She's a diva.

1166
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:08,298
This is the head and the legs.

1167
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:14,498
Can't you tell?

1168
00:55:16,003 --> 00:55:18,258
There's just one hour remaining.

1169
00:55:18,283 --> 00:55:19,138
Going to be tight.

1170
00:55:19,163 --> 00:55:20,658
I should be assembling by now.

1171
00:55:20,683 --> 00:55:22,898
Gee whizz, we'd better get cracking.

1172
00:55:24,483 --> 00:55:26,778
I'm going to give it five minutes,

1173
00:55:26,803 --> 00:55:30,458
and hopefully it will stiffen up.

1174
00:55:30,483 --> 00:55:32,178
This is Herbert's head.

1175
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:35,938
Even if the bakers have completed
their basic animal structures...

1176
00:55:35,963 --> 00:55:37,498
Just worried about my cake leaning.

1177
00:55:37,523 --> 00:55:40,058
...Prue and Paul will be looking
for impressive decoration.

1178
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:42,498
I don't know if that's going
to freak out the judges.

1179
00:55:42,523 --> 00:55:45,258
"Hi, Rowan, what have you made?"
A dead lobster.

1180
00:55:45,283 --> 00:55:47,818
He's alive. Norman lives.

1181
00:55:47,843 --> 00:55:49,258
This part's pretty difficult.

1182
00:55:49,283 --> 00:55:51,738
Milk chocolate and dark
chocolate butter cream.

1183
00:55:51,763 --> 00:55:54,098
Looks a bit like
a rogue animal at the moment.

1184
00:55:54,123 --> 00:55:57,018
There'll be some tahini
in the butter cream as well,

1185
00:55:57,043 --> 00:55:58,378
to pipe the feathers.

1186
00:55:58,403 --> 00:56:00,738
But before
he can pipe his finish...

1187
00:56:00,763 --> 00:56:03,578
It's bad times, innit? Cos
everyone's already on their way.

1188
00:56:03,603 --> 00:56:05,858
...Matty has had another issue
with butter cream.

1189
00:56:07,883 --> 00:56:09,858
Let me guess what you're making.

1190
00:56:09,883 --> 00:56:12,178
For that colour,
are you making an elephant?

1191
00:56:12,203 --> 00:56:14,178
It's supposed to be a black dog.

1192
00:56:15,403 --> 00:56:17,178
Matty is attempting to recreate

1193
00:56:17,203 --> 00:56:19,178
his family's cooker spaniel, Marty,

1194
00:56:19,203 --> 00:56:22,258
with lemon sponges filled with
lemon curd and fresh raspberries

1195
00:56:22,283 --> 00:56:25,058
and a black coat made from
Swiss meringue butter cream.

1196
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:26,458
What you going to do? It's grey!

1197
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,538
We'll pretend he's not black.

1198
00:56:28,563 --> 00:56:31,018
Have you got no more food colouring
that's black? Yeah, there is

1199
00:56:31,043 --> 00:56:33,938
but, like, I don't want to spend
half an hour trying to get black.

1200
00:56:33,963 --> 00:56:35,898
There are grey dogs out there.

1201
00:56:35,923 --> 00:56:37,858
Thankfully.

1202
00:56:37,883 --> 00:56:40,818
These are legs.
And that will be the head.

1203
00:56:40,843 --> 00:56:43,138
I'L have to cover his head
in fondant.

1204
00:56:43,163 --> 00:56:45,058
Not very thin, not very thick.

1205
00:56:46,443 --> 00:56:48,298
Fondant is heavy.

1206
00:56:48,323 --> 00:56:50,218
This is always the nervy bit
for me just because

1207
00:56:50,243 --> 00:56:52,858
once it's on you,
you're pretty much committed.

1208
00:56:52,883 --> 00:56:55,698
Its weight can press down
on the sponge beneath...

1209
00:56:55,723 --> 00:56:57,218
So, come in nice and tight.

1210
00:56:57,243 --> 00:56:59,178
...making the cake dense and heavy.

1211
00:56:59,203 --> 00:57:02,738
I'm just moulding in with my fingers
just the detail of her eyes.

1212
00:57:02,763 --> 00:57:05,418
Something that Amos
is yet to worry about.

1213
00:57:05,443 --> 00:57:07,258
Got carving to do
then I've got assembly.

1214
00:57:07,283 --> 00:57:09,778
It's not going to be ready.

1215
00:57:09,803 --> 00:57:11,378
I've run out of red butter cream...

1216
00:57:14,163 --> 00:57:15,418
...which makes the front look messy

1217
00:57:15,443 --> 00:57:17,098
and I know that's
going to annoy them.

1218
00:57:17,123 --> 00:57:19,698
Come on, Norman. We can do this.

1219
00:57:19,723 --> 00:57:21,418
Still got to butter cream
the whole thing.

1220
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:27,058
Painting bit is the hardest part.

1221
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:30,498
These are indentations,
I need to put green.

1222
00:57:32,243 --> 00:57:35,378
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

1223
00:57:36,523 --> 00:57:37,978
OK.

1224
00:57:38,003 --> 00:57:40,698
So many wonderful
creatures out there.

1225
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:42,058
It's like Noel's Ark.

1226
00:57:45,203 --> 00:57:46,938
I've got more like that.

1227
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:50,378
So I'm going to do, like,
an isomalt pond.

1228
00:57:50,403 --> 00:57:53,338
So I've got a photograph of her
eyes, and then blown it up

1229
00:57:53,363 --> 00:57:55,618
and then got it transferred
into edible paper.

1230
00:57:57,883 --> 00:57:59,698
I just can't.

1231
00:57:59,723 --> 00:58:02,018
Absolutely nothing
that can be done now.

1232
00:58:02,043 --> 00:58:04,258
I'll just do some texture.

1233
00:58:05,443 --> 00:58:07,218
I just need to keep on going.

1234
00:58:11,523 --> 00:58:13,178
Several coats to go.

1235
00:58:13,203 --> 00:58:15,138
God better get a shift on.

1236
00:58:15,163 --> 00:58:16,498
Try and get some black on there

1237
00:58:16,523 --> 00:58:18,938
but that's probably
going to weigh it down.

1238
00:58:20,283 --> 00:58:21,618
My word.

1239
00:58:21,643 --> 00:58:23,858
He does have a little face coming.

1240
00:58:27,443 --> 00:58:31,098
I'm not done.
I just need... I need...

1241
00:58:31,123 --> 00:58:32,618
I don't know what I need.

1242
00:58:32,643 --> 00:58:36,658
I'd like to neaten him up a lot
but we are where we are.

1243
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:39,218
Try and make it look
somewhat pretty.

1244
00:58:39,243 --> 00:58:41,498
He's so cute.

1245
00:58:41,523 --> 00:58:42,418
Then the teeth.

1246
00:58:42,443 --> 00:58:44,778
I'm now really worried. Time?

1247
00:58:44,803 --> 00:58:47,418
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

1248
00:58:53,203 --> 00:58:55,018
Got a dog over here.

1249
00:58:55,043 --> 00:58:56,178
We're getting there.

1250
00:59:00,883 --> 00:59:02,538
White chocolate spaghetti.

1251
00:59:02,563 --> 00:59:06,338
Just got to try...
get the head done for her.

1252
00:59:06,363 --> 00:59:07,698
One minute left.

1253
00:59:07,723 --> 00:59:09,978
Come on, you can do this.

1254
00:59:10,003 --> 00:59:13,218
We can give him a tail.

1255
00:59:13,243 --> 00:59:15,098
Go on, Norms. Got it.

1256
00:59:15,123 --> 00:59:17,618
Your time is up.

1257
00:59:20,363 --> 00:59:21,978
This is awesome.

1258
00:59:22,003 --> 00:59:23,538
Look at that robin.

1259
00:59:24,763 --> 00:59:26,498
Piece of poo.

1260
00:59:32,883 --> 00:59:36,538
It's judgment time for
the show-stopping animal cakes.

1261
00:59:38,843 --> 00:59:41,498
Cristy, would you like
to bring up your Showstopper?

1262
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,818
It's beautifully conceived.

1263
00:59:48,843 --> 00:59:50,218
I love the colours of it

1264
00:59:50,243 --> 00:59:52,658
and I love that river
the duck's sitting on.

1265
00:59:52,683 --> 00:59:53,938
This is isomalt lake.

1266
00:59:55,683 --> 00:59:57,178
You've broken his lake.

1267
00:59:57,203 --> 00:59:58,658
That's beautiful.

1268
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,978
That is a raspberry cake.
Isn't that lovely?

1269
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:07,698
That's gorgeous, yeah.

1270
01:00:07,723 --> 01:00:09,498
And the raspberry's really tart.

1271
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,378
It cuts through the sweetness
of the white chocolate.

1272
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:12,578
It hits the side of your... Yeah.

1273
01:00:12,603 --> 01:00:15,538
It's lovely.
I must not eat any more of it.

1274
01:00:20,403 --> 01:00:22,658
This is Maisie. And she's

1275
01:00:22,683 --> 01:00:24,338
bursting with excitement.

1276
01:00:24,363 --> 01:00:25,698
Look at her little face.

1277
01:00:27,843 --> 01:00:29,018
Rough and ready.

1278
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:30,138
She'd take that.

1279
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:37,658
She's made from lemon and orange
sponge cake with lemon butter cream.

1280
01:00:37,683 --> 01:00:40,218
Far more elegant inside
than it is outside.

1281
01:00:40,243 --> 01:00:41,698
Yes.

1282
01:00:44,283 --> 01:00:45,538
Delicious.

1283
01:00:45,563 --> 01:00:48,018
It's a straightforward cake
and you've got the right level

1284
01:00:48,043 --> 01:00:49,938
of flavours
running through each layer.

1285
01:00:49,963 --> 01:00:52,898
Not over sweet, just full of flavour,
so well done, Keith. Well done.

1286
01:00:58,283 --> 01:01:00,298
It looks like it's been run over.

1287
01:01:02,843 --> 01:01:05,778
Really nice cake.
I like the flavour of the filling.

1288
01:01:05,803 --> 01:01:07,818
I've never seen
a spaniel that colour though.

1289
01:01:07,843 --> 01:01:09,218
Me either.

1290
01:01:09,243 --> 01:01:10,858
Right, yeah.

1291
01:01:15,643 --> 01:01:18,058
That's really impressive.
It's really good.

1292
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:19,418
It's orange sponge,

1293
01:01:19,443 --> 01:01:21,858
lime curd and a cherry
Swiss meringue butter cream.

1294
01:01:21,883 --> 01:01:23,218
It's almost tutti frutti,

1295
01:01:23,243 --> 01:01:25,618
where you've got several
flavours all in one

1296
01:01:25,643 --> 01:01:26,978
and you can't identify any of them.

1297
01:01:27,003 --> 01:01:28,938
Yeah, I know, I was
struggling with what it was.

1298
01:01:28,963 --> 01:01:31,338
But it is delicious. It is nice.

1299
01:01:36,603 --> 01:01:38,458
It's astonishing to look at.

1300
01:01:38,483 --> 01:01:40,858
It's just beautiful.
It's so accurate. It's amazing.

1301
01:01:40,883 --> 01:01:43,138
That could be turtle shell.

1302
01:01:43,163 --> 01:01:45,458
This is orange and poppy seed cake

1303
01:01:45,483 --> 01:01:46,938
with orange butter cream.

1304
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:51,538
It's quite stodgy.

1305
01:01:51,563 --> 01:01:54,178
And it's over baked
quite dramatically.

1306
01:01:54,203 --> 01:01:57,138
I think this is a classic case
of style over substance.

1307
01:02:02,643 --> 01:02:04,258
He's totally adorable.

1308
01:02:04,283 --> 01:02:06,098
Let's see how he tastes.

1309
01:02:06,123 --> 01:02:08,458
Sorry. Aw!

1310
01:02:10,003 --> 01:02:11,058
Cake looks great.

1311
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:13,418
Rich chocolate with milk
chocolate ganache

1312
01:02:13,443 --> 01:02:15,698
and milk chocolate
and dark chocolate butter cream.

1313
01:02:21,123 --> 01:02:24,018
Buttercream on the outside
goes beautifully with the chocolate,

1314
01:02:24,043 --> 01:02:25,818
so the whole thing is very moreish.

1315
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:28,138
And very, very intense.

1316
01:02:28,163 --> 01:02:30,498
I think you've done Bruno
very proud.

1317
01:02:30,523 --> 01:02:32,898
Brilliant. Yeah, I think so.
Amazing. Thank you.

1318
01:02:35,283 --> 01:02:36,418
It's charming,

1319
01:02:36,443 --> 01:02:39,658
and I love the way one of her eyes
is completely gone with the fringe.

1320
01:02:41,243 --> 01:02:42,938
The coffee and the date work well

1321
01:02:42,963 --> 01:02:45,338
but there's quite
a lot of butter cream in this.

1322
01:02:50,043 --> 01:02:52,778
Quite flat here. What happened?

1323
01:02:52,803 --> 01:02:55,578
Um, she's quite a flat dog.

1324
01:02:55,603 --> 01:02:57,458
She is - she doesn't have
much body to her.

1325
01:02:57,483 --> 01:02:58,938
I need to feed her a bit more.

1326
01:03:01,003 --> 01:03:03,338
It's banana cake topped
with a cinnamon crumble

1327
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:05,258
and with peanut butter
frosting in between.

1328
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,138
That's a strong peanut, that.

1329
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:12,938
The peanut's quite dominant.

1330
01:03:12,963 --> 01:03:14,338
I'm not getting any banana.

1331
01:03:14,363 --> 01:03:16,618
I think less peanut
would've been better.

1332
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:19,658
Go on, Gracie.

1333
01:03:19,683 --> 01:03:21,178
She'll love you!

1334
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:24,578
You can eat that now, Dan.

1335
01:03:30,003 --> 01:03:31,418
Straight off, it looks great.

1336
01:03:31,443 --> 01:03:33,778
It's got real character to it
in the face.

1337
01:03:33,803 --> 01:03:36,098
Paul is now going to
cut his head off I dare say.

1338
01:03:36,123 --> 01:03:38,578
I'll go into its rear quarter.

1339
01:03:38,603 --> 01:03:41,938
He is a ginger sponge,
salted caramel butter cream,

1340
01:03:41,963 --> 01:03:43,938
rhubarb jam, a hazelnut brittle

1341
01:03:43,963 --> 01:03:45,738
and then black sesame butter cream.

1342
01:03:51,603 --> 01:03:54,818
The rhubarb jam is excellent
and so is the cake.

1343
01:03:54,843 --> 01:03:56,458
You've got a sharpness
from that rhubarb,

1344
01:03:56,483 --> 01:03:57,978
so the ginger and the rhubarb marry,

1345
01:03:58,003 --> 01:04:00,338
and then you have that
hazelnut which is delicious.

1346
01:04:00,363 --> 01:04:03,178
With a bit of crunch.
You've done a really good job, Abbi.

1347
01:04:03,203 --> 01:04:04,818
Thank you very much.

1348
01:04:04,843 --> 01:04:07,458
Amos, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

1349
01:04:21,523 --> 01:04:23,178
You can see what it is.

1350
01:04:23,203 --> 01:04:26,538
It's a shame everything's
sort of slipped slightly.

1351
01:04:26,563 --> 01:04:29,938
Caramel sponge and then
we have an apple butter cream.

1352
01:04:29,963 --> 01:04:33,898
Your cake looks a little doughy,
as if it's become compressed.

1353
01:04:40,323 --> 01:04:41,898
It's tough as old boots.

1354
01:04:41,923 --> 01:04:45,018
And on top of that, you've got the
weight of everything going round it

1355
01:04:45,043 --> 01:04:46,618
so it's concertinaed up.

1356
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:49,658
It's bone dry as well.

1357
01:04:51,043 --> 01:04:53,298
Because you've kept it in the oven.

1358
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:56,418
Very stodgy, over sweet.

1359
01:04:56,443 --> 01:04:58,338
Not your best day.

1360
01:04:58,363 --> 01:04:59,898
Not in the slightest.

1361
01:05:04,243 --> 01:05:06,538
Nicky, can you bring your
Showstopper up, please?

1362
01:05:06,563 --> 01:05:07,658
Here we go, Norman.

1363
01:05:12,763 --> 01:05:15,018
So, Nicky,
tell us about your beaver.

1364
01:05:24,163 --> 01:05:26,618
All right, I'll try again.

1365
01:05:26,643 --> 01:05:29,498
So, Nicky, tell us about
your Showstopper.

1366
01:05:29,523 --> 01:05:31,818
Norman is made out
of chocolate cake.

1367
01:05:31,843 --> 01:05:33,218
He's got a blackberry jam

1368
01:05:33,243 --> 01:05:34,738
and he's got a chocolate ganache

1369
01:05:34,763 --> 01:05:36,258
that's got some rum in it.

1370
01:05:36,283 --> 01:05:40,258
Straight out of a cartoon,
isn't he? Yes, it's beautiful.

1371
01:05:40,283 --> 01:05:43,258
Very heavy on the fondant on
the outside, really thick.

1372
01:05:51,283 --> 01:05:53,178
It's quite a solid cake, Nicky.

1373
01:05:53,203 --> 01:05:55,098
Do you think you over baked it?

1374
01:05:55,123 --> 01:05:57,538
A little, but... A lot. A lot.

1375
01:05:57,563 --> 01:05:59,538
Texture's all wrong, unfortunately.

1376
01:05:59,563 --> 01:06:01,218
It is solid

1377
01:06:01,243 --> 01:06:04,178
and it shouldn't be bone dry.
It's a real shame.

1378
01:06:07,323 --> 01:06:10,258
Tasha, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

1379
01:06:20,763 --> 01:06:22,458
That is incredible.

1380
01:06:22,483 --> 01:06:23,578
Thank you.

1381
01:06:23,603 --> 01:06:24,738
It's sensational.

1382
01:06:24,763 --> 01:06:27,178
The pipework, the colour,
the stance,

1383
01:06:27,203 --> 01:06:29,458
you know instantly what it is.

1384
01:06:29,483 --> 01:06:30,738
This robin has personality.

1385
01:06:32,443 --> 01:06:34,738
So I've made a tahini sponge

1386
01:06:34,763 --> 01:06:38,338
with a chocolate, ginger
and tahini butter cream.

1387
01:06:49,563 --> 01:06:52,058
I think of tahini
as a savoury flavour

1388
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:53,498
and this is a cake,

1389
01:06:53,523 --> 01:06:55,818
and it's not too savoury
and it's not too sweet -

1390
01:06:55,843 --> 01:06:57,098
it's just very delicious.

1391
01:07:01,123 --> 01:07:02,658
I don't like that, Tasha.

1392
01:07:04,683 --> 01:07:05,978
I love it.

1393
01:07:06,003 --> 01:07:08,658
God, what a relief.

1394
01:07:08,683 --> 01:07:11,258
I thought I was going to
have my first big battle

1395
01:07:11,283 --> 01:07:13,658
with Paul Hollywood on Bake Off

1396
01:07:13,683 --> 01:07:17,538
because I would've gone to the wall
to defend you if he meant it.

1397
01:07:17,563 --> 01:07:19,338
I love the flavour of the tahini.

1398
01:07:19,363 --> 01:07:21,818
And actually, the tahini
with the chocolate,

1399
01:07:21,843 --> 01:07:24,138
you've got a nice balance
between the two.

1400
01:07:24,163 --> 01:07:25,498
And it's such a big cake.

1401
01:07:25,523 --> 01:07:27,018
That's a lot of work in that.

1402
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,698
I think you've done
a fantastic job.

1403
01:07:28,723 --> 01:07:30,098
Thank you so much.

1404
01:07:41,403 --> 01:07:45,698
Wow! That was so much better
than I could've ever imagined.

1405
01:07:47,123 --> 01:07:49,378
It's a complete disaster.

1406
01:07:49,403 --> 01:07:51,658
Where do I rank?

1407
01:07:51,683 --> 01:07:52,738
Bottom?

1408
01:07:52,763 --> 01:07:54,738
Literally praying to all
the gods out there,

1409
01:07:54,763 --> 01:07:56,018
fingers and toes crossed.

1410
01:07:56,043 --> 01:07:58,938
I would be over the moon
if I was here next week.

1411
01:07:58,963 --> 01:08:01,218
But it would also be a shock.

1412
01:08:03,523 --> 01:08:06,458
So it's been Alison's
first week in the tent.

1413
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:09,458
It's been lovely. Slotted right in.
I love our bakers as well.

1414
01:08:09,483 --> 01:08:11,778
I really don't want to see
anyone go today.

1415
01:08:11,803 --> 01:08:13,298
Dan's done very well again.

1416
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:15,618
And Cristy.
And I think Abbi has as well.

1417
01:08:15,643 --> 01:08:16,738
Abbi's done really well.

1418
01:08:16,763 --> 01:08:20,058
But it is going to be tricky
to decide who's going to go home.

1419
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:21,698
For instance, Amos. Yeah.

1420
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:24,738
When you looked at his orca,
the problem was it was so dense.

1421
01:08:24,763 --> 01:08:28,258
So I think it automatically puts
Amos in a very difficult position.

1422
01:08:28,283 --> 01:08:30,578
I have to put Dana
into that position.

1423
01:08:30,603 --> 01:08:32,418
The peanut overwhelmed everything.

1424
01:08:32,443 --> 01:08:35,098
There is somebody else who struggled
over the last couple of days.

1425
01:08:35,123 --> 01:08:36,338
Which would be Nicky. Was Nicky.

1426
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:38,698
Her beaver looked amazing
but it was bone dry.

1427
01:08:38,723 --> 01:08:41,938
Yeah. I don't like dry beavers,
do you?

1428
01:08:41,963 --> 01:08:44,258
Hate dry beavers.
Am I in a Carry On film?

1429
01:08:44,283 --> 01:08:45,458
Look, stop this.

1430
01:08:59,963 --> 01:09:01,698
Congratulations, Bakers -

1431
01:09:01,723 --> 01:09:04,018
you've got to the end of Cake Week.

1432
01:09:04,043 --> 01:09:08,938
Now, I've got the lovely job of
announcing Star Baker of the week.

1433
01:09:08,963 --> 01:09:11,218
The first Star Baker is...

1434
01:09:15,643 --> 01:09:17,538
...D to the A to the N,
you know it's Dan!

1435
01:09:20,803 --> 01:09:22,018
Congratulations.

1436
01:09:24,723 --> 01:09:27,498
Unfortunately, that leaves me
with such a horrible job

1437
01:09:27,523 --> 01:09:29,818
cos it's the first week,
and we're just getting to know you,

1438
01:09:29,843 --> 01:09:32,178
but sadly someone does have to go.

1439
01:09:33,323 --> 01:09:35,178
And that person is...

1440
01:09:42,563 --> 01:09:44,378
...Amos. I'm sorry.

1441
01:09:50,563 --> 01:09:53,218
Sorry, mate. You did a good job.

1442
01:09:53,243 --> 01:09:56,738
It was obviously the Showstopper
that stopped my show.

1443
01:09:56,763 --> 01:10:00,218
As soon as I heard my name,
I came out of my body.

1444
01:10:06,563 --> 01:10:08,058
Sorry. I'm fine. Sorry.

1445
01:10:17,883 --> 01:10:20,298
You were amazing.
Thank you. Thanks very much.

1446
01:10:20,323 --> 01:10:21,658
I'm shocked that I'm here

1447
01:10:21,683 --> 01:10:24,858
and I'm really, really sad for Amos.

1448
01:10:24,883 --> 01:10:29,978
What a warm-hearted,
lovely man he is.

1449
01:10:30,003 --> 01:10:33,978
Tomorrow, what you'll remember
is you got into Bake Off.

1450
01:10:34,003 --> 01:10:37,618
It's been amazing being in
that group of people, walking in

1451
01:10:37,643 --> 01:10:41,938
that tent on that first day and it's
softening the blow a little bit.

1452
01:10:43,563 --> 01:10:46,658
Well done, Dan. Thank you
so much. You were so good.

1453
01:10:46,683 --> 01:10:49,458
Just surreal. Surreal, honestly.
The dog did us proud.

1454
01:10:49,483 --> 01:10:52,458
And he won me Star Baker,
so nice one, Bruno.

1455
01:10:52,483 --> 01:10:53,938
I'm really pleased for Dan.

1456
01:10:53,963 --> 01:10:56,338
They say that you're going to
be like a family and I was like,

1457
01:10:56,363 --> 01:10:58,418
"No," but actually, like, you are.

1458
01:10:58,443 --> 01:11:01,338
The thought of losing just one
of these people is devastating.

1459
01:11:01,363 --> 01:11:04,058
The thought that we're all
going to, one by one,

1460
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:06,338
drop off is like, my goodness.

1461
01:11:06,363 --> 01:11:07,578
Next time...

1462
01:11:07,603 --> 01:11:08,778
Hurry up.

1463
01:11:08,803 --> 01:11:10,618
...the bakers brace for biscuits.

1464
01:11:10,643 --> 01:11:12,218
Very concerned about this.

1465
01:11:12,243 --> 01:11:13,538
With a sticky signature...

1466
01:11:13,563 --> 01:11:15,018
I don't think it would
be this messy.

1467
01:11:15,043 --> 01:11:16,178
...a tricky technical...

1468
01:11:16,203 --> 01:11:17,778
I don't know when they're
going to be ready.

1469
01:11:17,803 --> 01:11:20,098
...and a mind-bending illusion
biscuit Showstopper...

1470
01:11:20,123 --> 01:11:22,578
Chuff tog heck. This is so realistic.

1471
01:11:22,603 --> 01:11:24,258
...who will take the biscuit..

1472
01:11:24,283 --> 01:11:26,258
It's absolutely delicious. It is.

1473
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:28,258
...and whose cookie...
Cristy?

1474
01:11:28,283 --> 01:11:29,738
...will finally crumble?

1475
01:11:29,763 --> 01:11:31,138
Have you used my biscuit dough?

1476
01:11:31,163 --> 01:11:33,018
You have!

1477
01:11:33,043 --> 01:11:35,658
Are you a Star Baker in the making?

1478
01:11:35,683 --> 01:11:40,138
