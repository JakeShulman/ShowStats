1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,840
NOEL: In the beginning...

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,880
Ah, thank you very much.
Is that better?

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,240
..there were 12.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,160
So, Nicky, tell us about your
beaver?

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,160
{\an1}LAUGHTER

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,800
ALISON: Now...

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,160
This is it,
the storm is coming.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,680
..there are three.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,800
Let's see how I get on.
No! Why's it doing that?

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,240
There can only be one winner.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,080
To be honest I just,
I don't know with it.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,960
Patience!

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,760
Oh, no! I didn't dust them
in icing sugar either, did I?

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,120
It's not your best shot.

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,800
{\an1}BIRDS CHIRP

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,560
Oh, it's an empty tent
now, isn't it?

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,520
NOEL: Just three challenges
stand between the finalists

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,160
and the Bake Off title.

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,720
Best of luck.
Go, go, go, Josh.

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,120
Josh's passion for precision
was obvious from week one.

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,640
I love the way one of her eyes
is completely gone with the fringe!

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,880
By week two, he already had
the Hollywood handshake.

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,320
It's amazing.

24
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,360
But every week, he's delivered
stunning Showstoppers.

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,760
It's beautiful.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,640
Delivering him Star Baker
not once, but twice.

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,640
Just want to be able
to have three good last bakes

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,200
that I can be happy with,
but we shall see.

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,520
ALISON: This year's
first Star Baker, Dan,

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,160
has often made
his life complicated.

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,080
So I am doing the aromatic flavours
of a Thai green curry.

32
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,320
What're you thinking?!

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,360
And it hasn't always
been successful.

34
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,080
It's a bit sandy and dry.

35
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,400
But he's fought back
from disappointment.

36
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,800
These aren't baked.

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,320
Winning more technical challenges
than any of his fellow finalists,

38
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,560
the Hollywood handshake...
That's beautiful.

39
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,120
And was Star Baker again
in dessert week.

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,840
I'd love to win it,

41
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,160
but I'm against these two little
rug rats this weekend.

42
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,320
Such good lads, I'm going
to have to really raise my game.

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,640
NOEL: Matty's time in
the tent did not begin well.

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,760
Can't give that to anyone!
But he's listened.

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,840
It looks like it's been run over.

46
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,160
And learned.
The look of it is really very good.

47
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,680
Polishing decoration...
Your box is beautifully engineered.

48
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,800
And perfecting flavours.

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,560
The chilli is great in there.

50
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,720
Oh!

51
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,560
But despite a handshake
and winning Star Baker twice,

52
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,520
he's never won
a Technical Challenge.

53
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,800
I would say that I'm the underdog.

54
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,560
Everyone likes the underdog,
though, right? Please!

55
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,640
Welcome back to the tent, bakers,

56
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,560
for your last ever
Signature Challenge.

57
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,440
The judges would like you

58
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,680
to bake eight exquisite,
highly decorative eclairs.

59
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,600
You should choose two different
types in terms of decoration

60
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,360
and flavour. Now remember guys,
this is the final,

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,360
so the judges would like you
to bake in the nude!

62
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,200
And when Noel says judges,
he means Prue.

63
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,120
You have two hours and 15 minutes.
On your marks.

64
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,480
Get set. Bake!

65
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,960
Can't believe this is
the last signature I'm going to do.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,080
I'm a bit nervous,
I just hope these look all right.

67
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,760
There's a lot of personal pride
for each one of us.

68
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,720
We all play sport,
we're all competitive.

69
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,640
When I play football, I always had
to wear two pairs of socks.

70
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,840
I've got four pairs
of underpants on today!

71
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,600
Because I'm going to need 'em...

72
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,880
They've got to make two different
types of eclairs,

73
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,840
and they've got to be perfect.

74
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,840
The pastry needs to be really
puffed up, and crisp as anything.

75
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,880
But you want beautiful air holes
in the inside which you can fill

76
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,360
with cream or custard.

77
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,920
But the problem is you can add
too many creams and custards to it

78
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,560
and make it soggy.

79
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,360
They've all had two Star Bakers,
they've all had a handshake,

80
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,440
so they are absolutely
level pegging.

81
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,680
And I haven't a clue
who's going to win.

82
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,080
And if they want to win
The Great British Bake Off,

83
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,520
start now with the eclair.

84
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,600
Hello, Dan. Hi, good morning.
Hello, Dan. Hiya, you all right?

85
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,920
Right tell us all about
your eclairs. What are you doing?

86
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,680
So I'm doing strawberries and cream
and a summer fruit punch jelly.

87
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,120
And for my second one I'm doing
a salted caramel mascarpone cream

88
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,240
with a praline ganache on top.
Sounds very nice.

89
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,960
Yeah, don't they sound good?

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,480
ALISON: Dan will top his salted
caramel and praline eclairs

91
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,920
with crisp tempered chocolate.

92
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,440
His strawberries and cream eclairs
will be decorated

93
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,800
with Chantilly cream
and cubes of jelly.

94
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,440
Tell us about your choux.

95
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,680
Some of the first pastries
I sort of learnt to make,

96
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,320
so I've got my set recipe
and it never fails!

97
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,400
Good. So far! So far, yeah.

98
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,240
ALISON: Josh is also hoping
to fill choux pastry

99
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,160
with a taste of summer.

100
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,320
Is this some of your own fruit
from your own garden?

101
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,440
Well, actually it's not
now because... No!

102
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,160
Because I've used it all up!
You've used all your fruit!

103
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,880
There's nothing left out there.
Now it's just like a barren garden.

104
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,600
I keep bringing it all in
and it's all gone.

105
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,160
What flavours are you doing?

106
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,360
We're going to do coconut,
mango and raspberry.

107
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,240
NOEL: Alongside his summery eclair,
Josh plans another filled

108
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,240
with coffee pastry cream
and topped with dark chocolate

109
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,520
and coffee icing.

110
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,960
That's for my brother cos
he's not a huge fruit lover at all.

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,160
So most of the things
that I've been making recently,

112
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,480
he's not really liked them.

113
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,680
What does he say? Does he go,
"Yeah, that's all right"?

114
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,120
Yeah, he'll try a bit.
Exactly like that!

115
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,240
Thanks for the encouragement!

116
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,680
So you need to melt the butter
first then bring it to a boil.

117
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,360
Get your flour in and then beat
the living daylights out of it!

118
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,520
ALISON: Unless the finalists
combine butter,

119
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,760
milk and flour
with the perfect amount of egg...

120
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,680
I'm a smidge under.

121
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,280
..their choux will be loose,
creating flat, soggy eclairs.

122
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,240
I've avoided choux pastry like
the plague up until this week.

123
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,080
NOEL: Matty's hoping to play it safe
with two classics,

124
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,400
Black Forest Gateau eclairs,

125
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,040
topped with
a Kirsch Chantilly cream,

126
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,280
and Banoffee eclairs featuring
a walnut and pecan praline.

127
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,480
You all right?
I'm so happy for you.

128
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,880
I'm so happy that you're here.
So you feel like you could do this?

129
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,240
Yeah, no, I've not really given
any of that a thought.

130
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,400
I never applied, so I never really
had that as like a thought process.

131
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,440
So you didn't apply for this?
No, Lara applied for me.

132
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,760
Oh, I love Lara!

133
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,680
He would never have applied
for himself.

134
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,320
{\an8}It's just not in his nature.
He's not braggy.

135
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,200
I wanted him to be a part
of something like this,

136
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,560
to show to him how amazing he is.

137
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,520
Because doesn't matter how much
I tell him, he doesn't believe me.

138
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,960
{\an8}I don't actually understand most
of the things he's made.

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,520
No, exactly! If I'm absolutely
honest. Especially you,

140
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,080
cos you're not a dessert person
anyway, really. I'm not, no.

141
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,840
So it's all a bit over my head.

142
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,880
So his ability has obviously
increased as he goes along.

143
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,640
He made our anniversary cake
last year, didn't he? Did he?

144
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,600
Don't. It was a lemon cake.
Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah.

145
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,480
Sorry, it was very nice!

146
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,960
He'll go to school, he'll do all
of his after school clubs. Perfect.

147
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,120
He'll get in,
start baking straight away,

148
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,520
baking until we go to bed.

149
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,240
And there were times when he's been
running around the kitchen

150
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
like a headless chicken
that I've thought,

151
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,800
"Oops. Like this is all my fault."

152
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,680
I don't know when the penny's going
to drop that he's good at baking,

153
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,360
I definitely think he can win it.

154
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
Good luck, Matty.
Good luck, Matty. Cheers.

155
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,160
I want you to actually think about
you actually winning.

156
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,080
Possibly winning it. All right.
You've got to start visualising it.

157
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,160
Yeah, that's actually
what Lara says. Visualise.

158
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,800
Start visualising like you winning.

159
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,800
But before any of the finalists
can see themselves winning...

160
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,200
Come on, don't play games.

161
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,000
They'll need to take
a long hard look at their choux.

162
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,520
This is the part where I said
about trusting your instinct.

163
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,120
You need it to fall off
in three seconds.

164
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,280
Do you know how many videos
I've had to watch?

165
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,560
I'm going to start piping them out.

166
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,840
So I'm just looking for
a bit of uniformity.

167
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,000
You can see my hands shaking,
can't you, as well.

168
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,960
Choux has a mind of its own.

169
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,880
Without a dusting of icing sugar,

170
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,040
an eclair won't have
its classic crisp shell.

171
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm doing two different types
of choux.

172
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,520
But Josh has decided
to go even further.

173
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,760
I've gone for a chocolate
craquelin topping.

174
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,360
Couple of millimetres thickness is
all you need.

175
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,000
Do or die now.

176
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,040
They're going to go in
for 40 minutes.

177
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,160
Half an hour, 175.

178
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,560
15 minutes at 200.

179
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,760
Take it down to 175
for another 15 minutes,

180
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,760
maybe 20. Maybe 25.
I want them to be dry.

181
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,560
Ah, no, I didn't dust them
in icing sugar either, did I?

182
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,000
Too late now, innit? Did you
put icing sugar on yours, Matty?

183
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,720
Yes, mate, did you?
Forgot, didn't I? Oh, no way.

184
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,880
It would be me not forgetting
there was something,

185
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,640
would it? Josh, how you doing, mate?
Yeah, I think OK.

186
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,440
Choux looking all right? Yeah.

187
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,280
Good lad. How are ya? Flipping
all over the place like you.

188
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,920
I'm dreaming it's just like the most
surreal week ever, isn't it?

189
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,400
And your kids don't know that you're
in the final? I've told them.

190
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,280
You've told them?
Told them yesterday.

191
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,080
My kids don't know that I do this.
Don't they? No. No, it's probably

192
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,360
the best way, cos I tell you what,
it went down like a lead balloon

193
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,880
yesterday when I told them.

194
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,480
What do you mean? What, nothing?

195
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,240
Gave you nothing? He just went,
"You lied." And then he give me

196
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,960
the old father talk, like,
"I'm very disappointed in you."

197
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,080
Oh, no. "I'm not angry.
I'm just disappointed."

198
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,160
Disappointed.

199
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,160
From the top ropes.

200
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,880
This lie is the biggest burden

201
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,800
of my life, especially when
I tell my children, never lie.

202
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,240
But obviously this is
a slight exception.

203
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,480
My eldest wanders into the kitchen.
He doesn't really question anything.

204
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,400
"Oh, what you doing today, Dad?"
I'm just like,

205
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,040
"Yeah, I'm just making an electric
guitar out of puff pastry,"

206
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,680
and he's like, "Cool." And just like
wanders off with his iPad.

207
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,680
He just thinks
I'm absolutely crackers, I think.

208
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,880
Mm-hm.

209
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,280
But there are some members
of Dan's family that know
what he's been up to.

210
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,960
It's been very difficult
keeping it quiet

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,800
and not telling the world
that my son's in Bake Off.

212
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,800
I'm so proud of him.

213
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,400
What was Dan like as a little lad?

214
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,840
He was a whirlwind. He was cheeky,

215
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,720
he was mischievous as well.

216
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,280
The trophies that he's won
playing football.

217
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,360
They used to line his bedroom walls.

218
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,480
It never got to his head
that he was man of the match

219
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,920
or Player of the Year.
He's very critical of himself.

220
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,400
I want to make sure I put my kids
in bed, you know, and try

221
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,360
and live that sort of
normal life and help out,

222
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,360
doing all the family stuff
as much as possible.

223
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,920
Soon as eight o'clock strikes
it's in here until

224
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,360
I'm done, basically.
So, yeah, it's totally covert,

225
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,880
door closed.
Luckily they're good sleepers.

226
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,520
Whatever happens,
I'll make sure that I leave

227
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,960
the tent as I came in,

228
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,360
with a big smile on my face,
cos I've absolutely loved it.

229
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,360
Good luck, Dan.
You'll absolutely smash it.

230
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,440
Cheers, thank you.

231
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,600
Do you think he can win?

232
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,080
Yes. I think he can.

233
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,800
They're not as dark
as they normally are.

234
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,880
Bakers, you are halfway through.

235
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,440
As their choux bakes,

236
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,680
the finalists will need every minute
to perfect two delicious fillings.

237
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,280
Creme pat. This is
a chocolate one,

238
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,920
then I'll turn my attention
to the banana one.

239
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,000
This is for my eldest lad,
loves his salted caramel ice cream,

240
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,200
so I thought I'd pay homage
to the wonderful boy that he is.

241
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,160
Whilst Dan and Matty race
to create separate fillings

242
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,880
for each of their two eclairs...

243
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,400
Decent.

244
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
..Josh has perfected a short cut.

245
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,640
Just prepping pastry creams now.

246
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,920
I've been tweaking with the recipes

247
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,320
so I can have exactly
the same base for both of them.

248
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,160
One's going to be a coffee one.
This one has got coconut milk.

249
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,440
Just means I can do 'em
a little bit quicker cos I know

250
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,000
it's a lot of pressure on today.

251
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,960
That's our VIP experience
at Gardener's World.

252
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,200
Very clever lad. Yeah.
He likes perfection.

253
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,600
Yeah. So he'll keep going

254
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,600
and doing something until he's got
as best as he can get.

255
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,320
See, Nanny always has a smile
on her face wherever we are.

256
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,080
And she's always got colourful
necklaces on like Prue, hasn't she?

257
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,600
Oh, like Prue. Yes, she has.

258
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,480
His love of baking
did stem from being with Nanny.

259
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,400
My mum always fetched him
out of school.

260
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,920
And they'd go back to her house
and then would be baking.

261
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,440
Josh's nan Frieda
first encouraged him to apply

262
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,880
for Bake Off back in 2019.

263
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,320
Looking very smiley.

264
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,960
She died in 2021.

265
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,760
Nanny was a big part of him
applying the second time around.

266
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,040
He really wanted to do it
for her because...

267
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,880
It's OK darling.

268
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,280
She so wanted him
to be on that show.

269
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,560
She'd loved all his baking.
She says you go for it,

270
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
you go for it. And...

271
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,920
And he's gone and he's got to the
final and I can't believe it.

272
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,480
Sorry. It's all right.
Poor mum. I know.

273
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,880
Do you want it, Josh?
I mean it'd be. Do you want it?

274
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,520
It would be lovely wouldn't it but.
Come on Josh, you gotta...

275
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,240
All I'm visualising in my head is
what my Showstopper should look

276
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,440
like tomorrow.
Yeah. What's the one thing

277
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,080
you're going to miss
from the tent? You, of course.

278
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,560
Is the right answer!
Is the right answer.

279
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,440
See you in a bit, bub.

280
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,640
Apart from not putting
my icing sugar on so they're not

281
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,560
as coloured as I'd like, they're
looking all right. I'm quite happy.

282
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,480
Another five minutes just
to make sure I finish those off.

283
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,840
Think I'm all right
with how it looks.

284
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,840
Ah, let's give it a minute.
Out of my depth.

285
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,960
Alison's just informed me that she
went, "What you going to miss most

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,560
out of this tent?"
and you said "you" to her.

287
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,880
Absolutely furious.
Thought we had something, Josh.

288
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,800
Seven years I've been doing
this, Josh, seven years.

289
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,280
I'm going to prick some holes
in the top of 'em

290
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,600
to let that little steamies escape.

291
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,360
Chocolate creme pat is done,

292
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,040
the Chantilly cream is whipped.
Trying to multitask.

293
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,800
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

294
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,280
Oh, you're joking me.

295
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,160
You having a tin bath?

296
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,920
{\an1}THUNDER ROLLS

297
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,280
This is it, the storm is coming.

298
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,720
This is banana for the banoffee.

299
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,120
The choux are a minute off
being done.

300
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,040
Really, really happy.

301
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,960
I can, I can just hear
that they're hollow.

302
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,280
Just going to poke some holes
in 'em to release steam.

303
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,840
Then I'm going to put 'em back in
just for like five minutes.

304
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,160
This just hopefully
completely dries them out.

305
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,000
I've left,
I've left them on the bloody tray,

306
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,000
haven't I? Now they've gone soft.

307
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,680
This tent does strange things to me.

308
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,800
Fortunately I've got
lots of really good ones,

309
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,480
so I can just pick
my four favourites.

310
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,560
Cherry jam.

311
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,120
I'm just going to blitz this
so it can fold through into

312
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,960
the cream. Yeah, that's cool.

313
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,960
These are going to be macerated
with summer fruit punch.

314
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,480
See how I get on. Ah,
why's it doing that?

315
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,920
This is the coffee pastry cream.

316
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
I'll pipe a bit in the first hole
and then I go for

317
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,320
the second hole then

318
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,400
I'll stop once this first hole
starts to ooze out again

319
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,120
so I sort of. I know that
I've gone all the way through.

320
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,360
You have 15 minutes left.

321
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,280
I don't think I'm going to be able
to do it, am I?

322
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,040
Creme pat first.
I need to get as much in as I can.

323
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,200
Chantilly cream, voila.

324
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,080
Icing.

325
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,440
It's difficult to get
the bananas to squeeze through.

326
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,440
This is my debut appearance of
a transferring onto acetate.

327
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,640
Just do some very thin lines
of chocolate.

328
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,520
This is my praline paste.
This is going into my ganache.

329
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,800
You have five minutes left.

330
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,320
Just about OK, time wise.

331
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,400
I just want to finish off these
other ones now.

332
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,480
I'm going to run
out of filling I think.

333
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,480
Ah! BLEEP.

334
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,800
Sorry.

335
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,160
Bakers, you only have one
minute left.

336
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,360
One minute?

337
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,760
I've done that the wrong way round,
haven't I? BLEEP. You berk.

338
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,400
Oh, you flipper.

339
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,240
Ah!

340
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,680
Bakers, your time is up.

341
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,880
Please step away from your final
Signature Challenge eclairs.

342
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,360
{\an8}It's judgment time in
the final Signature Challenge.

343
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,920
Hi, Josh. Hello. Hi, Josh.
Hiya.

344
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,160
{\an8}Like the look of them.

345
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,520
I think they're all pretty
much the same size.

346
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,280
Pretty uniform across the board.

347
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,040
Well, that's perfectly filled.

348
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,080
I'm always so cross when I have
an empty eclair.

349
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,480
The flavours are very delicate.

350
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,760
But they are absolutely delicious.

351
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,920
I think, for me, it's
a little bit too sweet.

352
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,000
OK. It almost needs a sharpness
to make that pop even more.

353
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,520
This is the chocolate coffee.

354
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,720
Yeah.

355
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,960
Now, that's clever.
Chocolate's the right level.

356
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,560
It gives a lovely texture to it
as well, the craquelin on the top.

357
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,440
The craquelin. Coffee level is
absolutely spot-on, filled well.

358
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,920
Baked well. That's delicious.

359
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,440
I love coffee eclairs.

360
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,240
And it is perfect. Thank you very
much. Thank you, Josh. Thank you.

361
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,040
{\an8}Those cherry on
the top look ridiculous.

362
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,000
OK. Um, if you're going to put
cherry on

363
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,800
the top make sure it's all the same.

364
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,200
Shall we start with
the banana first?

365
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,800
I like the flavour of the banana.

366
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,800
You're missing the caramel.

367
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,760
I know you tried to get it on
the outside.

368
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,120
But for banana lovers,
this is perfect.

369
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,120
Thank you.

370
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,920
Now that's the first one we've had
that is properly firm.

371
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,560
I like the taste of
the Black Forest gateau.

372
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,320
You could've done more cherry. OK.

373
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,040
But I think the chocolate is lovely.

374
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,640
Booze is good.

375
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,680
And most of all I like
the crisp firm eclair.

376
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,240
Thank you, Matty. Thank you.

377
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,040
These look a bit messy.

378
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,560
These, it's the wrong shape
for this. Ah, right, OK.

379
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,000
You can't have something that's
too big that sits over the top.

380
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,400
Right. Shadowing underneath.
Shadowing what's underneath.

381
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,400
Right, OK, got ya.
I think you've attempted too much.

382
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,240
They do look very soggy.

383
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,680
The flavour is lovely,
it's not too sweet.

384
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,360
It's really strawberries
and cream but it's a bit soggy.

385
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,360
You've destroyed it by adding
too much cream on top. On top.

386
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,560
This is the praline, isn't it?

387
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,720
Not convinced about
the flavour on that.

388
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,560
Are you not?
I think it's probably the grain.

389
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,160
I agree that the filling is not
satin smooth

390
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
but I think the flavour's great.

391
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,800
I think it looks a mess.

392
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,760
Paul picked up on all my
technical issues.

393
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,000
And again I've been guilty
of overthinking it.

394
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,880
Nine weeks ago I would not
have been able

395
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,160
to produce anything like that so,
yeah.

396
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,680
Weird.

397
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,080
I think I had quite a strong
signature, overall.

398
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,760
We've just got
the technical now to get through.

399
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
And hopefully it isn't just
step one,

400
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,640
make this and that's it.

401
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,800
I'm hoping for a little bit
of help along the way.

402
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,160
The bakers' last Technical Challenge
is as ever a total mystery.

403
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,880
It's time for your final
Technical Challenge

404
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,000
and today it's been set
for you by Mr Paul Hollywood.

405
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,880
What can we say about
Paul Hollywood?

406
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,480
We've heard his poetry,
we've seen his dance moves,

407
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,360
we've seen him strip down to trunks
and wrestle a live bear.

408
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,440
I'm sure you've all fallen in love
with him

409
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,880
and he loves you too, although he
will destroy you one by one.

410
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,320
Paul, have you got any words

411
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,080
of advice for our
incredible finalists?

412
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,280
For perfection, you're
going to need patience.

413
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,880
As ever this Technical Challenge
will be judged blind

414
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,200
so we're going to have
to ask these two to leave the tent.

415
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,880
And it's the last
Technical Challenge

416
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,720
so you know where they're going,
don't you?

417
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,640
Where they going?
To make sweet, sweet love.

418
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,760
For your final Technical Challenge
Paul would like you

419
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,480
to bake a batch
of nine lardy cake slices.

420
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,600
Now the judges will be looking

421
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,560
for perfectly laminated dough,

422
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,000
packed with soaked fruit
and home-made candied peel.

423
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,920
You have three hours.

424
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,000
On your marks. Get set.

425
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,520
Bake!

426
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,000
Right, let's have a look at ya.

427
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,600
A lardy cake?

428
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,920
I've heard the name but I don't have
a clue what one looks like.

429
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,920
No-one makes lardy cake, do they?

430
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,280
No. Not since the War.

431
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,800
No, it s it, it sounds like one from
that era, doesn't it?

432
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,320
Do you not know what
a lardy cake is? No.

433
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,440
Oh, dear.

434
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,400
What a lovely nostalgic bake
for a final. Lardy cake.

435
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,480
We've revisited a British classic.

436
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,400
It's been around
for hundreds of years

437
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,920
and it was a way
of using up predominantly pig fat.

438
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,000
But don't forget fat is flavour.

439
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,720
Yeah.
So I'm really flavoursome.

440
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,920
{\an1}PRUE LAUGHS MILDLY

441
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,840
It's a cross between
a Danish pastry and a bread.

442
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,840
This is all about getting your
timing right.

443
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,920
Get the dough done as quickly
as possible

444
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,120
to get it in that prover and then
you're layering it with sugar...

445
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,800
Folding it. ..lard, butter and
fruit.

446
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,480
On the second prove, be patient.

447
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,480
The longer the better.

448
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,400
That opens the whole thing up

449
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,640
but it'll condense if they don't
bake it properly

450
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,560
and it'll look and taste quite raw.

451
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,760
You can see the layers. It's lovely.

452
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,360
And you can see all the fruit in
there evenly distributed.

453
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,880
Lard, sugar and a bit of
fruit. Heaven.

454
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,000
Line the roasting tin
with baking paper then grease

455
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,240
with lard and sprinkle with sugar.

456
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,040
I assume this is going to help
colour up the lardy cakes.

457
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,240
Obviously, you are the oldest of
the bakers.

458
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,760
I am, yes. So you must know what
a lardy cake is.

459
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Make the bread dough.

460
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,400
Make the bread dough.

461
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,480
50g of lard.

462
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,240
So I'm going to bread crumb it
then add yeast and water.

463
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,920
I'll just add a little bit at
a time.

464
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Add the water and then I think once
it comes together I'm going to put

465
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,160
the lard in. I don't know.

466
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,920
Don't know if I should be doing it
like this.

467
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,480
Sounds really healthy, lardy cake.

468
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,480
That's the problem
with baking, innit?

469
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,160
{\an1}HE SQUEAKS

470
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,520
Yeah, I've got to do plenty
of runs once this has finished.

471
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,320
The kneading.

472
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,120
How many times have we made
a variation of bread?

473
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,360
Is this even bloody bread?
What is this?

474
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,560
I'm going to lob it in
the proving drawer.

475
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,560
Probably go for half an hour
but we'll just see how we're doing.

476
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,960
I'm not happy with that
but I'm just going to go with it.

477
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,920
Bye-bye, my little cherub.

478
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,280
I'm going to go for about 30 mins.

479
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,480
See how it looks.

480
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,400
Patience is the key.

481
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,880
Step five, make diced candied orange
boiling twice in fresh water

482
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,520
and then a third time in
sugar syrup.

483
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:31,440
Using the microwave for speed,
infuse the dried fruit with the tea.

484
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,920
Smells lovely.
Do you put any rum in it?

485
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,720
No. Cos I'm from Jamaica I soak my
fruits in rum.

486
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,360
In rum. There's none.

487
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,600
Any vodka?

488
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,640
No. Gin?
Nothing unfortunately, just water.

489
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,160
Oh. Just water. Dry. Yeah. I know.

490
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,600
With a, with a... BOTH:
..with a teabag!

491
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,800
Finalists, you are halfway through.

492
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,240
Brrr-uuupppp.

493
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,960
That's been in for about
35 minutes.

494
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,880
That's been in for 45 minutes.

495
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,680
Laminate the dough with lard,
butter and filling mixture.

496
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,640
Doesn't say what to do with
the lard?

497
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,320
Do you reckon I smear the lard?

498
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,800
Let's get rocking and rolling.

499
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,000
I think I might actually just make
sure I've got this evenly spread.

500
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,360
Maybe I brush the lard on.

501
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,000
Have you had a breakdown?
What's happening here?

502
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
{\an1}NOEL LAUGHS

503
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,880
Look at you just brushing lard.

504
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,640
It's a bit strange...

505
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,120
I think me and you might as well
just grease ourselves up in lard.

506
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,080
Just go the whole hog.
I'm in if you are.

507
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,920
I'd never turn something like
that down.

508
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,960
Right lamination let's make some
space for t'lamination.

509
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,200
Perform three single letter folds.

510
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,080
Which is that.

511
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,400
Or is it that?

512
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,240
Going to do it carefully cos I
want them to see those layers.

513
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,480
Spin it round 90 degrees.

514
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,480
Obviously everything's
a bit warm, unfortunately.

515
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,080
But that's one letter fold so.

516
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,520
I want the layers to be even.

517
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,200
Butter's getting a bit warm.

518
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,720
That's two. Stay with me, bread.

519
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
Need to give it one more fold.

520
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,440
I'm not liking the look of this.

521
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,760
Pleased with that.

522
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,680
And then it just says prove in tin.

523
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,920
The second prove needs
to be as long as possible.

524
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,560
But any attempt to speed
it up in the heat of

525
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,080
the proving drawer
could melt the lard,

526
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,120
ruining the rise
and the lamination.

527
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,320
No, maybe I just leave it on
the side.

528
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,080
Oh, no, yeah, put it in the drawer.

529
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,520
I, I really want to give it half
an hour prove.

530
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,320
Half an hour.

531
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,840
Um...

532
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,720
I don't know how long to bake for.

533
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,840
If I can work out bake time.

534
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,400
So, bake 40?

535
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,360
Bakers, you have an hour left.

536
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,480
That means prove only two minutes,
uh, 20 minutes.

537
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,040
{\an1}BEEPING

538
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,280
{\an1}THUNDER RUMBLES

539
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,040
I'm going in.

540
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,880
It's feeling very, very springy so
that's what you want.

541
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,360
So I'm going to put that in.

542
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,200
I'm going to start with
half an hour.

543
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,880
Look at that.This is looking great.
Look at that. The worst thing is,

544
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,200
Dan, you don't...
NOEL WHISTLES

545
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,600
..know whether that is what it's
supposed to look like, do ya?

546
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,280
Uh, not a clue, no.
And it doesn't look brilliant.

547
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,000
Bake, I'm thinking 200... 200's my
go-to temperature for bread.

548
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,160
30? Maybe 40, maybe 30.

549
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,080
Patience.

550
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,400
It's like painful.

551
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,960
You have 15 minutes left.

552
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,000
Just don't, I don't know with it.

553
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,440
It's had half an hour now.
I shall give it another.

554
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,400
35's what I had in my head.

555
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,880
I've just cranked it up
to 220 just to...

556
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
{\an1}HE WHISTLES

557
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,440
..give it a wiggle.

558
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,560
Maybe another five?

559
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,560
Wants you to leave it in the tin
for ten minutes before turning out.

560
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,320
OK start that now.

561
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,600
I'm bringing it out.

562
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,560
It's dark, mine.
Looks like it's been cremated.

563
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,200
Brush the lardy cake with
the reserved orange syrup.

564
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,080
Cool completely upside down then
cut to nine rectangles.

565
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,200
There's no chance
of me cooling it completely.

566
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,360
How long do we have left?

567
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,960
Bakers,
you've got five minutes left.

568
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,160
Right.

569
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,160
{\an1}CLATTERING

570
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,600
Looks pretty tasty, doesn't it?

571
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,160
This is very hot still

572
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,800
and I'll be lucky to cut it in any
way, shape or form.

573
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,160
I can smell the orange.

574
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,360
Oh! Looks a bit dense in places.

575
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,840
Well, you can see the layers,
can't you?

576
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,480
Baked anyway.

577
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,640
Bakers, your time is up.

578
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,640
Please bring your lardy cakes
and place them behind your photos.

579
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,920
They're varying degrees
of weirdness, aren't they?

580
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,120
Paul and Prue are expecting
golden brown lardy cakes

581
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,680
with clearly defined layers

582
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,720
and evenly packed
with plump sweet fruit.

583
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,840
Obviously they've been struggling
with proving.

584
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,960
OK.

585
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,200
We start with this one.

586
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,120
We have got nine
and they are sort of square.

587
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,320
That one feels a little bit light,
which is good.

588
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,920
The lamination, you can see
the lines going across.

589
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,280
Mm. The flavour's there.

590
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,560
But what's so lovely about this
is the mixed peel.

591
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,000
I think that's really delicious.

592
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,280
{\an1}THEY LAUGH

593
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,000
Now, moving on to this,
um...King Alfred, um...

594
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,840
Now, it's only slightly King Alfred,
come on.

595
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,320
It's... Slightly?

596
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,960
Well, it's caramelised a lot.

597
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,240
It is caramelised a lot.
It's overbaked.

598
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,360
So you can see the layers.
They're sort of not very even.

599
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,320
It's a nice flavour.
It's just a little bit dry.

600
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,400
Hmm, it's too dry.
It is too dry.

601
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,320
Moving on.
This isn't properly baked, is it?

602
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,400
No. Got lots of fruit in it,
but it's a bit raw.

603
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,040
It has got lots of fruit
in it. Yeah.

604
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,600
It needed more proving as well,
but it is quite dense, this.

605
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,760
You see how quite raw that is?
Hmm.

606
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,240
Because that hasn't been laminated
properly. It's a shame.

607
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,480
Paul and Prue will now rank the
lardy cakes from worst to first.

608
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,240
OK, in third spot, we have...

609
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,120
..this one. Whose is this?

610
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,000
Matty. Lamination is really bad.

611
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,080
It needed more proving and more
baking. Right. No problem.

612
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,920
Number two, we have this one.

613
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,000
Dan. Stayed in the oven a bit
too long, didn't it?

614
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,400
Which means in first place, we have
this one, Josh.

615
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,040
It's pretty decent.
It's the right colour

616
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,040
and it's certainly the right
flavour, so well done.

617
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,080
Well done, mate.
APPLAUSE

618
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,880
I'm buzzing after that.
Really, really pleased.

619
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,160
I would say Josh has probably got
his nose in front

620
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,520
and then, yeah, me and Matty
are scrapping at the bottom.

621
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,800
Oh!

622
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,240
Bloomin' hell.

623
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,080
I'm glad I had a good Signature,

624
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,880
cos otherwise I'd probably be
a bit deflated.

625
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,400
{\an8}There's just one challenge remaining
in this year's Bake Off.

626
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,840
Very quiet walk this time, isn't it?
Yeah, very quiet.

627
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,160
In the zone.

628
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,720
Well, guys, we've made it
to the final. I just hope

629
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,840
the sunshine comes out. I'm sure it
will. I'm gutted.

630
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,080
So who do you think's bringing
the sunshine right now? Are they
even at the moment?

631
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,120
I think it is pretty even.
I think Josh has got a slight edge.

632
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,720
Yeah, I think he's slightly ahead.

633
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,960
Weirdly, Matty is sitting in second
place, I would say.

634
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,680
If he wins it, he would've played an
absolute blinder. A blinder,

635
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,480
absolutely. Cos he's always just
underneath the top.

636
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,480
Can we talk a little bit about Dan?

637
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,280
I think he's going to struggle
against the other two at the moment,

638
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,960
but I think what often happens
in the final bake is

639
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,200
the pressure gets to them.
Any one of them could win.

640
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,400
What about Amos?

641
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,200
Outsider. Great.

642
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,760
So I've just put £20,000 on Amos
to win.

643
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
{\an1}THEY LAUGH

644
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,160
It's good odds.

645
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,640
I bet.

646
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,560
Bakers, it's your final ever
Showstopper Challenge.

647
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,880
The judges would like you to create
an elegant tiered celebration cake

648
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,000
inspired by your very first bake.

649
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,480
They would like you to take your
first bake

650
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,320
and elevate it into
something incredible,

651
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,320
something that could win
the entire competition.

652
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,160
You have four and a half hours
for this.

653
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,240
On your marks.
Get set.

654
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,160
Bake!

655
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,440
Come on, Dan, flour power is needed.

656
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,000
There's lots of elements to do
so timing is definitely the thing
I'm most worried about.

657
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,360
I just know how I want it to look.

658
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,120
I will spend the time to make it,
and that will be my downfall.

659
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,840
They have to make
a minimum three-tier cake

660
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,120
to celebrate their very first bake.

661
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,920
But we're looking for that to be
the inspiration

662
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,040
for something completely new
and different and wonderful.

663
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,560
We want it highly decorated,
we want tartness,

664
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,720
we want sweetness, we want textures.

665
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,600
This is the biggest bake
they will ever do.

666
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,200
If it was me, I'm a big fan of
the lemon drizzle.

667
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,760
That would be my favourite.

668
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,560
But sometimes the bakers tell us
that this is

669
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,720
going to be a lemon cake and it
doesn't have enough lemon flavour.

670
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,200
You have to deliver what you say
you're going to deliver.

671
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,880
DAN: My first footstep into baking
was a lemon drizzle cake.

672
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,120
A lemon meringue pie as well,

673
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,240
so my three-tiered cake today is
celebrating both of those

674
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,000
two absolute beauties of
the baking world.

675
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,880
Dan's final tilt at the title

676
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,320
{\an8}is a towering triple-tiered love
letter to lemon drizzle,

677
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,840
{\an8}layered with lemon curd,

678
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,680
{\an8}limoncello creme mousseline
and raspberry compote.

679
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,960
His Showstopper will be finished
with torched Italian meringue,

680
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,920
shiny white chocolate collars,
and one final citrus flourish.

681
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,360
And I'm also going to make some
macarons as well

682
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
to decorate round the outside.
Lemon macarons?

683
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,080
Yeah, lemon macarons with lemon curd
and raspberry compote filling.

684
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,840
I mean, he's obviously
been doing his homework. He knows
that we like lemon.

685
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,560
It's something... Which is fine,
because it was your first bake...

686
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,520
Yeah, I love lemon. ..which is
lucky! Oh, OK. Well, yeah.

687
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
I hope... Well, I need to do
it right.

688
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,640
You know, Rahul made me a lemon
drizzle cake for my 50th birthday.

689
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,720
Oh, did he? Lovely.
Ten years ago.

690
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,640
{\an1}THEY LAUGH

691
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,200
ALISON: But one finalist is going
even more traditional

692
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,640
than a lemon drizzle.

693
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,920
The bake that it stems from is
a Victoria sponge.

694
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,840
It's the first one I remember doing
with my nan.

695
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,680
Josh will combine his first bakes
with his other passion

696
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,920
in a seasonal celebration
of his garden,

697
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,000
{\an8}with a spring and summer-inspired
rhubarb and strawberry jam

698
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,280
and autumnal apple in his
Victoria sponges.

699
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,640
It's quite tricky to put apple
in sponge, to get the flavour to
come through.

700
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,440
Yeah. For decoration, what's the
whole thing going to look like?

701
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,840
So the three tiers are decorated
for spring, summer and autumn.

702
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,240
And then I'm going to do a biscuit
greenhouse on top.

703
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,560
With boiled sweet windows?

704
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,400
Yeah, with little panels.
Yeah, like that.

705
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,400
Oh, my goodness, Josh,
this is quite a lot.

706
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,520
Sounds like a Showstopper!
Keep your cool.

707
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,680
Yeah, I'll try.
Thank you, Josh.

708
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,400
I have gone for a bit of a
stronger batter

709
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,480
so it doesn't lose its shape when it
gets put together.

710
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,840
Genoise is a little bit of
a risk, I guess,

711
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,560
to go on the bottom tier
because it's such a light cake,

712
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,960
but I feel like the pros outweigh
the cons on this one.

713
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I've gone for it
because it's quick to make,

714
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,960
quick to bake, quick to cool.

715
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,680
But I've never stacked a cake
until this week.

716
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,000
Inspired by the chocolate treats
that got him into baking,

717
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,040
{\an8}Matty's first-ever tiered cake will
see chocolate genoise sandwiched

718
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,600
{\an8}with French buttercream
and crumbled brownie,

719
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,960
and a lemon and rosemary
Victoria sandwich

720
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,160
with a fresh summer fruit jam.

721
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,120
ALISON: Now that you're a baker,
do you think you'll bring baking
into the school?

722
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,360
What bake would you bring
to your kids?

723
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,880
Probably the brownies. I've already
brought them in to 'em once,

724
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,040
but they think Lara made 'em.
Really?

725
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,920
Yeah. So you just lied and said,
"My girlfriend's brought them."

726
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,600
Yeah. Why, though? What is so
embarrassing about people knowing
that you're a baker?

727
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,920
No, I don't know, really.
I've never told anyone.

728
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,480
You don't have to lie any more
because your bakes taste amazing.

729
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,120
{\an1}HE LAUGHS

730
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,560
How these final Showstopper taste
could prove even more important

731
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,720
than the spectacular look.

732
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,520
DAN: I want my cake to be strong
with lemon,

733
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,040
but not too sort of like bleurgh!

734
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,200
I want to have the essence of
Victoria sandwich but I also want to
sort of elevate it.

735
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,040
So this is my rhubarb. They're not
my strawberries, because I ran out.

736
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,960
They've been ravaged from all of
the past weeks that I've done.

737
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,120
ALISON: But past weeks may not bode
well for Matty's chosen flavours.

738
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:49,160
In week one, I had a stinker
with the buttercream,

739
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,240
so I've changed the recipe slightly.

740
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,560
I kind of need to learn
in my own way.

741
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,360
It takes me a few mistakes
to...to learn.

742
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,400
I am slightly worried about
time already.

743
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,760
ALISON: For three tiers,
the finalists will need to bake at
least six sponges...

744
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,120
Seven minutes left.

745
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,960
..which will require batch baking...

746
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,560
Have a little look at that brownie
in a second an' all.

747
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
{\an1}..and a constant eye on the clock.
TIMER BEEPS

748
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,840
{\an1}CLATTER
HE STIFLES LAUGHTER

749
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,680
There you go, I've stopped it.
Cheers, mate.

750
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,200
Imagine if that hit Josh in the eye
and he had to go to hospital and the
whole thing was cancelled.

751
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,200
One way to stop him winning it,
wouldn't it?

752
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,520
What we onto now?

753
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,000
Done. Happy with that.

754
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,520
I can start to make
the next batter.

755
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,200
Now I'm going to go on my second
mix now.

756
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,440
Four and a half hours - do you think
it's enough time?

757
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,680
I mean, so, I think
it's ample, right?

758
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,000
No?
SHE LAUGHS

759
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,520
See how they get on.

760
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,120
Pretty happy with that.

761
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,680
These are going in. It's now all on
me getting the bakes done

762
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,680
quick enough that I can have
enough time.

763
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,040
But Dan will need to find the time
to bake more than just sponges.

764
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,240
I'm only on step four. Ridiculous!

765
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
The idea of a macaron is to get
a nice skin on them,

766
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,040
so once I've piped them, I'm going
to leave 'em for a good hour.

767
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,600
Let's get these in.

768
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,800
This is the Swiss meringue
buttercream now.

769
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,600
So I've got two on the go,
plus a bit of cake.

770
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,440
That's got about eight minutes
to go.

771
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,560
Whilst they're in the tin,
whilst they're still warm,

772
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,320
make some holes in it and then just
soak lemon juice on.

773
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,480
"Too much lemon in that, Dan."
Sorry, Paul!

774
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,560
Bakers, you're halfway through.

775
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,680
DAN: What?!

776
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,280
I know!

777
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,640
Love these ovens.

778
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,640
I think they're done. They're a bit,
like, not straight

779
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,240
but I'll have to trim that.

780
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,320
Just tasted the curd.
That tastes beautiful.

781
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,040
I've done that, that, that, that.

782
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,200
NOEL: You've just got a big list
you're working through.

783
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,800
Yeah, look. The buttercreams are
made. The jam's made.

784
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,480
Not too bad. Yeah, but this part is
where it gets, like, hard. Crazy?

785
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,200
Is that assembly? Yeah.

786
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,000
ALISON: If constructing
a three-tiered cake wasn't
hard enough...

787
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,680
It's the assembly and making it look
pretty is where I'm pants.

788
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,360
..whilst building, Dan still has
baking to do.

789
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,000
Well behind.
It's all right, I'll do it.

790
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,680
But he's not alone.

791
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,280
What's going down here?

792
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,680
This is my, um, greenhouse on top.

793
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,160
You're like Da Vinci. Have you got
enough time to do everything you
want to do?

794
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,200
I'm never going to have enough time
to do everything that I would love
to do, but...

795
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,440
Have you factored that in?
Course you have.

796
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,840
Yeah. I've got a couple of backups
of what I can do in terms of...

797
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,760
That's why I love you.
NOEL LAUGHS

798
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,680
Just in case things don't go
to plan.

799
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,040
Plan B and a plan C in your
back pocket.

800
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,480
Matty could be in need
of his own plan B.

801
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,760
That one's a little bit
not too done.

802
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,480
The sponges for his middle tier
are underbaked.

803
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,800
That's a bummer.
How long do we have?

804
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,840
Bakers, you have one hour left.

805
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,680
BLEEP.

806
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,440
Can I go home now, please?

807
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,960
Come on, Josh, come on.

808
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,880
Five minutes at really high,

809
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,800
and then I'll put 'em straight in
the freezer.

810
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,200
Probably will affect the bake
slightly, um...

811
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,400
..but it is what it is.

812
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,440
Oh, I've got my meringue to do as
well, haven't I? Flipping heck.

813
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,400
I don't think I'm going to do
it. I don't think I'm going to do
it. Help.

814
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,800
Once I've got these out the oven,

815
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,920
we'll start straight away doing
the assembly.

816
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,840
So we've got chocolate genoise,
Swiss meringue,

817
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,560
and then a chocolate French
buttercream and then brownie.

818
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,360
Let's have a little gander.

819
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,480
I'd say them two are done.

820
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,040
I don't know, but I haven't got that
much time left.

821
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,680
Whose stupid idea was this?

822
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
That's the last lot of panels.

823
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,920
Beautiful. Right.

824
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,200
That can go off now.

825
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm inserting dowels.

826
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,320
Oh, I need to put the dowels
in, actually, as well.

827
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,120
This is the
white chocolate buttercream.

828
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,880
We need to get going with cake.

829
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,200
And then freezer.

830
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,640
That's the first one of those done.

831
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,080
Right, come on.

832
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,520
40 minutes.

833
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,440
Bit of summer fruit jam.

834
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,120
I just need to get it in the fridge
for as long as it takes.

835
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,720
It's nearly there.

836
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,080
Right, macarons.

837
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,800
I've just done the middle layer
with strawberry and rhubarb jam,

838
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,400
and now I'm doing the final layer.

839
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,040
Just swapping the tiers.

840
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,640
So how long do we have left?

841
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,240
Bakers, you only have
half an hour left.

842
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,640
Yeah, I'm happy with that. Right.

843
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,320
Oh, you're joking me.

844
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,440
These should just basically
peel off perfectly.

845
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,560
Come on, you stupid thing!

846
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,360
BLEEP. It's cracking.

847
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,600
Let's see how much I learnt from
Lara's art lesson.

848
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,600
Look a bit underdone, actually.
Too soft.

849
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,520
I just don't think I've probably
made the batter well enough, to be
honest, but deal with it.

850
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,320
I need to just collect my thoughts
for a second, I think.

851
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,160
Number two.

852
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,960
Lara said you have to build up
the colour.

853
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,760
Be patient and always go
in the same direction.

854
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,160
You OK? No.

855
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,120
But you need it all to go smoothly
today, don't you?

856
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,360
Yeah. Dig deep.

857
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,480
You can do this.
I can do it.

858
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,280
ALISON: Where did you get this
design from?

859
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,720
It's kind of, like, cos I'm not very
good at doing it any other way.

860
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,320
No, but it works, though. It looks
really arty, doesn't it?

861
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,680
This is going to be spring
at the top.

862
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,640
Hard to quickly temper chocolate.

863
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,680
This is going
to look very rushed, this.

864
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,520
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

865
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,000
Come on. There we go.

866
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,400
Don't swear, Dan.

867
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,440
We're getting to kind of like

868
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,600
the critical point where I need to
stack it.

869
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,360
Don't want it to lean.

870
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,320
Dog's dinner!

871
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,560
I want to put the greenhouse on now
and then I can finish - any time

872
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,960
I've got spare
I'll just do some decoration.

873
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,640
How's long's left?

874
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,600
Looking good, bakers,
you have ten minutes left.

875
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,000
I'm going to have to rush
a lot of decoration now.

876
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,480
I need a blowtorch.

877
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,240
Don't know why I'm even bothering.

878
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,320
Gold leaf BLEEP out of it.

879
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,320
These are my giant marrows that
I harvest in the autumn.

880
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,640
I'll hide it with a macaron - Paul
and Prue will never notice.

881
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,680
I want to do some piping round
the outside of it just

882
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,200
to make it look
a little bit fancier.

883
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,800
How long we got left now?

884
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,280
One minute left.

885
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,920
It's messy, too messy.

886
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,760
Don't look behind you and look at
Josh's whatever you do.

887
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,120
Bakers, your time is now up.

888
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,480
Walk away rapidly!

889
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,480
Please step away from your bakes.

890
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,560
We love you! Well done!

891
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,840
Come on bring it in mate,
bring it in. Well done boys.

892
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,440
Woo. Well done. I just got Swiss
meringue buttercream all over your
back now!

893
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,720
It's all right don't worry
about it.

894
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,560
Oh, no my mistake you've got
four minutes left!

895
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,920
{\an1}HE LAUGHS

896
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,680
The winner of this year's Bake Off
will be announced at

897
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,640
a very special garden party in
front of

898
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,600
the bakers' families
and some old friends.

899
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,640
I'm back at the tent.
It's so exciting.

900
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,200
Just like one wee family all
together again.

901
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,720
We've got like a group chat
and we all talk on there

902
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,600
and post pictures of what we've been
doing and that's really lovely.

903
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,320
It's so nice to be here
and not be baking

904
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,480
and just feel like you can enjoy all
the wonderful cakes

905
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,320
and that that have been made.

906
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,440
In my mind I think Dan's going to
win,

907
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,560
but I think it's going to be so
close.

908
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,280
I think they're all incredible,
they're all good at different
things.

909
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,840
I don't, I literally can't call it.

910
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,680
If I had to say someone maybe
Josh.

911
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,880
Either Dan or Josh or Matty.

912
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,280
One of those.

913
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,520
I think Matty could
surprise everyone.

914
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,360
It's probably like asking a parent
to pick their favourite child,

915
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,120
it's a very difficult call - Josh!

916
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,520
Dan, for one last time bring up
your Showstopper.

917
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,120
Dan tell us all about your
final Showstopper.

918
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,960
So, this is my lemon drizzle

919
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,520
and meringue cake with a lemon curd

920
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,400
and raspberry compote,

921
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,840
topped with Italian meringue and
decorated with some

922
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,920
macarons filled with the lemon curd
and raspberry compote.

923
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,120
I quite like the white chocolate
against the raspberry.

924
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,320
I like the meringue as well.
Those macarons are terrible.

925
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,880
I know, I don't know what's gone on
with them. I wouldn't even bother
putting them on... Yeah.

926
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,600
Cos it sort of ruins it.

927
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,120
I did think it was quite ambitious
to do three chocolate collars.

928
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,080
It's cracked quite a bit.
Yeah.

929
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,960
Looks a lovely sponge though.
Does look really nice?

930
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,440
Doesn't it? Doesn't it?
Yeah.

931
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,760
You know, it needs more lemon.

932
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,080
Does it?

933
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,280
The drizzle only comes in to
so far and then it stops so.

934
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,840
Ah, OK.
But the flavour is delicious

935
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,280
and I think the bake is lovely
as well.

936
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,280
Macarons let it down dramatically.
Yeah.

937
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,000
And the bake's not right either.

938
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,320
No, I don't know what's gone on.
It's really pasty.

939
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,880
Is it? Have I not, have I not cooked
them for long enough?

940
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,360
No, you've definitely not cooked
them for long enough.
No I've not, have I? No.

941
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,360
It's just a
little bit flawed for me.

942
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,160
Work to be done for next week, then.

943
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,200
{\an1}PRUE AND PAUL LAUGH

944
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,440
Thanks, buddy!
Thanks very much.

945
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,520
Matty, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

946
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,200
Matty, tell us about
your Showstopper.

947
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,040
The top and bottom tier are inspired
by a chocolate cake.

948
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,320
So, it's a chocolate genoise
sponge, with

949
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,240
a French chocolate buttercream

950
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,120
and chocolate brownie coated in

951
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,520
a Swiss meringue buttercream.

952
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,840
Middle tier is a Victoria sponge,
so it's lemon

953
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,440
and rosemary

954
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,320
with summer fruit jam
and an American buttercream.

955
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,880
It's leaning a bit.
Dramatic effect!

956
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,400
What happened then?

957
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,760
Well, I mustn't have done much of a
job with the dowels.

958
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,000
I must say, Matty, I love
the colour combinations.

959
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,760
And the way you've done it.

960
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,400
I like the decoration,
I like the piping,

961
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,360
I like the fruit,
the drop for me is the big problem.

962
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,640
Yeah, it's done me.

963
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,400
But let's have a look
and see what it's like inside.

964
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,000
{\an1}Wow, that's one light sponge.

965
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,920
Oh! That looks beautiful, doesn't
it? Wow.

966
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,720
I mean I'm surprised it weighs
enough to cause the lean.

967
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,240
What a great cake.
Thank you.

968
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,200
Now you're getting
the chocolate coming in.

969
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,280
And it's a really light chocolaty
moreish sponge.

970
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,520
It's absolutely delicious.
Hmm.

971
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,280
I have no good reason to having
another bite, but I've got to.

972
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,680
I love the jam.
I like the cake.

973
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,360
It reminds me of some of the nice
birthday cakes I had when I was a
kid.

974
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,920
It's a beautiful sponge.

975
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,760
All the flavours are perfect.

976
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,160
Thank you.
Really perfect, Matty.

977
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,280
You know what, there's nothing wrong
with this cake,

978
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,880
except it's on the lean.

979
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,520
That's such a pity, because it's
only one mistake.

980
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,000
Yeah. Everything else is
absolutely perfect.

981
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,480
Thank you, Matty.
Thank you very much.

982
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,320
Well done, Matty, lad.
Thank you. Awesome well done, mate.

983
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,800
Good luck, mate.

984
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,160
Josh do you need
a hand getting it off the table?

985
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,040
I think I'll be OK. We'll see.

986
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,200
Josh, it's time
for your Showstopper.

987
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,720
Josh tell us all about your
final Showstopper.

988
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,480
So I've called this Showstopper
A Slice For All Seasons.

989
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,200
So it's all representing
the seasons in the garden.

990
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,560
It's all inspired by
a Victoria sandwich,

991
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,440
so the bottom tier is an apple

992
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,680
and lemon sponge with a lemon curd

993
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,400
and a white chocolate buttercream.

994
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,520
Then the top two tiers are
the same - they're an apple

995
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,440
and vanilla sponge, with
a strawberry and rhubarb jam

996
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,680
and a white chocolate,
buttercream in as well.

997
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,600
And it's all got a Swiss meringue
buttercream around the outside.

998
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,040
And my biscuit greenhouse on top.

999
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,360
I think the greenhouse is great

1000
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,760
and I think the colours
are beautiful.

1001
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,320
It is straight and it is level.

1002
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,760
The pipework is not very neat.

1003
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,280
You could've spent another half
an hour on that

1004
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,720
to create a much more
polished image.

1005
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,520
Do you want to keep this intact or
can I taste the biscuit?

1006
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,920
You can taste it if you want.

1007
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,800
There's just some strawberry in
the biscuit

1008
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,920
and they're mints used for
the panels.

1009
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,480
Very clever that.

1010
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,960
It's a sugar biscuit, isn't it?
Yeah, just, yeah, bound together
with some egg white.

1011
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,960
Really minty, isn't it?
Mm, it is minty. Incredible, yeah.
It is minty.

1012
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,320
Thank you, I really like that.

1013
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,360
Well, let's have a look
and see if we can try this spring.

1014
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,800
Mm, jam is perfect.

1015
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,400
I like the sponge.

1016
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,400
I'm not getting any apple.
It hasn't showed up to the party.

1017
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,880
No, you can't taste the apple.
No.

1018
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,680
You've gone with the rhubarb

1019
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,400
and strawberry on this one.

1020
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,280
It needs something more.

1021
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,680
OK.

1022
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,680
This one's got a little compressed
with the weight of the others.

1023
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,440
Yeah, it ha.
Mm.

1024
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,560
Mm.

1025
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,080
Lovely lemon curd.

1026
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,200
The lemon curd's nice.
Got a nice flavour.

1027
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,000
I think you need another layer
of lemon curd.

1028
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:51,080
I question whether that sponge is
actually overbaked as well.

1029
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,080
I think your flavours are adequate

1030
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,120
and for me I wanted
to see much more of your journey in

1031
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,720
the tent in that cake.

1032
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,800
I think boring is too strong
a word, but it's on its way.

1033
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,080
It's not your best shot.

1034
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,400
Thanks Josh.
Thank you very much, Josh.

1035
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,920
I think he was probably being
a bit harsher

1036
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,280
because I've set my own standards
on my Showstoppers

1037
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,920
and I and I know that was not

1038
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,080
the finesse wasn't probably quite
there as I'd like.

1039
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,600
I don't know who's going to win.

1040
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,240
I think it might be between me
and Matty, maybe?

1041
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,120
Hopefully I've done enough
with yesterday as well.

1042
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,400
Maybe.

1043
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,600
I've got absolutely no idea
to be...

1044
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,920
..honestly I don't feel
like I'm going to win it.

1045
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,880
So, I think it's between them
two, personally.

1046
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,120
Blimey!

1047
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,320
That could be enough.

1048
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,560
{\an1}CHEERING AN APPLAUSE

1049
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,320
Hey. Hello, you come here!

1050
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,640
Whilst the bakers are reunited
with their families,

1051
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,120
Prue and Paul have
a huge decision to make.

1052
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,840
That's it,
we've done the last Showstopper.

1053
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,960
Pretty good cakes.

1054
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Just stick your fingers in all
of 'em you'll be all right, Sammy.

1055
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,800
You guys are always telling Dan
to simplify.

1056
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,960
Today he definitely did simplify.

1057
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,800
Yeah. But he didn't get all
the elements right.

1058
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,560
But with Josh you've never told him
to simplify

1059
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,880
and usually his Showstoppers are,
they're a bit more clever.

1060
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,120
I don't think that
the decoration was defined enough

1061
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,040
and it wasn't up
to his usual standard.

1062
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,720
But he's still in line

1063
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,840
for winning because he had
a good day yesterday.

1064
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,520
Yeah, he did. And I think Matty has
also pushed himself into that

1065
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,120
possibility of winning as well,

1066
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,680
because of what he's done today
and because of his flavours.

1067
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,960
The only thing that was wrong
with Matty's was there was...

1068
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,320
It was on the wonk.
..on the wonk.

1069
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,400
But then you look at yesterday, in
the signature they were very close.

1070
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,000
Josh won the technical and Matty
came third in the technical.

1071
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,120
Matty was bottom.

1072
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,520
Technical yesterday was really good.
Really pleased with that.

1073
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,920
It is tight.

1074
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,560
I wouldn't want to be in your
shoes!

1075
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,360
I want a cup of tea
and another slice.

1076
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,800
OK. Can I be the person who actually
announce the winner?

1077
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,520
That's all I want?

1078
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,200
You should do it,
cos it's probably your last year!

1079
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,200
{\an1}LAUGHTER

1080
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,080
You all right, mate? Yeah, I just
need another nervous wee!

1081
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,640
You do, yeah?
I'm getting that way as well.

1082
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,360
{\an1}CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1083
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,040
First we'd like to thank everyone

1084
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,880
for coming on this beautiful
sunny day.

1085
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,200
And I'd like to invite up
the three finalists.

1086
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,560
Round of applause for Dan!

1087
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,520
{\an1}CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1088
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,320
Josh!

1089
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,920
And Matty!

1090
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,720
{\an1}CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1091
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,040
Obviously, we'd want every single
one of you to win,

1092
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,920
but there can only be one winner.

1093
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,000
So, it gives me great pleasure to
announce

1094
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:26,560
that the winner of the Great British
Bake Off

1095
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,520
2023 goes to...

1096
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,760
..Matty!

1097
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,640
{\an1}CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1098
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,960
Well done, darling!
Thank you. Well done!

1099
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,040
Congratulations.
Well done, mate! Well done.

1100
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,840
Thank you. Congratulations.

1101
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,360
Bloody hell! Do you believe that?
What do you think, Matty?

1102
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,400
You won, mate!

1103
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,560
Bloody hell! Thank you!

1104
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,560
I don't know what to say!

1105
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,680
I don't know what to say.

1106
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,680
{\an1}CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1107
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,480
Well done!

1108
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,920
People say you should go on Bake Off
and I just thought it

1109
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,120
was like a throw away comment -
never really listened to it.

1110
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,400
I never thought that I would be on
this.

1111
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,320
Let alone win it.

1112
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,280
Where are we going to put this?

1113
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,680
I can't even have it on show for a
while, can I?

1114
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,880
Well done! Oh. my God!

1115
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,200
So chuffed for Matty.

1116
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,480
When it always comes to the cake,
he has been fantastic,

1117
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,160
so he's just a worthy winner
and such a lovely chap as well.

1118
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,760
You're only the winner!
How amazing is that?

1119
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,600
He was going home six times!

1120
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,600
I had a feeling Matty was
going to win.

1121
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:01,560
He's done it on the date counted
and I am honestly so happy for him.

1122
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,840
What a kid, I absolutely love him!

1123
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,600
I never met a more cheerful,

1124
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,800
smiling, uncomplaining
and willing baker.

1125
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,760
He just was having a good time,
learning as much as he could,

1126
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,040
taking on board anything
either of us said.

1127
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,400
And he's just got better
and better and better.

1128
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,120
And if you're going to smash it you
do it in the last challenge

1129
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,960
and that's exactly what he did.

1130
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,920
That chocolate cake was
one of the best chocolate cakes

1131
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,120
I've had for a long, long time.

1132
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,240
Lara, Lara I need you.

1133
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,960
There's been so many ups,
there's been so many downs,

1134
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,240
there's been so many times
when I've been pulled through

1135
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,120
by the people closest around me.

1136
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,080
Certainly Lara,

1137
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,800
I can't imagine I have been too much
fun to live with the last ten weeks.

1138
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,160
I'm happy for them as much as
I am for me with this one.

1139
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,680
{\an1}CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1140
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,960
It still doesn't really feel real.

1141
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,800
I don't really know.

1142
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,880
What do you think it was
got you here?

1143
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,120
Lara!

1144
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,320
Look at him!

1145
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,360
Sorry! Get out the camera,
will you?!

1146
