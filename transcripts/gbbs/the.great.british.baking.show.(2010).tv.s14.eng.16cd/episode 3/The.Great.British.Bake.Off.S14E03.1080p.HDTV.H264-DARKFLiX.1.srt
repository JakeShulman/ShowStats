1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,015
Noel, I got a few questions for you.
Hit me up.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,335
Flan or tart, what's the difference? You'd
have to ask Prue. What's an even bake?

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,335
You'd have to ask Paul. Do you even
know anything about baking? Not really.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,215
How long you been on
this show? Seven years.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,135
Do you still find a soggy bottom
funny? 'Course I do, I'm not an idiot.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,535
Has anyone ever been injured by a Hollywood
handshake? I'm not at liberty to disclose

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,975
that information. who's
Kate's Corner? It's Kate Corner.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,935
Kate Corner's just a woman who lives
down my street. What's cake corner?

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,896
Cake corner's a corner where we eat
cake. What week is it? It's Bread Week.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,375
Can I do the fun part now? Yes, you
can. Welcome to The Great British Bake Off.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,695
Did you enjoy that?
I really loved it. Me too. Thanks.

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,775
Last time...

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,415
Come on, custard creams.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,455
The bakers battled biscuits...
SHE GASPS

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,975
and while Josh served up
a stunning Showstopper...

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,495
Everything about it is spot on.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,575
It was Tasha...

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,255
I think they're delicate, I think
they're pretty and I have to...

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,615
ALISON GASPS
..shake your... Good for you!

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,256
That earned this year's
first handshake

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,695
and took home Star Baker...

22
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,055
Gotta put some peanuts on.
..but Keith's lack of finesse...

23
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,415
Ooh, dear.
..and under baked Showstopper.

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,815
I shouldn't be able to push my
finger in like that. - No.

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,695
Meant he had to say goodbye
to the tent.

26
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,015
It's been so lovely to meet you,
Prue.

27
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,415
This time, it's bread week.

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,775
I'm really nervous.
You nervous about this one?

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,136
I just don't want him to not like
it. Is it all about Paul? Yeah.

30
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,175
The bakers take on
a classic cottage loaf Signature...

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,775
I've never been
so stressed making bread.

32
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,215
SHE GASPS It's enormous...

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,055
My God.
..a traditional Technical...

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,135
SHE CHUFFS

35
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,615
that leaves some hot under
the collar... Cool those balls!

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,895
And a plaited Showstopper...

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,015
Help me, lord.

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,935
That has them tied up in knots.

39
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,695
Stressful.

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,775
SMASH, SHE GASPS

41
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,055
Chuff tog heck.
You just want an easy life.

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,535
Bread week is one of the most feared
weeks, isn't it

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,495
cos Paul's gonna be coming round

44
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,215
poking all our loaves
seeing if they're cooked or not.

45
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,935
Love baking my bread, not too sure
about doing it in a tent

46
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,295
with Paul Hollywood looking at me,
but...!

47
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,055
Paul is the bread king.
So nervous.

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,415
I don't know if it's nerves or if
it was the dodgy prawn

49
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,415
I had last night,
but something's churning.

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,215
I've definitely got
the bread dread.

51
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,535
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

52
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,375
It's bread week
and for your Signature Challenge,

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,615
the judges would love you
to make a cottage loaf.

54
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,015
Paul and Prue are looking for
a classic cottage loaf shape

55
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,815
that's two stacked cobs

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,455
and don't worry, it doesn't have to
be an actual cottage.

57
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,855
CHUCKLING

58
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,735
They are not gonna spend
a mini break inside your loaf.

59
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,015
ALISON LAUGHS

60
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,575
Your loaves can be flavour
and the style of bread dough

61
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,895
is entirely up to you, so go wild.

62
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,895
These are heady times we're
living in.

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,975
You've got two hours, and,
because we're feeling generous,

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,815
another 45 minutes.

65
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,215
On your marks... Get set...

66
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,375
Bake!

67
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,055
Right, let's get going
with this then.

68
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,575
I do like bread,
so hopefully Paul'll like it,

69
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,455
hopefully it'll all go to plan.

70
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,895
I don't make bread. I don't.
So this is not my week.

71
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,735
Everyone's scared of eating bread
now, aren't they? Not me.

72
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,655
No, not me. I love eating bread.
I love it!

73
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,095
That's my bread pouch,
muffin, crumpet, baguettes.

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,655
It's bread week and the
Signature Challenge

75
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,695
is a cottage loaf.

76
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,015
It's two loaves,
one on top of the other.

77
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,295
A little round one on the top

78
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,855
and a bigger round one underneath.

79
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,215
The lovely thing
about a cottage loaf,

80
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,695
simple though it is,

81
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,055
is it does cover all the skills
that really matter in bread making.

82
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,655
You need to spend a bit of time
developing that gluten,

83
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,535
mixing and kneading properly.

84
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,455
You don't want it to be too dense.

85
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,135
You want a little bit
of spring in it.

86
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,855
The joining of the two balls
is important

87
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,175
and they must be stable
and grow up rather than flat,

88
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,855
so you want a bit of height
to this.

89
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,855
We want perfection to impress us.

90
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,655
They've just gotta make good bread.

91
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,455
Morning, Cristy. Hello.
Hello, Cristy. Morning!

92
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,175
Right, Cristy, tell us all about
your cottage loaf.

93
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,055
So I'm doing dried cranberries,
chopped walnuts and rosemary.

94
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,935
Is this a favourite recipe?

95
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,255
Yeah. My kids love it. I love it.

96
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,255
Always a hit at home, Cristy's
loaf packed full of

97
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,015
sweet cranberries, rosemary
and walnuts also contains

98
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,055
multigrain flour for an extra hit
of nutty flavour.

99
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,375
Do you think it hinders the growth
of the dough at all

100
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,655
if you add too much flavour?

101
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,175
Yeah. No. I don't know.

102
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,575
It's not a test!
OK, you make me nervous!

103
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,415
I just wanna impress you both.

104
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,975
Well, good luck, I think it sounds
great. Thank you. OK!

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,695
Thank you. Thanks, Alison.
It's not an exam!

106
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,095
I'm nervous. It's cos he just knows
everything about bread.

107
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,535
You've got this, you've made it
before. You've got it.

108
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,895
I'm full of bread. Not stopped
eating it. What,

109
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,816
have you been eating bread?
I love a bit of bread.

110
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,015
I can do it all day long.

111
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,055
Saku's also aiming to impress
with a family favourite.

112
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,655
My kids love cinnamon toast
with orange juice

113
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,855
so I'm making cinnamon
and orange cottage loaf.

114
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,895
She'll add orange zest
to her dough for a citrus kick

115
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,255
to complement the warmth of
the cinnamon

116
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,135
that she's sourced
from somewhere special.

117
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,855
Sri Lanka is very famous
for its spices.

118
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,295
Always my cinnamon coming from
Sri Lanka. This is from home.

119
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,415
I brought my own rosemary from home

120
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,175
so from my mum's garden.

121
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,175
She has a very small
vegetable garden.

122
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,615
She won't like
that I've said it was very small,

123
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,415
but it's her pride and joy.

124
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,055
Looking to build on last week's
success, reigning Star Baker Tasha

125
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,415
will roast her mum's rosemary
with garlic

126
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,855
before kneading it through her
seed-packed dough.

127
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,735
But her classic flavour combination
faces competition.

128
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,495
I was quietly confident

129
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,535
and then, there are four people
doing rosemary and garlic.

130
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,855
But it's fine.
It's just a battle of the garlic!

131
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,975
This is wild garlic.
Love picking my wild garlic.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,055
Got a secret patch near me
no-one knows about.

133
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,015
Foraging fan Dan will add rosemary
and smoked bacon to his wild garlic

134
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,655
to flavour his main loaf

135
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,135
and he'll make a wild garlic pesto
to fold through his top cob.

136
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,695
Do you go foraging? I do, yeah.
Yeah, I do a bit of fungus.

137
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,015
Fungus. You got a basket? Yeah.

138
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,975
What do you wear, speedos?
Yeah, leopard skin speedos.

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,895
Massive top hat. Yeah, flippers.
With a door in it. Yeah!

140
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,055
And then throw the mushrooms in.
Goes in, yeah!

141
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,455
Just gonna check how the gluten is
doing. It feels pretty good.

142
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,215
Kneading the dough helps to develop
the strands of gluten,

143
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,295
crucial to producing the perfect
texture demanded by Paul and Prue.

144
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,375
Like a rocking motion just
to get right through the dough.

145
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,855
But it's a lab our intensive task.

146
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,495
You warmed up now, Nicky? Have
I warmed up? You warmed up?

147
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,895
Yeah, I'm getting there.
I need to take my jumper off now.

148
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,815
I'm letting the machine do
the hard work

149
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,975
and then I'll put it out on
the bench for a couple of minutes

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,655
and just pretend that I've done it!

151
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,255
I like kneading by hand cos it gives
you more control over the dough

152
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,135
and you can feel when it's ready,
rather than just guess.

153
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,055
I've done 300 hand kneads.
I count them all to make sure.

154
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,855
Abbi taste-tested her garlic
and rosemary cottage loaf

155
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,175
with the local village community
lunch where it went down a storm.

156
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,655
A success that she puts down to the
addition of a special ingredient.

157
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,135
I'm using smoked garlic and it has
an absolutely amazing smell.

158
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,495
Garlic, rosemary...
Just really nice.

159
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,455
It's a great classic combo,
isn't it?

160
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,815
The roasting of the garlic
just enhances the flavour

161
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,455
and I've got Scottish sea salt.

162
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,055
Oops, look at that,
went in a bit too much.

163
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,855
Nicky will add her roast garlic,

164
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,135
rosemary and Scottish sea salt paste

165
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,935
to her dough after its first prove.

166
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,455
And to ensure even distribution,
she's taking no risks.

167
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,215
I am not going to use
the stand mixer.

168
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,015
I'm doing it by hand.

169
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,295
I'm doing the kneading in the mixer
just to save me some arm strength,

170
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,215
basically. I like heat,
so I'm doing chipotle,

171
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,495
smoked Cheddar and bacon.

172
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,015
This is smoked Cheddar.

173
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,615
It's literally just amplifying that
smoky taste,

174
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,215
so if he says he can't taste
the flavour, that's a lie!

175
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,375
SHE LAUGHS

176
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,695
Ooh...
RATTLE, SMASH

177
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,735
God.

178
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,255
SHE GASPS

179
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,935
I meant to do that! You can taste
shards of glass. Yummy.

180
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,215
Starting from scratch,
Dana will add smoked paprika

181
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,695
to her second batch
of spicy chipotle dough

182
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,615
for an extra hit of smoky heat.

183
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,935
Yeah, I think it should be great,
as long as it's not

184
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,975
totally overpowering.

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,895
I mean, sometimes, smoke can just be
too much.

186
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,535
Well, it's not like a bonfire smoke.

187
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,455
It's more like just a little subtle
kick, so...

188
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,935
Have you got a name for your bread?

189
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,535
Um, Bread-ley Cooper.
Bread-ley Cooper!

190
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,855
I just thought, a bit of spice.
LAUGHTER

191
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,135
I love that.

192
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,495
This is about the stage
I'm happy with now.

193
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,455
If you hold it up to the window,
it'll stretch out nice and thin

194
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,775
without tearing
so you can see through it.

195
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,295
That'll do us. Beautiful.

196
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,935
It's just gonna go now into
the proving drawer for an hour.

197
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,655
Will it fit? Yeah.

198
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,455
Now the waiting game.

199
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,415
This is the, like, sit about and
have a cup of tea part of the bake.

200
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,335
Which is very, very nice
for once in a challenge!

201
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,455
I didn't bring a book
to read or game to play.

202
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,935
Let's play tic, tac, toe.

203
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,495
Are you into cricket? Yes.
I'm such a good batter.

204
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,015
Really? So, so good.
So I'm a bowler, you are a batter.

205
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,055
If you could bowl, I could bat.

206
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,415
It's not gonna work, is it?
No. My God!

207
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,695
It's a complete disaster!

208
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,975
Go on.

209
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,935
Sorry!
SHE LAUGHS

210
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,855
Right in the thigh.

211
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,775
I thought you was gonna do it
softly!

212
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,175
I feel like everybody else
has got theirs... proving

213
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,735
and I'm still working on mine.

214
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,055
It's a big dough.

215
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,495
I've got, like,
700g of flour in here.

216
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,255
Rowan's large loaf filled
with kalamata olives

217
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,735
and sun dried tomatoes is inspired
by a sun-strewn holiday to the Med.

218
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,055
I went to Amalfi.

219
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,415
The Amalfi coast, it were good...
It were expensive.

220
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,615
I mean a sorbet, you had to take out
a mortgage, so it was...

221
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,815
It was a place I'd never go back to.

222
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,695
Far from the glitz and glamour of
the Italian Riviera,

223
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,375
Josh is recreating one of his
Italy"s most humble offerings.

224
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,735
I am making a pizza-inspired
nduja...

225
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,215
and honey, cottage loaf.

226
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,575
So I've got nduja-spiced
spreadable sausage in there

227
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,935
which is gonna be spread over
the dough once it's proved.

228
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,255
You don't wanna put your flavours
in in the first prove.

229
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,656
It's gonna affect the way it rises,

230
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,335
<i>50 I mix it all in
on the second one.</i>

231
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,415
Along with spicy nduja sausage,

232
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,735
Josh will throw handfuls
of black olives,

233
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,575
basil and Gruyere into his loaf

234
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,015
for that flavour-packed
pizza experience.

235
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,335
It's like a meal in your bread.
It is, yeah, you've got

236
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,696
a lot of things going on in there.

237
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,495
It doesn't inhibit
its rise or anything?

238
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,856
It gets a nice rise. I know it's a
bit more of a risk, maybe,

239
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,536
putting bits of cheese in there
as well, but I wanted to give myself

240
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,855
a bit of a challenge. All right.
Good luck. Thank you very much.

241
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,455
Bakers, you are halfway through.

242
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,415
You can do it guys. Maybe.

243
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,095
HE LAUGHS

244
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,975
I'm just gonna have to go with it.

245
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,295
Looks like all right. Yes.

246
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,895
A lovely first prove that.
You can see the bubbles there,

247
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,455
you can see a lot of
carbon... dioxide in there!

248
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,215
Remember my elements, then.

249
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,015
It's not as proved as I would like.

250
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,736
But I think the second prove is far
more important than the first one

251
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,655
because that's what
gives you the shape.

252
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,415
But before shaping starts...
I'm gonna put my filling in.

253
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,855
There's one last opportunity
for the bakers

254
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,735
to add even more flavour
to their dough.

255
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,935
So I've got Gruyere cheese, basil
and I've got some olives as well.

256
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,255
It looks like a pizza anyway so.

257
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,815
Who doesn't like a bit of roast
garlic? And with your meat.

258
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,255
This is the smoked Cheddar, so I'm
just gonna get that rolled in.

259
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,055
It's just making sure it all just
goes through the dough

260
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,415
and there's no sort of empty
pockets.

261
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,775
I'm really pleased with this.
Just want to be able to get

262
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,095
a really good bit of shaping on it
now. Key to creating the classic

263
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,255
cottage loaf shape is both size
and proportion.

264
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,495
The top is a bit smaller.
It has that little hat.

265
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,055
I'm gonna split it into
a third and two thirds.

266
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,415
They're quite big balls.
I don't want it to be like

267
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,775
a little stuck on ball
on top of the bottom.

268
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,135
Three quarters to a quarter.
You have gotta, like,

269
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,056
trust your instinct
which is easier said than done

270
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,615
when there's everyone else
around you

271
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,215
doing the same thing, but different.

272
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,215
Bursting with olives,
sun dried tomato and Parmesan,

273
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,775
Matty's keen to add heat
to his loaf with the addition

274
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,415
of chilli flakes to his dough.

275
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,175
I think the flavours are
great inside.

276
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,775
When it comes to
the overall look of it,

277
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,055
tell us about the proportion,
your... ball size.

278
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,255
Three quarters bottom,
one quarter on top.

279
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,215
So you've got a little one on
top and then...

280
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,015
a big ball underneath. Yeah!
HE CHUCKLES

281
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,935
They're in proportion though...

282
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,215
They seem slightly out of
proportion, the ball size.

283
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,695
Don't be naughty. I'm just saying!

284
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,455
Would you go two thirds, one third?

285
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,255
I don't know.
It's entirely up to you.

286
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,815
Not only does a cottage loaf require
perfectly proportioned balls...

287
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,335
Hello, wee man.
..but the bakers must ensure

288
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,615
that they stay firmly in place too.

289
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,775
Here we go.

290
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,055
Flour up the old fingers.

291
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,615
Dear.

292
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,175
I'm a bit stuck!

293
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,135
Just three firm jabs.

294
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,695
I hope it will work.

295
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,215
Going in the proving
drawer again.

296
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,855
That's the biggest loaf I have made
in a long time.

297
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,455
Right, half an hour in there.

298
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,815
Have you got a proving drawer
at home?

299
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,055
No. The kitchen's normally about
the right temperature.

300
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,815
Is it too cold in here? It's Baltic,
yeah. Do you get ever cold hands?

301
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,095
Yeah, I do get...

302
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,415
If you put your hands out like that,

303
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,375
and pump really hard up and down.
You don't get cold hands?!

304
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,295
You don't get cold hands! Really?

305
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,575
Yeah! And an egg comes out.

306
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,735
THEY LAUGH

307
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,575
Bakers, you only have one hour left.

308
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,775
Few more mins.
It's a lot of proving, innit, this.

309
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,335
It's a lot of proving. They don't
do anything in this, do they?

310
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,935
Yeah, just sort of wandering about,
waiting... Like what we do!

311
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,855
SHE CACKLES

312
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,735
It's just about holding your nerve.

313
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,455
If you don't give it the time
it needs to rise,

314
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,735
then it's gonna be more
like a flat bread!

315
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,775
It's a bit flat, innit?

316
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,175
My gosh.

317
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,455
She's not very cottage
loaf-shaped any more.

318
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,535
I'm painting my lovely ball in red,
blue and green,

319
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,495
to make it look kind of Italian.
I wanted to add a bit of pop.

320
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,575
Did you pop it in the proving
drawer? Yes. Did it get bigger?

321
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,375
This is my problem - I can't
remember the size of it before

322
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,735
I put it in the proving drawer,
so...! Goldfish. I'm kind of like...

323
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,615
It's getting there. I know.

324
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,575
Wish I had a photogenic memory,
then 1'd be like,

325
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,935
"Yes, you know what,
that's risen by an eighth..."

326
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,255
Can you have a photogenic memory?
No, a photographic...! However...

327
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,375
In it goes.

328
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,935
It'll bake for about 50 minutes
because it's so huge.

329
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,295
Three more minutes.

330
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,975
Pancakes for breakfast everybody.
Here she is.

331
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,695
What shall we name her? Janice.

332
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,375
Right, I'm gonna score it.

333
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,775
Scoring the dough
is key to maintaining

334
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,615
the unique cottage loaf shape.

335
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,255
It's letting it breathe a little bit

336
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,615
so that, when it bakes,
it can expand out.

337
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,815
And deep precise cuts
will produce better shaped loaves.

338
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,615
Are you scoring it with this?

339
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,935
I've got a lame.

340
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,495
I've just got a sharp knife that
Yeah, but that's all right.

341
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,655
SHE MIMES SLASHING

342
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,135
Looks cottagey.
We're going in for 30 minutes.

343
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,455
40 to 45 minutes IS what it usually
does at home.

344
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,415
There you go, Janice.

345
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,775
Maybe the oven will solve
all ailments.

346
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,855
Just, it's now gotta watch it bake.
God.

347
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,375
I'm going to sit here
and watch and pray.

348
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,375
SHE LAUGHS

349
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,735
It's looking great!
I've just turned it round.

350
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,256
I'm trying to give it a really good
colour.

351
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,615
I know Paul likes a lot of colour
on his bread. Yeah...

352
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,536
I'm excited. Are you excited?
I'm really nervous.

353
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,096
You nervous about this one? I just
don't want him to not like it.

354
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,655
Is it all about Paul? Yeah.
Good luck. Thank you.

355
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,935
I can't wait for this.

356
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,775
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes.

357
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,615
Till Paul Hollywood comes in
with his mahogany fists

358
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,375
and smashes your dreams.

359
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,415
Mine's so lopsided.

360
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,575
I'm feeling happier than earlier.

361
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,535
I don't think Paul's gonna be
very happy.

362
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,055
The top's merged into the bottom.
I'm a bit annoyed.

363
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,455
Rise!

364
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,735
Bloody hell she's massive.
It's really ballooned.

365
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,495
It's enormous bread! My God...

366
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,855
They're not done.

367
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,295
It's disastrous.

368
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,775
It's literally come off.
THEY GASP

369
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,655
What do I do? Shall I rod it?

370
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,975
Well, I'm a bit panicky about this.

371
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,335
He's rodding it.
That's a good shout.

372
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,175
I've never been
so stressed making bread.

373
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,975
Chuff tog heck, this is a bit high
pressure.

374
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,495
You just want an easy life!

375
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,815
It's cooked. I think it's done.

376
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,175
I have to check temperatures
because a lot of bakers

377
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,175
tap the bottom
and listen to the sound.

378
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,495
Sounds hollow inside. Like that.

379
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,135
I can't do that. It's hollow.

380
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
Lovely!

381
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,895
My God this is actually
diabolical. I might scream.

382
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,655
Bakers, you've got one minute left,
just one minute.

383
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,215
Coming out in 30 seconds.

384
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,575
Just waiting till literally
the last second.

385
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,895
These are the flowers
from the wild garlic.

386
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,455
It's such a pancake.

387
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,815
It's coming out.

388
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,335
Here we are.

389
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,575
I don't know. Really happy with
that. Perfect.

390
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,375
My gosh. It's just so big.

391
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,455
Bakers, your time is up.

392
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,495
That looks amazing.

393
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,775
I am happy with that.
Hopefully they will like the taste.

394
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,135
You look around the room,
you start going...

395
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,655
See, it's all...
They're all kind of perfect.

396
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,855
This is the failure corner.

397
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,855
Dearie me.

398
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,215
The bakers' cottage loaves now face
the judgment of Paul and Prue.

399
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,935
Hello, Saku. Hello.

400
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,415
I think it looks pretty good.

401
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,415
The cuts have gone slightly awry,

402
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,535
but overall, I like the colour
and I like the height.

403
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,295
Go on, then, Hollywood.
Right, let's have a look. Cut it.

404
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,975
Smells good. It's really cinnamony.

405
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,015
I don't get the orange very much,
but the cinnamon's there.

406
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,815
I did get the orange. It's a hint.
Certainly there in the background.

407
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,775
The cinnamon is good. So your
flavour combinations are spot on.

408
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,695
But, your bread itself
is slightly under proved.

409
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,735
You can see where you've put your
finger in

410
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,615
and it's concertinaed down
at the bottom.

411
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,855
Overall, it's a nice loaf.

412
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,536
I think you were ten minutes away
from something that was very good.

413
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,815
Well done. Thank you.

414
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,055
Well, it's certainly rustic.

415
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,415
I think you've fumbled
a little bit when you cut this

416
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,015
cos it's gone all over the place.

417
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,455
Doesn't look too bad.

418
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,175
It is a lot of filling,
but, actually, it works.

419
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,175
Nothing is overpowering
anything else.

420
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,935
Chilli's coming in right at
the end. It's lovely. Thank you.

421
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,815
It's split here quite badly

422
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,815
And this is down
to under proving it...

423
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,575
so it needed another
ten minutes or so.

424
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,855
I think you've got
a great bake on it though.

425
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,535
Certainly cheesy.
DANA CHUCKLES

426
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,495
Smokiness comes through beautifully,
and the cheese and the chipotle

427
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,135
as well. It is a bit doughy,
but your flavours are good.

428
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,415
It looks monstrous.

429
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,055
How much flour did you use?

430
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,495
Nigh on 700g.

431
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,975
It's a big loaf.

432
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,695
But actually the structure
is spot on. Great colour.

433
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,375
The olives come through beautifully.

434
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,295
The sun dried tomatoes not so much.

435
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,175
I can taste the sun dried tomatoes,

436
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,335
but I don't think
the little S's add anything.

437
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,575
You should've just written
"Paul is king". Bread king.

438
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,895
Thank you, Rowan. Well, thank you.

439
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,935
"Monstrous”. It's fine,
I've been called worse.

440
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,415
It's quite dense inside. Yes.

441
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,135
I'm getting... salt.

442
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,695
Quite a lot of salt. What's the
level of salt you put in?

443
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,375
The original prove was just 7g

444
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,695
and then after that I just went...

445
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,575
You added more?
In with the paste. Yeah, that's...

446
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,095
So just did a wee... probably
why we're picking it up then,

447
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,375
because you just went over
that balance. Yeah.

448
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,135
Colour, I love. Cuts, I like,
they're nice and deep.

449
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,815
I think it looks really appetising.

450
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,695
Think it needs a little of salt.

451
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,055
Considering you had cranberries,
walnuts in there,

452
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,816
it's just a little bit bland, but
overall, I think it's a decent loaf.

453
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,015
EXHALES SHAKILY
OK.

454
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,735
This is flat Janice.

455
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,375
Her cottage is a bungalow.

456
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,935
LAUGHTER

457
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,055
Let's have a look at it.

458
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,815
How much of the garlic did you put
in it? All of it?

459
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,615
Not all of it, I think I did, like,
six cloves. It's quite strong.

460
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,095
Can't taste the rosemary. OK.
Um...

461
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,055
When it comes to salt,
it's quite a bland loaf. Yeah.

462
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,815
All you get... Is garlic?
..Is garlic.

463
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,295
You haven't got enough salt. Yeah.

464
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,655
And actually that,
it's affected the structure

465
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,215
and that's why it'll look
like this.

466
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,535
Taste it with a bit of the crust
though, cos that's really nice.

467
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,095
Ooh, yeah.
Bit of salt on it, it'll be lovely.

468
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,655
Good job, Janice.

469
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,455
Lovely colour.

470
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,335
It's turned out quite nicely.

471
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,695
You've pretty much
got the proving right.

472
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,575
I think the flavour is great.

473
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,495
Nice balance of cheese and chilli.

474
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,975
There is considerable heat in that.

475
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,295
And I like it. I think it's lovely.

476
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,655
And I'm surprised because I thought
the cheese and olives

477
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,375
are going to hold it down,
it's going become claggy...

478
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,735
But it's really lovely. Well done,
Josh. Thank you.

479
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,255
Wonderful, thank you. Well done!
HE EXHALES

480
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,975
Do you know, if you saw that
in a baker's shop you'd buy it,

481
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,455
just because it looks so rustic
and so appetising.

482
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,415
Looks quite appealing doesn't
it, yeah.

483
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
Let's have a look.

484
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,175
I think it's quite clever
the pesto going through it.

485
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,535
My issue is it only stays in
one place. Yeah.

486
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,295
You have to distribute it
amongst the whole loaf. Yeah...

487
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,255
I think it's a
really interesting delicious loaf.

488
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,655
Flavour-wise, and texture-wise,
you've done a great job.

489
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,095
It just needed to be more
uniform with... Distribute, yeah.

490
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,735
Your filling. Just pop it in the
mixer, all your ingredients,

491
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,095
once you've proved your dough

492
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,536
and just slowly turn it to
introduce it and then you shape it.

493
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,415
I should've belled you beforehand,
shouldn't 1? You should've done,

494
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,375
yeah! I was only across there.
Were ya?

495
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,975
Give you a shout next time.
Thank you very much.

496
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,255
That'll do me.

497
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,295
Because you've put weight

498
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,015
in the dough as seeds,

499
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,655
I'm thinking that this
is gonna be quite dense inside.

500
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,175
But... the proof of the pudding
is in the eating.

501
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,295
Come on, then.

502
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,775
I would be so proud
of that if I'd done it!

503
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,335
It is dense, but nevertheless,
it's delicious.

504
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,695
It's not perfect.
But it is 90-odd-per cent there.

505
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,735
I wish I'd made it.

506
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,335
Thank you. Well done. Thank you.
Thank you.

507
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,135
Wow. She wishes she'd
made it! I'll take that!

508
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,015
Think that went pretty well!

509
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,255
That's good feedback.

510
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,815
Thank you, Prue. It was lovely!

511
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,335
It went well.

512
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,095
"Monstrous". I'd rather be monstrous
than mediocre.

513
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,455
That was pretty good.
He liked the look of it,

514
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,855
it had good colour on it,
one down, two to go.

515
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,175
Flat Janice.
I'm definitely at the bottom.

516
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,135
But last week's Technical I won,

517
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,895
so hopefully, do a better job.
Smash it.

518
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,455
The bakers were able
to practise their first challenge,

519
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,015
but now, they face
a mystery shrouded in gingham.

520
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,375
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

521
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,095
It's time for your
Technical Challenge, which, today,

522
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,175
has been set for you by the bad boy
of buns himself, Mr Paul Hollywood.

523
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,775
Paul has been preparing
some incredible words of wisdom.

524
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,335
Over to you, Paul.

525
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,295
It's all about the timing.

526
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,855
I'm gonna put that on my Instagram.

527
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,095
NOEL LAUGHS

528
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,455
As ever, this Technical will be
judged blind

529
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,575
so we're gonna have to ask our
judges to leave the tent. Bye-bye.

530
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,735
Thank you.

531
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,375
To make sure there's no cheating,

532
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,815
they will be lowered
into a medieval well.

533
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,655
Paul would like you to make a batch

534
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,375
of eight delicious
Devonshire splits.

535
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,695
Ooh, I love Devonshire splits.

536
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,535
I often do the splits
while I'm eating Devonshire splits.

537
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,895
Now, the judges are looking
for soft,

538
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,815
light, enriched dough buns

539
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,695
that are split and then filled with
a home-made strawberry jam

540
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,015
and freshly whipped cream.

541
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,655
You have two hours
and 30 minutes.

542
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,775
On your marks...

543
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,895
get set...

544
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,935
bake!

545
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,935
That's not
a lot of ingredients, is it?

546
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,935
I'm familiar with the Devonshire split. It's
a bit like a doughnut and I love doughnuts.

547
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,695
I live adjacent to Devon.

548
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,015
I've never seen one before.

549
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,975
Bit worried, I need a good technical
cos I had a mediocre signature,

550
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,495
so I'm just looking round.

551
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,615
"Do not confer," it says
but it doesn't say "don't look."

552
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,335
So, Paul, Devonshire splits,
what a treat.

553
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,655
I grew up on these.

554
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,895
My dad used to make these in his
bakery and they're just delicious to eat.

555
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,535
Where they're going to come unstuck
on this particular challenge is timing.

556
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,455
We've allowed for two proves
in this.

557
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,775
So for the first prove?

558
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,695
Well, you do it roughly 45 minutes.

559
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,895
As it starts to rise, carbon dioxide
begins to be formed

560
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,655
and a little bit
of flavour comes into it.

561
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,015
Then they can prepare the rolls.
So divide it into eight,

562
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,015
roll it into balls,
and prove it again.

563
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,575
45 minutes on the second one
and it stabilises the dough

564
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,015
and gives it better flavour.

565
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,815
It's all down to the proving.

566
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,535
The oven bake's for around
15 minutes.

567
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,255
We want them beautifully round
and symmetrical.

568
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,655
You don't want any tears in
the side at all

569
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,376
and you want a nice flash of colour
going all the way down to the bottom.

570
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,735
I would not have thought a
Devonshire split could be so complicated.

571
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,415
Now, there's no cutlery with this.

572
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,375
This is when we get cream all over
the show.

573
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,975
Yeah.

574
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,895
It's soft in the mouth,
slightly chewy.

575
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,135
That is heaven.

576
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,055
Beautiful sweetness from the
strawberry and then the cream as well.

577
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,415
I'm going to sit here
and eat the lot, I tell you.

578
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,775
Not all of those, but all of this.
All of this.

579
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,095
Step one, make the dough.

580
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,455
It's an enriched dough which means
it's enriched

581
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,695
with milk and butter
and I'm adding that to my flour,

582
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,575
yeast, salt and sugar,

583
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,775
then bring it together to form a scraggly
dough and then I'll get that kneaded.

584
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,255
Get your hands in, get in there.

585
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,975
Going to need to work quite quickly.

586
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,895
I'm just very keen
to get my dough proving.

587
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,575
You all right, Abbi? Hello, Alison.
How you doing darling?

588
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,095
All right, thank you.

589
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,935
Devonshire splits, have you ever
made one of these before?

590
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,815
No, I haven't. Have you ever done
the splits before? No, I haven't.

591
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,216
But you've got to impress Paul with this though,
ain't ya? I know, need to get myself back on track.

592
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,615
This is a big one. After flat Janice. Well,
do you know what? Janice tasted amazing.

593
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,895
She was very garlicky, which is the way
I like it. Probably not what Prue wanted.

594
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,295
So you've got to get this right haven't ya? So,
yeah. Keep kneading babes, keep kneading. Thank you.

595
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,815
Perfect Devonshire split dough...

596
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,135
You can feel that changing already
under my hands.

597
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,615
Requires lots of kneading.

598
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,495
That's like a workout.

599
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,815
Not enough and they could end up
with tight buns.

600
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,535
We're looking for something very
smooth and elastic.

601
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,815
You don't want it to tear.

602
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,095
It's looking all right, that.

603
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,095
Step five, prove.

604
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,895
Thank you very much.
For all that information.

605
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,695
I'll give it as long as I humanly possibly can
cos I want it to be quite light and fluffy.

606
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,015
I'm going to leave this
for 50 minutes.

607
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,975
Start with 30 minutes, check.

608
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,775
It'll probably need longer than that but whether
we've got time to do it longer than that...

609
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,695
There's going to be
a lot of under proved buns today.

610
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,855
Next is to make the strawberry jam.

611
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,775
I've chopped up my strawberries

612
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,495
and put them in a pan
with some jam sugar

613
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,855
and hopefully I have the setting
temperature branded into my brain.

614
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,175
I'm trying to get this
to 104 centigrade.

615
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,455
Here we go. It's bubbling away now.

616
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,815
Bit longer.

617
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,215
Looks all right.

618
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,775
Hopefully it will work.

619
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,775
Steaming up, yes.

620
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,055
SHE CHUCKLES

621
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,095
Jam is ready.

622
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,255
The dough's proving.

623
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,655
Jam cooling.

624
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,135
Should've been a rapper.

625
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,935
Wow, what's this? We're giving you a double
whammy. Looks lovely. That is my strawberry jam.

626
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,255
What's your favourite jam?

627
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,335
Blueberry jam. Blueberry?
Yeah.

628
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,775
That is quite a bold statement. Why?
How often do you make blueberry jam?

629
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,255
I don't make it,
I'm buying from shop.

630
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,215
Bakers, you are halfway through.

631
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,055
Sh. Love watching her work.

632
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,775
See how much it's grown.

633
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,095
If the bakers under prove
their dough...

634
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,495
We're looking pretty groovy there.

635
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,855
Looks good.

636
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,455
They'll fail to produce the light

637
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,855
and springy texture Paul
and Prue expect.

638
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,695
Well, it could do with longer really

639
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,015
but I can see quite
a few people shaping

640
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,495
Which is a bit stressful.

641
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,535
Divide the dough into eight pieces
and shape into each ball.

642
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,175
604 divided by eight.

643
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,775
I can't do it,
I can't physically do the maths.

644
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,656
That's terrible, I'm gonna have
to book a course.

645
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,935
75.4 grams each.

646
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,975
I'm just going to eye it.

647
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,015
It could do with another ten minutes
but we don't have another ten minutes

648
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,535
so now I'm going to shape them into
little balls.

649
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,015
Key to an even rise

650
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,375
and avoiding any tears in
their dough

651
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,255
the bakers must create
a smooth, taut skin.

652
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,855
I make a lot of bread rolls at home
so I'm quite used to this.

653
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,375
That looks a wee bit wrinkled.

654
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,855
Wrinkly balls. Wrinkly balls.

655
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,535
So we've got a pair for Prue
and a pair for Paul.

656
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,575
This is like a dream I've had.

657
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,415
Paul's balls are out on
a baking sheet.

658
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,015
I'm really pleased with those.
Nice and even.

659
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,655
Second prove, we're going in.

660
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,295
The most important prove in
my opinion.

661
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,815
I'm going to do the second prove
for half an hour.

662
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,695
I've just got to wait now.

663
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,335
I'm just trying to stay zen before
it all goes crazy in a minute.

664
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,055
Oomm.

665
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,335
Make them work.

666
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,615
I'm doing a dance for you just
to keep you occupied. Nice one.

667
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,335
Nice, nice.

668
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,015
Thank you.

669
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,095
They're getting there.

670
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,695
I'm giving them another
three minutes.

671
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,095
Five minutes left on the clock but I'm going to
live by the seat of my pants I think and go for it.

672
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,735
We're going in with them, big boy.

673
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,295
Can't believe Dan's in, that's
so stressful?

674
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,775
My God.

675
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,575
Bakers, you've got half an hour
left.

676
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,215
Drama there, weren't it?
That cut through the tent.

677
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,855
Yeah.
Like a hot knife through butter.

678
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,095
Half an hour left.

679
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,295
I'm happy with the rise of
the dough balls.

680
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,735
They've risen up,
not as much as I would like.

681
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,295
I'm not that upset with them.

682
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,615
They're just a little on
the small side.

683
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,815
Going in.

684
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,615
In they go.

685
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,695
Don't know how long they'll take in
the oven. I reckon about 12, 15 minutes.

686
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,055
Going for 14 minutes cos that's
my lucky number.

687
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,135
So next, make the Chantilly cream.
This is whipped up,

688
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,055
bit of icing sugar, vanilla,

689
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,815
and lo and behold you'll have
a Chantilly.

690
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,295
I want it to be a little bit above
soft peaks.

691
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,815
Medium peaks.

692
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,095
Looks good.

693
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,415
Just joking.

694
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,455
That's looking quite good.

695
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,935
You're going to use this? Yeah.

696
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,855
In here? Fill it with Chantilly.
Should I just use a wooden spoon?

697
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,375
Just use a wooden spoon.
It's convenience, innit? Thank you.

698
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,455
What about a bigger one? What's
this?

699
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,215
That's what... that's where I write my... Some
poems in here. Go on, read one of the poems.

700
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,415
"Dear Paul,

701
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,775
you look so good today in your
double denim.

702
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,575
I think about your desert boots
all the time."

703
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,015
That one gets a bit racy. Does it?

704
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,695
They're done.

705
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,055
They're not big anyway,
they're quite dainty.

706
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,575
Get them out,
get 'em nice and cool.

707
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,095
Dan's are out. I know, he's speedy
Gonzales.

708
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,455
Like he's so speedy.
Do you know what?

709
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,735
I'm pretty sure I've not put
the caster sugar in?

710
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,895
Hence why my buns are
a little bit small.

711
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,655
What a doughnut I am.

712
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,895
Dough-nut.

713
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,175
Bakers,
you've got ten minutes left.

714
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,735
My God.

715
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,095
OK, I'm getting them out.

716
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,735
OK. We're good, we're good,
we're good, we're good.

717
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,695
They've not baked very evenly.
Here is a little bit under.

718
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,495
All right,
now we've got to let them cool.

719
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,855
Is it all about cooling? Yeah.
Before assemblage.

720
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,416
You don't want to put cream into
a hot bun.

721
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,295
And drip out the other side, yeah.

722
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,095
Cool those balls.

723
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,735
You've not been on Bake Off until
you've done the waft.

724
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,135
Cut a deep slit through
the centre of each.

725
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,655
I think this is right,
I don't have a clue.

726
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,375
These are shocking.

727
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,095
No sugar in it.

728
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,375
I'll tell you one thing,
it's too late now.

729
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,055
Bakers, you've got five
minutes left.

730
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,895
Have we really?

731
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,895
You know when you feel sick?

732
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,455
Jam time.

733
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,895
Nice thick jam anyway.

734
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,735
The jam is perfect.

735
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,615
Generously fill each bun
with whipped cream.

736
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,135
I want it to look neat.

737
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,975
Pipe it directly into the bun.

738
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,415
Gosh, it's splodging.

739
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,695
Sodding hell. It's so bad.

740
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,295
Bakers, you have one minute left.

741
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,655
One minute, OK, we can do this.

742
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,215
Decorate with the strawberries.

743
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,735
Come on, strawbs.

744
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,015
Must move quicker.

745
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,735
I don't know this is the right way.

746
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,175
My gosh.

747
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,495
♪ Shaky hands. ♪

748
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,815
Just hide the mistakes
with icing sugar.

749
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,175
That's monstrous to another level.

750
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,695
Bakers, your time is up.

751
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,735
Please come and bring your
Devonshire splits

752
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,095
and place them behind
your photographs.

753
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,055
Dear.

754
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,535
The garish A&E look.

755
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,375
Forgot the icing sugar.

756
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,495
Wow, that was awful.

757
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,775
Well...

758
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:01,095
Did my best.

759
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,335
It's time to judge
the bakers' Devonshire splits.

760
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,655
We've got an array here, Prue.

761
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,175
We certainly have.

762
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,815
Paul and Prue are looking
for eight equally sized,

763
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,535
light and springy buns

764
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,055
filled with perfectly-set strawberry
jam and Chantilly cream

765
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,575
And they have no idea whose
is whose.

766
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,815
OK, let's start down this side.

767
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,855
Bit irregular in shape these,
actually,

768
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,335
and it's under proved,

769
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,135
you can tell by the cracks on
the bottom.

770
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,455
They probably needed another ten,
15 minutes.

771
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,815
But they're soft inside.
They've got a lovely flavour.

772
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,495
Jam's lovely.
Some of these are a bit odd.

773
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,775
These are really small.

774
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,255
This one's a bit peculiar.

775
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,775
They're massively under proved.

776
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,055
Soon as you press it,
it goes back to dough again.

777
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,735
And they're very dense.
They are dense.

778
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,815
Right. Now, the size of these is
better, much better.

779
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,895
They're quite light, Paul. They are.

780
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,735
They're proved well.
They're big and light.

781
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,975
Good jam.

782
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,455
Yeah, the jam looks good.

783
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,815
That's a decent one, the size is
good. I like that.

784
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,175
It's just a shame the cream's not
looking nicer than it is.

785
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,655
But it does look like lots of cream,
which I like.

786
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,015
Too small. These are way too...
These are like golf balls.

787
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,775
This is... It's really dense.
Needed much longer proving.

788
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,055
You can tell when you look at
the bottom there. It's ripped.

789
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,695
And it tastes yeasty.

790
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,735
And now when you move on to this...

791
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,495
These are very neat. They are neat

792
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,455
and they are round
but they're a little bit small.

793
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,935
That's the old thing
of not proved enough.

794
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,255
I'm not quite sure what these are.
They're not round.

795
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,496
<i>And they're.. they're a bit flat.</i>

796
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,935
They've almost been under mixed.

797
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,335
It crumbles rather than stretches.

798
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,375
Don't taste very good them.
Quite dry on the mouth.

799
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,535
I don't understand.

800
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,335
These are not bad, these buns.

801
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,935
Underproved slightly,
but it's got a good texture inside.

802
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,615
Lovely texture.

803
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,415
The jam's good. That's delicious.

804
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,215
They just needed icing sugar.

805
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,935
And moving on to this,
again under proved.

806
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,775
See the split but they are large.

807
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,015
Nice flavour. Nice jam. Yeah.

808
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,535
OK, moving on to these guys.

809
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,735
A bit under proved again.

810
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,575
You see it's blown there again,
it's ripped.

811
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,135
It's a little bit small.

812
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,495
Not bad, though.

813
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,175
Moving on to these,

814
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,975
again under proved, ripped.

815
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,975
That's quite dense that.
Look at that one.

816
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,775
They're neat but it's blown.

817
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,095
It's a shame. OK.

818
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,015
The Devonshire splits will now
be ranked...

819
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,375
All of them are slightly
under proved.

820
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,695
These are the best.

821
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,975
From last place to first.

822
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,775
In 10th place we have this one.

823
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,095
Dan, they're too small,

824
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,655
under proved, bit tough, good jam.
Brilliant.

825
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,055
In ninth place we have this one.

826
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,455
When you look at it, it looks good, but turn it upside
down and you realise there's a few issues there.

827
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,415
Yeah.

828
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,615
Abbi is eighth,

829
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,895
Matty is seventh,

830
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,255
Cristy sixth,

831
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,335
Nicky fifth,

832
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,695
Josh is fourth

833
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,095
and Dana is third.

834
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,375
In second place we have this one.

835
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,015
Tasha,

836
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,295
they were very, very good.

837
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,575
No icing sugar for some reason.

838
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,455
And in first place we have these.

839
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,175
APPLAUSE

840
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,935
The bun itself was excellent.

841
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,816
You've got a nice tension in there
and the flavour on the mouth was good,

842
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,055
So it was well proved.

843
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,215
I think you did really well.

844
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,495
I'm so happy.

845
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,335
Disappointed that I forgot
to put the caster sugar in.

846
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,815
Just got to dust yourself down
and go again, haven't you?

847
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,535
I think they're too kind
to me actually.

848
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,815
It really was like eating cement
when I tried it so fair enough.

849
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,255
Look, I know I'm crying it's just cos
I get really emotional really easily.

850
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,015
I know that I'm definitely at
the bottom of the pack now.

851
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,935
I just need to really smash
my Showstopper.

852
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,455
Just one challenge remains before
someone's named Star Baker of bread week

853
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,455
and someone's time in
the competition is up.

854
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,935
This is your week Paul and...
It's all about Hollywood.

855
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,495
What did you think of the standard?

856
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,815
The standard's been pretty poor in
the technical.

857
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,255
THEY GIGGLE

858
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,855
Don't mince your words. But I
do think Tash is doing really well.

859
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,015
Josh is there or thereabouts.
I think Saku's the same.

860
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,695
OK, so going into the Showstopper
who needs to pull it out of the bag?

861
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,055
Abbi who had the problem with
the salt.

862
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,615
Yeah. And I think Abbi had a problem
with the technical as well

863
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,535
which puts her in a very precarious
position.

864
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,335
It's not just her, though, I think
Rowan, Dan, he had a terrible technical.

865
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,175
He started well
but he's fallen off a cliff.

866
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,695
Which is crazy, right, cos he's been
so consistent. Yeah.

867
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,975
But they're all in trouble. I love when
you get really strict Paul. Right.

868
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,775
So nice. Turns you on, does it?

869
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,055
A little bit.

870
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,055
Wow.

871
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,175
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

872
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,135
It's time for your
Showstopper challenge.

873
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,455
Today the judges would love you
to make

874
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,815
a visually stunning,

875
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,135
plaited bread centrepiece.

876
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,335
Now, your Showstopper can be sweet
or savoury,

877
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,495
it's entirely up to you,

878
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,655
but it must have two different types
of flour

879
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,495
and include your incredible bread
plaiting skills.

880
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,095
If you want to practise your
plaits,

881
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,495
me and Alison are going out on
the razz tonight so...

882
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,895
We are... you're welcome to sort our
barnets out.

883
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,816
We're going to be in the corner with a
tea towel round our shoulders all right?

884
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,975
You've got four hours
for your Showstopper.

885
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,055
On your marks...

886
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,975
get set... bake.

887
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,895
Pssh!

888
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,655
Here we go again.

889
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,375
I'd say the hardest part about this
challenge is plaiting.

890
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,695
It's not something I've got much
experience of.

891
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,975
I've watched so many YouTube videos

892
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,575
and I still can't plait my own hair

893
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,935
so I'm hoping I can plait
bread today.

894
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,695
The Showstopper challenge is
a plaited centrepiece loaf.

895
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,375
Now, this is their chance
to really show off to Prue and |

896
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,935
what they can actually do
with dough.

897
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,975
The focus for this challenge is on
the plaiting.

898
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,935
Of course we want the bread
to be delicious.

899
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,575
It could be flavoured as they like.

900
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,095
They can put fillings in there.

901
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,695
God, it smells good, don't it?

902
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,615
I could just put my face in that.

903
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,335
But what we're really looking for

904
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,615
is some intricate and amazing
plaiting.

905
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,935
There are numerous plaits
they could do

906
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,735
to create an image that they want.

907
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,095
It's like painting a picture
with braids.

908
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,415
I want to see something that makes
me go,

909
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,215
"How did they do that?"

910
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,775
Morning, Abbi. Hello, morning.
Hello, Abbi.

911
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,095
Tell us about your
plaited Showstopper.

912
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,135
I am making a tree

913
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,215
because I love trees.

914
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,735
Wherever I go I always have like my favourite
tree so that's kind of what it represents.

915
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,095
What is your favourite tree? Right now
that lovely pink horse chestnut out there

916
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,455
that I can see from my bench.
Beautiful that one, isn't it?

917
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,855
So I'm making a walnut
and stilton trunk and branches.

918
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,895
The leaves are going to be made from
wild garlic and nettle

919
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,335
and then this is made with dock
flour from the seeds of dock leaves.

920
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,015
Have you been out foraging for these yourself?
Yes, I've picked these this week. Brilliant.

921
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,455
Abbi will make dock flour dough
mushrooms to sit at the base of her tree.

922
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,735
Its leaves made from nettle
and wild garlic three-strand plaits,

923
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,455
while its trunk will be plaited from
no less than nine.

924
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,255
Nine strands? Nine strands.

925
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,975
Nine, I've not done before.

926
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,335
Honestly, Abbi, it's
wonderfully ambitious.

927
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,695
And it sounds as if it
could be terrific.

928
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,255
I do need it. I'm really hoping that
today I can just smash it.

929
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,535
You want to stay, don't you?

930
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,815
I do. I've got so many more
different foraged things that I want to.

931
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,775
Just concentrate on this and get it done the best
you can. Right now this is what I'm focusing on.

932
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,255
And Abbi's favourite tree has
a friend.

933
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,695
I am making a rowan tree,

934
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,895
a bread rowan tree.

935
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,735
So I'm just popping the spices in

936
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,775
for my sweet curry wholemeal loaf.

937
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,495
I've got a hefty amount going in.

938
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,695
I want to punch 'em right in
the jaw with the flavour.

939
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,535
Fighting to stay in the competition

940
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,895
Rowan's flavour-packed tree also
features

941
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,655
a six-strand plaited marzipan
challah trunk

942
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,175
supporting a bacon and Parmesan
three-strand crown,

943
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,175
complete with red rowan berries.

944
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,775
How big is it going to be in total?

945
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,255
It's about this tall.

946
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,135
Wow. My goodness. It's huge. Proper
showstopper. Yeah.

947
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,135
And it's going to be
lying down not standing up?

948
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,855
Standing up. I got my dad to make me
a structure. A frame.

949
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,815
This is going to be colourful
and huge.

950
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,655
Massive. And delicious.

951
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,415
Yeah. I like it.

952
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,695
This is one kilo of flour.
Which is quite a lot to do by hand.

953
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,055
With at least two different doughs
to make,

954
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,415
the bakers have their work cut out
to mix

955
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,815
and knead them before
the crucial first prove.

956
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,295
It's not easy kneading
with this great big lump.

957
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,695
Look at these. These been in the
proving drawer?

958
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,576
They've been in the proving drawer.
Yeah, they have. Look at the guns on that.

959
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,080
I've never been to a gym in my life.
Just make bread every day.

960
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,775
The longer they take,
the less time they'll have

961
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,895
to create the intricate plaits Paul
and Prue want to see.

962
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,455
It's a lot of dough, yeah.

963
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,535
Just want to get it proving.

964
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,895
All right, it's going in.
It's my wholemeal bread.

965
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,575
I have decided to make today

966
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,575
a highland cow called Angus.

967
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,895
I always wanted one as a pet.

968
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,015
This big, hairy animal just in your
back garden,

969
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,335
chomping on your grass
and keeping it down.

970
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,655
I'd love one.

971
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,535
Nicky's highland heifer will
be both savoury and sweet,

972
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,695
with hair and ears containing Comte
cheese and lardons,

973
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,095
and the face and horns packed with
pecans and dates.

974
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,736
Two flours, what two flours have you
gone for?

975
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,295
I did wholemeal for his face.
Yeah. Healthy.

976
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,535
And his horns. "Horins"?
Horns. "Horins"?

977
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,135
I can't say...

978
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,575
Horns?

979
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,495
EXAGGERATED ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION:
Horns.

980
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,655
I love the way you say it.
Horns? "Horins".

981
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,135
I'm excited about this.
Especially seeing his horins.

982
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,055
Saku's also been inspired by
an animal close to her heart.

983
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,895
I am going to make a peacock.

984
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,455
I love peacocks. They are lovely,
colourful creatures.

985
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,535
Saku will recreate the peacock's
beautiful tail feathers

986
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,855
from white dough flavoured
with garlic and rosemary

987
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,655
and the branch her bird will sit
upon from seeded spelt dough.

988
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,975
And she's hoping her years
of plaiting experience

989
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,415
will give her an advantage.

990
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,695
I'm doing this from aged 16.

991
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,495
And my daughter's 21.

992
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,175
Still I do her hair.

993
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,895
Aw, my baby girl!

994
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,935
Right, that's my wild garlic dough.
This is going in.

995
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,135
As the last of the bakers' doughs
hit the proving drawer,

996
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,615
some are ready to come out.

997
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,175
It's risen. Looks really lovely.
All nice and bouncy.

998
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,535
I don't know,
I don't want to under prove.

999
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,096
I don't know,
I'm going to put it back in.

1000
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,975
But before plaiting starts...

1001
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,895
OK, we're going to add the stilton.

1002
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,255
There's the chance
to add extra flavour.

1003
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,776
So, this is cranberry
and orange dough.

1004
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,455
Orange is coming only from the zest,

1005
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,455
and then I've got my cranberries
soaked in orange juice as well.

1006
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,935
I'm mixing in pastrami and cheese.

1007
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,855
Which is a little bit messy.

1008
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,295
While the rest of the bakers
add their fillings

1009
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,935
before rolling their strands...

1010
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,615
Just trying to distribute this
as evenly as we can.

1011
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,175
Dan's decided to add his
one at a time.

1012
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,495
So, what I'm going to do is
individual strands in

1013
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,695
the fillings in each strand,

1014
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,295
and then roll it up to make
a lattice-type, braided loaf.

1015
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,895
So they crisscross each other.

1016
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,295
It's going to form two round,
circular wreaths,

1017
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,415
and I'm going to make my word
"pizza" out of the remaining dough.

1018
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,775
Looking to bounce back after
yesterday's disastrous technical,

1019
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,895
Dan's going all-out with an
ambitious, five-piece Showstopper.

1020
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,015
He'll pack his first plaited pizza
wreath with fennel and sausage,

1021
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,015
nduja and mozzarella,
and his second with truffle salami,

1022
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,535
truffle Cheddar
and smoked provolone.

1023
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,935
Love making pizzas, love cooking
outdoors, so I'm just bringing the

1024
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,615
flavours we've really enjoyed with
our pizzas to this bread, basically.

1025
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,335
And Dan won't be dining
al fresco alone.

1026
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,855
I'm doing a picnic basket.

1027
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,215
This is green chutney dough.

1028
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,575
It's just what we called sandwiches
growing up.

1029
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,935
So it's just a filling
of coriander paste

1030
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,735
with all the different spices
and everything, literally

1031
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,375
in two pieces of white bread,
and it was sensational.

1032
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,855
Filled with plaited wholemeal
bagels, Dana will weave plaits

1033
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,495
of her green chutney and sun dried
tomato dough

1034
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,735
over a mixing bowl to give her
picnic basket its shape.

1035
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,455
I am just doing a
three-strand plait.

1036
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,255
Only cos it's what I know and it's
the fastest and I have to

1037
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,535
cover the whole basket.

1038
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,455
So I want to go for speed.

1039
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,895
I'm going to do an eight-stranded
plait.

1040
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,695
Which I thought was a good idea
at the time.

1041
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,535
To sit snugly inside her
complicated,

1042
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,215
eight-strand honeyed challah,

1043
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,815
Cristy will also bake
a chocolate and almond babka,

1044
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,855
both traditional Jewish
plaited sweetbreads.

1045
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,655
My grandpa's Jewish.

1046
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,015
When I was younger, my grandpa lived
in a beautiful home in Primrose Hill

1047
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,655
and after Sunday lunch, we used to
go and walk through the park,

1048
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,055
so it's like to represent all
the lovely memories.

1049
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,575
Hopefully, I can do it justice.

1050
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,295
Gosh.

1051
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,335
Start plaiting.

1052
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,895
Help me, Lord.

1053
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,015
Bakers, two hours left,
you're halfway through.

1054
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,535
Is there anything
you'd like to say? No!

1055
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,975
If you want to speak to me,
you go through my lawyer.

1056
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,815
So, this is the trunk of the tree.

1057
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,735
It's quite long and remember, this
has got to stand up.

1058
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,055
So the nerves are setting in.

1059
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,975
Whether the bakers have been
ambitious

1060
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,535
with their choice of plait...

1061
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,175
There's six strands alternating,
some go above, some go below.

1062
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,935
Quite a complex one.

1063
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,855
Or have gone
for something simpler...

1064
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,255
These are three-strand plaits to
make the feathers of the peacock.

1065
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,695
Paul and Prue will expect
to see beautifully even braids.

1066
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,695
This is going to be my central
trunk. So, I'm doing nine strands.

1067
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,215
I've really enjoyed
the bread plaiting aspect of this.

1068
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,415
You just learn the rhythm
and then it's easy.

1069
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,735
Go across there...

1070
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,415
This is like maths to me, I don't
know what's going on. Um...

1071
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,735
The basket is taking shape.

1072
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,055
I had a dream last night that my
bread picnic basket

1073
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,055
was going to collapse.

1074
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,815
It has once on practice.

1075
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,575
I'm hoping it doesn't.

1076
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,095
I'm just shoving pecans
in the horns.

1077
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,415
As the bakers put the finishing
touches to

1078
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,095
their first plaited pieces...

1079
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,095
That's it done. Get that to prove.

1080
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,415
I just hope it's big enough.

1081
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,815
Dan and his ambitious,
five-piece Showstopper...

1082
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,655
I'm making my inside wreath.

1083
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,535
But I need to get my outside plaits
round them as well yet.

1084
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,015
Are falling behind.

1085
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,775
I am feeling pinched for time.

1086
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,015
There's a lot to do.

1087
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,255
So, yeah. Best get a wiggle on.

1088
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,735
What a day.

1089
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,935
To finish their plaited
bread Showstopper.

1090
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,135
One down. Not long enough left.

1091
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,855
So, these are going to prove.
Next is the leaves.

1092
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,375
What have I done?

1093
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,015
It's meant to be a four-strand plait

1094
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,215
and it's gone from a four-strand to
a three-strand into a four-strand.

1095
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,215
I've never messed something
up so badly.

1096
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,135
But it's a root, it's meant
to have in formalities.

1097
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,495
How you feeling, you all right?
It's a marathon.

1098
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,495
Bit stressed, but just get it done.
Well, I've just walked in here

1099
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,375
and I'm not being funny, the
atmosphere is very tense, isn't it?

1100
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,735
Everybody's really concentrating
on this today.

1101
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,416
It's because of Paul. Yeah. He's the
bread king. Do you know what I mean?

1102
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,935
Everyone wants to
impress him, isn't it?

1103
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,495
I'm plaiting snakes.

1104
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,815
I'm making a Medusa.

1105
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,535
Snakes. My grandma saw one
of my practice bakes

1106
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,055
and she thought they were prawns.

1107
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,415
My mum thought they were something
else entirely.

1108
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,895
So we'll see how they
turn out today!

1109
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,335
Inspired by a love
of Greek mythology,

1110
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,175
Tasha will plait Medusa's face
and hands from rye

1111
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,375
and wholemeal milk bread
filled with pastrami and cheese,

1112
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,975
while the green snakes will be made
from spelt dough

1113
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,815
flavoured with pistachio pesto.

1114
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,895
Are you hoping to turn
the judges to stone?

1115
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,575
So, I'm deliberately covering
her eyes.

1116
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,975
So, Paul and Prue are...
Are safe? Yes, exactly.

1117
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,095
Tasha's isn't the only Showstopper
likely to cause

1118
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,135
a few sleepless nights.

1119
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,855
I support West Ham,
so I'm going for a West Ham badge.

1120
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,175
Are you? Yeah.
And how they doing?

1121
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,775
We've had better days.

1122
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,775
They not doing good?

1123
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,095
Aw.

1124
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,535
By the time this airs,
they'll be smashing it.

1125
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,415
Keen to make a push
for top spot, Matty will plait

1126
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,775
the hammers from spiced,
wholegrain spelt dough,

1127
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,735
while the shield will be made from
two different plaited white doughs,

1128
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,775
one flavoured with Cheddar
and jalapenos,

1129
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,735
the other sun dried tomato,
basil and red onion.

1130
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,095
I like the idea of this.
The flavours sound good.

1131
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,535
And what about colouring it?
What colours are West Ham?

1132
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,095
They're claret and blue,
and on practice it just looked like

1133
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,455
what you get at a fairground.

1134
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,815
You don't think West Ham is
a fairground?

1135
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,095
No, we're a serious team now, Prue.
I see.

1136
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,175
And there's another sports fan in
the tent today.

1137
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,935
So, I'm doing a tiger cos
I'm a Leicester Tigers supporter,

1138
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,535
the rugby team. I've been followed
the Leicester Tigers

1139
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,335
for all my life.
We have a little tiger here.

1140
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,975
Which is what we'd often take
to games. I've had it for as long as

1141
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,335
I can remember going down.
It's an old tiger now.

1142
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,935
Josh will use two different
enriched doughs,

1143
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,815
one flavoured with cranberry
and orange,

1144
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,255
the other chocolate and orange,

1145
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,255
to create the tiger-stripe effect
once plaited.

1146
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,895
Is that your inspiration
over there?

1147
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,255
Yeah, that's my little tiger mascot.
Who is that?

1148
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,615
He's not really got a name, but...
Can I touch him?

1149
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,135
Course you can, yeah. He's not
got a name? Shall we name him?

1150
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,655
You can name him. What shall
we name him? Shall we go Paul?

1151
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,015
Well, it's Bread Week, isn't it?
Probably should.

1152
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,335
Let's call this Paul.
Let's get some water.

1153
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,015
We christen you... Paul Hollywood.

1154
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,895
There you go.

1155
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,415
Guys, one hour left.
You can do this.

1156
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,775
Right, last bit.
I'm just doing my letters,

1157
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,095
my I, Z and Z.
This needs to be done right now.

1158
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,656
I'm just going to make a couple of
ears. I'll just stick a nose on

1159
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,975
as well. I just think it looks like
a tiger head.

1160
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,295
These are for Angus' hair.

1161
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,615
What's happening here?
What are these...?

1162
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,895
It's Angus. It's a puzzle.

1163
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,016
Imagine if I couldn't do it.

1164
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,375
NICKY LAUGHS

1165
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,615
NOEL GROANS IN MOCK FRUSTRATION

1166
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,775
Yay!

1167
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,175
This is the base of a face which
mostly will be covered by her hands.

1168
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,975
This is worst part because the
plaits have to be so fine,

1169
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,135
otherwise they end up like
massive, club hands.

1170
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,655
My back is killing me.

1171
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,775
As the last plaits prove...

1172
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,655
OK, this is the hammers.

1173
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,055
Put that in now.

1174
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,655
The first are ready for the oven.

1175
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,415
It's going to go in at 230,
for about ten minutes,

1176
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,255
then we're turning it down.

1177
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,255
I'll do 20 but it might be longer.

1178
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,415
Cheerio.

1179
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,695
The head of the tiger's gone in the
oven. That'll have half an hour.

1180
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,295
But the bakers have no time
to rest.

1181
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,895
Look at that, it's a little
mushroom. Isn't that cute?

1182
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,295
These are going to be the eyes
for my tiger.

1183
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,135
And with so much still to bake...

1184
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,415
This is the babka.

1185
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,415
Their batch-baking skills are
being put to the test.

1186
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,615
We're going in. About 25 minutes.

1187
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,815
I've only got an hour to prove,
bake, assemble.

1188
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,655
So I'm feeling the stress.

1189
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,815
<i>And Rowan's not alone.</i>

1190
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,295
Dan's pizza is missing
a couple of crucial details.

1191
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,655
Not done me little bit
for P or me A.

1192
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,375
I've literally got no dough left.

1193
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,615
Absolute shocker.

1194
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,615
Trying to think how I can make
the letters.

1195
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,215
As the first bakes exit the oven...

1196
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,255
My gosh. She's enormous.

1197
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,575
Yeah, reckon that's about done.

1198
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,655
Rowan's giant marzipan tree trunk
is finally ready to go in.

1199
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,095
This will be until it's
golden brown.

1200
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,575
I don't work in numbers,
I work in visuals.

1201
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,895
I'm painting the last of my snakes
and then I'm done,

1202
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,175
but they just need to bake.

1203
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,135
Last little bit of glossing.

1204
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,495
Go on matey. Do your business.

1205
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,815
I'm just going to bang 'em in.

1206
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,135
With the pizza wreaths
finally baking...

1207
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,295
Cross all fingers.

1208
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,695
Dan has a plan for his
missing letters.

1209
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,255
I'm just going to do some
dead dough,

1210
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,175
which is essentially just flour
and water.

1211
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,495
Shape some bits coming off of a P
and two for the A.

1212
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,680
It's the only thing I can do.

1213
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,295
Bakers, you've got half
an hour left.

1214
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,535
It's going to be tight.

1215
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,055
Last one.

1216
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,375
Everything is in the oven,
I've just put in my leaves.

1217
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,015
This is the top of the tree.

1218
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,895
Making it green, otherwise it don't
look like owt, really, does it?

1219
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,895
With these on top. So, these are my
little rowan berries.

1220
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,255
It's looking nice.
I'm going to glaze it now.

1221
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,415
It looks really good.

1222
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,935
I'm just waiting for the last one
to come out.

1223
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,375
It's heavy.

1224
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,855
Do you have to take the bowl out?

1225
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,255
No. That's the thing, as soon as
the bowl comes out,

1226
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,255
if it's not cooled down,
it'll just collapse.

1227
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,255
Right, that's everything out.
These are my wild garlic flowers.

1228
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:58,655
I'm using them to illustrate
the tree being in blossom.

1229
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,415
The letters,
I'm going to put 'em in 20 minutes.

1230
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,895
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes left.

1231
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,015
No, I'm not.

1232
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,175
It's coming out.

1233
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,800
Should be patient.

1234
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,935
It's ever so slightly doughy,

1235
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,215
so I want it back in
for literally a minute.

1236
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,055
I'd rather Paul and Prue say,

1237
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:27,455
"They've cooked their edges
a bit," than go, "They're raw."

1238
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,255
Angus, mate, you've risen.

1239
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,535
Sounds good.

1240
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,335
We're just freestyling.

1241
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,135
Doing bits of blue and
then we'll do bits of claret.

1242
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,975
He's got all his stripes going down,
so I'm pleased, yeah.

1243
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,295
This is the babka. It's looking nice

1244
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,575
but I don't know if it's going to
go in the middle.

1245
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,295
Stressful.

1246
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,855
I can only go as fast as
the oven, unfortunately, can't I?

1247
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,735
Please be done, please be done,
please be done.

1248
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,175
You are done.

1249
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,895
Little Angus, come on, matey.

1250
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,455
Whoa.

1251
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,735
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1252
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,175
Tight.

1253
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,175
Come on.

1254
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,495
Maybe I should just present it
on the side?

1255
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,335
It's OK,
everything's still quite warm.

1256
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,855
Think that's a bit under.

1257
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,055
They do actually look like little
mushrooms, don't they?

1258
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,815
Bakers, that is your time up.

1259
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,295
Please step away from
your Showstoppers.

1260
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,095
Well, I'm happy with that.

1261
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,695
It's still up.

1262
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,495
I've managed to get it up
and keep it up.

1263
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,415
It's turned out exactly how
I wanted to.

1264
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,695
That's all I can ask for,
isn't it, every time.

1265
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:53,135
It's judgment time for the bakers'
plaited bread Showstoppers.

1266
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,455
Josh, bring your Showstopper to
the front, let's have a look.

1267
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,935
I think it's amazing.

1268
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,055
It's really effective

1269
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,415
and I think you've chosen wisely
with the doughs

1270
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,775
to give you that depth of colour
with the chocolate bread

1271
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,416
and then the cranberry
and orange one as well.

1272
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,095
And you get the face shape just by
plaiting. It's absolutely amazing.

1273
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,775
Does this mascot have a name?

1274
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,615
It was christened Paul
by Alison, so...

1275
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:25,095
It was a beautiful christening.
It was lovely.

1276
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,815
It's absolutely delicious.

1277
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,415
Fantastic flavour.
I think it's gorgeous.

1278
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,135
It's very much an enriched dough

1279
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,055
but you've managed to achieve the
same texture in the two doughs

1280
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,295
and that's quite a trick.

1281
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,655
It's very clever.
, I think it's ingenious.

1282
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,415
I think it's well thought out
and well executed. Excellent.

1283
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,855
Thank you.

1284
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,055
The overall look
of that I think is beautiful.

1285
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:47,815
It's really clever.

1286
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,415
Let's try this.

1287
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,255
Remind me of the flavours.

1288
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,695
It's pecan and date.

1289
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,415
I've had quite a big lump there
and there's just nothing in there.

1290
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,455
It tastes lovely if you get a pecan.

1291
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,335
So this is Comte cheese
and lardons.

1292
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,615
Certainly get the cheese.

1293
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,175
Do you? It's lovely.

1294
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,895
The cheese you get.
There is no bacon.

1295
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,415
I think your display's incredible.

1296
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,695
It's down to distribution
of your flavours inside.

1297
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,695
I hope you're, allowed
back in the ground, mate.

1298
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,055
That's a bit unkind.

1299
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,455
I like your design, actually,
it's lovely.

1300
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,095
It's like a bit of art.

1301
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,055
Let's try this one first.

1302
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,535
This looks a bit biscuity.

1303
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,495
It's bone dry.
Now this looks more promising.

1304
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,895
You can see the structure on that
is so much better.

1305
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,095
I like the chillies.
And the bread is just beautiful.

1306
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,615
The bread is very good.

1307
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,055
Saku, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please.

1308
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,255
Do you want a hand?

1309
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,775
Come on, Saku. Stop messing around.

1310
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,735
I think it looks great.
It's quite striking.

1311
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,255
But this is under proved.

1312
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,375
You can see that by the split all
the way down the middle of it.

1313
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,695
Try that one.

1314
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,975
That is spelt seeded.

1315
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,655
It's quite gluey in the mouth.

1316
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,055
It's a bit bland
and a bit dense.

1317
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,455
Remind us again
of the flavours of this?

1318
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,375
Rosemary and garlic.

1319
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,255
You've certainly got the flavour
but it's quite dry.

1320
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,055
I think it's really impressive
bread art.

1321
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,335
It's a little disappointing to eat.

1322
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,175
Well, I have to say it looks
absolutely fantastic.

1323
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,935
Thank you. And you should be proud
of your dad too.

1324
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,615
Yeah. Thanks, John.

1325
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:39,215
This is?
The wholemeal sweet curry.

1326
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,695
It is very strong.

1327
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,575
It's hideous, yeah.
The dough is raw inside.

1328
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,295
It's so, so dense.

1329
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,975
There's so much curry in there,

1330
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,735
the yeast is going,
"Help me I can't rise!"

1331
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,215
OK. This is the...?

1332
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,975
Smoked bacon, rosemary and Parmesan.

1333
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,455
It's quite heavy. OK.

1334
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,055
Over flavoured again.

1335
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,615
And yeast is going, "Not on the
second time, I still can't rise!"

1336
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,536
Is it going to be the same
for this, do you think?

1337
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,615
Who knows?

1338
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,055
This is the marzipan.

1339
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,335
Yeah. Now that's more open.

1340
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,575
That looks lovely.

1341
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,015
That is such a relief after
the strength of your other flavours.

1342
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,975
And the crust is
absolutely delicious.

1343
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,175
But it's not enough to compensate
for the other two.

1344
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,615
I'm just gonna...

1345
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,455
Absolutely, that's what I wanted
to do.

1346
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,815
The best of it is this
beautiful plaiting

1347
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,775
and frankly I think you've spoilt it
with all this tat.

1348
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,455
Tat?! I thought that was one of
your earrings, Prue.

1349
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,775
This one is...?

1350
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,335
Coriander and cumin.

1351
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,975
Dana, that is delicious.

1352
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,575
Your flavours are absolutely
spot on.

1353
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,055
I just would've liked
a little bit of crispiness on there.

1354
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,695
When you're doing a basket,

1355
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,975
take it off the bowl cos this
has now gone soggy. Yeah.

1356
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,015
The bread, as it's cooling,
is sweating on the bowl.

1357
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,015
But I think it tastes great.

1358
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,375
It's beautiful. My mouth's watering.

1359
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,895
I actually want to eat it.

1360
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,335
But because you didn't get that
in there,

1361
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,975
you don't see the glory
of the centrepiece.

1362
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,335
But let's have a quick look
at this one first.

1363
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,055
That looks beautiful, doesn't it?
It's very light.

1364
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,455
OK, good.

1365
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,015
It's a lovely challah,
the flavour's fantastic.

1366
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,055
I think the texture's good.
Let's just taste that.

1367
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,655
Lovely flavour.

1368
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,495
The nuts and the chocolate
work really well together.

1369
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,015
They're both very good breads.

1370
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,495
I think overall
the design is rudimentary.

1371
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,375
This is a what plait?

1372
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,655
A nine.
That's the walnut and stilton.

1373
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,495
Needs to be more stilton in there.

1374
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,175
There is definitely a flavour,

1375
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,055
but you can get much,
much stronger flavour than that.

1376
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,375
This is the wild garlic and...?
And nettle.

1377
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,175
It's extremely green, isn't it?

1378
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,175
It feels as if it's doing you good.

1379
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,535
Yeah, I like the flavour
of that, it's really unusual.

1380
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,015
But needs to be more open.
It's a bit dense. Cake like.

1381
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,735
I'm so interested in that
dock seed flour.

1382
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,455
There's a,
almost a pepperiness to it.

1383
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,935
I do like your flavours.

1384
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,655
They're unusual, some of them I've
never had before and I like that.

1385
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,495
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Abbi.

1386
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,335
These aren't baked
I mean, that colour's wrong.

1387
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,615
Did you just run out of time and
have to take them out of the oven

1388
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,095
before they were baked? Yeah.

1389
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,855
It's a shame. Is this all the same?

1390
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:29,015
Yeah. Tuscan sausage, nduja, tomato,
mozzarella and basil.

1391
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,775
It's quite powerful.

1392
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,255
It's too doughy.
More air, more bake.

1393
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,655
I think this one might be
a little bit raw.

1394
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:39,975
It's such a pity

1395
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,295
because that has the makings
of a really good loaf.

1396
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,135
It's just so unlike you.

1397
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,175
You know, I know, we all know

1398
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,495
you can do a hell of a lot better
than that.

1399
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,855
OK?

1400
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,935
I think it's beautiful.

1401
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,295
I think it really is,
it's a work of art.

1402
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,615
The hands are the most beautifully
plaited,

1403
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,215
look at those little fingers.

1404
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,775
The face has real expression,
quite sinister.

1405
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,215
And the hair, very, very clever.

1406
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,215
You've caught some of them in
the oven.

1407
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,175
It's just gone a little bit
too dark. Yeah.

1408
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,775
Let's try the pesto one.

1409
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,415
It's a really strong fresh
pesto. Just delicious.

1410
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,375
That's very good.
Now let's try the face, shall we?

1411
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,815
That's pastrami and cheese.

1412
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,775
Tasha, you are one hell
of a bread baker.

1413
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,695
Wow. Thank you.

1414
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,935
That is beautiful.

1415
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,255
Stunning.

1416
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,575
Wow,

1417
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,455
Never seen anything
like that before.

1418
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,815
The flavours are good,
the textures are good.

1419
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,935
You understand bread
and I like that.

1420
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,855
Thank you. Thank you.
Well done, Tasha.

1421
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,495
Well done. Thank you.

1422
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,935
Well done, Tash, amazing.

1423
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,575
Well done, girl.

1424
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,735
Yeah, I'm so happy.

1425
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,055
That comment from Paul,

1426
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:13,095
I think that's the biggest win
of bread week for me.

1427
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,455
I understand bread.

1428
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,895
Flipping heck.

1429
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,335
That's amazing.

1430
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,615
Diabolical.

1431
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,735
Paul said monstrous yesterday,
hideous today.

1432
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,455
Gonna get that tattooed.

1433
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,815
They did have their criticisms
but they really liked my flavours.

1434
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,735
I'm aware that because of how
yesterday went,

1435
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,215
I still might not have done enough.

1436
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,775
Pretty gutted to be fair,
I was looking forward to bread week.

1437
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,095
Prue gave me some nice words
cos she knows I can do it.

1438
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,415
I know myself I can do it.

1439
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,495
But I have a sense I'm probably
gonna go today.

1440
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,775
Well, bread week's ended up as dread
week, didn't it?

1441
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,655
Well, some of it was
a bit disappointing.

1442
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,375
I think some of the bakers got a bit
caught up with the plaiting

1443
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,255
and ignored the flavour and the
texture.

1444
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,615
Point in question would be Rowan.
Yeah.

1445
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,695
Because however great that tree
looked, that curry bread was,

1446
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,695
I wouldn't say unedible
but it was certainly on the way.

1447
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,735
I was quite shocked with Dan.
Everything was raw. Is he in danger?

1448
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,775
He is. He did really well in the
signature.

1449
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,095
But nevertheless he's put himself
down there.

1450
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,935
Yeah. Can we talk about Abbi?

1451
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,655
Abbi's had a bit
of a shocker as well.

1452
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,975
The thing I loved was her foraging.

1453
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,495
Her flavours were unique but overall
it came down to textures.

1454
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,215
Who really surprised you today?
You loved Tasha's, didn't you?

1455
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,735
The flavours she achieved
was really, really nice.

1456
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,495
And she did it so beautifully.

1457
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,295
I mean, those hands are
just exquisite.

1458
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,215
Amazing. Same size as your hands.

1459
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,895
I know! And I felt like Josh
is really good.

1460
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,335
That was a great loaf.

1461
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,975
So now for Star Baker, I think it is
between Josh and Tasha.

1462
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,735
Going home, it's between Dan,
Abbi... Abbi... and Rowan.

1463
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,735
Well, you've definitely got some big
decisions to make.

1464
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,215
Good luck. Thank you, Alison.

1465
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,495
If you didn't wrap it up,
we'd be here forever.

1466
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,735
Hi there, Bakers.

1467
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,415
I'm really, really excited to be
announcing this week's Star Baker,

1468
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,135
and according to the judges
they are absolutely smashing it.

1469
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,735
So this week's Star Baker is...

1470
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,695
Tasha.

1471
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,255
APPLAUSE

1472
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,935
Which means I've got the horrible
job of announcing

1473
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,295
the person who is leaving us.

1474
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:32,855
And the person who is leaving us
this week is...

1475
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,415
Abbi.

1476
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,215
Sorry. That's OK.

1477
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,775
Well done.

1478
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,575
I knew it was coming.

1479
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,135
You know what? I'm really proud
of myself, and...

1480
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,655
Sorry, got my hanky this time.

1481
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,575
I'm absolutely gutted. Abbi.

1482
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,375
I never thought I'd be able
to do this.

1483
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,215
It's given me such
a massive confidence boost

1484
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,055
and I met such amazing people.

1485
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:10,135
I'm going to remember it every day
for the rest of my life, honestly.

1486
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,455
But I'm quite looking forward to
getting back to my vegetables.

1487
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,335
What are we going to do without you?

1488
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:19,695
I do feel lucky. It's a
bit bittersweet.

1489
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,615
I'm devoed, because I love Abbi.

1490
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,935
You don't want your friends
to leave, do you?

1491
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,815
And we're all friends, it's awful.

1492
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,375
A lot better next time. Yeah.

1493
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,855
Abbi going's really tough.

1494
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,695
Love the girl, love her to bits.
She's absolutely brilliant.

1495
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,735
Did enough to go through but I can't
afford another week like this.

1496
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,295
Check you out!

1497
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,855
Thank you. Two in a row!

1498
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,775
Bloody hell.

1499
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,215
I got Star Baker again.

1500
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,895
What the hell?

1501
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,695
What the hell?

1502
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,015
Tash, that's amazing. Bloody hell.

1503
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:53,655
I go into things with quite low
expectations of myself and...

1504
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,575
I think I need to stop doing that.

1505
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,055
Next time...

1506
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,895
Guess what? More chocolate.

1507
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,375
It's chocolate week.

1508
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,975
I'm not worried, are you?

1509
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,455
The bakers are taught
a hard lesson in the signature...

1510
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,815
Because I don't like tortes,
I haven't actually tasted it.

1511
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,015
Good luck with this one.

1512
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,295
Feel the heat in a cheesecake
technical...

1513
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,775
and must keep their temper...

1514
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,095
God. It's not tempering well
enough.

1515
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,375
In a chocolate box Showstopper,

1516
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,135
that will push the bakers...

1517
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,535
My heart is breaking right now.

1518
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,615
.To their limit.

1519
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,975
Tasha, are you all right?

1520
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,255
You can take as much time as you
need, all right? OK.

1521
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,975
Are you a Star Baker in the making?
