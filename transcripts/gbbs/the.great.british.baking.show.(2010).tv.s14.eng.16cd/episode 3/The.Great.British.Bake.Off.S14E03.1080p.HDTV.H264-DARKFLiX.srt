1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,040
Noel, I got a few questions for you.
Hit me up.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,360
Flan or tart, what's the difference?
You'd have to ask Prue.
What's an even bake?

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,360
You'd have to ask Paul. Do you even
know anything about baking?
Not really.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,240
How long you been on
this show? Seven years.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,160
Do you still find a soggy bottom
funny? 'Course I do,
I'm not an idiot.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,560
Has anyone ever been injured by a
Hollywood handshake? I'm not at
liberty to disclose

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,000
that information. who's
Kate's Corner? It's Kate Corner.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,960
Kate Corner's just a woman who lives
down my street. What's cake corner?

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,920
Cake corner's a corner where we eat
cake. What week is it?
It's Bread Week.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,400
Can I do the fun part now?
Yes, you can. Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,720
Did you enjoy that?
I really loved it. Me too. Thanks.

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,800
Last time...

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,440
Come on, custard creams.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,480
...the bakers battled biscuits...
SHE GASPS

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,000
...and while Josh served up
a stunning Showstopper...

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,520
Everything about it is spot on.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,600
...it was Tasha...

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,280
I think they're delicate, I think
they're pretty and I have to...

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,640
ALISON GASPS
..shake your... Ah, good for you!

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,280
...that earned this year's
first handshake

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,720
and took home Star Baker...

22
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,080
Gotta put some peanuts on.
..but Keith's lack of finesse...

23
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,440
Ooh, dear.
..and under baked Showstopper.

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,840
I shouldn't be able to push my
finger in like that. PRUE: No.

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,720
...meant he had to say goodbye
to the tent.

26
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,040
It's been so lovely to meet you,
Prue.

27
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,440
ALISON: This time, it's bread week.

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,800
I'm really nervous.
You nervous about this one?

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,160
I just don't want him to not like
it. Is it all about Paul? Yeah.

30
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,200
The bakers take on
a classic cottage loaf Signature...

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,800
Oh, I've never been
so stressed making bread.

32
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,240
SHE GASPS
It's enormous...

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,080
Oh, my God.
..a traditional Technical...

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,160
SHE CHUFFS

35
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,640
...that leaves some hot under
the collar... Cool those balls!

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,920
...and a plaited Showstopper...

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,040
Help me, lord.

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,960
...that has them tied up in knots.

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,240
Ah! Oh...

40
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,720
Stressful.

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,800
SMASH, SHE GASPS

42
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,080
Chuff tog heck.
You just want an easy life.

43
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,560
Bread week is one of the most feared
weeks, isn't it

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,520
cos Paul's gonna be coming round

45
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,240
poking all our loaves
seeing if they're cooked or not.

46
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,960
Love baking my bread, not too sure
about doing it in a tent

47
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,320
with Paul Hollywood looking at me,
but...!

48
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,080
Paul is the bread king.
Ah, so nervous.

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,440
I don't know if it's nerves or if
it was the dodgy prawn

50
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,440
I had last night,
but something's churning.

51
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,240
I've definitely got
the bread dread.

52
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,560
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

53
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,400
It's bread week
and for your Signature Challenge,

54
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,640
the judges would love you
to make a cottage loaf.

55
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,040
Paul and Prue are looking for
a classic cottage loaf shape

56
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,840
that's two stacked cobs

57
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,480
and don't worry, it doesn't have to
be an actual cottage.

58
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,880
CHUCKLING

59
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,760
They are not gonna spend
a mini break inside your loaf.

60
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,040
ALISON LAUGHS

61
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,600
Your loaves can be flavour
and the style of bread dough

62
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,920
is entirely up to you, so go wild.

63
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,920
These are heady times we're
living in.

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,000
You've got two hours, and,
because we're feeling generous,

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,840
another 45 minutes.

66
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,240
On your marks... Get set...

67
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,400
Bake!

68
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,080
Right, let's get going
with this then.

69
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,600
I do like bread,
so hopefully Paul'll like it,

70
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,480
hopefully it'll all go to plan.

71
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,920
I don't make bread. I don't.
So this is not my week.

72
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,760
Everyone's scared of eating bread
now, aren't they? Not me.

73
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,680
No, not me. I love eating bread.
I love it!

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,120
That's my bread pouch,
muffin, crumpet, baguettes.

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,680
It's bread week and the
Signature Challenge

76
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,720
is a cottage loaf.

77
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,040
It's two loaves,
one on top of the other.

78
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,320
A little round one on the top

79
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,880
and a bigger round one underneath.

80
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,240
The lovely thing
about a cottage loaf,

81
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,720
simple though it is,

82
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,080
is it does cover all the skills
that really matter in bread making.

83
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,680
You need to spend a bit of time
developing that gluten,

84
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,560
mixing and kneading properly.

85
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,480
You don't want it to be too dense.

86
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,160
You want a little bit
of spring in it.

87
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,880
The joining of the two balls
is important

88
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,200
and they must be stable
and grow up rather than flat,

89
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,880
so you want a bit of height
to this.

90
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,880
We want perfection to impress us.

91
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,680
They've just gotta make good bread.

92
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,480
Morning, Cristy. Hello.
Hello, Cristy. Morning!

93
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,200
Right, Cristy, tell us all about
your cottage loaf.

94
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,080
So I'm doing dried cranberries,
chopped walnuts and rosemary.

95
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,960
Is this a favourite recipe?

96
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,280
Yeah. My kids love it. I love it.

97
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,280
NOEL: Always a hit at home, Cristy's
loaf packed full of

98
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,040
sweet cranberries, rosemary
and walnuts also contains

99
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,080
multigrain flour for an extra hit
of nutty flavour.

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,400
Do you think it hinders the growth
of the dough at all

101
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,680
if you add too much flavour?

102
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,200
Yeah. No. I don't know.

103
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,600
It's not a test!
OK, you make me nervous!

104
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,440
I just wanna impress you both.

105
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,000
Well, good luck, I think it sounds
great. Thank you. Oh, OK!

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,720
Thank you. Thanks, Alison.
It's not an exam!

107
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,120
I'm nervous. It's cos he just knows
everything about bread.

108
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,560
You've got this, you've made it
before. You've got it.

109
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,920
I'm full of bread. Not stopped
eating it. What,

110
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,840
have you been eating bread?
Oh, I love a bit of bread.

111
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,040
I can do it all day long.

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,080
Saku's also aiming to impress
with a family favourite.

113
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,680
My kids love cinnamon toast
with orange juice

114
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,880
so I'm making cinnamon
and orange cottage loaf.

115
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,920
She'll add orange zest
to her dough for a citrus kick

116
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,280
to complement the warmth of
the cinnamon

117
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,160
that she's sourced
from somewhere special.

118
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,880
Sri Lanka is very famous
for its spices.

119
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,320
Always my cinnamon coming from
Sri Lanka. This is from home.

120
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,440
I brought my own rosemary from home

121
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,200
so from my mum's garden.

122
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
She has a very small
vegetable garden.

123
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,640
She won't like
that I've said it was very small,

124
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,440
but it's her pride and joy.

125
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,080
Looking to build on last week's
success, reigning Star Baker Tasha

126
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,440
will roast her mum's rosemary
with garlic

127
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,880
before kneading it through her
seed-packed dough.

128
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,760
But her classic flavour combination
faces competition.

129
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,520
I was quietly confident

130
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,560
and then, there are four people
doing rosemary and garlic.

131
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,880
But it's fine.
It's just a battle of the garlic!

132
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,000
This is wild garlic.
Love picking my wild garlic.

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,080
Got a secret patch near me
no-one knows about.

134
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,040
Foraging fan Dan will add rosemary
and smoked bacon to his wild garlic

135
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,680
to flavour his main loaf

136
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,160
and he'll make a wild garlic pesto
to fold through his top cob.

137
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,720
Do you go foraging? I do, yeah.
Yeah, I do a bit of fungus.

138
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,040
Fungus. You got a basket? Yeah.

139
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,000
What do you wear, speedos?
Yeah, leopard skin speedos.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,920
Massive top hat. Yeah, flippers.
With a door in it. Yeah!

141
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,080
And then throw the mushrooms in.
Goes in, yeah!

142
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,480
Just gonna check how the gluten is
doing. It feels pretty good.

143
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,240
Kneading the dough helps to develop
the strands of gluten,

144
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,320
crucial to producing the perfect
texture demanded by Paul and Prue.

145
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,400
Like a rocking motion just
to get right through the dough.

146
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,880
But it's a labour intensive task.

147
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,520
You warmed up now, Nicky? Have
I warmed up? You warmed up?

148
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,920
Yeah, I'm getting there.
I need to take my jumper off now.

149
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,840
I'm letting the machine do
the hard work

150
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,000
and then I'll put it out on
the bench for a couple of minutes

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,680
and just pretend that I've done it!

152
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,280
I like kneading by hand cos it gives
you more control over the dough

153
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,160
and you can feel when it's ready,
rather than just guess.

154
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,080
I've done 300 hand kneads.
I count them all to make sure.

155
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,880
Abbi taste-tested her garlic
and rosemary cottage loaf

156
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,200
with the local village community
lunch where it went down a storm.

157
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,680
A success that she puts down to the
addition of a special ingredient.

158
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,160
I'm using smoked garlic and it has
an absolutely amazing smell.

159
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,520
Garlic, rosemary...
Just really nice.

160
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,480
It's a great classic combo,
isn't it?

161
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,840
The roasting of the garlic
just enhances the flavour

162
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,480
and I've got Scottish sea salt.

163
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,080
Oops, look at that,
went in a bit too much.

164
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,880
Nicky will add her roast garlic,

165
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,160
rosemary and Scottish sea salt paste

166
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,960
to her dough after its first prove.

167
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,480
And to ensure even distribution,
she's taking no risks.

168
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,240
I am not going to use
the stand mixer.

169
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,040
I'm doing it by hand.

170
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,320
I'm doing the kneading in the mixer
just to save me some arm strength,

171
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,240
basically. I like heat,
so I'm doing chipotle,

172
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,520
smoked Cheddar and bacon.

173
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,040
This is smoked Cheddar.

174
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,640
It's literally just amplifying that
smoky taste,

175
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,240
so if he says he can't taste
the flavour, that's a lie!

176
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,400
SHE LAUGHS

177
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,720
Ooh...
RATTLE, SMASH

178
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,760
God.

179
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,280
SHE GASPS

180
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,960
I meant to do that! You can taste
shards of glass. Yummy.

181
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,240
Starting from scratch,
Dana will add smoked paprika

182
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,720
to her second batch
of spicy chipotle dough

183
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,640
for an extra hit of smoky heat.

184
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,960
Yeah, I think it should be great,
as long as it's not

185
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,000
totally overpowering.

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,920
I mean, sometimes, smoke can just be
too much.

187
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,560
Well, it's not like a bonfire smoke.

188
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,480
It's more like just a little subtle
kick, so...

189
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,960
Have you got a name for your bread?

190
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,560
Um, Bread-ley Cooper.
Bread-ley Cooper!

191
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,880
I just thought, a bit of spice.
LAUGHTER

192
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,160
I love that.

193
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,520
This is about the stage
I'm happy with now.

194
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,480
If you hold it up to the window,
it'll stretch out nice and thin

195
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,800
without tearing
so you can see through it.

196
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,320
That'll do us. Beautiful.

197
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,960
It's just gonna go now into
the proving drawer for an hour.

198
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,680
Will it fit? Yeah.

199
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,480
Now the waiting game.

200
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,440
This is the, like, sit about and
have a cup of tea part of the bake.

201
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,360
Which is very, very nice
for once in a challenge!

202
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,480
I didn't bring a book
to read or game to play.

203
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,960
Let's play tic, tac, toe.

204
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,520
Are you into cricket? Yes.
I'm such a good batter.

205
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,040
Really? So, so good.
So I'm a bowler, you are a batter.

206
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,080
If you could bowl, I could bat.

207
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,440
It's not gonna work, is it?
No. Oh, my God!

208
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,720
It's a complete disaster!

209
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,000
Go on. Oh!

210
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,960
Sorry!
SHE LAUGHS

211
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,880
Right in the thigh.

212
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,800
I thought you was gonna do it
softly!

213
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,200
I feel like everybody else
has got theirs...proving

214
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,760
and I'm still working on mine.

215
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,080
It's a big dough.

216
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,520
I've got, like,
700g of flour in here.

217
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,280
Rowan's large loaf filled
with kalamata olives

218
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,760
and sun dried tomatoes is inspired
by a sun-strewn holiday to the Med.

219
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,080
I went to Amalfi.

220
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,440
The Amalfi coast, it were good...
It were expensive.

221
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,640
I mean a sorbet, you had to take out
a mortgage, so it was...

222
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,840
It was a place I'd never go back to.

223
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,720
Far from the glitz and glamour of
the Italian Riviera,

224
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,400
Josh is recreating one of his
Italy"s most humble offerings.

225
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,760
I am making a pizza-inspired
nduja...

226
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,240
...and honey, cottage loaf.

227
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,600
So I've got nduja-spiced
spreadable sausage in there

228
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,960
which is gonna be spread over
the dough once it's proved.

229
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,280
You don't wanna put your flavours
in in the first prove.

230
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,680
It's gonna affect the way it rises,

231
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,360
so I'll mix it all in
on the second one.

232
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,440
Along with spicy nduja sausage,

233
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,760
Josh will throw handfuls
of black olives,

234
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,600
basil and Gruyere into his loaf

235
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,040
for that flavour-packed
pizza experience.

236
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,360
It's like a meal in your bread.
It is, yeah, you've got

237
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,720
a lot of things going on in there.

238
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,520
It doesn't inhibit
its rise or anything?

239
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,880
It gets a nice rise. I know it's a
bit more of a risk, maybe,

240
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,560
putting bits of cheese in there
as well, but I wanted to give myself

241
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,880
a bit of a challenge. All right.
Good luck. Thank you very much.

242
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,480
Bakers, you are halfway through.

243
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,440
You can do it guys. Maybe.

244
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,120
HE LAUGHS

245
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm just gonna have to go with it.

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,320
Looks like all right. Yes.

247
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,920
A lovely first prove that.
You can see the bubbles there,

248
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,480
you can see a lot of
carbon...dioxide in there!

249
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
Remember my elements, then.

250
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,040
It's not as proved as I would like.

251
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,760
But I think the second prove is far
more important than the first one

252
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,680
because that's what
gives you the shape.

253
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,440
ALISON: But before shaping starts...
I'm gonna put my filling in.

254
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,880
...there's one last opportunity
for the bakers

255
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,760
to add even more flavour
to their dough.

256
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,960
So I've got Gruyere cheese, basil
and I've got some olives as well.

257
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,280
It looks like a pizza anyway so.

258
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,840
Who doesn't like a bit of roast
garlic? Oh, and with your meat.

259
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,280
This is the smoked Cheddar, so I'm
just gonna get that rolled in.

260
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,080
It's just making sure it all just
goes through the dough

261
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,440
and there's no sort of empty
pockets.

262
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,800
I'm really pleased with this.
Just want to be able to get

263
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,120
a really good bit of shaping on it
now. Key to creating the classic

264
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,280
cottage loaf shape is both size
and proportion.

265
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,520
The top is a bit smaller.
It has that little hat.

266
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,080
I'm gonna split it into
a third and two thirds.

267
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,440
They're quite big balls.
I don't want it to be like

268
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,800
a little stuck on ball
on top of the bottom.

269
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,160
Three quarters to a quarter.
You have gotta, like,

270
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,080
trust your instinct
which is easier said than done

271
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,640
when there's everyone else
around you

272
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,240
doing the same thing, but different.

273
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Bursting with olives,
sun dried tomato and Parmesan,

274
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,800
Matty's keen to add heat
to his loaf with the addition

275
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,440
of chilli flakes to his dough.

276
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,200
I think the flavours are
great inside.

277
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,800
When it comes to
the overall look of it,

278
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,080
tell us about the proportion,
your...ball size.

279
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,280
Three quarters bottom,
one quarter on top.

280
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,240
Oh, so you've got a little one on
top and then...

281
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,040
...a big ball underneath. Yeah!
HE CHUCKLES

282
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,960
LAUGHING: They're in proportion
though...

283
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,240
They seem slightly out of
proportion, the ball size.

284
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,720
Don't be naughty. I'm just saying!

285
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
Would you go two thirds, one third?

286
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,280
I don't know.
It's entirely up to you.

287
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,840
Not only does a cottage loaf require
perfectly proportioned balls...

288
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,360
Hello, wee man.
..but the bakers must ensure

289
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,640
that they stay firmly in place too.

290
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,800
Here we go.

291
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,080
Flour up the old fingers.

292
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,640
Ah, dear.

293
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm a bit stuck!

294
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,160
Just three firm jabs.

295
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,720
I hope it will work.

296
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,240
SINGSONG: Going in the proving
drawer again.

297
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,880
That's the biggest loaf I have made
in a long time.

298
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,480
Right, half an hour in there.

299
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,840
Have you got a proving drawer
at home?

300
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,080
No. The kitchen's normally about
the right temperature.

301
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,840
Is it too cold in here? It's Baltic,
yeah. Do you get ever cold hands?

302
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,120
Yeah, I do get...

303
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,440
If you put your hands out like that,

304
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,400
and pump really hard up and down.
You don't get cold hands?!

305
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,320
You don't get cold hands! Really?

306
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,600
Yeah! And an egg comes out.

307
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,760
THEY LAUGH

308
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,600
Bakers, you only have one hour left.

309
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,800
Few more mins.
It's a lot of proving, innit, this.

310
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,360
It's a lot of proving. They don't
do anything in this, do they?

311
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,960
Yeah, just sort of wandering about,
waiting... Like what we do!

312
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,880
SHE CACKLES

313
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,760
It's just about holding your nerve.

314
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,480
If you don't give it the time
it needs to rise,

315
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,760
then it's gonna be more
like a flat bread!

316
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,800
Hmm, it's a bit flat, innit?

317
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,200
Oh, my gosh.

318
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,480
She's not very cottage
loaf-shaped any more.

319
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,120
Hmm...

320
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,560
I'm painting my lovely ball in red,
blue and green,

321
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,520
to make it look kind of Italian.
I wanted to add a bit of pop.

322
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,600
Did you pop it in the proving
drawer? Yes. Did it get bigger?

323
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,400
This is my problem - I can't
remember the size of it before

324
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,760
I put it in the proving drawer,
so...! Goldfish. I'm kind of like...

325
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,640
It's getting there. I know. Oh!

326
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,600
Wish I had a photogenic memory,
then 1'd be like,

327
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,960
"Yes, you know what,
that's risen by an eighth..."

328
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,280
Can you have a photogenic memory?
No, a photographic...! However...

329
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,400
In it goes.

330
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,960
It'll bake for about 50 minutes
because it's so huge.

331
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,320
Three more minutes.

332
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,000
Pancakes for breakfast everybody.
Here she is.

333
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,720
What shall we name her? Janice.

334
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,400
Right, I'm gonna score it.

335
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,800
ALISON: Scoring the dough
is key to maintaining

336
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,640
the unique cottage loaf shape.

337
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,280
It's letting it breathe a little bit

338
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,640
so that, when it bakes,
it can expand out.

339
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,840
...and deep precise cuts
will produce better shaped loaves.

340
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,640
Are you scoring it with this?

341
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,960
I've got a lame.

342
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,520
I've just got a sharp knife that
... Yeah, but that's all right.

343
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,680
SHE MIMES SLASHING

344
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,160
Looks cottagey.
We're going in for 30 minutes.

345
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,480
40 to 45 minutes IS what it usually
does at home.

346
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,440
Oh, there you go, Janice.

347
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,800
Maybe the oven will solve
all ailments.

348
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,880
Just, it's now gotta watch it bake.
Oh, God.

349
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,400
I'm going to sit here
and watch and pray.

350
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
SHE LAUGHS

351
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,760
Oh, it's looking great!
I've just turned it round.

352
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,280
I'm trying to give it a really good
colour.

353
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,640
I know Paul likes a lot of colour
on his bread. Yeah...

354
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,560
I'm excited. Are you excited?
I'm really nervous.

355
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,120
You nervous about this one? I just
don't want him to not like it.

356
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,680
Is it all about Paul? Yeah.
Good luck. Thank you.

357
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,960
I can't wait for this.

358
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,800
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes.

359
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,640
Till Paul Hollywood comes in
with his mahogany fists

360
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,400
and smashes your dreams.

361
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,440
Oh, mine's so lopsided.

362
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,600
I'm feeling happier than earlier.

363
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,560
I don't think Paul's gonna be
very happy.

364
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,080
The top's merged into the bottom.
I'm a bit annoyed.

365
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,480
Rise!

366
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,760
Oh, bloody hell she's massive.
It's really ballooned.

367
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,520
It's enormous bread! Oh, my God...

368
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,880
They're not done.

369
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,320
Oh, it's disastrous.

370
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,800
It's literally come off.
THEY GASP

371
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,680
What do I do? Shall I rod it?

372
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,000
Well, I'm a bit panicky about this.

373
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,360
He's rodding it.
Oh, that's a good shout.

374
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,200
Oh, I've never been
so stressed making bread.

375
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,000
Chuff tog heck, this is a bit high
pressure.

376
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,520
You just want an easy life!

377
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,840
Oh, it's cooked. I think it's done.

378
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,200
I have to check temperatures
because a lot of bakers

379
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
tap the bottom
and listen to the sound.

380
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,520
Sounds hollow inside. Like that.

381
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,160
I can't do that. Oh, it's hollow.

382
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
Lovely!

383
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,920
Oh, my God this is actually
diabolical. I might scream.

384
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,680
Bakers, you've got one minute left,
just one minute.

385
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,240
Coming out in 30 seconds.

386
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,600
Just waiting till literally
the last second.

387
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,920
These are the flowers
from the wild garlic.

388
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,480
Oh, it's such a pancake.

389
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,840
It's coming out.

390
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,360
Here we are.

391
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,600
I don't know. Really happy with
that. Perfect.

392
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,400
Oh, my gosh. It's just so big.

393
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,480
Bakers, your time is up.

394
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,520
That looks amazing.

395
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,800
SAKU: I am happy with that.
Hopefully they will like the taste.

396
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,160
ROWAN: You look around the room,
you start going...

397
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,680
See, it's all...
They're all kind of perfect. Oh...

398
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,880
This is the failure corner.

399
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Oh, dearie me.

400
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,240
The bakers' cottage loaves now face
the judgment of Paul and Prue.

401
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,960
Hello, Saku. Hello.

402
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,440
I think it looks pretty good.

403
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,440
The cuts have gone slightly awry,

404
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,560
but overall, I like the colour
and I like the height.

405
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,320
Go on, then, Hollywood.
Right, let's have a look. Cut it.

406
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,000
Smells good. It's really cinnamony.

407
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,040
I don't get the orange very much,
but the cinnamon's there.

408
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,840
I did get the orange. It's a hint.
Certainly there in the background.

409
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,800
The cinnamon is good. So your
flavour combinations are spot on.

410
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,720
But, your bread itself
is slightly under proved.

411
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,760
You can see where you've put your
finger in

412
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,640
and it's concertinaed down
at the bottom.

413
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,880
Overall, it's a nice loaf.

414
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,560
I think you were ten minutes away
from something that was very good.

415
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,840
Well done. Thank you.

416
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Whew!

417
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,080
Well, it's certainly rustic.

418
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,440
I think you've fumbled
a little bit when you cut this

419
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,040
cos it's gone all over the place.

420
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,480
Doesn't look too bad.

421
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,200
It is a lot of filling,
but, actually, it works.

422
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Nothing is overpowering
anything else.

423
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,960
Oh, chilli's coming in right at
the end. It's lovely. Thank you.

424
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,840
It's split here quite badly

425
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
and this is down
to under proving it... Mm-hm.

426
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,600
...s0 it needed another
ten minutes or so.

427
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,880
I think you've got
a great bake on it though.

428
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,560
Certainly cheesy.
DANA CHUCKLES

429
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,520
Smokiness comes through beautifully,
and the cheese and the chipotle

430
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,160
as well. It is a bit doughy,
but your flavours are good.

431
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,880
Hmm.

432
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,440
It looks monstrous.

433
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,080
How much flour did you use?

434
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,520
Uh... Nigh on 700g.

435
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,000
It's a big loaf.

436
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,720
But actually the structure
is spot on. Great colour.

437
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,400
The olives come through beautifully.

438
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,320
The sun dried tomatoes not so much.

439
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,200
I can taste the sun dried tomatoes,

440
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,360
but I don't think
the little S's add anything.

441
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,600
You should've just written
"Paul is king". Bread king.

442
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,920
Thank you, Rowan. Well, thank you.

443
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,960
"Monstrous”. It's fine,
I've been called worse.

444
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,440
It's quite dense inside. Yes.

445
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,160
I'm getting...salt.

446
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,720
Hmm, quite a lot of salt. What's the
level of salt you put in?

447
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,400
The original prove was just 7g

448
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,720
and then after that I just went...

449
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,600
Oh, you added more?
In with the paste. Yeah, that's...

450
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,120
So just did a wee... ..probably
why we're picking it up then,

451
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,400
because you just went over
that balance. Yeah.

452
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,160
Colour, I love. Cuts, I like,
they're nice and deep.

453
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,840
I think it looks really appetising.

454
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,720
Think it needs a little of salt.

455
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,080
Considering you had cranberries,
walnuts in there,

456
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,840
it's just a little bit bland, but
overall, I think it's a decent loaf.

457
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,040
EXHALES SHAKILY
OK.

458
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,760
This is flat Janice.

459
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,400
Her cottage is a bungalow.

460
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,960
LAUGHTER

461
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,080
Let's have a look at it.

462
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,840
How much of the garlic did you put
in it? All of it?

463
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,640
Not all of it, I think I did, like,
six cloves. It's quite strong.

464
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,120
Can't taste the rosemary. Oh, OK.
um...

465
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,080
When it comes to salt,
it's quite a bland loaf. Yeah.

466
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,840
All you get... Is garlic?
..Is garlic.

467
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,320
You haven't got enough salt. Yeah.

468
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,680
And actually that,
it's affected the structure

469
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,240
and that's why it'll look
like this.

470
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,560
Taste it with a bit of the crust
though, cos that's really nice.

471
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,120
Ooh, yeah.
Bit of salt on it, it'll be lovely.

472
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,560
Hmm.

473
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,680
Good job, Janice.

474
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,480
Lovely colour.

475
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,360
It's turned out quite nicely.

476
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,720
You've pretty much
got the proving right.

477
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,600
I think the flavour is great. Mm-hm.

478
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,520
Nice balance of cheese and chilli.

479
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,000
There is considerable heat in that.

480
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,320
And I like it. I think it's lovely.

481
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,680
And I'm surprised because I thought
the cheese and olives

482
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,400
are going to hold it down,
it's going become claggy...

483
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,760
But it's really lovely. Well done,
Josh. Thank you.

484
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,280
Wonderful, thank you. Well done!
HE EXHALES

485
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,000
Do you know, if you saw that
in a baker's shop you'd buy it,

486
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,480
just because it looks so rustic
and so appetising.

487
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,440
Looks quite appealing doesn't
it, yeah. Hmm.

488
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
Let's have a look.

489
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,200
I think it's quite clever
the pesto going through it.

490
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,560
My issue is it only stays in
one place. Yeah.

491
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,320
You have to distribute it
amongst the whole loaf. Yeah...

492
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,280
I think it's a
really interesting delicious loaf.

493
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,680
Flavour-wise, and texture-wise,
you've done a great job.

494
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,120
It just needed to be more
uniform with... Distribute, yeah.

495
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,760
...your filling. Just pop it in the
mixer, all your ingredients,

496
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,120
once you've proved your dough

497
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,560
and just slowly turn it to
introduce it and then you shape it.

498
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,440
I should've belled you beforehand,
shouldn't 1? You should've done,

499
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,400
yeah! I was only across there.
Oh, were ya?

500
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,000
Give you a shout next time.
Oh, thank you very much.

501
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,280
That'll do me.

502
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,320
Because you've put weight

503
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,040
in the dough as seeds,

504
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,680
I'm thinking that this
is gonna be quite dense inside.

505
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,200
But...the proof of the pudding
is in the eating.

506
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,320
Come on, then.

507
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,800
I would be so proud
of that if I'd done it!

508
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,360
It is dense, but nevertheless,
it's delicious.

509
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,720
It's not perfect.
But it is 90-odd-per cent there.

510
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,760
Mm-hm. I wish I'd made it.

511
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,360
Thank you. Well done. Thank you.
Thank you.

512
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,160
WHISPERED: Wow. She wishes she'd
made it! I'll take that!

513
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,040
Think that went pretty well!

514
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,280
That's good feedback.

515
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,840
Thank you, Prue. Oh, it was lovely!

516
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,360
It went well. Phew.

517
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,120
"Monstrous". I'd rather be monstrous
than mediocre.

518
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,480
That was pretty good.
He liked the look of it,

519
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,880
it had good colour on it,
one down, two to go.

520
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,200
Oh, flat Janice.
I'm definitely at the bottom.

521
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,160
But last week's Technical I won,

522
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,920
so hopefully, do a better job.
Smash it.

523
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,480
The bakers were able
to practise their first challenge,

524
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,040
but now, they face
a mystery shrouded in gingham.

525
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,400
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

526
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,120
It's time for your
Technical Challenge, which, today,

527
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,200
has been set for you by the bad boy
of buns himself, Mr Paul Hollywood.

528
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,800
Paul has been preparing
some incredible words of wisdom.

529
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,360
Over to you, Paul.

530
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,320
It's all about the timing.

531
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,880
I'm gonna put that on my Instagram.

532
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,120
NOEL LAUGHS

533
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,480
As ever, this Technical will be
judged blind

534
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,600
so we're gonna have to ask our
judges to leave the tent. Bye-bye.

535
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,760
Thank you.

536
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,400
To make sure there's no cheating,

537
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,840
they will be lowered
into a medieval well.

538
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,680
Paul would like you to make a batch

539
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,400
of eight delicious
Devonshire splits.

540
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,720
Ooh, I love Devonshire splits.

541
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,560
I often do the splits
while I'm eating Devonshire splits.

542
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,920
Now, the judges are looking
for soft,

543
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,840
light, enriched dough buns

544
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,720
that are split and then filled with
a home-made strawberry jam

545
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,040
and freshly whipped cream.

546
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,680
Mmm. You have two hours
and 30 minutes.

547
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,800
On your marks...

548
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,920
...get set...

549
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,960
...bake!

550
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,960
That's not
a lot of ingredients, is it?

551
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,960
I'm familiar with the Devonshire
split. It's a bit like a doughnut
and I love doughnuts.

552
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,720
I live adjacent to Devon.

553
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,040
I've never seen one before.

554
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,000
Bit worried, I need a good technical
cos I had a mediocre signature,

555
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,520
so I'm just looking round.

556
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,640
"Do not confer," it says
but it doesn't say "don't look."

557
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,360
So, Paul, Devonshire splits,
what a treat.

558
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,680
I grew up on these.

559
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,920
My dad used to make these in his
bakery and they're just delicious
to eat.

560
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,560
Where they're going to come unstuck
on this particular challenge is
timing.

561
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,480
We've allowed for two proves
in this.

562
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,800
So for the first prove?

563
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,720
Well, you do it roughly 45 minutes.

564
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,920
As it starts to rise, carbon dioxide
begins to be formed

565
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,680
and a little bit
of flavour comes into it.

566
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,040
Then they can prepare the rolls.
So divide it into eight,

567
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,040
roll it into balls,
and prove it again.

568
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,600
45 minutes on the second one
and it stabilises the dough

569
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,040
and gives it better flavour.

570
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,840
It's all down to the proving.

571
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,560
The oven bake's for around
15 minutes.

572
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,280
We want them beautifully round
and symmetrical.

573
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,680
You don't want any tears in
the side at all

574
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,400
and you want a nice flash
of colour going all
the way down to the bottom.

575
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,760
I would not have thought a
Devonshire split could be
so complicated.

576
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,440
Now, there's no cutlery with this.

577
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,400
This is when we get cream all over
the show.

578
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,720
Mm-hm.

579
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,000
Oh, yeah.

580
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,920
It's soft in the mouth,
slightly chewy.

581
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,160
That is heaven.

582
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,080
Beautiful sweetness from
the strawberry and then
the cream as well.

583
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,440
I'm going to sit here
and eat the lot, I tell you.

584
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,800
Not all of those, but all of this.
All of this.

585
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,120
Step one, make the dough.

586
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,480
It's an enriched dough which means
it's enriched

587
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,720
with milk and butter
and I'm adding that to my flour,

588
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,600
yeast, salt and sugar,

589
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,800
then bring it together to form
a scraggly dough
and then I'll get that kneaded.

590
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,280
Get your hands in, get in there.

591
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,000
Going to need to work quite quickly.

592
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,920
I'm just very keen
to get my dough proving.

593
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,600
You all right, Abbi? Hello, Alison.
How you doing darling?

594
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,120
All right, thank you.

595
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,960
Devonshire splits, have you ever
made one of these before?

596
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,840
No, I haven't. Have you ever done
the splits before? No, I haven't.

597
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,240
But you've got to impress Paul with
this though, ain't ya? I know, need
to get myself back on track.

598
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,640
This is a big one. After flat
Janice. Well, do you know what?
Janice tasted amazing.

599
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,920
She was very garlicky, which is the
way I like it. Probably not what
Prue wanted.

600
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,320
So you've got to get this right
haven't ya? So, yeah. Keep kneading
babes, keep kneading. Thank you.

601
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,840
Perfect Devonshire split dough...

602
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,160
You can feel that changing already
under my hands.

603
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,640
...requires lots of kneading.

604
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,520
That's like a workout.

605
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,840
Not enough and they could end up
with tight buns.

606
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,160
Oh!

607
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,560
We're looking for something very
smooth and elastic.

608
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,840
You don't want it to tear.

609
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,120
It's looking all right, that.

610
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Step five, prove.

611
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,920
Thank you very much.
For all that information.

612
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,720
I'll give it as long as I humanly
possibly can cos I want it to be
quite light and fluffy.

613
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,040
I'm going to leave this
for 50 minutes.

614
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,000
Start with 30 minutes, check.

615
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,800
It'll probably need longer than that
but whether we've got time to do it
longer than that...

616
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,720
There's going to be
a lot of under proved buns today.

617
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,880
Next is to make the strawberry jam.

618
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,800
I've chopped up my strawberries

619
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,520
and put them in a pan
with some jam sugar

620
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,880
and hopefully I have the setting
temperature branded into my brain.

621
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,200
I'm trying to get this
to 104 centigrade.

622
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,480
Here we go. It's bubbling away now.

623
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,840
Bit longer.

624
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,240
Looks all right.

625
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,800
Hopefully it will work.

626
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
Steaming up, yes.

627
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,080
SHE CHUCKLES

628
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,120
Jam is ready.

629
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,280
The dough's proving.

630
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,680
Jam cooling.

631
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,160
Should've been a rapper.

632
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,960
Wow, what's this? We're giving you a
double whammy. Oh, looks lovely.
That is my strawberry jam.

633
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,280
What's your favourite jam?

634
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,360
Mmm, Blueberry jam. Blueberry?
Yeah.

635
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,800
That is quite a bold statement.
Why? How often do you make
blueberry jam?

636
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,280
I don't make it,
I'm buying from shop.

637
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,240
Bakers, you are halfway through.

638
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,080
Sh. Love watching her work.

639
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,800
See how much it's grown.

640
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,120
If the bakers under prove
their dough...

641
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,520
We're looking pretty groovy there.

642
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,880
Looks good.

643
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,480
...They'll fail to produce the light

644
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,880
and springy texture Paul
and Prue expect.

645
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,720
Well, it could do with longer really

646
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,040
but I can see quite
a few people shaping

647
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,520
Which is a bit stressful.

648
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,560
Divide the dough into eight pieces
and shape into each ball.

649
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,200
604 divided by eight.

650
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,800
I can't do it,
I can't physically do the maths.

651
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,680
That's terrible, I'm gonna have
to book a course.

652
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,960
75.4 grams each.

653
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,000
I'm just going to eye it.

654
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,040
It could do with another ten minutes
but we don't have another
ten minutes

655
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,560
so now I'm going to shape them into
little balls.

656
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,040
Key to an even rise

657
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,400
and avoiding any tears in
their dough

658
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,280
the bakers must create
a smooth, taut skin.

659
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,880
I make a lot of bread rolls at home
so I'm quite used to this.

660
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,400
That looks a wee bit wrinkled.

661
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,880
Wrinkly balls. Wrinkly balls.

662
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,560
So we've got a pair for Prue
and a pair for Paul.

663
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,600
This is like a dream I've had.

664
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,440
Paul's balls are out on
a baking sheet.

665
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,040
I'm really pleased with those.
Nice and even.

666
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,680
Second prove, we're going in.

667
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,320
The most important prove in
my opinion.

668
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,840
I'm going to do the second prove
for half an hour.

669
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,720
I've just got to wait now.

670
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
Oh.

671
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,360
I'm just trying to stay zen before
it all goes crazy in a minute.

672
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,080
Oomm.

673
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,360
Make them work.

674
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,440
Mmm.

675
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,640
I'm doing a dance for you just
to keep you occupied. Nice one.

676
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,360
Nice, nice.

677
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,040
Thank you.

678
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,120
They're getting there.

679
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,720
I'm giving them another
three minutes.

680
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,120
Five minutes left on the clock but
I'm going to live by the seat of my
pants I think and go for it.

681
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,760
We're going in with them, big boy.

682
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,320
Can't believe Dan's in, that's
so stressful?

683
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,800
Oh, my God.

684
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,600
Bakers, you've got half an hour
left.

685
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,240
Drama there, weren't it?
That cut through the tent.

686
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,880
Yeah.
Like a hot knife through butter.

687
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,120
Half an hour left.

688
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,320
I'm happy with the rise of
the dough balls.

689
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,760
They've risen up,
not as much as I would like.

690
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,320
I'm not that upset with them.

691
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,640
They're just a little on
the small side.

692
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,840
Going in.

693
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,640
In they go.

694
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,720
Don't know how long they'll take in
the oven. I reckon about
12, 15 minutes.

695
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,080
Going for 14 minutes cos that's
my lucky number.

696
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,160
So next, make the Chantilly cream.
This is whipped up,

697
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,080
bit of icing sugar, vanilla,

698
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,840
and lo and behold you'll have
a Chantilly.

699
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,320
I want it to be a little bit above
soft peaks.

700
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,840
Medium peaks.

701
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,120
Looks good.

702
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,440
Oh! Just joking.

703
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,480
That's looking quite good.

704
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,960
You're going to use this? Yeah.

705
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,880
In here? Fill it with Chantilly.
Should I just use a wooden spoon?

706
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,400
Just use a wooden spoon.
It's convenience, innit? Thank you.

707
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,480
What about a bigger one? What's
this?

708
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,240
That's what... that's where
I write my... Some poems in here.
Go on, read one of the poems.

709
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,440
"Dear Paul,

710
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,800
you look so good today in your
double denim.

711
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,600
I think about your desert boots
all the time."

712
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,040
That one gets a bit racy. Does it?

713
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,720
They're done.

714
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,080
They're not big anyway,
they're quite dainty.

715
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,600
Get them out,
get 'em nice and cool.

716
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,120
Dan's are out. I know, he's speedy
Gonzales.

717
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,480
Like he's so speedy.
Do you know what?

718
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,760
I'm pretty sure I've not put
the caster sugar in?

719
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,920
Hence why my buns are
a little bit small.

720
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,680
What a doughnut I am.

721
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,920
Dough-nut.

722
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,200
Bakers,
you've got ten minutes left.

723
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,760
Oh, my God.

724
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,120
OK, I'm getting them out.

725
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,760
OK. We're good, we're good,
we're good, we're good.

726
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,720
They've not baked very evenly.
Here is a little bit under.

727
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,520
All right,
now we've got to let them cool.

728
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,880
Is it all about cooling? Yeah.
Before assemblage.

729
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,440
You don't want to put cream into
a hot bun.

730
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,320
And drip out the other side, yeah.

731
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,120
Cool those balls.

732
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,760
You've not been on Bake Off until
you've done the waft.

733
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,160
Cut a deep slit through
the centre of each.

734
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,680
I think this is right,
I don't have a clue.

735
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,400
Oh, these are shocking.

736
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,120
No sugar in it.

737
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,400
I'll tell you one thing,
it's too late now.

738
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,080
Bakers, you've got five
minutes left.

739
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,920
Have we really?

740
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,920
You know when you feel sick?

741
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,480
Jam time.

742
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,920
Nice thick jam anyway.

743
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,760
The jam is perfect.

744
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,640
Generously fill each bun
with whipped cream.

745
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,160
I want it to look neat.

746
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,000
Pipe it directly into the bun.

747
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,440
Oh, gosh, it's splodging.

748
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,720
Oh, sodding hell. It's so bad.

749
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,320
Bakers, you have one minute left.

750
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,680
One minute, OK, we can do this.

751
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,240
Decorate with the strawberries.

752
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,760
Come on, strawbs.

753
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,040
Must move quicker.

754
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,760
I don't know this is the right way.

755
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,200
Oh, my gosh.

756
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,520
# Shaky hands. #

757
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,840
Oh, just hide the mistakes
with icing sugar.

758
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,200
That's monstrous to another level.

759
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,720
Bakers, your time is up.

760
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,760
Please come and bring your
Devonshire splits

761
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,120
and place them behind
your photographs.

762
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,080
Oh, dear.

763
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,560
The garish A&E look.

764
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,400
Forgot the icing sugar.

765
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,520
Wow, that was awful.

766
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,800
Well...

767
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:01,120
Did my best.

768
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,360
It's time to judge
the bakers' Devonshire splits.

769
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,680
Hmm.
We've got an array here, Prue.

770
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,200
We certainly have.

771
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,840
NOEL: Paul and Prue are looking
for eight equally sized,

772
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,560
light and springy buns

773
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,080
filled with perfectly-set strawberry
jam and Chantilly cream

774
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,600
And they have no idea whose
is whose.

775
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,840
OK, let's start down this side.

776
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,880
Bit irregular in shape these,
actually,

777
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,360
and it's under proved,

778
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,160
you can tell by the cracks on
the bottom.

779
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,480
They probably needed another ten,
15 minutes.

780
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,840
But they're soft inside.
They've got a lovely flavour.

781
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,520
Jam's lovely.
Some of these are a bit odd.

782
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,800
These are really small.

783
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,280
This one's a bit peculiar.

784
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,800
They're massively under proved.

785
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,080
Soon as you press it,
it goes back to dough again.

786
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,760
And they're very dense.
They are dense.

787
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,840
Right. Now, the size of these is
better, much better.

788
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,920
They're quite light, Paul. They are.

789
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,760
They're proved well.
They're big and light.

790
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,000
Good jam.

791
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,480
Yeah, the jam looks good.

792
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,840
That's a decent one, the size is
good. I like that.

793
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,200
It's just a shame the cream's not
looking nicer than it is.

794
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,680
But it does look like lots of cream,
which I like.

795
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,040
Too small. These are way too...
These are like golf balls.

796
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,800
This is... It's really dense.
Needed much longer proving.

797
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,080
You can tell when you look at
the bottom there. It's ripped.

798
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,720
And it tastes yeasty.

799
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,920
Mmm.

800
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,760
And now when you move on to this...

801
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,520
These are very neat. They are neat

802
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,480
and they are round
but they're a little bit small.

803
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,960
That's the old thing
of not proved enough.

804
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,280
I'm not quite sure what these are.
They're not round.

805
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,520
And they're...they're a bit flat.

806
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,960
They've almost been under mixed.

807
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,360
It crumbles rather than stretches.

808
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,400
Don't taste very good them.
Quite dry on the mouth.

809
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,560
I don't understand.

810
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,360
These are not bad, these buns.

811
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,960
Under proved slightly,
but it's got a good texture inside.

812
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,640
Lovely texture.

813
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,440
The jam's good. That's delicious.

814
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,240
They just needed icing sugar.

815
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,960
And moving on to this,
again under proved.

816
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,800
See the split but they are large.

817
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,040
Nice flavour. Nice jam. Yeah.

818
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,560
OK, moving on to these guys.

819
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,760
A bit under proved again.

820
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,600
You see it's blown there again,
it's ripped.

821
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,160
It's a little bit small.

822
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,520
Not bad, though.

823
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,200
Moving on to these,

824
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,000
again under proved, ripped.

825
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
That's quite dense that.
Look at that one.

826
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,800
They're neat but it's blown.

827
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,120
It's a shame. OK.

828
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,040
The Devonshire splits will now
be ranked...

829
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,400
All of them are slightly
under proved.

830
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,720
These are the best.

831
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,000
...from last place to first.

832
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,800
In 10th place we have this one.

833
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,120
Dan, they're too small,

834
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,680
under proved, bit tough, good jam.
Brilliant.

835
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,080
In ninth place we have this one.

836
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,480
When you look at it, it looks good,
but turn it upside down and you
realise there's a few issues there.

837
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,440
Yeah.

838
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,640
Abbi is eighth,

839
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,920
Matty is seventh,

840
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,280
Cristy sixth,

841
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,360
Nicky fifth,

842
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,720
Josh is fourth

843
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,120
and Dana is third.

844
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,400
In second place we have this one.

845
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,040
Tasha,

846
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,320
they were very, very good.

847
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,600
No icing sugar for some reason.

848
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,480
And in first place we have these.

849
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,200
APPLAUSE

850
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,960
The bun itself was excellent.

851
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,840
You've got a nice tension in there
and the flavour on the mouth
was good,

852
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,080
So it was well proved.

853
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,240
I think you did really well.

854
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,520
I'm so happy.

855
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,360
Disappointed that I forgot
to put the caster sugar in.

856
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,840
Just got to dust yourself down
and go again, haven't you?

857
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,560
I think they're too kind
to me actually.

858
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,840
It really was like eating cement
when I tried it so fair enough.

859
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,280
look, I know I'm crying it's just
cos I get really emotional
really easily.

860
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,040
I know that I'm definitely at
the bottom of the pack now.

861
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,440
Oh!

862
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,960
I just need to really smash
my Showstopper.

863
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,480
Just one challenge remains before
someone's named Star Baker
of bread week

864
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,480
and someone's time in
the competition is up.

865
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,960
This is your week Paul and...
It's all about Hollywood.

866
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,520
What did you think of the standard?

867
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,840
The standard's been pretty poor in
the technical.

868
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,280
THEY GIGGLE

869
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,880
Uh... Don't mince your words. But I
do think Tash is doing really well.

870
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,040
Josh is there or thereabouts.
I think Saku's the same.

871
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,720
OK, so going into the Showstopper
who needs to pull it out of the bag?

872
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,080
Abbi who had the problem with
the salt.

873
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,640
Yeah. And I think Abbi had a problem
with the technical as well

874
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,560
which puts her in a very precarious
position.

875
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,360
It's not just her, though, I think
Rowan, Dan, he had a terrible
technical.

876
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,200
He started well
but he's fallen off a cliff.

877
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,720
Which is crazy, right, cos he's been
so consistent. Yeah.

878
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,000
But they're all in trouble. I love
when you get really strict Paul.
Oh, right.

879
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,800
So nice. Turns you on, does it?

880
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,080
A little bit.

881
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,080
Wow.

882
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,200
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

883
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,160
It's time for your
Showstopper challenge.

884
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,480
Today the judges would love you
to make

885
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,840
a visually stunning,

886
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,160
plaited bread centrepiece.

887
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,360
Now, your Showstopper can be sweet
or savoury,

888
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,520
it's entirely up to you,

889
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,680
but it must have two different types
of flour

890
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,520
and include your incredible bread
plaiting skills.

891
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,120
If you want to practise your
plaits,

892
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,520
me and Alison are going out on
the razz tonight so...

893
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,920
We are. ..you're welcome to sort our
barnets out.

894
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,840
We're going to be in the corner with
a tea towel round our shoulders
all right?

895
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,000
You've got four hours
for your Showstopper.

896
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,080
On your marks...

897
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,000
...get set... ..bake.

898
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,920
Pssh!

899
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,680
Oh, here we go again.

900
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,400
I'd say the hardest part about this
challenge is plaiting.

901
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,720
It's not something I've got much
experience of.

902
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,000
I've watched so many YouTube videos

903
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,600
and I still can't plait my own hair

904
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,960
so I'm hoping I can plait
bread today.

905
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,720
The Showstopper challenge is
a plaited centrepiece loaf.

906
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,400
Now, this is their chance
to really show off to Prue and I

907
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,960
what they can actually do
with dough.

908
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,000
The focus for this challenge is on
the plaiting.

909
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,960
Of course we want the bread
to be delicious.

910
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,600
It could be flavoured as they like.

911
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,120
They can put fillings in there.

912
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,720
God, it smells good, don't it?

913
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,640
I could just put my face in that.

914
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,360
But what we're really looking for

915
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,640
is some intricate and amazing
plaiting.

916
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,960
There are numerous plaits
they could do

917
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,760
to create an image that they want.

918
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,120
It's like painting a picture
with braids.

919
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,440
I want to see something that makes
me go,

920
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,240
"How did they do that?"

921
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,800
Morning, Abbi. Hello, morning.
Hello, Abbi.

922
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,120
Tell us about your
plaited Showstopper.

923
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,160
I am making a tree

924
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,240
because I love trees.

925
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,760
Wherever I go I always have like my
favourite tree so that's kind of
what it represents.

926
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,120
What is your favourite tree?
Right now that lovely pink horse
chestnut out there

927
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,480
that I can see from my bench.
Beautiful that one, isn't it?

928
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,880
So I'm making a walnut
and stilton trunk and branches.

929
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,920
The leaves are going to be made from
wild garlic and nettle

930
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,360
and then this is made with dock
flour from the seeds of dock leaves.

931
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,040
Have you been out foraging for these
yourself? Yes, I've picked these
this week. Brilliant.

932
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,480
Abbi will make dock flour dough
mushrooms to sit at the base of
her tree.

933
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,760
Its leaves made from nettle
and wild garlic three-strand plaits,

934
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,480
while its trunk will be plaited from
no less than nine.

935
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,280
Nine strands? Nine strands.

936
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,000
Nine, I've not done before.

937
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,360
Honestly, Abbi, it's
wonderfully ambitious.

938
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,720
And it sounds as if it
could be terrific.

939
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,280
I do need it. I'm really hoping that
today I can just smash it.

940
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,560
You want to stay, don't you?

941
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,840
I do. I've got so many more
different foraged things that I
want to.

942
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,800
Just concentrate on this and get it
done the best you can. Right now
this is what I'm focusing on.

943
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,280
And Abbi's favourite tree has
a friend.

944
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,720
I am making a Rowan tree,

945
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,920
a bread Rowan tree.

946
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,760
So I'm just popping the spices in

947
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,800
for my sweet curry wholemeal loaf.

948
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,520
I've got a hefty amount going in.

949
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,720
I want to punch 'em right in
the jaw with the flavour.

950
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,560
Fighting to stay in the competition

951
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,920
Rowan's flavour-packed tree also
features

952
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,680
a six-strand plaited marzipan
challah trunk

953
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,200
supporting a bacon and Parmesan
three-strand crown,

954
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
complete with red Rowan berries.

955
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,800
How big is it going to be in total?

956
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,280
It's about this tall.

957
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,160
Wow. My goodness. It's huge. Proper
showstopper. Yeah.

958
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,160
And it's going to be
lying down not standing up?

959
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,880
Standing up. I got my dad to make me
a structure. A frame.

960
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,840
This is going to be colourful
and huge.

961
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,680
Massive. And delicious.

962
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,440
Yeah. I like it.

963
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,840
Ah!

964
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,720
This is one kilo of flour.
Which is quite a lot to do by hand.

965
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,080
With at least two different doughs
to make,

966
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,440
the bakers have their work cut out
to mix

967
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,840
and knead them before
the crucial first prove.

968
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,320
It's not easy kneading
with this great big lump.

969
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,720
Look at these. These been in the
proving drawer?

970
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,600
They've been in the proving
drawer. Yeah, they have. Look at the
guns on that.

971
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,040
I've never been to a gym in my life.
Just make bread every day.

972
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,800
The longer they take,
the less time they'll have

973
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,920
to create the intricate plaits Paul
and Prue want to see.

974
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,480
It's a lot of dough, yeah.

975
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,560
Just want to get it proving.

976
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,920
All right, it's going in.
It's my wholemeal bread.

977
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,600
I have decided to make today

978
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,600
a highland cow called Angus.

979
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,920
I always wanted one as a pet.

980
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,040
This big, hairy animal just in your
back garden,

981
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,360
chomping on your grass
and keeping it down.

982
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,680
I'd love one.

983
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,560
Nicky's highland heifer will
be both savoury and sweet,

984
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,720
with hair and ears containing Comte
cheese and lardons,

985
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,120
and the face and horns packed with
pecans and dates.

986
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,760
Two flours, what two flours have you
gone for?

987
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,320
I did wholemeal for his face.
Yeah. Healthy.

988
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,560
And his horns. "Horins"?
Horns. "Horins"?

989
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,160
I can't say...

990
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,600
Horns?

991
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,520
EXAGGERATED ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION:
Horns.

992
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,680
I love the way you say it.
Horns? "Horins".

993
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,160
I'm excited about this.
Especially seeing his horins.

994
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,080
Saku's also been inspired by
an animal close to her heart.

995
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,920
I am going to make a peacock.

996
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,480
I love peacocks. They are lovely,
colourful creatures.

997
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,560
Saku will recreate the peacock's
beautiful tail feathers

998
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,880
from white dough flavoured
with garlic and rosemary

999
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,680
and the branch her bird will sit
upon from seeded spelt dough.

1000
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,000
And she's hoping her years
of plaiting experience

1001
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,440
will give her an advantage.

1002
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,720
I'm doing this from aged 16.

1003
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,520
And my daughter's 21.

1004
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,200
Still I do her hair.

1005
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,920
Aw, my baby girl!

1006
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,960
Right, that's my wild garlic dough.
This is going in.

1007
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,160
As the last of the bakers' doughs
hit the proving drawer,

1008
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,640
some are ready to come out.

1009
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,200
It's risen. Looks really lovely.
All nice and bouncy.

1010
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,560
I don't know,
I don't want to under prove.

1011
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,120
I don't know,
I'm going to put it back in.

1012
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,000
But before plaiting starts...

1013
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,920
OK, we're going to add the stilton.

1014
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,280
...there's the chance
to add extra flavour.

1015
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,800
So, this is cranberry
and orange dough.

1016
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,480
Orange is coming only from the zest,

1017
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,480
and then I've got my cranberries
soaked in orange juice as well.

1018
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,960
I'm mixing in pastrami and cheese.

1019
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,880
Which is a little bit messy.

1020
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,320
While the rest of the bakers
add their fillings

1021
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,960
before rolling their strands...

1022
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,640
Just trying to distribute this
as evenly as we can.

1023
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,200
...Dan's decided to add his
one at a time.

1024
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,520
So, what I'm going to do is
individual strands in

1025
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,720
the fillings in each strand,

1026
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,320
and then roll it up to make
a lattice-type, braided loaf.

1027
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,920
So they crisscross each other.

1028
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,320
It's going to form two round,
circular wreaths,

1029
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,440
and I'm going to make my word
"pizza" out of the remaining dough.

1030
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,800
Looking to bounce back after
yesterday's disastrous technical,

1031
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,920
Dan's going all-out with an
ambitious, five-piece Showstopper.

1032
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,040
He'll pack his first plaited pizza
wreath with fennel and sausage,

1033
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,040
nduja and mozzarella,
and his second with truffle salami,

1034
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,560
truffle Cheddar
and smoked provolone.

1035
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,960
Love making pizzas, love cooking
outdoors, so I'm just bringing the

1036
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,640
flavours we've really enjoyed with
our pizzas to this bread, basically.

1037
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,360
And Dan won't be dining
al fresco alone.

1038
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,880
I'm doing a picnic basket.

1039
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,240
This is green chutney dough.

1040
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,600
It's just what we called sandwiches
growing up.

1041
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,960
So it's just a filling
of coriander paste

1042
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,760
with all the different spices
and everything, literally

1043
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,400
in two pieces of white bread,
and it was sensational.

1044
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,880
Filled with plaited wholemeal
bagels, Dana will weave plaits

1045
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,520
of her green chutney and sun dried
tomato dough

1046
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,760
over a mixing bowl to give her
picnic basket its shape.

1047
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,480
I am just doing a
three-strand plait.

1048
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,280
Only cos it's what I know and it's
the fastest and I have to

1049
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,560
cover the whole basket.

1050
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,480
So I want to go for speed.

1051
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,920
I'm going to do an eight-stranded
plait.

1052
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,720
Which I thought was a good idea
at the time.

1053
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,560
To sit snugly inside her
complicated,

1054
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,240
eight-strand honeyed challah,

1055
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,840
Cristy will also bake
a chocolate and almond babka,

1056
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,880
both traditional Jewish
plaited sweetbreads.

1057
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,680
My grandpa's Jewish.

1058
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,040
When I was younger, my grandpa lived
in a beautiful home in Primrose Hill

1059
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,680
and after Sunday lunch, we used to
go and walk through the park,

1060
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,080
so it's like to represent all
the lovely memories.

1061
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,600
Hopefully, I can do it justice.

1062
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,320
Oh, gosh.

1063
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,360
Start plaiting.

1064
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,920
Help me, Lord.

1065
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,040
Bakers, two hours left,
you're halfway through.

1066
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,560
Is there anything
you'd like to say? No!

1067
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,000
If you want to speak to me,
you go through my lawyer.

1068
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,840
So, this is the trunk of the tree.

1069
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,760
It's quite long and remember, this
has got to stand up.

1070
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,080
So the nerves are setting in.

1071
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,000
Whether the bakers have been
ambitious

1072
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,560
with their choice of plait...

1073
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,200
There's six strands alternating,
some go above, some go below.

1074
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,960
Quite a complex one.

1075
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,880
...or have gone
for something simpler...

1076
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,280
These are three-strand plaits to
make the feathers of the peacock.

1077
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,720
...Paul and Prue will expect
to see beautifully even braids.

1078
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,720
This is going to be my central
trunk. So, I'm doing nine strands.

1079
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,240
I've really enjoyed
the bread plaiting aspect of this.

1080
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,440
You just learn the rhythm
and then it's easy.

1081
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,200
Uh...

1082
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,760
Go across there...

1083
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,440
This is like maths to me, I don't
know what's going on. Um...

1084
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,760
The basket is taking shape.

1085
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,080
I had a dream last night that my
bread picnic basket

1086
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,080
was going to collapse.

1087
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,840
It has once on practice.

1088
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,600
I'm hoping it doesn't.

1089
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,120
I'm just shoving pecans
in the horns.

1090
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,440
As the bakers put the finishing
touches to

1091
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,120
their first plaited pieces...

1092
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,120
That's it done. Get that to prove.

1093
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,440
I just hope it's big enough.

1094
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,840
...Dan and his ambitious,
five-piece Showstopper...

1095
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,680
I'm making my inside wreath.

1096
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,560
But I need to get my outside plaits
round them as well yet.

1097
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,040
...are falling behind.

1098
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,800
I am feeling pinched for time.

1099
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,040
There's a lot to do.

1100
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,280
So, yeah. Best get a wiggle on.

1101
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,760
Oh, what a day.

1102
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,960
To finish their plaited
bread Showstopper.

1103
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,160
One down. Not long enough left.

1104
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,880
So, these are going to prove.
Next is the leaves.

1105
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,400
What have I done?

1106
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,040
It's meant to be a four-strand plait

1107
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,240
and it's gone from a four-strand to
a three-strand into a four-strand.

1108
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,240
I've never messed something
up so badly.

1109
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,160
But it's a root, it's meant
to have informalities.

1110
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,520
How you feeling, you all right?
It's a marathon.

1111
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,520
Bit stressed, but just get it done.
Well, I've just walked in here

1112
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,400
and I'm not being funny, the
atmosphere is very tense, isn't it?

1113
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,760
Everybody's really concentrating
on this today.

1114
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,440
It's because of Paul. Yeah. He's the
bread king. Do you know what I mean?

1115
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,960
Everyone wants to
impress him, isn't it? Hmm.

1116
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,520
I'm plaiting snakes.

1117
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,840
I'm making a Medusa.

1118
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,560
Snakes. My grandma saw one
of my practice bakes

1119
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,080
and she thought they were prawns.

1120
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,440
My mum thought they were something
else entirely.

1121
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,920
So we'll see how they
turn out today!

1122
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,360
Inspired by a love
of Greek mythology,

1123
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,200
Tasha will plait Medusa's face
and hands from rye

1124
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,400
and wholemeal milk bread
filled with pastrami and cheese,

1125
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,000
while the green snakes will be made
from spelt dough

1126
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,840
flavoured with pistachio pesto.

1127
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,920
Are you hoping to turn
the judges to stone?

1128
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,600
So, I'm deliberately covering
her eyes.

1129
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,000
So, Paul and Prue are...
Are safe? Yes, exactly.

1130
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,120
Tasha's isn't the only Showstopper
likely to cause

1131
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,160
a few sleepless nights.

1132
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,880
I support West Ham,
so I'm going for a West Ham badge.

1133
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,200
Are you? Yeah.
And how they doing?

1134
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,800
We've had better days.

1135
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,800
They not doing good?

1136
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,120
Aw.

1137
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,560
By the time this airs,
they'll be smashing it.

1138
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,440
Keen to make a push
for top spot, Matty will plait

1139
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,800
the hammers from spiced,
wholegrain spelt dough,

1140
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,760
while the shield will be made from
two different plaited white doughs,

1141
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,800
one flavoured with Cheddar
and jalapenos,

1142
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,760
the other sun dried tomato,
basil and red onion.

1143
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,120
I like the idea of this.
The flavours sound good.

1144
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,560
And what about colouring it?
What colours are West Ham?

1145
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,120
They're claret and blue,
and on practice it just looked like

1146
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,480
what you get at a fairground.

1147
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,840
You don't think West Ham is
a fairground?

1148
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,120
No, we're a serious team now, Prue.
Oh, I see. Hmm.

1149
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,200
And there's another sports fan in
the tent today.

1150
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,960
So, I'm doing a tiger cos
I'm a Leicester Tigers supporter,

1151
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,560
the rugby team. I've been followed
the Leicester Tigers

1152
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,360
for all my life.
We have a little tiger here.

1153
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,000
Which is what we'd often take
to games. I've had it for as long as

1154
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,360
I can remember going down.
It's an old tiger now.

1155
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,960
Josh will use two different
enriched doughs,

1156
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,840
one flavoured with cranberry
and orange,

1157
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,280
the other chocolate and orange,

1158
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,280
to create the tiger-stripe effect
once plaited.

1159
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,920
Is that your inspiration
over there?

1160
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,280
Yeah, that's my little tiger mascot.
Who is that?

1161
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,640
He's not really got a name, but...
Can I touch him?

1162
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,160
Course you can, yeah. He's not
got a name? Shall we name him?

1163
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,680
You can name him. What shall
we name him? Shall we go Paul?

1164
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,040
Well, it's Bread Week, isn't it?
Hmm, probably should.

1165
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,360
Let's call this Paul.
Let's get some water.

1166
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,040
We christen you...Paul Hollywood.

1167
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,920
There you go.

1168
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,440
Guys, one hour left.
You can do this.

1169
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,800
Right, last bit.
I'm just doing my letters,

1170
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,120
my I, Z and Z.
This needs to be done right now.

1171
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,680
I'm just going to make a couple of
ears. I'll just stick a nose on

1172
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,000
as well. I just think it looks like
a tiger head.

1173
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,320
These are for Angus' hair.

1174
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,640
What's happening here?
What are these...? Oh.

1175
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,920
It's Angus. It's a puzzle.

1176
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,040
Imagine if I couldn't do it.

1177
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,400
NICKY LAUGHS

1178
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,640
NOEL GROANS IN MOCK FRUSTRATION

1179
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,800
Yay!

1180
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,200
This is the base of a face which
mostly will be covered by her hands.

1181
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,000
This is worst part because the
plaits have to be so fine,

1182
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,160
otherwise they end up like
massive, club hands.

1183
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,680
My back is killing me.

1184
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,240
Oh!

1185
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,800
As the last plaits prove...

1186
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,680
OK, this is the hammers.

1187
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,080
Put that in now.

1188
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,680
...the first are ready for the oven.

1189
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,440
It's going to go in at 230,
for about ten minutes,

1190
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,280
then we're turning it down.

1191
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,280
I'll do 20 but it might be longer.

1192
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,440
Cheerio.

1193
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,720
The head of the tiger's gone in the
oven. That'll have half an hour.

1194
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,320
But the bakers have no time
to rest.

1195
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,920
Look at that, it's a little
mushroom. Isn't that cute?

1196
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,320
These are going to be the eyes
for my tiger.

1197
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,160
...and with so much still to bake...

1198
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,440
This is the babka.

1199
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,440
...their batch-baking skills are
being put to the test.

1200
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,640
We're going in. About 25 minutes.

1201
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,840
I've only got an hour to prove,
bake, assemble.

1202
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,680
So I'm feeling the stress.

1203
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,840
And Rowan"s not alone.

1204
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,320
Dan's pizza is missing
a couple of crucial details.

1205
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,680
Not done me little bit
for P or me A.

1206
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,400
I've literally got no dough left.

1207
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,640
Absolute shocker.

1208
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,640
Trying to think how I can make
the letters.

1209
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,240
As the first bakes exit the oven...

1210
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,280
Oh, my gosh. She's enormous.

1211
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,600
Yeah, reckon that's about done.

1212
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,680
...Rowan's giant marzipan tree trunk
is finally ready to go in.

1213
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,120
This will be until it's
golden brown.

1214
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,600
I don't work in numbers,
I work in visuals.

1215
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,920
I'm painting the last of my snakes
and then I'm done,

1216
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,200
but they just need to bake.

1217
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,160
Last little bit of glossing.

1218
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,240
Oh.

1219
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,520
Go on Matey. Do your business.

1220
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,840
I'm just going to bang 'em in.

1221
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,160
With the pizza wreaths
finally baking...

1222
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,320
Cross all fingers.

1223
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,720
...Dan has a plan for his
missing letters.

1224
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,280
I'm just going to do some
dead dough,

1225
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,200
which is essentially just flour
and water.

1226
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,520
Shape some bits coming off of a P
and two for the A.

1227
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,640
It's the only thing I can do.

1228
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,320
Bakers, you've got half
an hour left.

1229
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,560
Oh, it's going to be tight.

1230
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,080
Last one.

1231
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,400
Everything is in the oven,
I've just put in my leaves.

1232
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,040
This is the top of the tree.

1233
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,920
Making it green, otherwise it don't
look like owt, really, does it?

1234
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,920
With these on top. So, these are my
little Rowan berries.

1235
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,280
It's looking nice.
I'm going to glaze it now.

1236
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,440
It looks really good.

1237
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,960
I'm just waiting for the last one
to come out.

1238
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,400
It's heavy.

1239
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,880
Do you have to take the bowl out?

1240
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,280
No. That's the thing, as soon as
the bowl comes out,

1241
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,280
if it's not cooled down,
it'll just collapse.

1242
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,280
Right, that's everything out.
These are my wild garlic flowers.

1243
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:58,680
I'm using them to illustrate
the tree being in blossom.

1244
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,440
The letters,
I'm going to put 'em in 20 minutes.

1245
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,920
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes left.

1246
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,040
No, I'm not.

1247
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,200
It's coming out.

1248
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,800
Should be patient.

1249
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,960
It's ever so slightly doughy,

1250
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,240
so I want it back in
for literally a minute.

1251
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,080
I'd rather Paul and Prue say,

1252
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:27,480
"Oh, they've cooked their edges
a bit," than go, "They're raw."

1253
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,280
Angus, mate, you've risen.

1254
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,560
Sounds good.

1255
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,360
We're just freestyling.

1256
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,160
Doing bits of blue and
then we'll do bits of claret.

1257
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,000
He's got all his stripes going down,
so I'm pleased, yeah.

1258
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,320
This is the babka. It's looking nice

1259
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,600
but I don't know if it's going to
go in the middle.

1260
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,320
Stressful.

1261
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,880
I can only go as fast as
the oven, unfortunately, can't I?

1262
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,760
Please be done, please be done,
please be done.

1263
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,200
Oh, you are done.

1264
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,920
Little Angus, come on, Matey.

1265
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,240
Oh.

1266
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,480
Whoa.

1267
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,760
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1268
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,200
Tight.

1269
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,200
Come on.

1270
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,520
Ah!

1271
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,520
Maybe I should just present it
on the side?

1272
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,360
It's OK,
everything's still quite warm.

1273
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,880
Think that's a bit under.

1274
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,080
They do actually look like little
mushrooms, don't they?

1275
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,840
Bakers, that is your time up.

1276
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,320
Please step away from
your Showstoppers.

1277
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,120
Well, I'm happy with that.

1278
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,720
It's still up.

1279
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,520
I've managed to get it up
and keep it up.

1280
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,440
It's turned out exactly how
I wanted to.

1281
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,720
That's all I can ask for,
isn't it, every time.

1282
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:53,160
It's judgment time for the bakers'
plaited bread Showstoppers.

1283
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,480
Josh, bring your Showstopper to
the front, let's have a look.

1284
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,960
I think it's amazing.

1285
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,080
It's really effective

1286
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,440
and I think you've chosen wisely
with the doughs

1287
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,800
to give you that depth of colour
with the chocolate bread

1288
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,440
and then the cranberry
and orange one as well.

1289
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,120
And you get the face shape just by
plaiting. It's absolutely amazing.

1290
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,800
Does this mascot have a name?

1291
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,640
It was christened Paul
by Alison, so...

1292
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:25,120
It was a beautiful christening.
It was lovely.

1293
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,840
It's absolutely delicious.

1294
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,440
Fantastic flavour.
I think it's gorgeous.

1295
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,160
Phew. It's very much
an enriched dough

1296
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,080
but you've managed to achieve the
same texture in the two doughs

1297
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,320
and that's quite a trick.

1298
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,680
It's very clever.
, I think it's ingenious.

1299
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,440
I think it's well thought out
and well executed. Excellent.

1300
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,880
Thank you.

1301
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,080
The overall look
of that I think is beautiful.

1302
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:47,840
It's really clever.

1303
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,440
Let's try this.

1304
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,280
Remind me of the flavours.

1305
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,720
It's pecan and date.

1306
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,440
I've had quite a big lump there
and there's just nothing in there.

1307
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,480
It tastes lovely if you get a pecan.

1308
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,360
So this is Comte cheese
and lardons.

1309
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,640
Certainly get the cheese.

1310
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,200
Do you? It's lovely.

1311
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,920
The cheese you get.
There is no bacon.

1312
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,440
I think your display's incredible.

1313
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,720
It's down to distribution
of your flavours inside.

1314
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,720
I hope you're, uh, allowed
back in the ground, mate.

1315
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,000
Oh!

1316
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,080
That's a bit unkind.

1317
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,480
I like your design, actually,
it's lovely.

1318
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,120
It's like a bit of art.

1319
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,080
Let's try this one first.

1320
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,560
This looks a bit biscuity.

1321
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,520
It's bone dry.
Now this looks more promising.

1322
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,920
You can see the structure on that
is so much better.

1323
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,120
I like the chillies.
And the bread is just beautiful.

1324
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,640
The bread is very good.

1325
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,080
Saku, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please.

1326
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,280
Do you want a hand?

1327
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,800
Come on, Saku. Stop messing around.

1328
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,760
I think it looks great.
It's quite striking.

1329
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,280
But this is under proved.

1330
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,400
You can see that by the split all
the way down the middle of it.

1331
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,720
Mm. Try that one.

1332
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,000
That is spelt seeded.

1333
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,680
It's quite gluey in the mouth.

1334
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,080
Mm, it's a bit bland
and a bit dense.

1335
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,480
Mm-hm. Remind us again
of the flavours of this?

1336
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,400
Rosemary and garlic.

1337
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,280
You've certainly got the flavour
but it's quite dry.

1338
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,080
I think it's really impressive
bread art.

1339
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,360
It's a little disappointing to eat.

1340
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,200
Well, I have to say it looks
absolutely fantastic.

1341
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,960
Thank you. And you should be proud
of your dad too.

1342
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,640
Yeah. Thanks, John.

1343
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:39,240
This is?
The wholemeal sweet curry.

1344
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,720
It is very strong.

1345
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,600
It's hideous, yeah.
The dough is raw inside.

1346
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,320
It's so, so dense.

1347
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,000
There's so much curry in there,

1348
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,760
the yeast is going,
"Help me I can't rise!"

1349
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,240
OK. Mm. This is the...?

1350
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,000
Smoked bacon, rosemary and Parmesan.

1351
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,480
It's quite heavy. OK.

1352
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,080
Over flavoured again.

1353
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,640
And yeast is going, "Not on the
second time, I still can't rise!"

1354
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,560
Is it going to be the same
for this, do you think?

1355
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,640
Who knows?

1356
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,080
This is the marzipan.

1357
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,360
Yeah. Now that's more open.

1358
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,600
Oh, that looks lovely.

1359
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,040
That is such a relief after
the strength of your other flavours.

1360
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,000
And the crust is
absolutely delicious.

1361
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,200
But it's not enough to compensate
for the other two.

1362
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,640
I'm just gonna...

1363
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,480
Absolutely, that's what I wanted
to do.

1364
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,840
The best of it is this
beautiful plaiting

1365
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,800
and frankly I think you've spoilt it
with all this tat.

1366
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,480
Tat?! I thought that was one of
your earrings, Prue.

1367
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,800
This one is...?

1368
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,360
Coriander and cumin.

1369
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,000
Dana, that is delicious.

1370
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,600
Your flavours are absolutely
spot on.

1371
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,080
I just would've liked
a little bit of crispiness on there.

1372
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,720
When you're doing a basket,

1373
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,000
take it off the bowl cos this
has now gone soggy. Yeah.

1374
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,040
The bread, as it's cooling,
is sweating on the bowl.

1375
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,040
But I think it tastes great.

1376
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,400
It's beautiful. My mouth's watering.

1377
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,920
I actually want to eat it.

1378
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,360
But because you didn't get that
in there,

1379
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,000
you don't see the glory
of the centrepiece.

1380
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,360
But let's have a quick look
at this one first.

1381
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,080
That looks beautiful, doesn't it?
It's very light.

1382
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,480
OK, good.

1383
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,040
It's a lovely challah,
the flavour's fantastic.

1384
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,080
I think the texture's good.
Let's just taste that.

1385
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,680
Mm, lovely flavour.

1386
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,520
The nuts and the chocolate
work really well together.

1387
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,040
They're both very good breads.

1388
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,520
I think overall
the design is rudimentary.

1389
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,400
This is a what plait?

1390
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,680
A nine.
That's the walnut and stilton.

1391
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,520
Needs to be more stilton in there.

1392
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,200
There is definitely a flavour,

1393
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,080
but you can get much,
much stronger flavour than that.

1394
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,400
This is the wild garlic and...?
And nettle.

1395
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,200
It's extremely green, isn't it?

1396
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,200
It feels as if it's doing you good.

1397
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,560
Yeah, I like the flavour
of that, it's really unusual.

1398
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,040
But needs to be more open.
It's a bit dense. Cake like.

1399
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,760
Mm-hm. I'm so interested in that
dock seed flour.

1400
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,480
There's a,
almost a pepperiness to it.

1401
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,960
I do like your flavours.

1402
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,680
They're unusual, some of them I've
never had before and I like that.

1403
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,520
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Abbi.

1404
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,360
These aren't baked
I mean, that colour's wrong.

1405
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,640
Did you just run out of time and
have to take them out of the oven

1406
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,120
before they were baked? Yeah.

1407
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,880
It's a shame. Is this all the same?

1408
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:29,040
Yeah. Tuscan sausage, nduja, tomato,
mozzarella and basil.

1409
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,800
Hmm, it's quite powerful.

1410
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,280
It's too doughy.
More air, more bake.

1411
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,680
I think this one might be
a little bit raw.

1412
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,000
It's such a pity

1413
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,320
because that has the makings
of a really good loaf.

1414
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,160
It's just so unlike you.

1415
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,200
You know, I know, we all know

1416
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,520
you can do a hell of a lot better
than that.

1417
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,880
OK?

1418
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,960
I think it's beautiful.

1419
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,320
I think it really is,
it's a work of art.

1420
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,640
The hands are the most beautifully
plaited,

1421
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,240
look at those little fingers.

1422
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,800
The face has real expression,
quite sinister.

1423
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,240
And the hair, very, very clever.

1424
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,240
You've caught some of them in
the oven.

1425
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,200
It's just gone a little bit
too dark. Yeah.

1426
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,800
Let's try the pesto one.

1427
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,440
Mm, it's a really strong fresh
pesto. Just delicious.

1428
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,400
That's very good.
Now let's try the face, shall we?

1429
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,840
That's pastrami and cheese.

1430
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,800
Tasha, you are one hell
of a bread baker.

1431
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,720
Wow. Thank you.

1432
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,960
That is beautiful.

1433
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,280
Stunning.

1434
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,600
Wow,

1435
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,480
Never seen anything
like that before.

1436
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,840
The flavours are good,
the textures are good.

1437
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,960
You understand bread
and I like that.

1438
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,880
Thank you. Thank you.
Well done, Tasha.

1439
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,520
Well done. Thank you.

1440
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,960
Well done, Tash, amazing.

1441
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,600
Well done, girl.

1442
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,760
Yeah, I'm so happy.

1443
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,080
That comment from Paul,

1444
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:13,120
I think that's the biggest win
of bread week for me.

1445
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,480
I understand bread.

1446
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,920
Flipping heck.

1447
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,360
That's amazing.

1448
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,640
Diabolical.

1449
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,760
Paul said monstrous yesterday,
hideous today.

1450
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,480
Gonna get that tattooed.

1451
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,840
They did have their criticisms
but they really liked my flavours.

1452
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,760
I'm aware that because of how
yesterday went,

1453
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,240
I still might not have done enough.

1454
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,800
Pretty gutted to be fair,
I was looking forward to bread week.

1455
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,120
Prue gave me some nice words
cos she knows I can do it.

1456
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,440
I know myself I can do it.

1457
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,520
But I have a sense I'm probably
gonna go today.

1458
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,800
Well, bread week's ended up as dread
week, didn't it?

1459
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,680
Well, some of it was
a bit disappointing.

1460
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,400
I think some of the bakers got a bit
caught up with the plaiting

1461
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,280
and ignored the flavour and the
texture.

1462
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,640
Point in question would be Rowan.
Yeah.

1463
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,720
Because however great that tree
looked, that curry bread was,

1464
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,720
I wouldn't say unedible
but it was certainly on the way.

1465
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,760
I was quite shocked with Dan.
Everything was raw. Is he in danger?

1466
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,800
He is. He did really well in the
signature.

1467
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,120
But nevertheless he's put himself
down there.

1468
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,960
Yeah. Can we talk about Abbi?

1469
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,680
Abbi's had a bit
of a shocker as well.

1470
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,000
The thing I loved was her foraging.

1471
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,520
Her flavours were unique but overall
it came down to textures.

1472
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,240
Who really surprised you today?
You loved Tasha's, didn't you?

1473
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,760
The flavours she achieved
was really, really nice.

1474
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,520
And she did it so beautifully.

1475
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,320
I mean, those hands are
just exquisite.

1476
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,240
Amazing. Same size as your hands.

1477
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,920
I know! And I felt like Josh
is really good.

1478
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,360
That was a great loaf.

1479
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:38,000
So now for Star Baker, I think it is
between Josh and Tasha.

1480
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,760
Going home, it's between Dan,
Abbi... Abbi. ..and Rowan.

1481
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,760
Well, you've definitely got some big
decisions to make. Mm-hm.

1482
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,240
Good luck. Thank you, Alison.

1483
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,520
If you didn't wrap it up,
we'd be here forever.

1484
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,760
Hi there, Bakers.

1485
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,440
I'm really, really excited to be
announcing this week's Star Baker,

1486
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,160
and according to the judges
they are absolutely smashing it.

1487
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,760
So this week's Star Baker is...

1488
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,720
...Tasha.

1489
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,280
APPLAUSE

1490
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,960
Which means I've got the horrible
job of announcing

1491
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,320
the person who is leaving us.

1492
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:32,880
And the person who is leaving us
this week is...

1493
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,440
...Abbi.

1494
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,240
Sorry. That's OK.

1495
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,800
Well done.

1496
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,600
I knew it was coming.

1497
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,160
You know what? I'm really proud
of myself, and...

1498
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,680
Sorry, got my hanky this time.

1499
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,600
I'm absolutely gutted. Oh, Abbi.

1500
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,400
I never thought I'd be able
to do this.

1501
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,240
It's given me such
a massive confidence boost

1502
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,080
and I met such amazing people.

1503
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:10,160
I'm going to remember it every day
for the rest of my life, honestly.

1504
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,480
But I'm quite looking forward to
getting back to my vegetables.

1505
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,360
What are we going to do without you?

1506
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:19,720
I do feel lucky. It's a
bit bittersweet.

1507
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,640
I'm devoed, because I love Abbi.

1508
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,960
You don't want your friends
to leave, do you?

1509
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,840
And we're all friends, it's awful.

1510
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,400
A lot better next time. Yeah.

1511
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,880
Abbi going's really tough.

1512
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,720
Love the girl, love her to bits.
She's absolutely brilliant.

1513
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,760
Did enough to go through but I can't
afford another week like this.

1514
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,320
Check you out!

1515
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,880
Thank you. Two in a row!

1516
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,800
Bloody hell.

1517
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,240
I got Star Baker again.

1518
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,920
What the hell?

1519
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,720
What the hell?

1520
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,040
Tash, that's amazing. Bloody hell.

1521
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:53,680
I go into things with quite low
expectations of myself and...

1522
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,600
...I think I need to stop doing that.

1523
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,080
Next time...

1524
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,920
Guess what? More chocolate.

1525
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,400
...it's chocolate week.

1526
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,000
I'm not worried, are you?

1527
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,480
The bakers are taught
a hard lesson in the signature...

1528
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,840
Because I don't like tortes,
I haven't actually tasted it.

1529
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,040
Good luck with this one.

1530
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,320
...feel the heat in a cheesecake
technical...

1531
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,800
...and must keep their temper...

1532
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,120
Oh, God. It's not tempering well
enough.

1533
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,400
...in a chocolate box Showstopper,

1534
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,160
that will push the bakers...

1535
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,560
My heart is breaking right now.

1536
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,640
.To their limit.

1537
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,000
Tasha, are you all right?

1538
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,280
You can take as much time as you
need, all right? OK.

1539
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,000
Are you a Star Baker in the making?

1540
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,520
