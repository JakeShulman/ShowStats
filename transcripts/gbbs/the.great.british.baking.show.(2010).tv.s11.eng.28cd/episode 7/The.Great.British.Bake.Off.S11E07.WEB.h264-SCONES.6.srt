1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,320
It's '80s week,
but don't take my word for it.

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,360
ET bake cake.

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,040
- Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,480
- Hollywood.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,960
Last time...

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,560
- Yes! - Japanese week.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,920
The winner right here.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,760
Lottie's extra special kawaii
cake...

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,936
- Last time I had a sponge like I was
actually in Japan.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,200
- ..helped her win
her first Star Baker.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,720
Lottie. THEY CLAP

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,480
Laura thought it was game over.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,056
- I was sat in that chair thinking,
"Right, what do I pack first?"

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,400
- But Mark became the sixth baker...
- Mark L.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,840
- ..to leave the tent.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,880
- They're happy tears because, you
know,

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,080
I've made it to week six
of Bake Off.

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,320
Now '80s week...

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,360
- I do remember enjoying a bit of
Depeche Mode.

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,800
- ..serving up quiches...

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,520
- Come on. - ..doughnuts...

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,120
Wow. Sexy!

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,640
..and ice cream cakes.

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,080
- Making ice cream
on a increasingly hot day.

25
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,520
- As temperatures soar, who will make
it to the quarterfinal?

26
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,840
- Oh, you're joking me.

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,720
- And who will have a meltdown?

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,800
- Oh, no. It's just melting, isn't it?

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,200
Wow. It just went from bad to worse.

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,680
- 1980s week, very excited.

31
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,320
- I do remember the 1980s. I was
a teenager then. I learnt to drive.

32
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,840
Yeah, they were good times.

33
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,120
- I had an '80s-themed night
out for my 30th

34
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,240
full of neon and Oops
Up Side Your Head-ing on the floor.

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,640
- 1980s food, I'm thinking cake with
lots of ruffled piped icing over it.

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,160
- Prawn cocktail's gross.

37
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,800
- I feel like it was all about, like,
frozen packet meals,

38
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,200
but maybe today I'll be
proved wrong.

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,200
- Good morning
and welcome back to the tent.

40
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,960
It's '80s week.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I love the '80s.
It's such a cool decade.

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,640
Jean-Michel Basquiat,
Keith Haring, Grace Jones.

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,080
- Yeah, Brookside, Right to Reply,
the emergence of Carol Vorderman,

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,520
really edgy. - LAUGHTER

45
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,520
Today the judges would like
you to make eight individual quiches

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,400
consisting of two different
savoury flavours.

47
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,480
- Your quiches should be made
with a shortcrust pastry

48
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,440
and filled with a savoury
custard base.

49
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,240
- They must be served
out of their tins.

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,080
- Yeah, if we see a quiche in a tin,
we're going to be very upset.

51
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,776
- We will unleash some fury. - You're
going to move to another planet,

52
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
you said. - I will burn the tent down.
- Yeah.

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,280
You have two hours.

54
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,640
- On your marks. - Get set.

55
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
- Bake!

56
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,560
- Hmm. Quiche. I love a quiche, yeah.

57
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,240
I mean, who doesn't love a quiche?

58
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,440
- I can't remember eating quiche in
the 1980s cos I was two years old.

59
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,560
- Born two decades after, in 2000.

60
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,240
The 1980s, just after medieval
history at school, you know.

61
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,560
- It's '80s week, so it's my
week.

62
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,616
I'm still an '80s boy in heart
and I always will be.

63
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,240
It's the best time, best time ever.

64
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,720
- We've asked for that absolute
classic '80s quiche

65
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,320
and I remember quiche as
quiche Lorraine,

66
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,360
which is the one with bacon, onion
and cheese,

67
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,800
but we're not really asking them
to do '80s flavours.

68
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,000
I hope they'll do something more
modern than that.

69
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,360
- I'm looking for a beautifully
crispy base,

70
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,280
creamy interior
full of great flavours.

71
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,760
Now, it's really hot in the tent
today, so, actually,

72
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,360
the bakers really have to
concentrate on what they're doing.

73
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,400
- How you doing, Lottie?
- I'm very warm.

74
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,000
Apart from that...

75
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,056
- Hello, Peter. - Hello, Peter.
- Good morning.

76
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,480
- Tell us about your quiche.

77
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,520
- So, for my quiches today,

78
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,800
I'm making
a South East Asian-inspired

79
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,960
coconut curry quiche, so I've got
some crab meat through that.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,640
- Ah. - Oh, wow. OK. - Wow.

81
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,640
- Peter's pairing his Thai curry
quiche with a less spicy offering -

82
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,600
salmon, asparagus and capers.

83
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,520
- It's different.

84
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,256
The Thai-style one was certainly
not around in the '80s. - Oh, it was.

85
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,760
That's just when it came in.

86
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,536
- You were in a posh area, though,
weren't you? - Yes, of course I was.

87
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,840
- "Of course I was,
it goes without saying."

88
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
THEY LAUGH - For goodness' sake.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,200
- Peter's not the only baker giving
the quiche a kick.

90
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,400
- This is Calabrian sausage.
I use it a lot on pizzas

91
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,360
but it's really delicious,
it's quite fiery.

92
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,840
- Laura's contrasting her fiery
sausage quiche

93
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,160
with a lighter addition -

94
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,920
goat's cheese, pea and asparagus.

95
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,496
How old were you in the '80s?
- It's '80s week. One. - About two.

96
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,960
- One! - What a decade.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We had all sorts -

98
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,600
Rubik's cube, ET.
You kids don't know you're born...

99
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,816
- Oh, I love ET. - ..with your Tinder
and your Love Island.

100
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,280
Now, if you couldn't phone home,
people'd go,

101
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,520
"What do you mean, phone home?"
ET would have a mobile.

102
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,280
He'd be swiping like that with his
big long finger. - He would, yeah.

103
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,280
- He'd do a Zoom.
- Oh, Grindr.

104
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,080
ET's definitely on Grindr.

105
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,720
- So, just working on my pastry.

106
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,280
Egg, flour and butter.

107
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,600
- The bakers have been asked
to produce shortcrust pastry.

108
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,840
- For my pastry, I really want it to
be nice and crisp

109
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,920
and have a relatively
short texture

110
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,080
so it's a bit crumbly, so I'm just
going to chill it down.

111
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,000
- To pull it off, the first
port of call is the fridge.

112
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,800
- I need to cool them before they go
in cos the butter

113
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,440
will come out otherwise.

114
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,920
- But getting it cool enough
is no mean feat...

115
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,560
- Pastry does not like heat.

116
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,280
Don't want it to be too warm.

117
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,480
- ..in a timed challenge
and summer heat.

118
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,840
- Freezer, actually. - Yes, freezer.

119
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,240
- I had to put it in the freezer for a
bit, which I wouldn't normally,

120
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,720
but it's so hot.
It's like Satan's kitchen in here.

121
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,480
- That fish is quite strong, isn't it?
- It is strong fish, yeah.

122
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,720
- Yeah! That's quite a strong food
to be cooking on quite a hot day.

123
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,120
- So, it's going to be
a Cornish-inspired quiche.

124
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,720
So, fish, it could be
caught from Cornwall.

125
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,440
- Inspired by his home town,

126
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,240
Marc's quiches pair cod
with Cornish blue

127
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,720
and smoked haddock with Cheddar.

128
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,760
So, what '80s music do you like?

129
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,720
- Transvision Vamp.
- Transvision Vamp!

130
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,480
- What's the name? Altered Images,
uh, Clare Grogan. - Clare Grogan!

131
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,640
# Happy birthday, happy birthday. #

132
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,776
- They were good times, weren't
they, the '80s? - Yeah!

133
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,640
Late '80s, it just dipped, didn't
it? - It did, yeah.

134
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,896
- It just dipped. - Yeah.
- And it's never really recovered.

135
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,936
- I don't think it has. - No.

136
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,520
- Or maybe we're just getting old,
Matt. - I think both.

137
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,120
45 minutes in...

138
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,960
- Hot. - Yeah. - It's hot.

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,320
- So hot. - ..and the temperature's
reached 28 degrees.

140
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,840
- Hottest day of the year
and we're working with pastry

141
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,040
but just now need to roll out.

142
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,200
- The pastry must be rolled out fast.

143
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,040
- Heat just makes it a bit soft
and a bit sticky, so, yeah,

144
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,160
I'm trying to work as quick as
possible.

145
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,640
- Handle it for too long, the fat will
melt, making it harder to shape.

146
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,320
- It's really sticky. Oh. Come on.

147
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,160
- Cool them down.
They're hotter than I am.

148
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,800
- Well, in we go. 22 minutes.

149
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,520
- Baking beans weigh it down.

150
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,400
And then this pastry's
going to blind bake.

151
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,560
That's going to hopefully provide
a bit of a barrier

152
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,760
and prevent the infamous
soggy bottom.

153
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,000
- But Hermine isn't ready to blind
bake her pastry just yet.

154
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,760
- I'm just a bit behind.

155
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,040
But, hey, I'm going to cook like
home.

156
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,760
I'm going to keep the feel.

157
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,280
I don't cook by time, you see.

158
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,840
I love cooking.

159
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,480
I probably love cooking more than
I love baking.

160
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,640
She's showcasing
classic flavour combos

161
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,440
with her painstakingly
prepared recipes.

162
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,880
True to form, she's adding some
je ne sais quoi

163
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,520
with a Gruyere cheese
and French mustard.

164
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,200
Do you miss France? - Yes.

165
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,160
The food. - The food.

166
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,280
- We've got the food, then we've got
the booze,

167
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,800
then we've got the cheese
and then we've got my family.

168
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,480
If you're watching this in France...

169
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,920
Number four.

170
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,280
- They'll all disown me now.

171
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,080
Bakers, you have one hour left.

172
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,720
Ah.

173
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
- Oh, dear.

174
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,840
God, it's warm, though, innit?

175
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,200
- Oh, so hot.

176
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,560
- Ah.

177
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,760
- But scorching heat
isn't a concern for everyone.

178
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,640
- My pastry is frozen.

179
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,160
This is not good.
This is not good.

180
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,640
They're too hard. I left them
too long in the freezer.

181
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,640
- While Hermine's forced to rescue
her pastry,

182
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,360
the others move on to the final
part of the quiche.

183
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,720
- I'm doing a custard.

184
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,760
- This is coconut cream
that I'm going to be adding.

185
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,360
I want the custard to be
interesting.

186
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,160
- And when it comes to making custard
interesting...

187
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
..Dave's going all out.

188
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,080
- I'm doing my interpretation
of an English breakfast,

189
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,600
so scrambled egg with
a custard base.

190
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,960
- Right.

191
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,280
- That's interesting that you're doing
a scrambled egg in an egg custard.

192
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
- Yeah. - Yeah. - That's brave.

193
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,440
It could just be
like scrambled custard.

194
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,560
- Yeah.

195
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,560
- Dave's English breakfast features
scrambled egg,

196
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,640
hash browns and sausage mince.

197
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Even his pastry will be
spiced like a Cumberland.

198
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,160
It'll be paired with another novel
quiche -

199
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,720
beef and avocado.

200
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,480
- I think it's very original.

201
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,960
Cos one's English breakfast,
one's avocado and beef. - OK.

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,320
- Cheers, thank you.
- Thank you very much. - Thank you.

203
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,000
Um, yeah, I think... I think
they thought it was unusual,

204
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,200
but I like the idea of it.

205
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,440
An English breakfast quiche may not
be that unusual after all.

206
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,720
- So, I am making a full English.

207
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,320
Obviously, my really,
really great original idea's

208
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,440
been stolen by another baker
in the tent.

209
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,360
So, Dave is also doing
a full English.

210
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,880
But I tasted his and I don't
think it is a full English,

211
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,440
I think it's mainly sausage.

212
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,160
- Lottie's putting just
a smattering of sausage in hers,

213
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,560
along with black pudding
and baked beans.

214
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,680
For contrast, her second will be
flavoured like a salad.

215
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,160
That looks nice and attractive.

216
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,680
- Yeah, those are my baked beans.

217
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,360
That's what I brought to the party.

218
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,760
- Hmm, can't wait to try these.

219
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,760
- Beans? Gross.

220
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,680
So, I've got all things nice and
she's got

221
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,200
what normally gets left over.

222
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,080
- Just 45 minutes remain.

223
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,880
- It's so hot

224
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,120
and I'm behind.

225
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,440
This is painful.

226
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,480
Blind bake now. Ah.

227
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,520
- For those who have blind
baked their pastry...

228
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,760
- Now just chuck it all together.
My mind's just going,

229
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,400
"Ping, ping, ping, ping, ping"
to all these different places.

230
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,960
- ..construction can commence.

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,520
- So, this is the coconut curry.

232
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,080
- Fingers crossed,
they will like my inventions.

233
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,560
- What do you think, Prue?

234
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,840
- I mean, we do ask them to be
original,

235
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,520
but my instinctive reaction
to scrambled egg

236
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,200
cooking in custard
is that it won't work.

237
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,440
- Right, beans.

238
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,960
- Lottie has included baked beans.

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,360
I hate baked beans.

240
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,840
- We've got to be open-minded about
this, Prue. - Exactly.

241
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,040
We're going to taste it as
if we had no prejudices at all.

242
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,440
- But we do.

243
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,800
- There's no going back now.

244
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,240
- Bakers, you have half an hour left.

245
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,800
- Really? - I'm really, really behind.

246
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,040
- It's so hot. - Crazy, innit?

247
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,840
Cooking on the hottest
day of the year.

248
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,080
Ugh, just got flour in my face.

249
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,680
- They'll go into the oven
for about 15 minutes

250
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,080
I want a gentle wobble,
but we don't want, uh,

251
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,600
a splodge on the plate.

252
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,920
- Oh, trying to rush now.

253
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,640
Aw. - Not good? - No.

254
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,160
- Oh, why?
- I don't think they'll cook in time.

255
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,440
- Do you know how you can
make up that time? - No.

256
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,200
- Doing this.

257
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,400
- I'm already doing that.

258
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,640
- Come on.

259
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,320
Living the dream.

260
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,280
- Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

261
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,480
Oh, there he is.

262
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,880
- Oh, God. Ah...

263
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,280
- Salad quiche.

264
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,720
- Come on, then.

265
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,616
- Do you want some help?
You've got ten minutes.

266
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,200
They're never going to cook like
that.

267
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,720
- I put them at the highest.

268
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,120
- Yeah, that should do it.

269
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,560
- Yeah, OK.

270
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,880
- Yeah, don't worry, Hermine. - Aw.

271
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,800
- So my bacon's pretty crispy.

272
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,640
Luckily it's just for decoration.

273
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,160
- Is that burnt, Lot? - Yeah,
that is burnt, yeah.

274
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,600
That is some burnt bacon, yeah.

275
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,560
Brilliant.

276
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,400
One minute left.

277
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,240
It's not long enough, we know that.

278
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,080
- We haven't got any time.
Ha-ha-ha.

279
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,040
- God, they look ugly.

280
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,560
That's still not good.

281
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,160
- Come on. - Ah!

282
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,480
- Bakers, your time is up.

283
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,480
- Well done. They look great.

284
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,000
- They're cooked.

285
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,560
The bakers' quiches will now
face the judgment of Paul and Prue.

286
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,440
- Hello, Lottie. - Hello. - Hiya, Lottie.

287
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,840
They're very neat.

288
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,320
- Yeah. They're perfectly cooked
underneath. Nice and thin.

289
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,840
- So, my first quiche is goat's
cheese, beetroot and some thyme.

290
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,600
- Lovely short pastry.

291
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,400
- The beetroot and the goat's cheese

292
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,920
with that beautiful, buttery,
crumbly base is delicious.

293
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,200
- Good. - Right, breakfast.

294
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,720
This is one where I have
to put my prejudices aside!

295
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,680
I really don't like baked beans.

296
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,760
What I'm mostly getting is
black pudding - which I like.

297
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,600
I'm glad to say I can hardly taste
the baked beans.

298
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,680
- Yeah, I didn't get the baked beans
which is good.

299
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,840
I don't think they add anything
to the look, either.

300
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,600
- No. - But the pastry's the king in it.

301
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,920
I think the pastry's
very, very good. - Thank you.

302
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,840
So, the first one,

303
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,800
there's bird's eye chilli,
avocado and top sirloin beef.

304
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,760
- You like bird's eye chilli?
I like Bird's Eye chicken dippers.

305
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,216
- It's obviously making you more hot.
- It's the paprika and cayenne

306
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,120
that overwhelm everything,
unfortunately.

307
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,960
- Yeah. - Heavy on the spices, Dave.
- Yeah, yeah.

308
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,120
- Shall we try the other one?
- Let's have a bit of breakfast, then.

309
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,840
- There is egg in there. - Yeah.

310
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,440
- I don't know whether that's
the scrambled egg or the custard.

311
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,400
- I like the idea of the spices
in the pastry to act like a sausage

312
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,600
but I think it's ruined it
because it's too strong.

313
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,960
- It does taste like
a sausage breakfast. - It does.

314
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,640
Remind us of the flavours again.

315
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,920
- That is the smoked haddock.

316
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,240
- The fish is delicious
but, more importantly,

317
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,960
the crumbliness and the butteriness
of your pastry is very, very good.

318
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,880
And your other...

319
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,520
The cod is beautiful.

320
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,600
- My only complaint is that
if you were at a party

321
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,280
and you had these as a choice,
they're too similar. - Yeah, yeah.

322
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,656
- There's a bit of a leakage
going on with the chorizo.

323
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,280
- I'm sorry,
that's not happened before.

324
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,200
- The pastry's a little tough. - Oh, OK.

325
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,680
- However, I like a bit spice.
The flavour's lovely.

326
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,880
- The asparagus and pea,
you've just given it

327
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,960
a nice delicate hint with the mint,
delicious. - Lovely, thank you.

328
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
- These look so pretty, Peter.

329
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,720
- OK, well, let's have a look
at the Thai-inspired one. - Yeah.

330
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,200
- Very nicely cooked pastry. - Hmm.

331
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,240
- I think the chilli
slightly overwhelms the fish,

332
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,480
because crab is so delicate.

333
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,280
- But the wholemeal one -

334
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,120
the wholemeal works beautifully
with the salmon. - Excellent.

335
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,800
- Hmm, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

336
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,920
- The pastry right in the middle
is a little undercooked.

337
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,280
- I was a bit short on time.

338
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,520
- But, actually, you've got
the texture. It holds well.

339
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Run through the ingredients again.

340
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,680
- Shiitake mushroom and,
er, spinach.

341
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,000
- I love that. - They're delicious.
- It's such a classic combination,

342
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,840
and such a good one.

343
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,840
- Your other - the salmon and the leek
is absolutely delicious. - Isn't it?

344
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,960
- It's creamy, the salmon's delicious,
it's buttery in the pastry.

345
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's absolutely gorgeous, isn't it?
- Hmm. Well done.

346
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,880
- Thank you, I wasn't expecting that.

347
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,720
Cor, I can't believe the comments.

348
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,200
I genuinely felt
I've booked my ticket home.

349
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,480
And I just saw Paul taking
one of my quiches for lunch

350
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,560
and I can't believe he did that.

351
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,240
- I could be towards the bottom
because my flavours weren't great.

352
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,640
No, I won't be making quiches any
time soon. It's just, it's not me.

353
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,640
- Technicals are something
I quite enjoy

354
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,120
as long as it's not 40 degrees.

355
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,560
As afternoon temperatures rise,

356
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,560
the bakers are facing
a gingham-covered mystery.

357
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,760
- Good afternoon, bakers, Welcome back

358
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,160
to the hottest tent in the history
of the world... - It's fine.

359
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,120
- ..for your Technical Challenge
which today has been set by

360
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,640
judge Paul Hollywood.

361
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,120
Judge Paul Hollywood,
any words of advice?

362
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,720
- This is a classic.

363
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,440
Watch the colour of the end product.

364
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,440
- That can't be it. Is that it?
- That's it.

365
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,880
- OK, as ever, this Technical
Challenge will be judged blind.

366
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,200
So, we're going to have to ask
these two beautiful people

367
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,640
to slip away into the grass.
Bye-bye.

368
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,840
Judge Paul Hollywood
would like you to make

369
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,960
six custard and jam
finger doughnuts.

370
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,880
- Your digit doughnuts should be
fried to a golden colour

371
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,840
and you have two hours
and 45 minutes.

372
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,480
- OK, Matthew,
it's time for our magic words.

373
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,160
- Yes, Izzy Wizzy, let's get busy.

374
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,560
- Not those magic words,
they belong to Sooty. - Oh, yeah.

375
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
- Our magic words. - Oh, yeah.

376
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,680
On your marks...
- Get set... - ..bake!

377
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,720
This one doesn't play to
my strengths, I don't think.

378
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,600
Um, I've never deep-fried
anything before.

379
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,640
- Right.

380
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,120
That scares the bejesus out of me.

381
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,760
- Paul, this really reminds me
of the '80s. Finger doughnuts -

382
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,120
these were considered
posher than the round ones.

383
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,976
- I grew up with these. I used to be
a Saturday lad in my dad's business

384
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,680
and my first job was
frying doughnuts.

385
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,120
- Deep frying in this heat.

386
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,360
- They've got to deep fry with
the temperature around 160 degrees.

387
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
But the thing is,
we want it a golden brown.

388
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,320
Any darker than this particular
colour, it starts to taste burnt.

389
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,120
- I don't think I've eaten
a finger doughnut since the '80s.

390
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,320
- They're whoppers these, aren't they?
- They are. Paul Hollywood's fingers.

391
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,920
Delicious, Paul. Mm.

392
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,800
- I hope the weather plays a fair game
with the bakers today in the tent

393
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,960
because it is going to be difficult
for them.

394
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,320
- I'm probing the air.

395
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,760
So, that's the temperature
of the room today.

396
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,360
- This isn't 35.8.

397
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,040
- On a hot summer's day,

398
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,160
just want to get in that kitchen
and deep fry stuff!?

399
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,840
- So, the first step is make the
dough, and then, leave to rise.

400
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,200
- Even the mixer is getting hot.
- I know, I just felt mine.

401
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,280
- You want do the window-pane test,
see if you can see through it.

402
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,680
Like that, it's still breaking
but it'll do.

403
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,040
- I'm just going to go all machine
for this dough.

404
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,000
In this heat, it's going to be quite
sticky and difficult to work with.

405
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,520
- Are you sweating? - I am, profusely.
- I'm really sweating.

406
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,600
It's really hot in here, isn't it?

407
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,056
- But we've got these to cool us down.

408
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,160
- We've got the chamois
around our necks. - Yeah.

409
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,120
- Which just means that
our necks are fine.

410
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,400
- Yeah, but also wet. - Wet. - Yeah.

411
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,360
- This is a most unflattering
portrayal

412
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,200
of two essentially
quite beautiful people.

413
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,121
- I'm just going to cover the dough
and leave it to prove.

414
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,400
I reckon in this heat
that's probably only going to take

415
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,080
half-an-hour or so.

416
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,056
- It needs to double in size,
and I just don't think

417
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,361
there's any need for a proving
drawer on a day like today.

418
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,200
- I've stuck it in the proving drawer.

419
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,840
Whether my dough's right - only
time will tell, won't it, really?

420
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,520
- I'm just going to chop
the strawberries

421
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,160
into my jam sugar,
and make the jam.

422
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,280
- So, just going to bring that
up to the boil,

423
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,320
and then, I'll pass it through
a sieve, and then, leave it to cool.

424
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,480
- Right, what am I doing?

425
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,960
I'm making the mousseline now.

426
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,520
- So, the creme mousseline
is creme pat with butter.

427
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,480
- Whipping the coolish butter,

428
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,320
and then, I'll whip that
into the creme pat.

429
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,296
- I really feel like
this is extreme baking today.

430
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,320
Like, insane amount of heat.
Now, it's really windy.

431
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,120
I just feel like... we should be
getting more out of this

432
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,640
than some doughnuts!

433
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,200
- Hiya, Noel. - What's happening here?

434
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,480
- I'm dribbling. - It's '80s week.

435
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,680
- How old are you? - 47. - 51.

436
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,360
- No way! - Way.

437
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,080
- Fashion stank, though, in the '80s.

438
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,960
Big shoulder pads. - Yeah.
- No! - Leg warmers.

439
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,520
Leg warmers were horrendous.
- Oh, leg warmers, Fame.

440
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,720
There were some cool stuff -
The Cure, what a look. - Yeah.

441
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,160
- Backcombed hair and a big jumper.

442
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,136
You'll wear that for
the rest of your life. - Yeah.

443
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,736
- No-one's ever going say anything.
- No.

444
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,160
- It's nearly doubled. We definitely
do not need a proving drawer today.

445
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,960
- Well, I don't think
my dough's rising.

446
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,960
I've stuck it in the proving drawer

447
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,040
but a lot doubled
at room temperature.

448
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,120
I'm going to take it out, anyway.

449
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,640
Fingers crossed I've done the dough

450
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,160
because this is
the main part of it.

451
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,440
- I'm supposed to divide the dough
in six.

452
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,960
- "Shape into a finger
15 centimetres in length."

453
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,280
Isn't that long?

454
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,640
- I don't think that's six inches.

455
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,200
Is it? It looks very large.

456
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,640
I think it looks big enough is
what I'm saying.

457
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,400
- I'm going to leave those
to rise a little bit.

458
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,616
It's a bit of a waiting game
at this point, to be honest.

459
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,760
- Yeah, we just need some tunes,
don't we?

460
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,040
- Peter, what do you know about
'80s music?

461
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
Careless Whisper - do you know it?
- Erm...

462
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,881
- It's the one that goes... - Not
too well. - It's got that great sax.

463
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,280
- Oh, yeah, I know that.

464
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,160
- # Nah, na-na, nah, nah, na-na... #

465
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,800
And then, what about True by Spandau
Ballet? Do you know that one?

466
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,040
- Er...

467
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,920
- He had a very thin microphone.

468
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,960
# So true, funny how it seems.. #

469
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,256
Do you know that song?
- I don't... I don't know if I know.

470
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,880
- Doesn't know it? - I don't know.
- Doesn't know it.

471
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,120
I'm so old now. So old.

472
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,280
- Bakers, you have 15 minutes left!

473
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,760
- True.

474
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,480
- It's so hot. I'm very,
I'm very wet. I'm very wet.

475
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,960
- Wouldn't it be great,
35 degree conditions,

476
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,400
get a deep-fat fryer going,
and make doughnuts?!

477
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,160
- This is torture.
Whose idea was this?

478
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,840
Do you want to stand over
a deep-fat fryer in 35-degree heat?

479
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,640
- I don't mind,
I've got nothing else to do.

480
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,280
- This is the first time
I've ever deep-fat fried,

481
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,440
and what a feeling it is.
Quite a rush. Quite a rush.

482
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,080
- Quite happy to leave it
at that temperature

483
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,280
which is about 160.

484
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,080
- Frying these at 180.

485
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,440
Maybe that might be too hot

486
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,280
because they shouldn't start
to look like that at 50 seconds.

487
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,600
- Right, that's too dark.

488
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,296
- There's no doubt that that is golden
brown, do you know what I mean?

489
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,040
- It's gone past the point of
golden brown, they're more brown.

490
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,640
- See, if we cover them up in sugar,

491
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,520
then, it covers up the
imperfections, doesn't it? - Lottie!

492
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,040
- I'm so hot.
- I'm so hot.

493
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,480
- I'm really bad at heat.

494
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,120
I'm not supposed
to be in the daylight.

495
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,320
This is a nightmare for me.

496
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,920
Do you know when I look best?
1.30 in the morning in a nightclub.

497
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,160
That is when I'm at my most... sexy!

498
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,320
- That's all... argh! It's hot.

499
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,920
- Getting it to cool down because

500
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,160
mousseline and heat - not friends.

501
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,760
- Right, this could all go
horribly wrong but... oh, yeah!

502
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,880
Up there for thinking,
down there for dancing.

503
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,720
- I had a wee look around,
and people are slicing from the top.

504
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,560
Other folk were around in the '80s,
so, know what they should look like.

505
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,400
- They look more like bread inside.

506
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,040
Definitely didn't leave them
to prove long enough.

507
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,560
- Who's the best piper in here?

508
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,720
- I think Peter's... - Peter Piper.
- Peter Piper!

509
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
- And there we go!

510
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,120
- How much time, please?
- Bakers, you've got one minute left.

511
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,800
- Unfortunately,
this one was cut wrong.

512
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,720
- "Pipe a line of jam," but a wiggly
line's still a line, isn't it?

513
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,920
Come on, Laura, precision!

514
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,320
- Ah, well. Lovely jubbly!

515
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,480
- OK, bakers, your time is up.

516
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,920
- This is embarrassing, this is,
this is embarrassing.

517
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,800
It's not a great look, is it,
really?

518
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,000
- Bring your finger doughnuts forward.

519
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,840
Paul and Prue are looking for
six golden finger doughnuts

520
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,280
filled with creme mousseline,

521
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,400
and finished with
a line of strawberry jam.

522
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,760
- OK, we'll start with these.

523
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,960
I quite like the colour of this one.
- Yeah. - But they are a bit short.

524
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,320
They need to be hanging
over the edge of that plate.

525
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,120
Let's have a quick look.

526
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,400
- Hmm. It's lovely.

527
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,080
- It's baked well.

528
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,520
OK, moving on to this one.
It's burnt in the, er, fryer.

529
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,440
Uh, it's underproved.

530
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,920
Um, this one is a right mess.

531
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,640
Yeah, it's very doughy.
See how tight that is inside.

532
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,560
So, overall, I mean,
it's the wrong colour, underproved,

533
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,200
and it doesn't taste extremely good.

534
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,840
Moving on.
- These are the right colour.

535
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,320
- Let's have a look at this one.

536
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,480
The creme mousseline looks good.

537
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,280
Nice and airy inside.

538
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,560
Hm. The texture and flavour's good.

539
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,280
- It's delicious.

540
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,920
- Um, moving on.

541
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,200
A little bit dark.

542
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,120
The colour and the basic shapes,
they need to be more consistent.

543
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,080
- And it is a little tough.

544
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,256
- Moving on to the next one. A little
bit more consistent with the shapes.

545
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,480
- The creme mousseline
is a little bubbly.

546
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,336
- I'm not even... - Worried about that.
- ..because of the weather.

547
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,720
- You're going to forgive that?
- Yes. - OK.

548
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,880
- Absolutely, but it tastes good.
- It's delicious.

549
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,400
- Moving on to the last one.
A little bit messy.

550
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,560
Probably slightly overfried,
as well.

551
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,400
Mm. The flavour's OK.

552
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,600
- Yeah, the flavour's good.

553
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,120
It just doesn't look great.

554
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,560
- Paul and Prue will now rank
the doughnuts from worst to best.

555
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,400
- In sixth place,
we have this one here.

556
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,760
David, you know what happened -
you overcooked them, basically.

557
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,160
- In fifth spot is this one.

558
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,080
The actual shaping of it,
it was all over the place

559
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,200
and it's slightly
overfried, as well.

560
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,680
- In fourth place is Laura,
and Marc is third.

561
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,960
- And in second place,
there's this one.

562
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,040
Peter, they were really nice,
just not all quite the same size.

563
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,920
- Which says, in first place,
we have this one.

564
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,920
Hermine. - Thank you!

565
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,120
- The textures and the flavours
were spot on. - Thank you.

566
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,520
That's some turn of fate.

567
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,920
- Well done. - I'm going to have
a nice, cold beer.

568
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,160
A well-deserved one.

569
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,680
- I do get it, like,
they were saying it's too dark

570
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,800
but I just like
a darker doughnut.

571
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,600
- I need to up my game for tomorrow.

572
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,400
If I can pull it off, I can pull it
off. If I can't, then, it's my time.

573
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,680
- One challenge stands between
the bakers and the quarterfinal.

574
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,880
Yesterday was the third
hottest day on record.

575
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,680
If I had hair, it would've
melted anyway.

576
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,400
The bakers did pretty well,
all things considered.

577
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,080
- Hermine's doing very, very well.
- Isn't she?

578
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,880
- We've had six star bakers
which are all different.

579
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,600
We could go for a seventh star baker
if she does take it.

580
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,160
But I think overall,
Lottie, Laura and Dave

581
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,840
are in a little bit of trouble.

582
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,760
- I agree but we often think that
somebody's doomed and they're not.

583
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,000
- The temperature of the tent
could rise a little bit today.

584
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,400
Maybe not as high as yesterday.
- Oh, I hope not.

585
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,400
- But I don't want the heat to affect
the show stopper today.

586
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,960
Anything could happen today.

587
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,080
- It was crazy in the tent yesterday.
It was really weird.

588
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,720
- I had to peel my jeans off.
- Oh!

589
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,120
- You peeling your jeans off is not
what I want to think about.

590
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,960
- Good morning, bakers.

591
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,960
Welcome back to the tent
for your show stopper challenge.

592
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,560
Today the Paul and the Prue
would like you each to reimagine

593
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,760
that '80s classic,
the ice cream cake.

594
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,440
- Your ice cream cake must have
at least one baked element

595
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,240
but apart from that, the flavours
and the style are up to you.

596
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,200
- You have four hours and 30 minutes.

597
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
- Four hours and thir... that's ages.

598
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,400
- Hmm, I know.
- What are we going to do?

599
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,920
- Well, I thought as it's '80s week,
we could go and hang out

600
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,000
in Rod and Emu's pink windmill.

601
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,720
- Wow, that's a lovely idea
but unfortunately I think they've

602
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,560
knocked it down, I think it's
a JD Sports now.

603
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,040
- Oh, that's a shame.

604
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,960
- When you try on trainers, you say,
"can I have that in a four?"

605
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,720
They go, "somebody wants a four,
somebody wants a four.

606
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,480
"Somebody wants a four."

607
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,040
- Yeah, that joke works better
if you're over 45.

608
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,120
- If you're under 45, just carry on
with TikTok. - Yeah.

609
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
- OK, bakers. On your marks...

610
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,320
- Get set...

611
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,600
- ..Bake!

612
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,080
- I'm feeling optimistic about this,
who knows what way it may go.

613
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,280
- I love ice cream to
too high of a degree.

614
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,760
- Nothing better than a bucket full
of ice cream, is there?

615
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,200
Apart from a bucket full
of wine, but anyway.

616
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,320
- From Viennettas and baked Alaskas,
to the arctic roll, the '80s were

617
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,600
synonymous with ice cream cakes.

618
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,080
Back then, 25 miles of arctic roll
was sold every month.

619
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,320
- Ice cream cake was definitely
a big deal in the '80s.

620
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,160
I mean, you would have it for a
birthday or a dinner party.

621
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,560
It's a lovely celebratory
thing to do.

622
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,360
- It's got to look amazing but
when we put the knife through,

623
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,600
what we want to see is variety
of different levels, some baked,

624
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,560
some ice cream, all hold their shape
and form throughout.

625
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,240
Morning. - Morning.

626
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,800
- So tell us about your show stopper
ice cream cake.

627
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,480
- So, for my ice cream cake, I'm going
to make an ice cream Christmas cake.

628
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,880
Marzipan on top and then covered
in hopefully quite a thin layer

629
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,960
of Italian meringue. - Wow!

630
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,920
- Peter's Christmas cake is
an ice cream surprise

631
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,400
with the decoration
another illusion,

632
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,600
mini ice cream
Christmas puddings.

633
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,520
- That's freezing all right, is it?

634
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,840
- It does take longer to freeze
cos I've got quite

635
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,960
a lot of brandy in it
but it does freeze in time.

636
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,680
- Well, I think this sounds absolutely
wonderful, I mean, why can't

637
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,920
we have Christmas
in the middle of the summer?

638
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,680
- Thank you.

639
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,800
- Peter might be celebrating Christmas

640
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,360
but Hermine's off
on her summer hols.

641
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,920
- Yeah, I'm bringing
a bit of sunshine.

642
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,560
I could eat mangos for breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

643
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,280
I just love them.

644
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,240
- She's enhancing the tropical
flavours of her cake

645
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,200
with a buttery shortbread
from Brittany.

646
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,320
Somebody... - Well done.

647
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,960
- ..did well in the technical.

648
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,120
How are you?
How are you going to play it?

649
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,720
- I'm playing it simple.

650
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,720
- Simple? I've got you
in the sweepstake.

651
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,600
If you don't win, I lose my house,
so no pressure.

652
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,040
- Oh, no.

653
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,800
- I say house, it's a coffin!

654
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,400
- I'm just making my ice cream.

655
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,800
It's a custard base.

656
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,560
Milk, double cream,
egg yolks and caster sugar.

657
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,520
If you can make a custard,
you can make an ice cream.

658
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,080
You can just shove it
in the freezer.

659
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,680
- But rather than using the freezer,
today the bakers have the luxury

660
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,760
of ice cream makers.

661
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:38,120
- This is a freezer but the paddle
inside here just churns your custard

662
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,400
round and round and stops ice
crystals so this makes it smooth.

663
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,800
- But how quickly the mixture cools
depends on the flavours they use.

664
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,080
- Obviously alcohol, brandy high
percentage, it doesn't freeze,

665
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,440
so I had to be careful
when I was putting it in,

666
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,920
not to be too generous.

667
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,000
- This is honey and hazelnut.

668
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,800
- And when it comes to adding extra
liquid, Marc is being more

669
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,640
generous than most.

670
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,200
- So I'm adding pretty much
a whole pot of honey.

671
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,800
I think it's going to take
a while to freeze.

672
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,040
- The honey ice cream is just
the start of his ambition.

673
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,560
Marc's adding four more
different layers.

674
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,000
The exterior is just as intricate
with a sponge resembling

675
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,640
the stripy roof of a retro
ice cream parlour.

676
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,240
- Yeah, it's almost got like an
ice cream quality to it

677
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,760
with the stripes.

678
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,120
What I do, I spread this on here,

679
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,320
paste makes the stripes
in the joconde.

680
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,240
- While Marc's sponge features
delicate chocolate stripes,

681
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,640
over at Laura's...

682
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,920
- That's quite a lot of chocolate,
isn't it?

683
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,760
- ..there's chocolate everywhere.

684
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,200
- Go big or go home!

685
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,120
It literally is death by chocolate.

686
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,440
- To balance the chocolate elements
in her death by chocolate cake,

687
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,760
Laura's making a praline ice cream
with meringue kisses.

688
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,440
- Do you want to be my meringue
guinea pig? - Oh!

689
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,160
Oh! Oh!

690
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,480
- Bit more.

691
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,376
Luckily for you, you didn't
get it all on you head.

692
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,920
- I don't mind having a whippy head.

693
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,560
- We could blowtorch it
and we could have some nice Italian

694
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,680
meringue blowtorch action, then
I could dip you in some hazelnuts.

695
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,240
- This is like Prue Leith meets
50 Shades of Grey or something.

696
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,240
- Sorry.

697
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,200
- While Laura's opted for
decorative meringues,

698
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,800
Dave's finishing his cake with
something a little more novel.

699
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,520
- If you have a bad week

700
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,520
and you know you've had a bad week,
you need to pull it out of the bag

701
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,160
so I'm going to have both,
both ice creams on top, piped.

702
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,240
So only a small amount, just add
that bit of decoration.

703
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,920
- His cake will be flavoured
like a tiramisu with coffee

704
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,240
and almond ice creams alternating
both inside and on top.

705
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,120
- Piped ice cream on the top?
- Yes, that's what I'm hoping for.

706
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,120
- That's risky.
- It is risky.

707
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,416
- Well, first of all, you've got to
be able to pipe it, therefore

708
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,560
it's got to be soft.

709
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,440
Temperature in the tent'll be warm.

710
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,600
So we're expecting puddles
by the time it comes to us.

711
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,720
- Oh, no, no, no.
He knows what he's doing.

712
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
- Good luck.
- Thank you, cheers. - Thank you.

713
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,080
- Decorating with ice cream
may be a risk...

714
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,280
- Hello, Lottie. - Hello.
- Hello, Lottie. - Hello. - Hello.

715
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,680
- ..but Lottie's pushing
the envelope even further.

716
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,120
- So I am coating the entire thing
in chocolate ice cream

717
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,280
all the way round. - Wow!

718
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,120
- To make it look
like a cassette tape.

719
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,160
- Inside Lottie's cassette tape
will sit flavours

720
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,320
reminiscent of '80s
birthday parties.

721
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,920
A layer of chocolate ice cream
will mirror the fragile shell.

722
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,920
- When you look back at ice cream
cakes, normally they're

723
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,360
surrounded with something
to protect them, ie, sponge. - Yeah.

724
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,920
- But you've decided,

725
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,256
you're just going to put the
ice cream on the outside. - Yeah.

726
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,560
- Well, if it works,
it'll be wonderful.

727
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,280
- OK, so it'll be a nice drink.
- Yeah, bring your straws.

728
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,960
- All right, Lottie.
Thank you very much.

729
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,520
- Thank you. - Thanks, Lottie.
- Does sound nice though?

730
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,920
- Thanks, Matt.

731
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,640
- Looking around, can't help
being worried.

732
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,640
Mine is really simple,
but we shall see.

733
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,160
- Wow, I like this.

734
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,600
- Bit like an ice cream parlour,
isn't it, with the stripes?

735
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,800
- I had a jumper like that.
- Did you?

736
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,880
- It was a bit Debbie Harry, a bit
Sting, I'm going to say early Sting.

737
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,840
Not embarrassing Sting.
Not lute playing Sting.

738
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,480
- Yeah.

739
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,680
- Bakers, you are halfway through.

740
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,240
- Beautiful.
- Thank you.

741
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,040
- Yes, the second one has churned.

742
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,840
- With all batches churned,
the ice creams now require

743
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,560
even more chilling.

744
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,440
- So this is now a soft scoop
ice cream but I need to freeze it

745
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,480
a bit more so that I've got a solid
layer for carving into later.

746
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,440
- In order to construct,
the temperature must be lowered

747
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,440
to minus 18 degrees.

748
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,000
- I've let that fully freeze, plop
them in and build it up that way.

749
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,840
- Don't know what's going on.

750
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,040
Come on, ice cream.

751
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,640
- But Laura's brownie ice cream isn't
ready for the freezer just yet.

752
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,320
- My ice cream is taking
way too long to churn.

753
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,880
We'll see.

754
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,160
It's like barely cold.

755
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,200
Oh, my God!

756
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,680
Do you know what I've done, Lottie?
- What?

757
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,120
- Didn't press the ice setting.

758
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,200
So it's just been sitting there
merrily churning,

759
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,600
with no cooling for about
40 minutes.

760
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,080
- Oh, no.

761
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,960
- Great fun we're having.
- That's sad.

762
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,520
- Anyway, would you like a kiss?

763
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,320
- Thanks.

764
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,720
That's amazing. - Nice?

765
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,920
- Just serve that.

766
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,200
- Might have to at this rate.

767
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,280
- You all right?
- Do you know what?

768
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,840
- Oh, here we go.

769
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,520
Do you know what? I've had
a good time here, guys.

770
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,040
If I have to go,
it's my time, I'll go.

771
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,976
- Yeah, literally.
- I don't want to hear that speech.

772
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,360
- OK.
- You're staying, missus.

773
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,096
- But the thing that actually
makes the ice cream,

774
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,880
I forgot to press that button.
- Oh.

775
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,360
- Not actually churning.

776
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,680
- So you might actually be going home,
cos you forgot to press a button.

777
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,120
- Wow, thank you. Yes.

778
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,040
- I mean, that's a rubbish
way to go home.

779
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,520
- Isn't it just?

780
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,720
- Three hours in...

781
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,480
and the chocolates, jellies...

782
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,440
- Don't throw it at Peter,
that's mean.

783
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,600
- You love Peter a bit, don't you?
- Yeah.

784
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,440
- ..and cakes are ready.

785
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,400
- This is the final sponge.

786
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,880
My ice cream hopefully freezing.

787
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,680
- Construction can't start
without the ice creams.

788
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,800
- It's still a bit soft
in the middle actually.

789
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,400
- And that's not all the bakers
have to contend with.

790
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,960
- Making ice cream on a increasingly
hot day, it's getting pretty,

791
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,960
pretty warm.

792
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,280
- Ice cream cake in this
crippling oppressive heat.

793
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,920
Should be laws against that.

794
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,920
You see, this is why I don't go
out in the sun because I melt.

795
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,720
- Wear a bikini.

796
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,520
- I can't get into my bikini any more,
that's the problem.

797
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,160
Bakers, you have one hour left.

798
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,720
How am I going to get down?

799
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,160
Seriously, how am I going to
get down?

800
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
- Churn. Done.

801
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,800
What could go wrong?

802
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,960
Let's pray to the ice cream gods
that it sets, shall we?

803
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,360
Come on.

804
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,040
- Just hope it sets.

805
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,320
My honey ice cream
was taking ages to set.

806
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,000
- I think it might be time to assemble
but if I can't carve

807
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,880
the chocolate, I've got to do it.

808
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,560
I've just scared myself talking now.

809
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,840
- I'm going to go for it.

810
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,800
- The heat is on.
- The heat is on literally.

811
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,240
- Good luck, good luck.

812
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,640
- Literally and physically.

813
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,600
- The build is now a race
against the clock.

814
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,680
- Hmm.

815
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,680
Trying to work fast.

816
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,320
Feeling hot already.

817
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,200
- Every second the ice creams
stay out of the freezer...

818
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,560
- Does defrost or unset very,
very quickly.

819
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,960
Oh, my God.

820
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,800
- ..increases the chance of collapse.

821
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,960
- God, this stuff's melting
so quick.

822
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,280
Ah!

823
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,056
I think it's cos it's really hot as
well, I'm starting to feel it now.

824
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,480
It's definitely warming up.

825
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,640
- I'm scared.

826
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,080
- Oh, dear.

827
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,456
Brandy snaps are splitting,
I think the heat might be starting

828
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,800
to get to me.

829
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,960
- I'm so hot.

830
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,240
OK, concentrate, Lottie.

831
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,600
- Ah!

832
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,800
Biscuit.

833
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,680
- Come on, ice cream.

834
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,520
- Blackberry layer quickly.

835
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,320
- Just try and take every advantage
you can to get it nice and cold.

836
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,200
Get this straight
in the freezer again.

837
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,560
- My ice cream, it takes
so long to cool back down.

838
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,200
Keep it in the freezer now
until I need to use it.

839
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,000
- As most of the cakes head
into the chiller,

840
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,200
Laura's brownie ice cream
is coming out.

841
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,760
- Right, I'm going to go for it.

842
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,376
Shouldn't really add it in but
haven't really got the time not to.

843
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,080
- Is it freezing, Laura?
- Not yet.

844
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,800
Very sticky.

845
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,280
Come on.

846
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,440
Let's hope and pray.

847
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,200
- I'm hoping everything sets now
cos we're going to have to decorate

848
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,320
with an ambient temperature
of 35 degrees.

849
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,320
- Fingers crossed.
- It's going to be tight.

850
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,840
- I'd like to know how badly
it's going to go.

851
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,920
- I feel like everyone's
in the same boat though,

852
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,400
like, worried about things
setting.

853
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,280
- Peter isn't.
Peter's making holly.

854
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,640
- I don't enjoy these.

855
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,480
- Just stop doing it then.

856
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,896
- You want to get into the final,
don't you? - Definitely, yeah.

857
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,400
- I love that about you.

858
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,320
You're so competitive and you don't
even pretend to be cool.

859
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,800
He's the baby faced assassin.

860
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,240
Lottie, Lottie who?

861
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,640
Lottie!

862
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,520
Laura!

863
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,840
- And I love them all.

864
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,120
- Bakers!

865
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,800
You have 30 minutes...

866
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,280
..left.

867
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,720
- It's getting warm.
- Yeah. - Very.

868
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,800
- Hopefully the cake will hold
together.

869
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,040
- Let's try it.

870
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,160
- Prue and Paul are expecting clean
layers of perfectly set ice cream.

871
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,600
- It's so hot.

872
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,280
It's melting a lot quicker
than what I thought.

873
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:54,800
- Any leaks and it will ruin
the entire look of the cake.

874
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,360
- This is the moment of truth.

875
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,880
Done.

876
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,680
It's a very delicate cake.

877
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,120
- Fingers crossed this is
going to work.

878
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,560
- Go on, go on, go on.

879
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,600
- Oh.

880
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,120
Really fragile.
It melts straight away.

881
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

882
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,280
Oh BLEEP!

883
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,720
Worst case scenario.

884
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,120
Oh, it's not set, is it?

885
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,040
- Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

886
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,400
- Right. - It's too hot, innit?

887
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,440
- It's so hot.
It's just melting.

888
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,320
- It's going to go, isn't it? - Ah!

889
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,816
- Mine needs coating in ice cream
but I'm worried I'm just going

890
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,080
to go like that and it's all
going to splurge out the sides.

891
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,800
- What's happening? What's happening
is I'm going home, BLEEP mess.

892
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,360
Right, let's just get that
abomination back in for a bit.

893
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,080
- That can go back in the freezer.

894
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,520
- I've got to do it now.

895
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,720
Got no time.

896
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,720
It's a really soft consistency
in order for me to spread it.

897
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,480
- No, this isn't - going to - work.

898
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,720
- Oh! You're joking me.

899
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,480
As fast as I'm making it,
it's just melting.

900
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,160
I'm just scraping it up
and it's just sliding down.

901
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,240
It's game over.

902
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,880
What a nightmare!

903
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,160
- I'm scared.

904
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,240
What was that?

905
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,880
Oh, no!

906
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,800
Oh, my God!

907
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,360
Wow!
It just went from bad to worse.

908
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,520
- Laura?
Does that make you feel better?

909
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,560
- Um, hmm, no.

910
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,360
- No, it's dripping. Sure?

911
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,800
- Little shells of shortbread,
so just get this on.

912
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,520
- I need to work quite fast
before it melts.

913
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,920
- Bakers, you have one minute left.

914
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,000
- To do what,
remake an entire ice cream cake?

915
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,440
- Crazy fast now.

916
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,000
- Piping ice cream onto the top
on this hot day, the ice cream

917
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,800
is going to melt very fast.

918
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,440
- Oh!

919
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,440
We love a dramatic ending, don't we?

920
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,320
- I'm just trying to draw in
the cassette tape.

921
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,520
Disaster.

922
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,640
- Come on.

923
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,360
- Bakers, your time is up.

924
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,640
Please put your ice cream cakes
in your freezers.

925
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,600
- I'm pretty embarrassed
about this one.

926
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,240
- Really? - Yeah.

927
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,600
Looks like a child's done it.

928
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,240
- OK, we'll just close that, yeah.
Goodbye.

929
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,880
- Did you enjoy it?

930
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,600
- Did I enjoy that? Well...

931
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,960
That went really well.

932
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,840
That was exactly how I planned it.
It's brilliant.

933
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,720
Got to laugh or cry.

934
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,600
Oh, my God, I can't look.

935
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,240
What a mess!

936
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:17,280
- It's judgement time
for the celebratory ice cream cakes.

937
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,280
Marc, would you like to bring
up your show stopper please?

938
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,720
- Considering that's an ice cream
cake, it's quite impressive.

939
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,920
- Thank you.

940
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,800
- Even if it wasn't an ice cream,
you'd say that's quite impressive.

941
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,840
- It is very impressive.

942
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,080
- Ah, look at that.
- Wow, look at that. Yeah.

943
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,600
Hmm, the mousse is lovely,

944
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,520
but I think both the ice creams
are delicious.

945
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,640
Bottom one's not quite set.

946
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,296
- I was struggling with
the honey in there.

947
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,416
- You add something. - Yeah.

948
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,536
- Therefore the freezing will take
a little bit longer. - Sure, OK.

949
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,080
- But very brave.

950
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,920
- It's so complicated,
there's so much happening.

951
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,520
And you've pretty well done it.
- Thank you very much.

952
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,640
- Looks nice.

953
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,680
- I think it looks beautiful, I love
the way you've done the ribbon.

954
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,080
Very good.

955
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,360
- Let's have a look, shall we?

956
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,200
Nice neat lines.

957
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,440
You can see the biscuit down
the bottom, it would suck in to

958
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,880
a shortbread.

959
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,120
- I think that's beautiful.
- Thank you.

960
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,600
- I think it's so well balanced
because I put both the mango

961
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:00,320
and the coconut flavours in together
and I can taste both distinctly.

962
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,880
Really good.

963
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,040
- The Breton is beautiful
because it's buttery. - Hmm.

964
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,640
- And you've got a really
nice eat, that.

965
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,240
It's simple,
but highly effective.

966
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,600
- As always, you're doing classical
things very simply but beautifully.

967
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,760
Well done, Hermine. - Thank you.

968
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,680
- Looks great.

969
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,640
- It looks absolutely fantastic.
- Clever.

970
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,320
- I love the decoration.

971
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,000
- Let's have a look, shall we?

972
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,960
- Oh, he's really strong, isn't he?
Oh.

973
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,120
- Remind us about your flavour.

974
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,160
- It's a Christmas cake and a layer
of Christmas cake ice cream

975
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,720
and then a layer of brandy cream
ice cream.

976
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,000
- Peter, that is absolutely delicious.

977
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,160
And it's very clever because you
know, you've managed to freeze that

978
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,520
with a lot of booze in it.

979
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,800
- I think your flavours are great
but the cake's pretty solid.

980
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,296
Um, that's because of the amount
of fruit that you've put in there.

981
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,520
And by the time that's
soft enough to eat,

982
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,120
your ice cream will be melted.

983
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,160
- That's absolutely true
but it's lovely.

984
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,480
Well done. - Thank you.

985
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,480
- We did point out about the ice cream
being piped on as well on the top.

986
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,960
It's a risky thing to do.

987
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,560
It doesn't look the best, these...

988
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,520
- Yes. - ..I wouldn't have bothered
with.

989
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,800
- OK, I just didn't wan to present
something too simple.

990
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,040
That's what I didn't want to do.
- Let's have a look.

991
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,040
The textures are lovely.

992
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,000
Chocolate is nice and strong.

993
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,400
- Sponges are baked
beautifully as well.

994
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,240
It's akin to a tiramisu
which is what you set out.

995
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,520
It doesn't look the best thing
in the world. - I know.

996
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,960
- But I like the flavour. - Hmm.

997
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,560
So, do I. - Thank you.

998
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,880
Cool. - Very good.

999
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,920
- Well done.
- Cheers, thank you.

1000
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,520
Oh, I don't want to do it.

1001
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,720
- Very underwhelmed.

1002
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:38,880
- Did you know all the way along
that it wasn't going to freeze?

1003
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,960
- I had my suspicions because this
cassette tape idea was fairly new.

1004
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,480
Um, so it had been in a square
cake tin for a long time

1005
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,640
but without that around it,
it melted.

1006
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,560
- To be honest, I think the cassette
tape is a really witty

1007
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,040
and nice idea.

1008
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,120
But it's not an easy thing to model.
- No.

1009
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,760
- No, it's not, I did try
and say this morning.

1010
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,960
- You did try and say, yeah.

1011
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,776
- It would never work
in this temperature. - No.

1012
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,520
- Is it going to taste good?

1013
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,800
- I really hope so, I hope there's
some ice cream in there still.

1014
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,120
- Did you lose a lot of it?
- Yeah.

1015
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,400
- So, that looks nice.

1016
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,000
Chocolate ice cream is delicious.
- Thank you.

1017
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,200
- Absolutely delicious.

1018
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,320
- Is that meant to be cherry
ice cream at the top?

1019
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,440
- It's blackberry. Yeah.

1020
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,680
- Can't get any blackberry at all.
- OK.

1021
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,720
- I think it looks terrible.

1022
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,240
If it had tasted good, then you sort
of hang something on that. - Yeah.

1023
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,560
- But besides the puffed rice
down at the bottom,

1024
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,400
just not getting anything from it
at all, nothing.

1025
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,600
It's a shame.

1026
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,080
The meringue kisses look nice. - Yes.
- Thanks, Paul I'll take that.

1027
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,880
- It's all a bit of a, on a lean,
isn't it? - Yeah.

1028
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,840
It's my fault, I had issues.

1029
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,440
Didn't press the right button
on the old ice cream machine.

1030
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,560
So, I'm really, really sorry.
- Oh, what a pity.

1031
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,376
- I mean, you've managed to create
a cake though.

1032
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,496
Obviously the tempered chocolate,
you've lost all the shine.

1033
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,520
It is melting all the way down
the side

1034
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,040
but it's, it's what it tastes like
as well. - I'm sorry.

1035
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,120
- Remind us what the baked element is.

1036
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:35,320
- So, a chocolate sponge, a brownie
in the chocolate ice cream as well

1037
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,400
and then the meringue on top.
- Hmm.

1038
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,600
I think the ice cream's delicious.

1039
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,440
The praline, it's a lovely flavour.

1040
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,880
- Yeah, your ice creams are delicious,
it's just not frozen.

1041
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,080
The big issue I have is brownie.

1042
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,880
Why would you put
a brownie in the freezer?

1043
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,080
What's the key element that you
look for in a brownie?

1044
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,240
- It's fudgy.

1045
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,016
- You're never going to get
that in a million years

1046
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,760
if you put it in the fridge. - OK.
- The flavours are nice though.

1047
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,000
- It's a pity, Laura,
cos you so nearly were there.

1048
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,840
- I know, I'm sorry.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1049
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,120
- That could have been worse.

1050
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,680
Mine, quite frankly,
was an embarrassment.

1051
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,760
I should've listened,
I didn't, I took a risk.

1052
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,160
It did not pay off.

1053
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,920
- I mean, it looked
an absolute state.

1054
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,880
Yeah, if I get through, it'll be
literally by the skin of my teeth.

1055
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,560
- So, not quite as hot as yesterday.

1056
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,040
Still warm,
still a challenge to make ice cream.

1057
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,880
Who do you think really
excelled themselves?

1058
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,920
- I thought Hermine's was very clean,
very tidy, very neat.

1059
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,480
- And beautifully made.

1060
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,320
Every element of it was classic
and perfect.

1061
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,680
She's in line for Star Baker.
- I loved the mango!

1062
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,240
Yeah, she has to be. I think
Hermine. I would even say that

1063
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,440
Marc's pulled himself up into a
situation of Star Baker as well.

1064
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,960
- Well, you were very, very impressed

1065
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,160
when Marc presented his cake,
weren't you?

1066
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,400
- I mean, it was so ambitious.
- Who's at the bottom?

1067
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,760
- I actually think Dave saved himself
today with that tiramisu cake.

1068
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,720
- I think it's Lottie or Laura.
- Lottie's been quite erratic.

1069
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,280
She's either brilliant... - Yeah.
- ..or a bit chaotic. - Yeah.

1070
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,840
- And Laura's been in the bottom a
lot. - She's made a lot of mistakes.

1071
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,360
- Every Showstopper she's fighting to
stay in the competition.

1072
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,576
- She is. I think it's between
Lottie and Laura going home.

1073
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,720
- Well, well done to you
guys for choosing an ice cream cake

1074
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,720
challenge in one of the hottest
days of the year.

1075
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,440
- But we didn't know that, did we?
We didn't know that. - You knew.

1076
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,200
- We don't have higher information.

1077
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,320
- That is NOT what the
Daily Mail are gonna say.

1078
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,960
- They know, they know. Devious.

1079
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,080
Well done, bakers.
You've all worked very, very hard.

1080
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,080
And now, it's down to me

1081
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,960
to say which one of you
is Star Baker.

1082
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:16,840
All of you have been Star Baker
once, except Hermine.

1083
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,480
Until now! Congratulations.

1084
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,480
- Well deserved. - Yeah!

1085
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,480
- Ahhh! That means I've got the
horrible job

1086
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,680
of announcing the person
who's leaving us.

1087
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,280
This gets tougher.
It DOES get tougher

1088
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,560
cos you're all our little
buddies now.

1089
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,720
But the person
who is going home today...

1090
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,440
..is...

1091
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,760
..Lottie. Ah!

1092
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,000
- Don't be nice to me. - Cat face!

1093
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,080
Why, cat face?

1094
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,240
- I had to.

1095
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,160
- Who am I gonna muck about with now?

1096
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,240
- Just give me a minute.

1097
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,520
It's just, like, a massive relief

1098
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,880
but also, like, obviously, I'm
gutted to see everyone, like,

1099
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,760
not be with everyone every day.

1100
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,320
Honestly, it's been amazing.
It has been amazing.

1101
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,920
Can you stop crying please, Laura?

1102
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,120
- Thank you.

1103
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,600
- I think mixed emotions,
definitely, right now.

1104
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,360
Really happy I got through
but, yeah,

1105
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,560
Lottie is a really good friend.

1106
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,040
Beneath the, like, sarcastic, tough
exterior is actually a really

1107
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,400
kind, really, really funny,
really lovely human being.

1108
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,200
So, yeah, I, uh, I think at the
moment I just feel a bit sad

1109
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,200
that I've, I've lost Lottie.

1110
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,760
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you too.

1111
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,760
We'll have a whisky tonight,
it's fine.

1112
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,480
I literally packed two outfits.

1113
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,600
And I'm here in week seven,
wearing everyone else's clothes.

1114
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,080
I cannot believe the stuff that
I've done. I got a handshake,

1115
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,360
I got a Star Baker.
Like, I'm so chuffed with myself.

1116
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,120
And maybe I CAN bake.

1117
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,480
Maybe I can.

1118
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,840
- Hermine, well done.
- Thank you.

1119
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,480
- I was absolutely thrilled that
Hermine finally got Star Baker

1120
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,880
because, honestly, in a way, she's
deserved it two or three times

1121
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,680
before but she's just been
pipped by a tiny margin.

1122
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,040
- Well done! I'll miss you too.

1123
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,200
- It WAS a lovely thing to hear.

1124
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,760
Cherry on the icing.

1125
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:30,360
But, as they always say,
keep my head on my shoulder.

1126
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,920
And, uh, keep going.

1127
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,600
I know! Ohh!

1128
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,400
Check you out.

1129
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,600
You all right? - Yeah.
- Did you hear? - Yeah.

1130
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,440
- Ooh, you're happy for me?
- Yeah. - Oh, lovely.

1131
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,840
- I'm proud of you. - Oh!

1132
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,200
Next time...

1133
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,240
- Oh.

1134
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,360
- ..it's Dessert Week.

1135
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,280
- In she goes!

1136
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,520
- The bakers face a runaway Signature.

1137
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,240
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

1138
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,240
- A Technical that takes us
back in time....

1139
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,280
- I mean, does anybody even
eat this in 2020?

1140
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,760
- ..and they inject some artistic
flair into the Showstopper.

1141
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,800
- I call myself the Jelly Picasso.

1142
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,600
- Who will make it to the final four?

1143
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,240
- It all hangs on this.

1144
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,560
- And who will fall from grace?

1145
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,200
- Oh, help, help, help, help.

1146
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,640
Why is this so stressful?

1147
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,560
- Are you a Star Baker in the making?

1148
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,960
If you'd like to apply

1149
