1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,320
-Hello, it's Japanese Week.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,520
-Konnichi wa!
-What are you doing?

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,696
Why are you dressed like that?

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,360
-Well, you said come as
a mango character.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,160
-I said "a manga character".
It's Japanese Week.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
-Oh.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,200
-Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,120
You should take that off.
You look ridiculous.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,320
-No, I can't. It's stuck.
-Oh, dear!

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,616
You're going to have to spend
the rest of your career like that.

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,200
Old mango head. See you later!

12
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,120
-Bye.

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,520
Last time-

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,360
..the bakers constructed
pastry cages-- It's bonkers!

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,760
-..in one of the most fragile
challenges-

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,160
..the tent has ever seen.

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,280
Laura triumphed-

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,360
Laura!

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,760
..and won her first Star Baker.

20
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,816
-I'm still a bit in shock!

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,560
-Mark thought his dreams
had shattered-- Oh, damn it!

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,720
-..but it was Linda-

23
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,600
-The way it looks doesn't look good.

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,640
-..who was left broken-hearted.

25
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,640
-I've been like a child
at Disneyland, really.

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,360
One of the highlights of my life.

27
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,600
-Now-

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,680
-Cakes are boring.

29
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,440
-..it's Japanese Week-

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,936
-Well, that's a load of rubbish,
innit?

31
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,240
-I hate matcha.
You might as well just eat grass.

32
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,720
-It SMELLS nice-. Do you reckon? No.

33
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,520
..and the bakers
are letting off steam.

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
-Burger off, Lottie-. YOU burger off.

35
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,960
-As the pressure builds-

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,440
-Oh, don't give me that look!

37
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,320
-..to a spectacular
kawaii Showstopper-

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,560
-Can I do it?

39
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,120
-..who will light up the tent-

40
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,240
-It's lovely!

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,400
-..and who will be saying sayonara?

42
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,640
-It's cruel to say it's unedible,

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,480
but it's getting that way.

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,400
-It's Japanese Week!

45
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,360
Who would ever have thought
I'd make it this far?

46
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,840
-I'm very excited for Japanese Week.

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,600
I think it's a bit more creative,
a bit more free to do things,

48
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,240
and bring a bit of fun
to the baking tent.

49
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,216
-Because we're all doing
really different things

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,320
that are unfamiliar,

51
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,240
we all kind of feel like we're
on a pretty level playing field,

52
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,240
but there's a lot
that could go wrong.

53
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
Always.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,600
-Bakers, hello,

55
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,720
or should I say konnichi wa,

56
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,000
because for the first time ever,

57
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,480
it's Japanese Week.

58
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,920
-We're all very excited,

59
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,040
and the judges today
would love you to make

60
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,080
a batch of eight soft,
delicious steamed buns.

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,640
-Now, Japanese buns are usually
filled with pork or curry,

62
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,520
but you can choose any filling
you like, sweet or savoury.

63
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,080
Noel, what would you fill
your buns with?

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,160
-Human blood?

65
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,216
-Noel, this is a family show.

66
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
-Dog blood.

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,480
-Better.

68
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,880
You have two hours
and 30 minutes.

69
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
-On your marks-

70
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
-..get set-

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
-..and bake.

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,360
-The adrenaline has kicked in.

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,120
Steamed buns it is.

74
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,520
-It is Japanese Week,

75
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,600
so I wouldn't be surprised
if we didn't get

76
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,360
quite traditional Japanese fillings,

77
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,120
but we know what these bakers are
like. They always surprise us.

78
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,960
-Every cut that we do,
you must see the filling,

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,640
and we certainly must taste it.

80
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,400
On the bread side,
it must be a soft, chewy roll,

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,920
but not TOO chewy.

82
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,040
Initially, you feel a tug,
and then it melts in the mouth.

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,296
-Of course, the filling matters.

84
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,360
We want something delicious inside,
but this is a bun challenge.

85
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,856
-I'm feeling good
about Japanese Week.

86
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,200
Those are almost ready.
I'm adding turmeric to it

87
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,040
to die the dough yellow,

88
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,440
cos the plan is they're going to
look like little chickens.

89
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,440
-Naturally adding colour to his buns,
with turmeric,

90
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,440
Dave will then be filling them
with his favourite meal,

91
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,440
and one of Japan's most popular
Western-inspired foods,

92
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,920
the katsu curry.

93
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Cat poo curry? KatSU curry.

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
-Oh, katsu curry.

95
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,376
-And that's with raw chicken today.

96
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,240
I tested it in practice.

97
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,320
-Did you like that?

98
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,536
-What I was more worried about is
that it wasn't going to cook,

99
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,696
but I did cook within that time.

100
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,736
-And how long are you steaming
them for? 15 minutes.

101
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,696
-Good-. OK. All right, good luck.
Thank you, Dave.

102
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,920
-Cheers. Thank you.

103
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,640
-NOEL: Dave's won't be the only buns

104
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,640
to be making
an animal-like appearance.

105
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,080
-So I'm going to make them
look like little pandas.

106
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,040
I've gone for pandas
cos I think they look cute.

107
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,000
-I'm making little piggies,

108
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,200
like, little snouts and ears,

109
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,720
and sesame seeds for eyes.

110
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,680
It's quite a fun challenge,
I think, isn't it?

111
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,800
-I'm going to be making
my wee buns into wee lambs.

112
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,240
The lamb itself is going to be raw,

113
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,320
and that's going to be steamed
in with the bun,

114
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,400
and I've got garlic, ginger,
chilli, coriander,

115
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,920
fish sauce, soy sauce, honey, cumin.

116
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,840
It really packs a punch.

117
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,640
-Peter's lamb-shaped buns will be
filled with a spiced lamb mince,

118
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,800
herded together with a Chinese
stir-fry, packed with flavour.

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,520
-So how are you going to infuse
that flavour into the lamb?

120
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,600
-So I'm just going to stir-fry off,
like, the aromatics first,

121
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,120
and then that's going to be
added into the lamb

122
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,640
and mixed through
with the soy sauce and fish sauce.

123
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,880
-OK. How are you making them
into lambs, then?

124
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,680
-I split my dough into two,
so I've got a small portion here,

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,360
and I'm going to colour that black,

126
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,560
and then that's going to be used
for the face and for the ears.

127
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,840
Just cut out wee shapes.

128
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,640
They look really quite cute.

129
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,456
-Great-. Lovely-. Thank you.
-I hope you enjoy it.

130
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
-So do I.

131
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,736
-Just doing the window pane test.

132
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,976
If you can see light through it,

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,776
then it means that it's been worked
enough, so now it's ready to prove.

134
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,840
-The timing of the prove is vital
with this soft dough.

135
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,520
Under-prove and it will split-

136
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,560
-I would like it to about
double in size.

137
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,760
-..but over-prove
and it will collapse and be flat,

138
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,160
the opposite of the domed shiny buns
the judges are expecting to see.

139
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,880
-I'll wait for it to triple in size.

140
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,200
Get more flavour into it.

141
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,456
-After I've coloured this dough
and get it into proving,

142
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,160
then it's on to making the filling.

143
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,320
It's more Chinese-inspired
than it is Japanese-inspired.

144
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,360
In Japanese Week, that might not
be great, but it's delicious.

145
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,640
I've loved it.

146
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,680
-And Peter isn't the only baker
with an East Asian inspiration.

147
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,480
-The Japanese element of
it is the bun,

148
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,880
but this is probably more
traditional Chinese-flavoured pork.

149
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,696
I'm just going to fry it
for about 20 minutes.

150
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,880
Get it nice and crispy.

151
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,560
You can't put raw pork belly
in a steamed bun.

152
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,440
I think it would be
absolutely savage, to be honest!

153
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,360
-Laura is doubling up on her flavours
and decoration

154
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,480
with her eight little pigs,

155
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,400
built around pork belly
in a Chinese-style sticky sauce.

156
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,840
-Tell us about the sticky sauce.

157
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,560
-Some hoisin going in there,
some oyster sauce, some sake,

158
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,080
a bit of honey.

159
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,896
-Ticks all the boxes,
all the flavours, I'm going,

160
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,120
"Yep, yep, yep, yep".

161
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,496
-You've practised this? Yeah.

162
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,496
The filling's gone down
a real treat at home, so, yeah.

163
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,776
-Oh, good. Yeah, I think it will do
with me, as well, to be honest!

164
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,440
-Good!

165
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,040
-NOEL: Across the border from China,
lie the flavours of India,

166
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,480
via Marc's kitchen in Cornwall.

167
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,920
-The eldest daughter, Jasmine,
has got really into cooking,

168
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,200
and particularly into curries.

169
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,520
We tried a few curries
in these steamed buns,

170
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,600
and as soon as she made this dhal,

171
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,080
we sat down at a table, we all bit
into it and we all just went, Hmmmm!

172
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,800
So hence why it's called
the Hmmm Dhal Steamed Bun.

173
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,080
-Marc will be colouring
and flavouring his dough

174
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,080
with smoked paprika to complement

175
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,520
his two Indian flavours

176
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,760
of mango chutney

177
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,280
and apple-sweetened lentil dhal.

178
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,600
-Oh, it sounds lovely-. OK.

179
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,696
-Curry dhal, mango chutney-
-And I'm hoping to fold them

180
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,360
in the traditional way, as well.

181
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,360
-OK, how are you doing that, then?

182
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,440
-With great skill, hopefully.

183
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
-Great skill.

184
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,080
-While Marc will be trying to twist
together his vegetarian filling,

185
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,360
two of the bakers are doing their
twist on the all-time classic,

186
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,040
meat in a bun.

187
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
-So I'm doing burger buns.

188
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,880
-Oh, excellent.
-I'm using beef mince, gherkins,

189
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,496
er, cheese-- Oh, gherkin. Can you
do one without a gherkin, for me?

190
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,496
-What, do you not like gherkins?
-I don't like gherkins.

191
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,376
-Oh, no. Really?
OK, I'll do one without gherkins.

192
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,496
-Thanks, buddy-. All right.

193
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,800
-Never judge a man on his gherkins.
-Yeah, yeah.

194
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,480
-Mark is mixing together beef mince

195
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,440
with onion, cheese,

196
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,880
tomato puree and gherkins.

197
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,640
But after Paul's recent disclosure,
he's making an adjustment.

198
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,800
-So I'm doing a little one
without gherkins.

199
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,120
-For Paul? Yeah, for Paul.

200
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,680
-Wow! What is he, five?!

201
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,136
-It is a bit like that! Paul,
write down on here what you like.

202
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,256
I mean, he's supposed to be a judge,
a man of the world,

203
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,320
with an exquisite taste palate.

204
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,800
-Yeah-. Good luck-. Thank you.

205
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,160
Lottie's also doing a burger,
though, as well, isn't she?

206
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,400
-She's not as good as you.

207
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,280
I'm not going to lie.
She's lucky to still be here.

208
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,560
-My burgers are way better
than Lottie's.

209
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,720
Burger off, Lottie.

210
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,840
-YOU burger off.

211
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,640
-Oh, it's on!
Some healthy rivalry going on here.

212
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,720
-We've been saving that for ages.

213
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,320
Our techniques are slightly
different,

214
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,800
so he's frying his off,

215
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,960
I'm putting mine in raw,
but they're pretty similar.

216
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,360
So if Mark gets a handshake,

217
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,520
I'll be very happy for him.

218
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,440
-Lottie will be assembling her buns
in the traditional fashion,

219
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,640
by building layers of beef patty,

220
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,440
onions, cheese and bacon.

221
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,000
And to add to the burger feel,

222
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,120
she'll also be serving up
spiralised chips.

223
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,936
-And you're making chips, too? Yeah,
which obviously you won't eat but-

224
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,496
-PRUE: There might be a few
chip eaters.

225
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,736
-I think there might be, yeah.

226
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,080
-Are you doing any gherkin?

227
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,160
-Yeah-. Oh, Paul'll be delighted.

228
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,400
-Can you do one without a gherkin,
for me?

229
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,680
-Yeah, maybe-. Thank you.

230
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,336
-He hates gherkins-. Really? Yeah.

231
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,680
-Really hates it? Yeah.

232
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,880
-OK, no gherkin.

233
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,840
-The gherkin ain't workin'.

234
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,520
-Gherkin doesn't work for me!

235
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,920
-I'll give that a quick minute and
then I'm going to ad the water.

236
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,760
-In contrast to baking,
which dries the dough,

237
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,200
steaming raises
its moisture levels-

238
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,640
-If the sauce is too wet,
going into steamed buns,

239
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,040
it's really hard to keep
that sauce inside.

240
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,440
So I need to thicken it,
so it's more of a paste,

241
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,080
and then when it steams, that
sort of reintroduces liquid to it.

242
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,560
-..so any fillings with a high
liquid content could result

243
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,840
in soggy, undercooked buns.

244
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,000
-I need some oyster sauce.

245
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm trying to celebrate
Japan with my flavour.

246
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,160
The brief said Japanese bun,
so it's good inspiration.

247
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,560
I don't know what I'm doing HERE,
though.

248
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,920
-Going all in on the Japanese theme,

249
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,200
Hermine is aiming to achieve
a rich, umami taste to her pandas,

250
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,400
with Japanese-style spiced chicken,

251
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,080
dried shrimps
and shiitake mushrooms.

252
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,336
-How are you feeling about Japanese
Week, then, Hermine,

253
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,120
because you're probably one of the
most consistent of bakers, thus far?

254
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,600
-Well, thank you
for the vote of confidence,

255
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,280
but, erm, yeah, see, it was all a
new sort of learning journey for me,

256
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,160
but through my research,

257
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,600
I found Japanese baking had some
French influence in there-. Yeah.

258
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,320
-So I'm hoping to draw on
my knowledge of French patisserie.

259
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,040
-We have to see if it works.

260
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,656
-Yes! Thank you, Hermine.
Looking forward to it-. Thank you.

261
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,320
-Good luck-. Thank you.

262
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,720
Paul said I'm the most consistent
baker. Isn't that lovely?

263
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,640
Well, I better get back to work now,

264
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,680
before he takes that back!

265
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,000
-Bakers, you are halfway through!

266
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,360
And make sure it all works.
You don't want to look silly on TV.

267
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,040
-Right, I've got to check my dough.

268
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,440
-With the dough's coming
out of the proving drawer,

269
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,520
they must be separated and weighed
into equal amounts-

270
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
-I'm going to stick to what I did
in practice,

271
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,040
and they're going to each be
49 or 50g in weight.

272
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,200
-..in order to fulfil the uniformity
required by the brief.

273
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,040
-I'm not weighing the dough.

274
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,760
I'm just eyeballing the dough.

275
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,880
There's a lot of winging and
eyeballing that goes on in the tent!

276
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,520
-It's just like an assembly line
that I have set up,

277
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,160
so it goes, like, patty, bacon,
cheese, relish.

278
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,000
I've got to remember to do one
without relish for Paul.

279
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
-Cos I know what one
he's going to eat,

280
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,600
it almost makes
the pressure greater on that one!

281
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,400
-The fillings must be centralised
in the bun,

282
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,840
as too near the top or bottom
could see it split the tender dough

283
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,040
and pour out-

284
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,640
-I'd probably say you want about
two thirds filling, the rest dough.

285
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,280
That's how I like it, anyway.
I don't know if Paul will.

286
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,640
-..but adding too much filling could
yield the same disastrous results.

287
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,280
-A minor issue, that I've been
too generous in filling

288
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,520
the first seven buns,
and have run out of mixture,

289
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,960
so I'm doing a bit of a slapdash
final mixture.

290
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,120
Hopefully I can persuade the judges
to move away from that one.

291
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,160
-Tricky moment-. Wrapping it up.
-This is wear it gets tricky.

292
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,720
-Oh, tricky,
I can see what you're saying.

293
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,640
Yeah, it's like putting jam
in a cowboy hat.

294
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,240
It's not really working out, is it?

295
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,336
-This is the bit that
I don't really know how to do,

296
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,480
if I'm being honest.

297
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,240
There's probably a technique.
What it is, I don't know.

298
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,400
-It has not closed properly!

299
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,720
-I have to be precise.

300
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,600
The competition's stepped up,

301
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,960
but Mark's not doing chips, so-

302
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,280
-Chips? Did they ask for chips?

303
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,240
-Who doesn't want chips, mate?

304
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,360
-Are you doing steamed chips?

305
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
-Yeah, I'm doing steamed chips, yeah.

306
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,960
-It's all about the decoration now,

307
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,760
so I need to get everything
all together.

308
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,040
-Once the bakers have added
their distinctive decorations,

309
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,920
it's full steam ahead.

310
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,320
-So these are the little
snouts for my little piggies.

311
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
-SHE MAKES PIGGY NOISES

312
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,480
-I feel like I'm going to get
a lot of hate online

313
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,200
from vegetarians worldwide for this.

314
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,496
-I've got to wrap this around
the outside of the steamed bun

315
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,920
just to represent the patty
in the middle.

316
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,720
-The water's actually boiling now.

317
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,240
I'll get that ready
to start steaming these.

318
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,640
Make sure there's enough space
in between each of them.

319
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,720
-They will obviously expand and rise
throughout, so too close together,

320
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,320
then they will touch
and be stuck together.

321
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,960
-That's the last one.

322
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,456
-Right, so we're going to
put those on.

323
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,400
-Once the lid is on the steamer,
it needs to remain airtight-

324
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,120
-They need 15 minutes,
so I'll give them until the end.

325
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,600
-..so the bakers won't discover
how successful their buns are

326
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,520
until they're ready to come out.

327
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
-Waiting now.

328
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,080
-Bakers, you only have
ten minutes left.

329
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,440
That sounded like me.

330
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
MATT MOUTHS: I know.

331
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,440
-Well, that's good, cos I've got
nine minutes left on my bake.

332
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,400
-Just like The Chamber Of Secrets.

333
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,400
I just hope they're cooked.

334
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,496
-Patience is a virtue,
but I always lift it in practice,

335
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,960
and now I'm a bit worried that
because I lift it in practice,

336
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,360
that's how long the cooking time is,
based on me lifting it.

337
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,640
-Is this your thing,
Japanese business?

338
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,136
-I mean, I am having fun this week.

339
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,760
I just like it being
a bit different.

340
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,720
-Yeah, exactly-. Cakes are boring.

341
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,240
-Let's both say that
into the camera.

342
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,640
BOTH:- Cakes are boring.

343
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,960
-OK? So, enough with the cakes.

344
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,920
-Very plump sheep.

345
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,000
-Yeah.

346
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,800
-They look ready
when they've popped.

347
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,600
-Good God. They've puffed up.

348
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,600
-Bakers, you have one minute left!

349
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,800
One minute.

350
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,480
-They're coming out,
they're coming out.

351
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,320
-Just a case of going for it,
I think.

352
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,720
-Whoa! We've got some big piggies.

353
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,840
-Ooh.

354
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,120
-P for Paul right here,
the one without gherkins.

355
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,320
-OK, let's get these ones in.

356
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,560
-God, they're hot!

357
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,080
-They're looking good.

358
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,920
-I THINK they look like pandas.

359
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,200
-Happy with them.

360
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,080
-Oh, they don't look very good.

361
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,360
Poor little piggy.

362
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,720
-OK, bakers, your time is up.

363
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,600
Please step away
from your delicious buns.

364
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,200
-They look good.

365
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,520
Look like little burgers. Nice.

366
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,480
-Mark's are better than mine. Livid.

367
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,400
-MATT:- It's time for the bakers'
steamed buns

368
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,320
to face the judgment of
Paul and Prue.

369
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,280
-Hi, Hermine-Hi, Hermine.

370
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,440
-You need bigger eyes for the pandas.

371
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,720
-Panda-ish.

372
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,200
-They're nearly even.

373
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,120
-It's a little untidy on the shaping.

374
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,640
You know, on the side?
But they're not bad.

375
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,960
-It's not dead in the middle.

376
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,240
-It's mainly bread.

377
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,960
There's an arch there of flavour.

378
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,960
-I love it. I think the bread is
soft

379
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,200
but it's a little bit chewy,
which is lovely.

380
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,960
And the filling is just delicious.

381
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,056
-Thanks-. It tastes very good.
It's full of flavour.

382
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,160
It packs a punch in the little bit
that you do have.

383
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,080
And the bun is actually
beautifully baked.

384
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,360
The shaping could have been a
little bit neater,

385
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,760
but the flavour is very, very good.

386
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,280
Thank you, Hermine-. Thank you.

387
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,520
-Lovely.

388
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,160
-Well, you've managed to achieve a
nice, smooth top, actually.

389
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,320
A bit of a shine on it.

390
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,200
You've got some sesame,
some have fallen off.

391
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,560
-Well, that one there doesn't have
the gherkins in it.

392
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,960
So I wanted to make sure-
-I love sesame seed.

393
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,520
-Oh, sorry. I wanted to make sure!

394
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,600
-Nice filling. It's in the middle.

395
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,720
-It's got a nice, bready look.
-Good flavour.

396
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,120
The burger bit is quite dry.

397
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,016
-A bit of mayonnaise, tomato ketchup
in there,

398
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,720
that would have softened it
a little bit.

399
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,440
But, actually, the taste is good and
the bun is very, very good.

400
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,880
It's slightly chewy.

401
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,600
You've got that smooth top.
-It's soft.

402
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,840
-But it is baked all the way through.
-Good.

403
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,280
-Simple, but highly effective.

404
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,680
-Thank you very much.

405
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,256
-Obviously you've had a few issues
with the dough.

406
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,440
It's seeping through.

407
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,360
You've probably got too much filling
in there.

408
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,560
That's what it looks like.

409
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,000
They're all a bit irregular, but
that's down to the filling.

410
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,280
You can see the arch, which I don't
really mind,

411
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,080
but you can see why it's broken
through.

412
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,040
-Yeah-. It's so close to the outside.

413
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,600
It was always going to burst
through,

414
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,800
but your bread looks good.

415
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,600
-That looks really good bread,
doesn't it?

416
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,720
It smells fantastic.

417
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,960
-It tastes lovely.

418
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,960
It's a bit dry, but it
tastes beautiful.

419
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,200
-The flavour's wonderful.

420
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,400
The meat is tough.

421
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,560
The bit of sticky sauce is lovely
but you need more of it.

422
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,400
-Very, very dry, but very, very
beautiful.

423
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,880
-Well, I think they look absolutely
lovely.

424
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,416
-Thank you-. They've obviously touched
a bit in the steamer,

425
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,960
but that's because they're so big.

426
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,336
-I think they are too big.
-Yeah.

427
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,056
-You've lost the shape a little bit.
-Yeah.

428
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,200
-But the colour looks good.
Decoration looks good.

429
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,480
-Thank you-. Right down at the bottom
on the filling.

430
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,640
-Yeah.

431
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,160
-It tastes great.

432
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,480
It's a lentil dhal, is it?

433
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,800
-Yes, lentil and apple.

434
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,121
-But you've still got a little bit
of bite in the apple.

435
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,960
It's unusual.

436
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,816
-The paprika works really well with
the curry

437
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,960
going through the middle.

438
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,760
It could have overwhelmed it
and it hasn't.

439
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,080
So you are carrying flavour.

440
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,840
My only issue is the size.
-Sure, yeah.

441
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,400
-I don't mind them being too big.

442
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,760
But then I'm greedy.

443
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,120
-PAUL LAUGHS
-They look great.

444
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,520
I love the addition of the colour.

445
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,320
You've got a little bit of marking
on there.

446
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,480
-Yeah, I wasn't happy-

447
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,720
-Where the fillings are trying to
pull through.

448
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,880
They're very neat, very bold,
well shaped,

449
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,200
nice and shiny, smooth.

450
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,440
So, you have this arch again of
flavour-. Yes.

451
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
Yeah.

452
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,360
-I love the chicken.

453
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,720
I think the texture's great.

454
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,360
The bread is lovely.

455
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,640
Either I needed a bit more filling
or a bit stronger.

456
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,600
More curry, really-. Yeah.

457
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,536
-I don't know. I think they are very,
very good.

458
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,800
And you've managed to get the
flavour in the arch as well

459
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,720
all the way through.
That's delicious.

460
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,480
My only gripe is it's coming
through.

461
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,256
-Yeah, that's what I don't like.
-Thank you.

462
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,360
-Thank you-Cheers.

463
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,976
-Can you see these little creases?

464
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,880
They're air pockets that have shrunk
back in.

465
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,080
That's to do with the way you've
tightened the ball up,

466
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,720
but they do look round.

467
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,880
Beautifully aromatic.

468
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,960
The problem is you've not tightened
it up around the meat.

469
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,280
So it's pulled away, and what you're
left with

470
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,800
is very little dough.

471
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,120
There's actually more meat than
there is dough.

472
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,840
-Too much filling? -Yeah.

473
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,800
-That tastes absolutely wonderful.

474
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,000
I love the flavour.

475
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,800
-I think your flavours are great.

476
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,360
Just watch the buns.

477
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,480
-This one's for Paul-OK.

478
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,400
-It doesn't have gherkins in the
relish.

479
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,080
-They all seem pretty similar in
size.

480
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,880
The little bit of decoration
is quite nice.

481
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,440
That looks like a burger,
doesn't it?

482
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,960
-It does! Bacon, cheese, burger
and relish.

483
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It just has to taste good now,
Lottie.

484
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,960
-It's like having a burger -
a dry burger -

485
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,560
but nevertheless a burger.

486
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,880
The flavour is spot on.

487
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,280
-It went in raw, didn't it?
-Yeah-. Mm.

488
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,360
-I think it's really difficult to do,
if you're steaming,

489
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,960
get it really cooked at the outside
and still rare in the middle.

490
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,056
-You probably need a little bit more
fat in the meat.

491
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,760
Nevertheless, the flavour's
excellent.

492
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,080
The way the bun wraps around
the filling-

493
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,896
-They're beautiful.
-It's a beautiful bun.

494
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,136
-Well done, Lottie.
-Thank you.

495
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,200
-Thank you-Thanks.

496
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,440
I'm really pleased with that.

497
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,120
I think I got away with it,
considering.

498
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,416
He said mine was dry, but if he'd
eaten it with the relish

499
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,800
then it wouldn't have been dry.

500
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,240
I was too scared to say it to
his face.

501
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,480
-I'm chuffed that it's come off
this morning.

502
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,080
But I've been in this position
before,

503
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,400
where I've had a good Signature

504
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,400
and then it's sort of all gone wrong
after that.

505
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,080
So I want to just keep that momentum
and really push through

506
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,520
with the next two challenges now.

507
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
-I'm disappointed to have got
bad feedback,

508
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,280
but I think, going into the
Technical,

509
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,560
you can always pull it back.

510
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,760
I've been relatively good at them
in the past,

511
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,080
so hopefully that's going to
continue today.

512
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,760
-NOEL: With mystery ingredients
shrouded in gingham,

513
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,200
the bakers can only guess what fate
awaits them

514
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,920
in the Technical Challenge.

515
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,800
Hello, bakers. It's time for your
Technical Challenge,

516
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,880
which today has been set for you by
the lovely Prue.

517
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,200
Prue, any words of advice?

518
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,840
-When you read this recipe,

519
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,680
do not panic.

520
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,280
There's nothing in there that you
haven't done before.

521
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,120
-Well, as ever, this challenge
is judged blind.

522
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,960
So we'd like to ask Paul and Prue
to leave the tent.

523
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,160
-She said don't panic.

524
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,320
That definitely means panic.

525
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,400
-Prue would like you each to make a
matcha crepe cake.

526
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,960
This is comprised of 12 matcha
filled crepes

527
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,840
stacked one on top of the other.

528
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,080
-They need to be layered with
strawberries

529
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,960
and a white chocolate ganache
buttercream

530
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,160
and decorated and topped with
fresh fruit

531
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,680
and edible flowers.

532
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,440
-You have two hours.

533
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,680
On your marks.

534
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,960
-Get set.

535
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,120
-Bake.

536
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,400
-Macha crepe cake - yeah, I've not
heard of it.

537
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,840
I've not even heard of making a cake
out of crepes before.

538
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,760
-Not what I expected, but crepes!

539
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,560
I mean, like, what could possibly
go wrong with crepes?

540
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,400
So, Prue, you've chosen a matcha
crepe cake.

541
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,840
It looks unusual from the outside,

542
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,480
but when you cut into it you go,
"Wow!"

543
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,600
It's striking, isn't it?
-Yeah, it's pretty.

544
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,920
-You can see the buttercream.

545
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,776
-And the crepes are really thin,
aren't they?

546
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,120
-They are-. And then VERY thin slices
of strawberry.

547
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,600
-The strawberries really lift it.

548
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,480
You do get a matcha flavour.

549
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,960
-The bitterness of the matcha sort
of cuts the sweetness

550
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,080
of the white chocolate ganache
buttercream.

551
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,776
-Yeah, I agree. Where do you think
the bakers are going to go wrong?

552
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,360
Because I can see a few things -
consistency being one.

553
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,960
-Yeah, they do need to make them
thin crepes

554
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,960
or they won't get 11 out of the
mixture.

555
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,680
And, also, where the bakers may be
in real trouble is,

556
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,840
if they take ages doing the
layering,

557
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,120
they won't get it set.

558
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,680
-I think it's a great challenge.

559
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,136
-I think we should stop eating this.

560
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,080
We've got to eat another seven
of them.

561
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,280
-That's true.

562
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,960
-For the batter, pour the milk into
the pan with the sugar

563
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,600
and cook over a low heat.

564
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,760
-Step two, whisk in the eggs followed
by the butter.

565
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,480
-This is matcha powder.

566
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,720
I actually hate matcha.

567
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,200
You might as well just eat grass.

568
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,520
-Smells nice.

569
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,920
-Do you reckon?! -No.

570
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,000
-Mm, delicious! Look at that!

571
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,760
It looks so weird.

572
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,040
-Are you a matcha fan?

573
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,760
-Well, as a drink, yes.

574
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,120
It's very good for you.

575
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,600
It has a load of antioxidants.

576
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,800
-Oh, good. Because I HATE oxidants.

577
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,960
I am totally antioxidants.

578
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,680
-For the filling, melt the chocolate
and cream together

579
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,160
and then make a Swiss meringue.

580
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,240
-A Swiss meringue? I've circled
that.

581
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,720
I don't know how to do that.

582
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,680
It's something to do with hot sugar.

583
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,200
I think it is hot sugar.

584
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,680
-The principle's to heat up
your eggs and sugar

585
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,680
over a bain-marie whilst whisking

586
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,680
so that the sugars all dissolve

587
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,960
and the eggs are getting nice and
frothy.

588
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,560
-It is thickening up.

589
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,040
But I've got a nasty feeling

590
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,160
I'm looking for a particular
temperature.

591
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,720
Absolutely no idea what that
would be.

592
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,920
-I think it looks good.

593
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,760
It's got peaks, it's holding its
shape.

594
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,960
I'm going to go with it.

595
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,600
-In a separate bowl, whisk the butter
until light and fluffy.

596
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,056
I'm going to do that in this bad boy

597
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,000
because I think whisking butter
is no mean feat.

598
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,080
-I think we should start with a new
butter.

599
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,320
Take two.

600
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,616
-I mean, that's pretty light and
fluffy,

601
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,320
so I'm going to add chocolate
ganache now.

602
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,520
-Then add the meringue.

603
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,080
-Do I whisk in the meringue?

604
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,760
Do I fold in the meringue?

605
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,760
-I'm folding the meringue to keep
the air in.

606
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,640
-I'm going to whisk in the meringue.

607
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,320
-Slice the strawberries wafer thin.

608
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,641
-Do you know, I'm quite excited for
slicing strawberries

609
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,120
cos that's something I understand.

610
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,320
-MARK:- Is that too thick?

611
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,600
-Yeah.

612
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,960
-It's as wafer thin as my sausage
fingers can get it, all right?

613
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,440
She's just annoyed because I beat
her in the burgers earlier.

614
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,560
-MARK LAUGHS

615
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,840
-OK, bakers, you are halfway through.

616
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,160
Cupcake? No, I'm fine.

617
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,280
-Make one crepe using the 30
centimetre pan.

618
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,960
-This is all about precision.

619
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,960
The crepes have all got to be the
same thickness and colour.

620
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,720
Whether that's what they get-

621
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,480
-Is that batter for 12 pancakes?
-Apparently.

622
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,136
So they're going to be VERY thin.
-They're going to be very thin.

623
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,640
But that's pretty good, isn't it?
-Yeah, for a crepe.

624
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,480
-Yeah. Paul's gone for a
crepe, actually.

625
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,840
-I'm not too sure how long it needs.

626
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,040
I'm just going to obviously make
sure it doesn't burn.

627
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,680
Where this will be the top layer,
I want it to look good.

628
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,640
-Can I flip that?
-No. Please don't do that.

629
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,376
-You're not going to use that one,
are you?

630
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,120
Oh, sorry.

631
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,040
-Just how the hell do you get that
out without it all breaking up?

632
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,000
-Lottie, there's something in the
instructions

633
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,080
that says you've got to flip your
matcha pancakes.

634
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,840
-I just don't think that's accurate,
Noel.

635
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,280
-No? No.

636
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,976
-I don't think you're supposed to be
using

637
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
your grubby fingers, are you?
-Look, it's stuck!

638
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,400
-Oh, crumbs.

639
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,480
This fellow broke,

640
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,960
so rather than his destiny being a
large pancake,

641
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,880
he's going to become a small
pancake.

642
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,880
-I think they need to be
a little thinner.

643
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,600
I'm a little worried I might not
have enough mix.

644
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,480
-Round two at the big boy.

645
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,240
-I think I know where you're going
wrong.

646
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,960
You need to flip them. Yeah?
-Yeah.

647
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,720
-Will you flip?
-I will flip.

648
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,080
-Will you? -I will flip.

649
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,800
-Oh, my God! -I know.

650
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,960
-He's going to flip it! Peter's going
to flip!

651
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,720
Come on, flip that baby and catch it
in the pan.

652
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,960
I meant, like, with one hand.

653
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,520
You know, like-
-With one hand?

654
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,240
-No? Definitely not.

655
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,800
No chance.

656
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,280
-Using the 24 centimetre pan,
make 11 further crepes.

657
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,960
The challenge is getting the right
amount of crepes out.

658
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,880
-Well, that's a load of rubbish,
isn't it?

659
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,240
-You need to flip it like a
traditional pancake.

660
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,200
-If I did it and there's only
11 layers when I present it,

661
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,960
do I just say "Noel made me flip a
pancake?"

662
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,080
-So mathematical! Why don't you let
that all go?

663
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,880
Just trust the laws-?

664
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
-Five done, this is number six.

665
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,880
It's going to be really close,
actually.

666
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,440
-Go on, go on!

667
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,760
-No-. Oh!

668
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,120
You were virtually flipping it!

669
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,200
-I'm worried there's not going to be
enough mixture, you know?

670
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,240
-Can I make this stretch?

671
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,160
Oh, come on! Come on!

672
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,640
-Come on.

673
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,200
That's quite thick. Go on!

674
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,040
Yes!

675
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,520
The winner, right here.

676
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,760
The winner!

677
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,520
-Five, six, seven.

678
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,960
I don't think I'm going to have
enough, actually.

679
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,400
I'll do as many as I can.

680
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,800
-Yeah, that's never going to make
enough, is it?

681
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,320
Great.

682
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,240
-TOGETHER: Bakers, you have half an
hour left.

683
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,520
-To assemble, cut two long strips of
baking paper

684
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,600
50 centimetres by 10 centimetres,
and arrange them as a cross.

685
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,560
-Place to largest crepe in the
centre of the paper cross,

686
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,880
spoon filling on top

687
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,200
and spread evenly.

688
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,776
-Place one of the smaller crepes in
the centre of the large crepe

689
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,080
and spread with the filling.

690
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,520
-Add in a layer of strawberries
between each layer

691
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,760
of two crepes.

692
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,640
So-

693
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,080
Bit hard to compute.

694
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,200
-Crepe, butter, yeah.

695
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,920
So now it's buttercream, yeah.

696
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,360
And then strawberries.

697
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,240
-I feel like I need to work much
quicker.

698
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,800
-Let's do one more strawberry layer.

699
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,720
This isn't a layer now.
This is puree.

700
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,960
-That's the last crepe.

701
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,496
-Hold the ends of the paper cross
and, using them as a handle,

702
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,680
lift the cake into the centre
of the bowl.

703
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,040
-This is terrifying.

704
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,200
-Slip the strips of paper from under
the cake.

705
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,360
-Well, that's easier said than done,
isn't it?

706
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,760
-What I think I'm going to do is
leave the greaseproof in.

707
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,960
-That's just all collapsed
at one side.

708
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,480
That is a mess.

709
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,280
-Place in the freezer to set.

710
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,960
-I don't think I can fix that side
cos it's all tucked underneath.

711
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,160
I just need to get it in the fridge
now.

712
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,840
-MARC SIGHS

713
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,480
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

714
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,440
Ten minutes.

715
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,880
-Turn the cake out and dust with
matcha powder,

716
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,920
and decorate with a crescent of
fruit and edible flowers.

717
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,000
-That doesn't look too bad.

718
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,320
-Ooh, look at that bit!

719
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,960
It just looks so shoddy,
the sides of it.

720
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,520
-Do you know what? I mean, it's not
Japanese great,

721
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,960
but it's all right.

722
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,800
-Oh, it looks horrendous, doesn't it?

723
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,560
Fill the crevices with matcha
powder.

724
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,680
-Crescent-

725
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,960
-What's a crescent of fruit?

726
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,120
-Crescent is, like, half, isn't it?

727
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,360
I knew that.

728
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,360
-OK, sure, sure.

729
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,280
-Bakers, you have one minute left.

730
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,840
-I don't know what a crescent is
so I've gone four seasons.

731
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,560
-Am I not just loving this?

732
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,960
-BEEP.

733
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,520
-Bakers, your time is up.

734
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,800
-Looks like a crepe cake.

735
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,360
Game, set, matcha.

736
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,960
Please bring your mille crepe cakes
to the front

737
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,640
and place them behind your
photograph.

738
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,800
-That was not my best work.

739
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,240
-Paul and Prue are expecting an
exquisitely decorated

740
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,240
mille crepe cake containing 14
delicate layers

741
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,960
of matcha-filled crepes,

742
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,120
smooth white chocolate buttercream
and wafer-thin strawberries.

743
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,680
-Shall we start with that one?

744
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,720
-The semicircle of fruit and flowers
looks OK.

745
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,280
-It's not perfectly enfolded.

746
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,520
-Yeah, it's not tucked in.

747
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,600
Should we have a look and see what
it's like inside?

748
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,160
-The strawberries are a little bit
too thick.

749
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,880
They need to be really thin,

750
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,320
otherwise they get very wet
and slidy

751
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,640
and it all falls to bits.

752
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,200
-But, actually, the flavour's not too
bad at all.

753
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,440
Right, moving on.

754
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,360
There's a lot going on. We didn't
want the whole thing covered.

755
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,800
-Yeah, we did ask for a semicircle.

756
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,480
-Let's have a look inside.

757
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,080
The ganache looks OK.

758
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,920
The strawberries are nice and thin.

759
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,960
You get that white chocolate,
don't you?

760
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,056
-It's very nice. It's just not very
well decorated.

761
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,280
-No, it's not.

762
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,720
OK, moving on to number three.

763
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,680
A full circle of flowers.

764
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,960
It's a bit of a mess around the
outside as well.

765
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,160
Lots of layers here. It's nice and
neat, though.

766
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,440
The inside is better than the
outside.

767
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,280
Ganache is OK, strawberries are
nice and light as well.

768
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,560
This isn't too bad.

769
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,440
It's a bit neater around outside.

770
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,280
But they've got too much coconut
on the top.

771
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,160
You want to celebrate the matcha,
not the coconut.

772
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,520
Cuts well.

773
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,440
It's pretty neat.

774
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,600
-It tastes good, and the ganache
is delicious.

775
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,960
-It's nice and silky smooth.

776
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,480
-OK.
-Now, I quite like this one.

777
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,800
-Yes. I mean, that's what it should
look like.

778
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,600
-Let's have a look.

779
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,840
-Very nice.

780
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,816
-Your flavour's good, ganache is
good-. Delicious.

781
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,040
-And I like the look of that one.
-Yeah, very good.

782
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,840
OK, this one's a little small.
-This looks a bit sad.

783
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,360
It is a bit small. It's very thin.

784
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,440
Let's have a look inside here.

785
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,520
You see, that's hardly got any
layers in there.

786
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,640
I'm only counting a handful.
They're very thick.

787
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,080
Because the crepe are a bit thick,

788
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,520
they're too chewy.

789
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,280
All right, moving onto the last one.

790
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,960
It's a bit of a mess around
the outside.

791
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,440
It's a bit mottled, isn't it?

792
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,960
There's not many in there either.

793
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,600
Very thick layers, aren't they?

794
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,880
They've got a lot of filling because
they lack the pancakes.

795
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,480
-Well! That's going to be
interesting judging.

796
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,400
-Prue and Paul will now rank the
mille crepe cakes

797
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
from worst to first.

798
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,000
-So, in seventh place we have
this one.

799
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,960
It tasted very good.

800
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,600
But, Laura, you know the problem.

801
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,120
There weren't enough crepe.

802
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,800
-In sixth spot we have this one.

803
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,240
Who's is this?

804
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,520
Just lack of crepes, really.

805
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,920
And the size of your strawberries
needs to be much thinner.

806
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
-OK.

807
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,080
-In fifth place, we have this one.

808
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,280
It's just very ugly at the side.

809
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,720
And the strawberries were a bit
too big

810
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,200
so they've leaked.

811
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,760
-Hermine is fourth.

812
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,880
And Dave is third.

813
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,040
-And in second spot we have this one.

814
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,920
Lottie, it's not bad at all.

815
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,920
Didn't need the coconut on the top,
but the inside looks pretty nice.

816
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,680
-Which leaves-

817
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,600
..Peter.

818
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,120
Lovely, thin strawberry slices,
excellent buttercream,

819
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,520
neatly done, perfect flowers and
crescents.

820
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,720
It's a model.

821
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,840
-APPLAUSE

822
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,120
-I felt right at the bottom of the
pile this morning,

823
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,040
so really needed a strong
performance, there.

824
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,240
Absolutely chuffed.

825
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,040
Yeah, a very nice way to end
the day.

826
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,680
I think I'll sleep a little bit
easier tonight.

827
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,760
-Disappointed. I wanted to do better
than that.

828
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,960
It is hard now. The differences
between all of us

829
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,160
is so minuscule,

830
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,200
but fifth out of seven is definitely
towards the bottom.

831
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,960
-Someone's got to come last,
haven't they?

832
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,760
You bake well when doing things you
love,

833
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,320
and I had no love for matcha.

834
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,720
I just don't really fancy eating or
making a swamp.

835
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,560
Going to have to pull it out of the
bag tomorrow, aren't I?

836
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,560
-Just the Showstopper Challenge
remains before we discover

837
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:13,360
who will be Star Baker and who will
be saying sayonara to the tent.

838
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,560
-So, Paul, you were
recently in Japan.

839
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,600
How are you finding the bakers'
Japanese offerings?

840
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,400
-I was quite surprised
how good they all were.

841
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,080
It's quite difficult to do
steamed buns properly.

842
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,040
-The mille crepe matcha cake.
-That wasn't bad either.

843
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,960
-They mostly achieved it.

844
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,080
-I mean, overall, all the cakes
tasted pretty good.

845
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,000
I think coming
into the Showstopper today,

846
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,680
Lottie and Dave were doing really
well so far in both challenges.

847
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,640
And they are definitely
in line for Star Baker.

848
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,400
But then, down at the bottom,
and it's not nice to say, is Laura.

849
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,160
Because Laura struggled
in the sig.

850
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,720
She also was last in the technical.

851
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,960
In the middle, Hermine and Mark L.

852
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,720
They could float down or up.

853
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,880
And what's really odd is sometimes,
as a judge, you've got

854
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,880
to take your opinions on a flavour,
for instance, that you may not

855
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,400
particularly like.
-You don't like matcha.

856
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,576
-No, I don't particularly
like matcha-. Or gherkins.

857
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,040
You don't like green food, we've
noticed? No, that's true.

858
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,960
-I don't like hardly any food.
So I'd be a bad judge, right?

859
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,080
I'm all about the eyes.

860
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,000
I like looking at things, but I
don't want to put them in my mouth.

861
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,320
-That's a very odd thing to say.

862
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,920
-LAUGHTER

863
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,440
-Good morning, bakers, welcome
back to the tent

864
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,920
for your Showstopper Challenge.

865
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,080
Today, the judges would
like you each to make

866
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,280
a spectacular kawaii cake.

867
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,800
-Kawaii is a style rooted
in Japanese culture

868
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,680
that means all things cute
and charming.

869
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,520
Cute and Charming. That's
our double act name, isn't it?

870
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,280
-Oh, I thought we were Little
and Often-. Oh, yeah. We are.

871
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,600
-Now your flavours, type of sponge
and decoration should take

872
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,080
their inspiration
from Japanese cuisine.

873
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,640
-How long they got?

874
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,040
-Oh, they have four hours-. Woo.

875
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,200
On your marks-. Get set-. Bake!

876
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,760
-So many eggs.

877
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Kawaii means cute in Japanese.

878
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,680
I'm really taking that word and
running with it with this one.

879
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,280
-Today's Showstopper, think
animation. Think cartoon.

880
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,200
Traditionally in Japan, they'll be
using something like an angel cake

881
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,320
or a chiffon cake.
So very light.

882
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,760
-It would be nice to see the bakers
think about Japanese flavours

883
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,480
like yuzu, matcha or sake.

884
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,640
-And we've asked the bakers,
the highly decorate it.

885
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,600
We want the cake to
have lots of colour.

886
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,960
We want to be quite vibrant, quite
neat, sharp, professional,

887
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,040
but it's got to look cute
and taste good.

888
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,440
Hello, Mark-. Hello-. Hi.

889
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,680
Tell us all about your kawaii cake.

890
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,720
-So I'm making an avocado cake,
so it's going to be two avocado

891
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,800
halves decorated with an emoji,
kawaii style.

892
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,440
They'll have little emotions
on their faces, like Japanese

893
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,760
characters, almost.
-I'm loving this idea.

894
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,400
Using avocado chiffon sponges,
green fondant

895
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,920
and buttercream filling.

896
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,560
Mark is going to bring
two avocados to life,

897
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,040
who will also be proud parents.

898
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,520
-The stone of one of them
will be tempered milk chocolate

899
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,280
filled with baby avocados.

900
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
-Wow.

901
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:22,040
-Getting in touch with your feminine
side, making little avocado babies.

902
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,120
-Good luck. Thank you, Mark.
-Thank you.

903
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,280
-Not only must the bakers create
cute cartoon characters

904
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,120
in their kawaii cakes-

905
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,920
-It's going to taste
of toasted soy bean.

906
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,840
-..The judges also expect a delicious
balance of Japanese flavours.

907
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,400
-So I've gone for matcha. Matcha
is highly used in Japan.

908
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,080
Also, there's rose water.
Matcha's very earthy.

909
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,360
So it's a floral flavour to
complement it.

910
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,480
-Dave's kawaii cake will be filled

911
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,160
with chocolate sponge, matcha
and rose sponge

912
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,680
and decorated in tribute to
his best friend.

913
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,600
-My dog is Japanese-. He is, isn't he?

914
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,440
-He's a Japanese Shiba Inu.

915
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,320
My dog's name is Yoki,
which is shortly for Yokohama.

916
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,800
It's a Japanese city-. Oh!

917
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,200
-And Dave is not the only baker
inspired by a canine companion.

918
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,080
-I'll making a cake in the form
of my little dog, Hamish.

919
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,000
A border terrier, very cheeky.

920
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,440
Incredibly naughty, but very
friendly and a bit cute.

921
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,160
-Hoping his dog will be best in show
Mark's border terrier Hamish

922
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,560
will be brought to life in a lemon
Swiss meringue buttercream layered

923
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,240
between two sponges, one honey
and tahini, the other ginger

924
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,200
and soy bean powder.
-How is it going to look like a dog?

925
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,840
-Using different coloured fondant
to make the eyes, ears and nose.

926
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,640
-The weight of the fondant, do you
not find concertinas up?

927
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,280
-In practice, no.
It seems to be OK.

928
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,040
-The bakers need to think carefully
about their choice of sponge.

929
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,496
-For as tall as the cake is going to
be, they need to be sturdy.

930
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,120
They need to hold their shape
and hold the filling in there.

931
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,360
-If they're too dense,
they'll be unpleasant to eat.

932
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,640
-The cake itself is called
a castella cake.

933
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,520
It's a fairly robust cake.

934
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,840
The texture is kind
of like a kitchen sponge.

935
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,480
-If they're too light, they may
buckle under the weight

936
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,720
of their decorations.

937
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,400
-Got a traditional chiffon sponge,
they're very light and fluffy.

938
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,920
It has the potential to collapse
quite easily.

939
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,840
And in practice it's
been hit and miss.

940
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,640
-And Lottie is taking an even bigger
risk with her choice of sponge.

941
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,720
-So I am making a cotton jiggle cake.

942
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,240
-A cotton jiggle cake? Yeah.

943
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,480
And I'm making
that into a toadstool.

944
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,696
-It's called jiggle because it's
like a souffle-. Yeah.

945
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,240
-You jiggle it to
see if it's cooked.

946
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,280
-Now, a toadstool tends
to be top heavy.

947
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,080
-Yes, it is a gamble. It is possible.
-It can be done.

948
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,560
-It can be done. Yeah.

949
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,240
-Lottie's lime flavoured jiggle cake
will have a cherry cream centre

950
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,000
and be fashioned into a cute red
toadstool growing in an edible

951
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,120
Japanese forest of biscuit
bamboo, whisky fudge,

952
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,320
pulled sugar and candyfloss.

953
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,760
-Oh, my goodness.
Wow-. That's a lot going on.

954
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,360
-There's a lot going on.
-Very ambitious-. Yeah.

955
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,680
Thank you-. Thank you.
-I hope I can do it.

956
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,080
-Hermine has found her Japanese
inspiration a little closer to home.

957
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:03,320
-I used to work in Slough and they
had a lovely Japanese garden

958
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,720
where you could go
in when you had lunch.

959
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,040
And I thought it was really nice
walking down there.

960
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,880
And it's quite
peaceful and calming.

961
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,840
I'm going to be back.

962
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,200
-Hermine is hoping the simplicity
of her vanilla sponge and fresh

963
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,400
strawberries will be lifted
by a decorative geisha standing

964
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,160
in a tranquil Japanese garden.

965
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,800
-I'm going to make a cherry blossom
tree out of modelling chocolate.

966
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,880
-Nice-. And hopefully-

967
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,360
So I had the lady on the cake
with the dress flowing.

968
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,240
-Yeah, lovely-. Japanese geisha.

969
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,520
-The key thing is,
it's got to look good,

970
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,040
but it's also got to taste good.

971
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,400
-These are going to go into the oven
for about 25 to 30 minutes.

972
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,320
-I bake them in water. Just have to
be really careful with the eggs.

973
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,440
I think they just prefer a nice warm
bath, and who doesn't?

974
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,400
Let's try that.

975
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,120
-With the sponges in the oven,

976
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,680
the bakers make a start on
their Japanese-flavoured fillings.

977
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,520
-I'm doing a lime and yuzu curd.

978
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,760
Six tablespoons of
yuzu going in there.

979
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,320
Basically like a Japanese
lime, but it's a lot more tangy.

980
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,640
-This is a Japanese whisky.

981
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,400
Smells nice. I'd quite like
a sip of that.

982
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,440
-Asian pears are what I'm using for
the filling, I'm poaching them.

983
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,960
I've named this cake
Dizzy The Shuttlecock.

984
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,800
It looks really, really cute.

985
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,720
It's going to look like
a anthropomorphic shuttlecock

986
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,600
that has been hit on the head
with a racquet.

987
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,280
-So he's seeing stars and he's
got a wee bump on his head

988
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,840
Hoping Dizzy The Shuttlecock
will be a knockout with the judges,

989
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,840
Peter's kawaii cake will be filled
with a chestnut cream and poached

990
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,920
pears and decorated with white
chocolate feathers.

991
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,720
-And you teach badminton, don't you?

992
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,200
Do you think you could teach my
daughter, Dali? She's two.

993
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,640
How young can you teach badminton?

994
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,320
-We had a wee boy that was three.
-Really?

995
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,000
-Yeah. I coached loads of different
people-. Geese? Kids, to adults.

996
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,800
Not to geese. So fun feather trivia,

997
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,160
shuttlecocks only use the left
wing of a goose.

998
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,280
-Not the right?
-Not the right.

999
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,920
Must be something with how they fly.

1000
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,720
-This is a sort of fantasy land,
isn't it,

1001
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,600
what is happening with you
today?

1002
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,840
You're making a shuttlecock
called Dizzy,

1003
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,920
talking about left
and right wings of a goose

1004
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,120
and that you coach toddlers
to play badminton.

1005
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,640
I think I might in love
with you a little bit. Bye!

1006
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,120
-After struggling in the technical
Laura's hoping her choice of cake

1007
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,560
will turn things around.

1008
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,240
-In Japanese culture, pineapple
was supposed to represent

1009
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,480
wealth and good fortune. So I'm
doing an upside down pineapple cake,

1010
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,200
rather than a pineapple upside down
cake, if that makes sense.

1011
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,520
I'm kind of taking the idea and
literally turning it on its head.

1012
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,280
-Oopsie, Laura's upside
down pineapple cake

1013
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,160
will be constructed from pineapple
sponges sandwiched between coconut

1014
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,840
buttercream and a lime-yuzu curd.

1015
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,640
-Yesterday, a challenging
day for you-. Mm.

1016
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,480
In my head. I'm baking, going,

1017
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,816
"I'm probably going home today.
Probably going home today."

1018
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,136
-Actually, I think it's going
to be really good-. I hope so.

1019
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,976
-I'm feeling very
positive about this-. Thanks.

1020
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,416
I need all the positivity I can get.
-I'm feeling really positive

1021
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,080
and I look forward to trying some.
-Thank you.

1022
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,200
-Bakers, you're halfway through!

1023
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,840
-Halfway through, halfway through.

1024
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,016
-I'm going to take the cakes
out, take the water bath out,
and then put them back in.

1025
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,480
-Bit stodgier than I
normally get them.

1026
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,696
-I think that one might have
collapsed. But it's fine.

1027
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,520
That was kind of a back-up anyway.

1028
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,760
Hello. Oh, don't give me that look.

1029
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,160
-As the sponges cool-

1030
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,600
-Just got to make the rest
of the elements.

1031
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,920
-..the bakers focus
on the decorative details

1032
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,600
that will bring their kawaii
cakes to life.

1033
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,680
-These are going to be
my baby avocados.

1034
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,776
That's a sentence I never thought
I'd say in my life.

1035
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,016
-A tribute to your little doggy?
-Yeah-. I love your dog.

1036
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,440
-You like him? Yeah.
-He's a naughty boy.

1037
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,576
I made the macarons the other
day in practise-. Yeah?

1038
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,320
-I took the back to the room for
the girls, left them on the bed.

1039
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,280
-And Hamish ate them?
-He ate them.

1040
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,560
-Cos they're in the shape of
bones. What do you expect?

1041
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,000
-So this is just some
golden caster sugar.

1042
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,160
I'm going to turn it into the cherry
blossom tree.

1043
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,120
That's so hot, I can't tell you.

1044
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,680
-Have you been to Japan?

1045
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,120
-Never, no.
-Would you like to go?

1046
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,280
-I'd love to go.

1047
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,360
-You know, Paul has said
that he'll take the winner

1048
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,400
of this episode to Japan.
-Really? No.

1049
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,840
Bakers, you have one hour left.

1050
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,000
-I'm getting on to stacking the cake.

1051
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,600
This is my yuzu buttercream.

1052
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,120
It's going to be eight layers
per avocado.

1053
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,080
I hope I haven't given myself
too much to do.

1054
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,800
-So it's just a layer of cream
and then a layer of pears

1055
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,200
into each one and we
build our way up.

1056
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,280
-Look at these guns.

1057
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,760
-You've ruined my spiral.

1058
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,560
-This is a massive risk.

1059
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,680
The cakes are so jiggly
and so fragile.

1060
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,920
Yeah, that's bang on.
I'm happy with that.

1061
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,640
-So now I'm trimming it into the
shape of a shuttlecock.

1062
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,136
And the shuttle's standing on its
feathers and not on its cork,

1063
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,800
that would have been mighty
difficult.

1064
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,840
-I. Hate. Fondant.

1065
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,440
Ohhhh.

1066
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,800
Tearing.

1067
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,520
-Right, this is the bit
that I'm worried about.

1068
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,736
-Go on, what are you going to do?

1069
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,640
-I need to put it on.
-Go on, let's see.

1070
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,720
-Can't do it.

1071
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,560
-Yes!

1072
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,640
Skill McGill.

1073
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,560
-I don't know if the fondant's too
fragile. I'm not sure.

1074
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,280
Tearing a bit, isn't it?

1075
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,360
Oh, I've just made a- BLEEP- mess.

1076
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,160
-Laura, are you OK? It's just a mess.

1077
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,600
It's not a mess. I don't know why
you're so upset.

1078
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,240
I think that looks pretty neat.

1079
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,640
-I think it's just the pressure.
-I know.

1080
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,440
I just did so bad yesterday.

1081
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,200
-I honestly don't think that
looks bad.

1082
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,920
Just keep going.
You've got a bit of time as well.

1083
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,240
-OK. We can do this.

1084
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,840
-So this is my second avocado
half. Really speed up now.

1085
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,240
I'm concerned about time.
-Bakers, you've got ten minutes left.

1086
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,800
-Can I do it?

1087
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,600
-Got to build the eyes, whiskers,
tongue, feet.

1088
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,040
Just making sure it's in
proportion.

1089
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,600
-Just need to do the
face features now.

1090
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,200
-It's really important to get
this level of detail.

1091
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,440
-It's a bit messy in
parts, but it's going to have to do.

1092
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,920
-They're called nama chocolates.
In Japan, they're given as gifts.

1093
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,560
I'm using them as pebbles.

1094
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,280
-I was going to do a geisha,
but not anymore.

1095
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,960
-I can't remember what it's supposed
to look like.

1096
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,320
-It's captured a certain dizziness,
you know?

1097
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,560
-I'm really not happy with that
finish.

1098
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,000
But just need to put faces on.

1099
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,000
-My bamboo. No!

1100
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,280
-Bakers, you
have one minute left.

1101
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,040
-Go like the clappers.

1102
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,360
-This is where I start getting
really stressed.

1103
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,000
-Slightly kinking up to him.

1104
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,920
It's kawaii isn't it?

1105
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,320
-The candyfloss
is the cherry blossom.

1106
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,000
-Quite cute, eh?

1107
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,720
-That'll do, that'll do.

1108
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,120
-Bakers, your time is up.

1109
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,400
-I hope it doesn't fall out.
-Cute.

1110
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,760
-Please step away
from your Showstoppers.

1111
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,160
-Oh, my God, that was so intense.

1112
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,720
-It's judgment time for

1113
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,600
the seven kawaii cakes.

1114
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,120
-Hooray! Ah, there we go.

1115
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,320
Ah, there we go.

1116
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,680
He's a shuttlecock
called Dizzy The Shuttlecock

1117
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,040
and it's just been hit on the head
and it's got a wee bump.

1118
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,800
-I think it looks great.

1119
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,136
-I think it's absolutely lovely.

1120
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,960
It's funny. It's cute.

1121
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,360
It's slightly mad.

1122
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,880
-OK, let's have a look, shall we?
PRUE CHUCKLES

1123
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,840
-Oh, my goodness-Wow.

1124
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,560
-I've never had a cake with
that texture.

1125
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,600
Really delicious.

1126
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,976
-It's a hell of a chew, but that's
the style of the sponge.

1127
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,240
It needs more of a punch,

1128
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,960
because the sponge stays
in your mouth for so long.

1129
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,040
Not, for me,
the right taste of flavours really.

1130
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,080
-Thank you.

1131
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,360
-I think you've got the theme
really well.

1132
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,440
You've got that Japanese feel.
The creases are a bit of a letdown

1133
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,080
because you want to see it really
nicely done all the way down.

1134
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,960
You've managed to achieve
good layers

1135
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,760
and they're all straight.
All the same.

1136
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,840
So, you've got no concertinaing
there at all.

1137
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,040
-Which is really impressive,
because they were very big cakes.

1138
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,000
I'm really surprised.

1139
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,880
I wouldn't have thought
rosewater and matcha

1140
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,600
would be a good combination,
but they are.

1141
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,560
-Actually, with the
buttercream and the apple,

1142
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,000
it works beautifully and
what impresses me is the sponges

1143
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,600
are baked really, really well.
I think you've done a decent job

1144
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,040
with the flavours and the overall
look-. Cheers, thank you.

1145
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,400
-It jiggles.

1146
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,760
-THEY LAUGH It does.

1147
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,840
-I love the concept.

1148
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,960
-I thought the head would be
a bit more,

1149
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,800
but considering it is quite
a delicate cake,

1150
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,240
you've managed
to get it to go in a little.

1151
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,320
That's stunning-. Very good.

1152
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,480
-That's really good.

1153
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,480
That sponge is amazing.

1154
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,560
-Texture, very good flavour.

1155
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,160
-Thank you-. Last time I had a sponge
like that I was actually in Japan.

1156
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,416
-Well done, Lottie.
-And well done on the candyfloss.

1157
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,320
-That's cherry drop flavour-. Is it?
-Yeah.

1158
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,960
-Mm! I've never had candyfloss
like that before.

1159
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,440
-LOTTIE CHUCKLES

1160
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,920
It is-. Oh, it is-. Isn't that great?
-Thank you.

1161
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,480
-This is charming, but it ain't cute.

1162
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,200
-No, it's quite menacing
that tree, actually.

1163
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,760
THEY LAUGH

1164
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,880
The blossom needed
another colour

1165
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,080
and the tree is sort of stumpy.

1166
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,720
Your fondant's a little bit thick

1167
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,360
and the buttercream
is very thick.

1168
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,160
That's a shame.
The flavours are great.

1169
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,800
And then you have
a lovely genoise as well.

1170
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,120
-You're a very good French baker.

1171
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:23,640
There's just not, for me, enough
Japaneseness about this cake.

1172
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,080
Well, Marc, I think you've done
a fantastic job.

1173
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,080
-Thank you-. It just looks amazing.
-Yeah.

1174
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,800
You can see the character.
It's very professional.

1175
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,320
You'd expect to see
that in a bakery, for sure.

1176
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,600
Well, let's have a look inside,
shall we?

1177
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,960
MATT:- Ooh. Look at that.

1178
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,640
-There's a bit of concertinaing
here on the second one.

1179
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,600
-Yeah-. But the top one's very light.
-The top one looks beautiful.

1180
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:52,440
That's very strange, because
the tahini is quite strong-. Mm-hm.

1181
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,720
-It's a surprise.

1182
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,760
-Yeah.

1183
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,776
-But I quite like it.
-And the ginger and the lemon

1184
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,440
work really well together,

1185
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,960
you know,
as the two king flavours in there.

1186
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,160
Thank you, Marc.

1187
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,720
It is like a character you see
all over the place in Japan

1188
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,400
and it is very cute.

1189
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,480
-I sort of feel you could have made
the character look a little

1190
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,000
more like a pineapple.

1191
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,480
-It's a bit uneven inside.

1192
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,480
It's an indication
that it has concertinaed.

1193
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,200
The weight of the fondant and
everything on top has pushed all
the ones down to the bottom.</c>

1194
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,120
Tastes amazing though!

1195
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,120
-It's delicious.
-Oh, yeah. It's a happy cake.

1196
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,720
-Citrusy yuzu-

1197
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,520
Yeah ..it's really strong.

1198
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,040
And the pineapple's there.
-The sponges are all light.

1199
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,520
Even the concertinaed ones
are quite light as well.

1200
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,200
The flavour of the whole thing
is very, very good.

1201
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,880
-Thank you-. Well done, Laura.

1202
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,080
-SHE EXHALES

1203
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,760
I mean, they're cute.

1204
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,160
A little bit scruffy,
but they are cute.

1205
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,400
-I love it.
It's witty. It's charming.

1206
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,120
Just got to taste good now.
-Hope so.

1207
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,720
-That's very neat,
accurate layering.

1208
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,160
-It's a bit tight, that sponge-. Hm.

1209
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,680
-You've got the yuzu, is it,
going through that? Yeah.

1210
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,440
-You can- You get that.

1211
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,400
And then that's it-. Hm.

1212
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,760
-The cake's very dry, which
you didn't expect it to be.

1213
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,200
The oil from the avocado should
have kept that really silky smooth

1214
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,240
and it hasn't. It's a shame.

1215
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,520
-I don't know if the nine-inch cake
is a bit better at the bottom.

1216
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,960
I'm not sure.
-Let's have a look.

1217
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,920
-Hm-. No?

1218
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,400
-No.

1219
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,800
Probably worse-. Oh, no.

1220
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,960
-It's cruel to say it's inedible-
-Ooh-but it's getting that way.

1221
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,800
-The biscuit is actually delicious,
but as that's only, you know,

1222
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,840
less than 1% of the whole lot-- Mm.

1223
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,440
-..I don't think it'll save it.

1224
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,880
-HE SIGHS

1225
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,160
-Didn't go well, did it?

1226
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,360
They used the word inedible.

1227
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,360
On week six of Bake Off,

1228
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,800
it's just not-
It's not good, is it?

1229
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:01,600
-I am really chuffed with the
comments. Maybe just cos he couldn't
get a cotton jiggle cake i
-n the UK.

1230
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,920
-Maybe that's why he hasn't had one
since he was in Japan,
but I'll take it.

1231
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,400
-I've had a gut feeling
all day I was going home

1232
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,640
and now I've got, like,
a glimmer of hope.

1233
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,960
I hope I've done enough.

1234
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,120
I hope I'm safe.

1235
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,760
-This is the first week that
I've been in the tent

1236
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,000
and every single
showstopper was a wow.

1237
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,200
-To look at-. I think
the dogs looked amazing.

1238
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,440
Based on Marc E's cake and
his invention with flavour,

1239
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,440
he has to be in line
for Star Baker.

1240
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,600
Dave, as well, has put himself
into a decent position-. Yeah.

1241
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,720
-Don't forget, there's Lottie, and
Lottie has had a terrific week.

1242
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,440
-Lottie's sponge was incredible.

1243
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,120
I've never, in the 11 series
of Bake Off, tasted a sponge
quite like that.

1244
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,920
There's one that disappointed me-

1245
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,320
-Really?-and probably disappointed
him more than it did me, is Mark L.

1246
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,360
-I thought the whole idea was
quirky and funny and very kawaii,

1247
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,720
but the cake was awful.

1248
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,640
-Laura was in trouble
coming into this,

1249
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,360
knowing she had to do well to save
herself-. Yeah, and she dropped
an ace right in front o
-f us,

1250
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,856
-and that's the first time I've seen
her do something like that.

1251
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,000
So overall, when you look at the
whole effort of the three challenges

1252
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,280
we've got to look at all the
bakers that are in trouble,
and I would say it's-

1253
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,920
..Mark L-. Mm-hm.

1254
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,520
-I would say it was Laura,

1255
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,920
and I will put Hermine
down there as well.

1256
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,000
-Interesting.

1257
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,480
Can I ask you a question? Yeah.

1258
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,840
-Is it your 100th episode today? Yes.

1259
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,920
-Wow.

1260
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,920
-I think you deserve a glass
of bubbly, don't you?

1261
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,960
LAUGHING:- I think a bottle!

1262
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,880
-A bath of bubbly-. Yes!

1263
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,240
-Well, bakers, I think we can all
agree, Japanese Week was a joy,

1264
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,680
and the showstopper was fantastic.

1265
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,000
I've got the great job of announcing
this week's Star Baker,

1266
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,200
and that person is-

1267
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,440
..Lottie.

1268
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,600
-Thanks, guys-. Well done, Lottie.

1269
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:16,760
-Which means it's time to tell you
who will be leaving us this week,

1270
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,840
and it's somebody who
always has a smile,

1271
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,720
somebody I've really bonded with,

1272
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,440
someone that I know we all adore
and we're all really gonna miss,

1273
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,840
and I'm afraid the baker
leaving us this week is-

1274
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,000
..Mark L.

1275
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:43,200
-That's all right, that's all right.
-No! Aww, come here, Mark.

1276
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,896
-That's all right-. Sorry, man.
-That's all right - going home!

1277
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,760
When you know you know, don't you?

1278
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,080
And I just thought
it was my time today.

1279
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,160
I mean, they're happy tears
as well, because, you know,

1280
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,080
I've made it to week six
of Bake Off.

1281
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,480
I'm going home having
learned so much.

1282
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,520
I made an amazing bunch of friends.

1283
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,360
It's pushed me to bake things that
I would never have baked before,

1284
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,520
so I couldn't have asked for
anything more in my Bake Off
experience. It's been-

1285
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,200
It's been brilliant, from start
to finish, it really has.

1286
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,880
So, yeah-. HE LAUGHS

1287
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,480
I'm so sorry-. Thank you so much.
Oh, no, it's OK, honestly.

1288
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,280
-Poor Mark. A disaster
of a showstopper.

1289
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,480
I actually thought Laura
would be going today,

1290
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,080
but she did a really wonderful
showstopper, and that's Bake Off.

1291
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,880
You only have to do one
bad cake and you're out,

1292
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,520
or one good one and you survive.

1293
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,440
-You thought you were gone
and you were wrong.

1294
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,016
-I genuinely thought
I was going home.

1295
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,880
I was sat on that chair thinking,
"Right, what do I pack first?"

1296
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,280
"What route? Shall I take
the M25 or the M2 or the A2?
How shall I get home?"

1297
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,440
So, yeah, what a relief.

1298
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,680
-Final six is absolutely mad.

1299
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,200
I honestly cannot believe
that I'm here saying that.

1300
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,360
The game is on, for sure.

1301
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,440
I mean, none of us thought we were
gonna make it through this week.

1302
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,240
Next week's a whole new ball game.

1303
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,640
-SHE LAUGHS
-We've got a lot of work to do in
the practice tent, all of us do.

1304
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,560
-Next time-- Oh, yeah!

1305
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,880
-..it's '80s week-- Gold, gold!

1306
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,640
-..with a period pastry signature-
-This is not good.

1307
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,160
-..a technical that gives the bakers
the heebie-jeebies-

1308
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,720
-That scares the bejesus out of me.

1309
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,720
-..and on one of the
hottest days of the year-

1310
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,320
-It's like Satan's kitchen in here.

1311
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,760
-..the bakers battle ice cream.

1312
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,360
-I'm starting to feel it now.
It's definitely warming up.

1313
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,376
-Who will make it to the
quarterfinal-- Argh.

1314
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,696
-..and who will have a meltdown?

1315
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,640
-Feel like everyone's
in the same boat, though,

1316
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,120
like, worried about things setting.

1317
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,576
-Peter isn't. Peter's making holly.

1318
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,720
-I don't enjoy these.
-Just stop doing it, then.

1319
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,880
-Are you a Star Baker in the making?

1320
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,440
If you'd like to apply for

1321
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,160
the next series of Bake Off,
