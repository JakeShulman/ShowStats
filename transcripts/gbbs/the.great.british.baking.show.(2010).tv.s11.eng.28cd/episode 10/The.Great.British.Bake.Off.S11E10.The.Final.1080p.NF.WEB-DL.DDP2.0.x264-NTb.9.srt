1
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,719
<i>In the beginning...</i>

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,720
- Ready, steady...
- Bake.

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,920
<i>...there were 12.</i>

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,200
That scares...

5
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:27,680
...the bejesus out of me.

6
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:31,799
<i>Now...</i>

7
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,080
<i>...there are three.</i>

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,600
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,760
It's a nightmare.
It's an absolute nightmare.

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,400
- You all right, Laura?
- Jeepers creepers.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,199
Come here, Laura.

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,080
Good luck, everybody.

13
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,680
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

14
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,440
I definitely feel like I'm going
into the final as the underdog.

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,520
Confidence has definitely been
one of my big struggles.

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,200
<i>Laura's</i> Baking Show
<i>began with chaos...</i>

17
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,119
Come on, Freddie, please stay together.

18
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,160
<i>...and was often disastrous.</i>

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,960
Didn't press the ice setting.

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,000
<i>But more than any other baker...</i>

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,520
I don't know why you're upset.
That looks pretty neat.

22
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,360
<i>...she's proved she's a survivor...</i>

23
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,000
- Say you like it.
- Actually, I love it. Yeah.

24
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,399
Yes!

25
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,559
<i>...and a star.</i>

26
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,000
Laura...

27
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,800
Getting Star Baker never meant
anything to me until I got it,

28
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,280
and then I was like,
"Wow, this is incredible."

29
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,000
I never thought
I'd make it to the final.

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,360
Some weeks, I thought
I was going week three.

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,479
<i>From week one,
Dave has been listening...</i>

32
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:06,080
Let yourself down a bit
on the texture and flavour.

33
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,360
Yeah, okay.

34
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,280
<i>...and learning.</i>

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,080
<i>It's seen him become one of the most</i>

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,040
<i>improved bakers
in the competition's history.</i>

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,720
That is remarkable.
I think you've done an amazing job.

38
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:16,840
Thank you.

39
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,000
The nerves are more today.
The final is nothing less than perfection.

40
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,000
I always wanted to get here.

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,600
I think I've always wanted to get here
since I was 12 or 13 or something.

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,360
He's the baby-faced assassin.

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,560
<i>From the off, Peter impressed...</i>

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,040
That's a great Battenberg.

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,959
Thank you so much.

46
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,360
<i>...consistently marrying
ambitious bakes with flawless flavours.</i>

47
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,600
For such a young head, you seem
to operate at quite a different level.

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,080
The Baking Show's
<i>youngest ever finalist</i>

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,120
<i>secured his second Star Baker last week.</i>

50
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,440
Peter.

51
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,000
Youngest finalist is awesome.

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,200
Let's take it a step further, eh?
We'll give it a shot.

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,000
Hello, bakers, you made it.
You're in the final.

54
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,440
And it's your last
ever signature challenge.

55
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,480
The judges would like you to bake eight
beautifully decorated custard slices.

56
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,440
Noel, are you a fan of custard?

57
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,799
I love custard.

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,600
I was very upset
when I heard that General Custard died

59
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,880
at the Battle of Little Cream Horn.

60
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,360
I think you should just leave.

61
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,840
You have two and a half hours.

62
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,799
On your marks, get set...

63
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,880
Bake!

64
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:36,239
Normally, you do the signature

65
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,560
and it could be your last one.
But you don't know.

66
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,519
And this time, it is the last one.

67
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,679
Custard slice.

68
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,600
That sounds very homely, doesn't it?

69
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:46,600
But a custard slice
is a really difficult thing to get right.

70
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:48,320
We want a laminated pastry,

71
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,399
which means it has to have those layers.

72
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,640
It's all about the butter.

73
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,519
When we cut into the custard slices,

74
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,840
you want a crispy, flaky pastry,

75
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,519
followed by a silky-smooth set custard.

76
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,399
Hot, hot, hot!

77
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,880
The use of the fridges
today will be critical

78
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,200
to get their custard slices finished.

79
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,519
Hi, Laura.

80
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,359
- Morning. Hi.
- Hello, Laura.

81
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,239
Tell us about your custard slices.

82
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,239
I am going to try and do refinement today.

83
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,560
I'm doing a yuzu custard slice.

84
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,360
I'm actually turning it on its side.

85
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,760
I love a custard slice,

86
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,720
but when you cut into it and it goes...

87
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,640
- Squish.
- Squishes.

88
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,760
With that, you can cut into it easier.

89
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,760
The resistance is in the custard
to hold it all up.

90
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,920
That's the plan.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,080
<i>Intricately-piped Chantilly cream</i>

92
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,440
<i>will top
Laura's vertical yuzu custard slice.</i>

93
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,919
The pastry itself...

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,440
- Yep.
- Tell us about that.

95
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,840
I'm doing
a rough puff because of time.

96
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,200
- Have you got the butter frozen?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,640
Pastry and heat
do not mix very well at all.

98
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,039
So, I'm quite nervous, to be honest.

99
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,200
<i>For speed,
all the finalists are making rough puff.</i>

100
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,120
One of my favourite pastries.

101
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,000
Working it very quickly and doing folds.
So, this will give you the layers.

102
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,599
I'm gonna pop this
in the freezer to chill down.

103
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,240
<i>As well as
perfectly laminated pastry,</i>

104
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,720
<i>the judges are expecting
a silky-smooth set filling.</i>

105
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,360
Cornflour thickens

106
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,080
and the gelatin
helps it so you can cut it nicely.

107
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,520
But you don't want too much,
'cause you don't want it to be rubbery.

108
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:15,919
Ten leaves of gelatin.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,599
I just can't afford
to have it not set today.

110
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,640
- Morning, David.
- Good morning.

111
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,360
- Hello, there.
- Tell us about your custard slices.

112
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,640
So, today I'm gonna do
a caramel latte custard slice.

113
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
It's coffee set custard
and there's gonna be

114
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,880
a small amount of caramel on top.

115
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,080
Caramel again.

116
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,960
<i>Dave will also add caramelised
hazelnut spikes to a coffee custard slice</i>

117
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,479
<i>that he hopes will set him</i>
<i>on his way to the</i> Baking Show <i>crown.</i>

118
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,200
I can kind of see you as the winner.

119
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,640
- Can you?
- Yeah.

120
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,760
In a small crown, big velvet cape on.

121
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,440
Shouting at lesser bakers.

122
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,880
Bring me my velvet baking cape.

123
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,240
- Spatula!
- Spatula!

124
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,680
So excited for you.

125
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,240
When you come out of here,
you've got bambino on the way.

126
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
I have a little baby on the way.

127
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,039
<i>Congratulations, Dave,
on making it through to the final.</i>

128
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,599
<i>We are so proud of you.</i>

129
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,320
<i>We know how much
hard work you've put into this.</i>

130
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,440
<i>We all miss you so much. All three of us.</i>

131
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,800
Aw...

132
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,479
<i>And we can't wait to see you again.</i>

133
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,880
<i>It's been so long, but so worth it.</i>

134
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,080
<i>None of the bakers'
family and friends</i>

135
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,560
<i>will be able to join
them at this year's final.</i>

136
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,640
<i>But they've all sent messages from home.</i>

137
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,880
<i>Love you loads. Good luck.</i>

138
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,640
Our boy's being born
into my life at its turning point.

139
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,280
I wanna win this for our new family.

140
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,039
A lot rides on today.

141
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,039
Just hoping the coffee
won't be overpowering.

142
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,479
It won't be too much coffee.

143
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,640
I think there'll be just the right amount.

144
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,400
Got 75ml of whisky
going into my crème pat.

145
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,479
<i>Flavour comes at a price.</i>

146
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,680
This is not your average custard.

147
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,440
<i>The more liquid is added,
the less chance the custard has to set.</i>

148
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,120
I'm doing 300ml of yuzu juice
to 100ml of lime juice.

149
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,280
<i>And Peter
is making his life twice as hard.</i>

150
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:02,479
I'm doing two different custards.
A raspberry crème pat, whiskey crème pat.

151
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
You have the two-tone colour in there.

152
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,680
<i>Speyside whiskey
and a caramelised-porridge-oat topping</i>

153
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,440
<i>will complete Peter's reinvention
of the Scottish dessert, cranachan.</i>

154
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,200
How do you feel about being in the final?

155
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,400
I don't think it's sunk in yet.
I think I'm gonna leave here

156
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,359
and then realise
I was in the <i>Bake Off</i> final.

157
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,719
And realise how awesome that is.

158
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:22,120
<i>Hi, Peter.</i>

159
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,840
<i>Many congratulations on making</i>
<i>it through to the</i> Bake Off <i>final!</i>

160
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,560
<i>It's amazing to see how far you've come
from those rainy afternoons</i>

161
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,919
<i>when you were four years old,
making cupcakes with your brother.</i>

162
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,960
<i>I must say, I couldn't have lost
my oven to a better person.</i>

163
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,200
<i>For Peter,</i>

164
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,560
<i>this has been so much more
than just a baking competition.</i>

165
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,200
This has shaped me.

166
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,760
One of the huge things is dealing

167
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,440
with the biggest time
away from home I've ever had.

168
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,840
At uni, people have travelled the world,
done amazing things,

169
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,960
and I feel sometimes
that I've maybe not experienced as much.

170
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:56,960
And this... This is something that...

171
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,479
There's a hundred people locked in here.

172
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,520
We're the only 100 people
that have experienced this.

173
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,200
- You're gonna go from here back to uni?
- Yeah.

174
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,960
Are you prepared
for every student to point at you?

175
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,159
That would be weird
if everyone did that.

176
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:14,520
People will come up to you
and film you on their mobile phones.

177
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,320
- Are you ready for it?
- That wouldn't be...

178
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,039
You'll just be out somewhere.
You'll be at a restaurant

179
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,560
and you'll look up
and people will be filming you.

180
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,039
- You're a star now.
- Well, that doesn't sound fun.

181
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,760
- Have a good bake.
- Thank you.

182
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,239
Take it off heat.

183
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,599
I'll whisk in the butter.

184
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,679
<i>By adding butter, Dave and Peter</i>

185
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,120
<i>hope to increase
their chances of a set custard.</i>

186
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:40,039
It means it's gonna be a lot thicker
and should hold its shape in the pastry.

187
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,120
It needs to be to the point
where you can slice through it.

188
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:44,480
That should do it.

189
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,840
Looks good. Looks good.

190
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,120
<i>While their custards chill,</i>

191
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:52,400
<i>the finalists need to use
every minute to prepare their pastry.</i>

192
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,600
It's really very cold.

193
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,400
There's definitely layers
of butter. That'll be fine.

194
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,199
I'm trying to get this rolled

195
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,840
as quickly as possible
and get it straight in the oven.

196
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,560
I'm giving the rough puff
a snow of icing sugar.

197
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,079
I'm gonna weigh it down
between two baking sheets.

198
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,800
That's gonna give it
a nice, flat, caramelised crust.

199
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,160
All right, let's go.

200
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,360
So, that's in the oven
at 190 degrees for about 25 minutes or so.

201
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,839
Until it's really lovely and golden brown.

202
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,760
Someone's in the final.

203
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,880
- That's pretty cool.
- If you can just nail it...

204
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,480
- Yeah.
- ...for three bakes...

205
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,400
- Yeah...
- ...winner.

206
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,760
Change your life, probably.

207
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,240
I know. I like my life, though.

208
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:36,120
<i>Hi, babe. I can't believe
you've been gone six weeks now.</i>

209
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:37,400
<i>But it's just as well,</i>

210
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,360
<i>as I've only just finished deep-cleaning
the kitchen from the state you left it in.</i>

211
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,680
<i>I'm missing you so much.</i>

212
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,480
<i>I really hope that you can now see</i>

213
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,040
<i>and believe that you do
deserve to be there in the final.</i>

214
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,079
<i>The whole family
is behind you all the way.</i>

215
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,920
<i>The other man
in Laura's life is doting dad, Mark.</i>

216
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,920
<i>How clever are you?</i>

217
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,079
<i>In the final of</i>
The Great British Bake Off.

218
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,360
<i>How have you pulled it off?</i>

219
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,560
<i>I'll tell you how.</i>

220
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,160
<i>You put your very big heart
and soul into all you do.</i>

221
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,480
<i>Believe in yourself, because we all do.</i>

222
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,400
<i>Come on, Laura, you can do this.</i>

223
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,240
There is a big part of me
that's doing it for them,

224
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,880
'cause they're so proud
and they want me to do so well

225
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:21,079
that, erm, yeah, you don't
wanna let them down, really.

226
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,240
Shall we ask Mr Spoon,
if he thinks you're gonna win?

227
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,640
Mr Spoon doesn't know the answer.

228
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,800
- He does, he's been to every final.
- Really?

229
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,800
Do you think
that Laura's done enough to win?

230
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,400
Oh, my God!

231
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,680
He said yes.

232
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,480
- I bet you say that...
- Kiss Mr Spoon.

233
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,440
Come on. Kiss Mr Spoon.

234
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,760
I'm 47.

235
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,079
Oy, time call.

236
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,320
Bakers, you are halfway through.
Halfway through.

237
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,440
As you were.

238
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,839
<i>Paul and Prue will be expecting
perfectly baked laminated pastry.</i>

239
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
So, I don't know whether it is flaky.

240
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,040
Only time will tell
when I come around to cutting it up.

241
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,760
Colour's looking good,
nice and crisp.

242
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
Hmm,
part of the butter seeped out.

243
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,560
And it's very thick, isn't it?

244
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,280
<i>And to transform
their humble custard slices</i>

245
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,400
<i>into decadent, final-worthy delights...</i>

246
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,240
There's two caramels on the go.

247
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,760
<i>...the bakers
will be adding extra textural...</i>

248
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,400
This is my lemon and coconut gel.

249
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,199
<i>...and decorative elements.</i>

250
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,240
Whoa! What is that?

251
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,040
- Honeycomb.
- Honeycomb.

252
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,920
- It's going back down!
- Whoa!

253
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,160
What's happening?

254
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,736
It's like a horror film.

255
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,320
It does look like
a '60s <i>Star Trek</i> creature.

256
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,160
I could communicate with it.

257
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,719
Please do.

258
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,760
It's telling me
who the winner is.

259
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,760
Oh, go on. Go on. Who is it?

260
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:56,959
It's Dave.

261
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,719
Anyway, it'll be good. See you later.

262
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,280
<i>Thirty minutes remaining.</i>

263
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,480
Okie cokey.

264
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,640
Just need to cut this down to size.

265
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:07,240
It's just so crumbly.

266
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm pleased with that.

267
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:11,560
These raspberries
are gonna be in a lovely little row.

268
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,800
Just filling up the custard.

269
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,280
Making it as even as possible.

270
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,120
Come on, Laura. Bit quicker.

271
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:21,120
We're in business now. Raspberry on top.

272
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,760
Just have to jigsaw it back together now.

273
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,959
And let it set in the freezer.

274
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,120
A bit worried about time, as always.

275
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:32,120
It wouldn't really be
my signature challenge, would it,

276
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:33,959
without a bit of a race to finish.

277
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,199
Coming out.

278
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
<i>It's the moment of truth.</i>

279
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,839
Here we go.

280
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,800
<i>Only now will the bakers
find out if their custard has set.</i>

281
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
Looks nice.

282
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,160
The custard has come out
clean and set, which I'm pleased about.

283
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,599
That was the only worry.

284
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:00,599
It's not set. It's not set.

285
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,599
This is a nightmare.
This is an absolute nightmare.

286
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,520
What can I do?

287
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:08,480
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

288
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,959
Ooh, careful.

289
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
Oh, dear!

290
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,079
Oh, no.

291
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,520
Just some piped lines
to make it a bit more pretty.

292
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:26,839
Judges are definitely expecting precision.

293
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,079
This is not going well, is it?

294
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,480
I'm happy with that.
That looks good.

295
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,120
Bakers, you have one
minute remaining. One minute.

296
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,680
Oh, dear!

297
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,640
I need more time.

298
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,240
This is too warm.
I'm actually just gonna leave them off.

299
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,120
They look good as they are.

300
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:48,599
Neaten up the custard as much as I can.

301
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,400
"Decorating" being a loose word.

302
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,920
Oh, I'm so sorry.

303
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,040
Bakers, your time is up.

304
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:00,760
Oh, no.

305
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:02,920
You all right, Laura?

306
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,199
Laura...

307
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,719
You know Björn Borg, the tennis player?

308
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,240
He was a good champion
'cause he could forget anything.

309
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:21,040
- Really?
- So the next point

310
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,079
was always all he would think about.

311
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,360
He'd never think
about anything behind him.

312
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:26,920
Just go forward.

313
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,079
Thank you.

314
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,760
My God, the execution.
I mean, it looks like it's been dropped.

315
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,000
And I just feel so embarrassed.

316
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,040
Come on,
you've come back from worse.

317
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,839
- Huh?
- You've come back from worse.

318
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,839
<i>It's judgement time
for the final signature bakes.</i>

319
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,719
- Hello, Peter.
- Hello.

320
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,280
They look incredibly good.
Let's hope they taste good.

321
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,199
I do like the look of them.
They're very professional.

322
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,400
I love the way you've got
the raspberries standing in the halves.

323
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,760
That's a lovely
flaky pastry, isn't it?

324
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,240
You can see all
the layers. It looks very good.

325
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:12,520
Mmm. The oats are really delicious on top.

326
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,839
They're crunchy, slightly caramelised.

327
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,760
The custard is good. Beautiful flavour
with the whisky and raspberry.

328
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,680
It's probably a little bit thick.

329
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,199
- Okay.
- Only a little.

330
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,160
But the saving grace is the raspberry.

331
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,160
Because the raspberries carry more liquid,
so the balance is there.

332
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,920
You thought it through
and ticked every single box.

333
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,520
It's a really lovely custard slice.

334
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,400
- Hmm.
- Thank you very much.

335
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,520
I intended for the wobbly lines.

336
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:43,120
- I like them.
- It's all about wobbly these days.

337
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,640
- Absolutely.
- Wobble, wobble.

338
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:46,839
This should hopefully
have a wobble.

339
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,319
That stood up to that.

340
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,800
That is delicious.

341
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:59,160
The pastry's beautiful and flaky.

342
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,439
A gorgeous coffee flavour going through.
It's a little stodgy, the custard.

343
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,959
- Okay, yeah.
- It's still pretty delicious.

344
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,079
I mean, it's not stodgy, stodgy.

345
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,199
And I love the coffee, and it's
a really strong espresso sort of flavour.

346
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
Well done.

347
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:14,240
- Cheers. Thank you.
- Well done.

348
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,959
I'm just so embarrassed to serve you that.
I'm so sorry.

349
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,640
It's so sad.
How much gelatin did you have in?

350
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,800
- Ten leaves of gelatin in the custard.
- Ten leaves?

351
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,319
- It should have set like concrete.
- Yeah.

352
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,680
Part of the problem,
it could be the flavours

353
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,319
could have broken it down.

354
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,280
- Okay.
- Yuzu, you've got in there?

355
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:37,719
- Yeah.
- Put too much flavour

356
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,479
in a custard, it can't set.

357
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,680
The flavours
actually sound wonderful.

358
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,319
That's a bit hard.

359
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,079
You've lost a lot of your butter
in your pastry.

360
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,760
So you've lost the colour, as well.

361
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,520
- Mmm.
- So it's very hard.

362
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:52,160
- Mmm.
- It's like a cracker

363
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,680
rather than rough puff.

364
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,560
Hmm.

365
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,880
The yuzu is very sharp. It is very strong.
And I love the flavours.

366
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:04,000
But that puff pastry is not good.

367
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,040
Laura, you've had a bad morning,
but it tastes delicious.

368
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,399
- Thank you.
- You could have a great afternoon.

369
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:13,319
Thank you.

370
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,760
You've got two more challenges.

371
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,800
- Just forget it.
- Yeah.

372
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,079
Oh, "bad morning," I think, Prue said.

373
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:25,560
Which... Yeah, pretty accurate.
I think that was actually very kind.

374
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,040
<i>Now the bakers face
their last gingham-wrapped mystery.</i>

375
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,919
It's time for your final
technical challenge,

376
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,040
which today has been set for you
by the lovely Prue.

377
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,960
- Which one's Prue?
- You know, sexy lady.

378
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,080
- All right. And who's the other lady?
- It's Paul. I told you about this.

379
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:50,159
Oh, yeah. They warned me about him.
So, Prue, any words of advice?

380
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,360
Keep your cool
and keep everything else cool.

381
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,960
Use your fridges.

382
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,159
Okay. Off you pop. See you later.

383
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,960
So, bakers,
for your final technical challenge,

384
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,000
the judges would like you each to make
eight little walnut whirls.

385
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,560
Your walnut whirls must feature
a walnut sablé biscuit base,

386
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,399
coffee ganache filling,
surrounded by marshmallow.

387
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,320
And beautifully coated
in tempered chocolate.

388
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,240
You have two hours.

389
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,240
- On your marks...
- Get set...

390
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,720
- Bake.
- Hmm.

391
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:30,960
Quite excited about this.
Yeah, I like a walnut whirl.

392
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,200
Hopefully, I'll have the tekkers required.

393
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,200
They are delicious.
I think normally they don't tend to have

394
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,440
coffee-infused ganache in the middle.

395
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,640
I hate coffee. I hate the smell of it.

396
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,960
I hate everything about it.

397
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,280
It's the final technical challenges, Prue,
and you've chosen walnut whirls.

398
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,919
It's quite tricky
because it's all very tiny.

399
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,159
I love it 'cause you can see
that beautiful biscuit at the bottom

400
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,000
and the ganache
surrounded with marshmallow

401
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,679
and the chocolate on the top.

402
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,360
Mmm, the marshmallow is just set.

403
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,320
It melts in the mouth.
You've got the kick of the coffee,

404
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:10,840
you've got the walnut
and that soft marshmallow.

405
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,320
- It's delicious.
- It is delicious.

406
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:14,200
What's the biggest problem gonna be?

407
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,960
The ganache. They have to
have it at the right temperature

408
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,640
that it's soft enough to pipe

409
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,120
but firm enough
to stay in a little pyramid.

410
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,040
Otherwise it'll spread
all over the biscuit.

411
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,919
The marshmallow is a bit tricky.

412
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,080
If it's too sloppy, you'll lose those
characteristic whirly whirlies.

413
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:32,040
And when you get to covering, again,

414
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,679
you want that chocolate
to be just about to set.

415
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,040
You do know what temperature it is,
don't you?

416
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,560
Yeah, but I didn't know
it was going to be 35 degrees

417
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,840
when I suggested chocolate.

418
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,159
It's hot.
We'll just try and keep everything cold.

419
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,480
I feel like I'm on fire.

420
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,480
Number one says, "Toast the walnuts."

421
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,840
Toasty walnuts
smell toasty and walnut-y.

422
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,800
So these are going in the base
of the biscuit.

423
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,560
Chopping these fairly small.
Doesn't give us any instruction,

424
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,560
but it's what I assume
is supposed to happen.

425
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,159
So I'm going with this.

426
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,720
I wanna blitz them
so they're like ground almonds.

427
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,679
Step two,
"Make the sablé dough and chill."

428
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,000
Sablé is a type of biscuit
that I've never made before.

429
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,720
Well, it's like a pastry biscuit, I think.

430
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,120
So that's the sablé dough.

431
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,600
Never heard of what sablé is, but yeah.

432
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,480
All right, let's get on
with the chocolate ganache.

433
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,640
- Oh, my God, it's so warm.
- It's very hot, isn't it?

434
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,360
You gotta be cool like The Fonz.

435
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,880
I might put an anorak on in a minute.

436
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,080
Step three, "Make a coffee-infused
chocolate ganache."

437
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:38,679
I don't like coffee.

438
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,240
I've got some coffee beans
in cream on low heat.

439
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,399
That's going to infuse
the flavour, hopefully.

440
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,159
I genuinely don't know how to use coffee.
Hot water?

441
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,560
Hopefully, it's infused enough.

442
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,200
Ganache should be
silky and smooth. No lumps or bumps.

443
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,200
Heat them with the cream?

444
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,040
"Stamp out eight discs of dough,
then bake."

445
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,159
And what did you think when you heard
you were gonna be making walnut whirls?

446
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,640
- I got quite excited.
- Did you get excited?

447
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,640
- Yeah.
- We can't see you.

448
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:22,440
The fact that we gotta cut discs out,
I'm gonna roll it thin.

449
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,080
Sablé likes to be kind of that thick,
but they're really small.

450
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,720
They need to be a bit thinner
to be in proportion.

451
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,919
I'll need to get the biscuits out.

452
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,600
Is it eight, that we need?

453
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,080
We don't know
how thin they're meant to be,

454
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,320
but that amount of dough,
you'd expect it to be...

455
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,480
I think you're meant to have
a bit more of a biscuit to it.

456
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,560
To be honest,
I probably rolled it too thin.

457
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
Why don't I re-roll it?
Because we're going for it.

458
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,520
I've set ten minutes.
It may be less than that.

459
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:54,080
I'm bound to mess it up.

460
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,720
Step five, "Make marshmallow."

461
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,720
- Good time to introduce you to Mr Spoon.
- Hello, Mr Spoon.

462
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,840
Go on, ask Mr Spoon...

463
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,880
Do you think
Peter's done enough to win?

464
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,200
He said yes.

465
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
He also said there's never been a winner
who hasn't kissed Mr Spoon.

466
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,080
Go on, just a little peck on the cheeks.

467
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,200
That's in my memory bank
for the rest of my life.

468
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,600
I've not actually made marshmallow before.

469
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,480
I think it's just an Italian meringue
with gelatin in it.

470
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,040
It is similar to Italian meringue.

471
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,736
When I've made
a marshmallow before,

472
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,280
it's been a Swiss meringue method,
whisking the eggs over bain-marie.

473
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,640
Normally, I'd just put
the sugar and water and then heat it

474
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,120
and then the syrup goes in the egg whites.

475
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,399
Yeah. Hot.

476
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,960
Do you want to do the old switcheroo?

477
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,360
- Erm, yeah.
- Yeah?

478
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:58,480
- Let's do it.
- So we've been freezing tea towels

479
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,880
and then putting them on. It's too frozen.

480
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,399
We'll just roll it up, shall we?
Stick it behind there.

481
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,720
And I'll just do
the rest of the technical like this.

482
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,040
Do it like that, yeah.

483
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,776
With the residual heat of the pan,
I've just melted down the gelatin.

484
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,320
Throwing this in with the marshmallow.

485
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:16,800
Tastes like marshmallow.

486
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,000
That's not right, is it?
What is that ball?

487
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,760
The hell?

488
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,320
<i>Laura's egg whites
weren't whisked enough</i>

489
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:31,919
<i>when she added her sugar syrup.</i>

490
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,080
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

491
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,880
Some lovely-looking
little cookies.

492
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,320
Another five minutes.

493
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:44,159
I think you're meant to have
more of a crisp biscuit.

494
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,560
Well, that's a first.

495
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,159
Oh, please can I start again?

496
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,960
Bakers, you have one hour left.

497
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,919
Step six, "Using the large nozzle,
pipe a cone of coffee ganache

498
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,760
in the centre of each biscuit."

499
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,040
Give it a quick whizz.

500
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,280
I think we're doing pretty well
on the time front.

501
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,120
Whether it's right or not, I have no idea.
I'm happy with it.

502
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,960
I'm happy with that, definitely.
Just being blinded by other people,

503
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
what they're doing.

504
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,760
We'll add the gelatin.
You need to whisk it until it gets cool.

505
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,640
Look at number eight, "Assemble."

506
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,480
Must have taken her a while to write that.

507
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,679
I just need a really steady hand.

508
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,880
That is set.

509
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:34,560
Oh, they're melting.

510
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,040
The meringue's starting
to weep a little bit,

511
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,760
which isn't great.

512
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,600
It could be because I didn't take
the temperature up high enough.

513
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,720
It could also be, it's pretty hot in here.

514
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,840
We'll chill it down in the freezer.

515
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,919
<i>Thirty minutes remaining.</i>

516
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,240
Number nine, "Coat the walnut whirls
in tempered chocolate

517
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,240
and top with a walnut half."

518
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,480
<i>To highlight the walnut whirls'
iconic shape...</i>

519
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,520
It's quite stiff.
Got some gappage, haven't we?

520
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
<i>...the marshmallow should be covered</i>

521
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,520
<i>in a glossy coat of crisp chocolate...</i>

522
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,840
Let's try and temper some chocolate
in 34-degree heat.

523
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,640
<i>...which can only be achieved
with precise heating and cooling.</i>

524
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,360
I want to get this
forty-five-ish degrees

525
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:19,000
and I'm going to throw in
some cold seed chocolate.

526
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,120
And the aim is to take this down
to around 29 degrees or so,

527
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:26,800
but the current air temperature
is 34 degrees, so that's difficult.

528
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,480
So I've got an ice bath here
because it's so warm.

529
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,880
We're never going to get to 27.

530
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,120
It's not coming down
to temperature.

531
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,280
Let's see if we can remedy that.

532
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,760
This is starting
to come down in temperature.

533
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,040
This has been in the freezer,
so it's cold.

534
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,520
It's gonna reduce the heat.

535
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,919
I'll do a seeder method
with the chocolate.

536
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,439
We're just gonna whisk it in.
How long have we got left?

537
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,120
Ten minutes remaining.

538
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:59,679
That's love, that is.
That's love.

539
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:02,560
That's acting.

540
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,159
Thirty-six degrees in here.

541
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:10,159
It's not looking great.
If I'm being honest, I'm dissatisfied.

542
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,560
We don't want to rush, do we?

543
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,199
I feel that if I pour it over,
it might not get even coverage.

544
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:22,560
I think we have to dip it
in the chocolate.

545
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,560
I'm disappointed
in how neat they are.

546
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,360
You have one minute left.

547
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,679
I like the look
you're getting with the spiral.

548
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,800
Bakers, your time is up.

549
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,080
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

550
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:57,720
Please place your walnut whirls
behind your photographs.

551
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,679
So hot in here that the chocolate's
just melting, isn't it?

552
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,120
They look insane, guys, well done.

553
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,800
<i>Prue and Paul
are expecting eight walnut whirls</i>

554
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,760
<i>with a crisp walnut sablé base,
rich coffee ganache</i>

555
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,199
<i>and a shiny, tempered chocolate coating</i>

556
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,080
<i>on an iconic whirl of light marshmallow.</i>

557
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,720
- Shall we start with this one, Prue?
- Yeah.

558
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,880
I think it's not quite set.
If it had been a bit chillier...

559
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,480
This might've been a timing issue.

560
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,120
It just hasn't had time
for the chocolate to set.

561
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,960
Yeah.

562
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,680
Biscuit is delicious.

563
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,159
It could have had
a second longer in the oven.

564
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,199
The ganache is quite soft.

565
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,320
Marshmallow is soft, chocolate is soft.

566
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:40,840
It's a timing issue

567
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,840
- to get everything just right.
- Yeah.

568
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:45,640
This one, the chocolate's obviously set,

569
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,560
but it looks as if the marshmallow
was a little soft.

570
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,560
You do want those swirls.

571
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,919
The biscuit could have done
with a bit longer.

572
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,880
- I think so.
- The ganache is good.

573
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,159
Ganache is perfect.
Coffee comes through really nicely.

574
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,159
And there's not too much marshmallow.

575
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,320
I do love the look of these.
The swirls are lovely, they are neat.

576
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:07,120
They probably would set...

577
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:09,760
They would've set
if they had a bit longer.

578
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,159
Listen.

579
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,480
Lovely crack.
That's the right colour biscuit.

580
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,320
It's good to have a decent lump of biscuit

581
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:18,159
- to compensate for all that sweet stuff.
- Mmm.

582
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Mmm.

583
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,439
It's got a nice crumble.

584
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,000
The ganache is all right.

585
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,360
It could've been darker,

586
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,280
- but the flavour's good.
- Mmm.

587
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,640
- That's beautiful.
- They do look neat as a pin.

588
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:33,280
I agree.

589
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,480
<i>Prue and Paul must now decide
whose walnut whirls are winners.</i>

590
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,679
Right. In third place...

591
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,720
we have this one. Laura.
It just wasn't quite ready, was it?

592
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,720
In second spot...

593
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:52,080
is this one. Peter. You managed to set it,

594
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,639
but you didn't get that definition
in the swirl.

595
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,240
Which means, Dave, you are the winner.

596
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,800
Not least because
the biscuits were thicker

597
00:28:59,879 --> 00:29:02,600
so that with every mouthful,
you got a good bit of biscuit.

598
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:04,360
They were absolutely delicious.

599
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:05,439
Well done.

600
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,959
I just can't believe it.
My last technical,

601
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,720
and I've proved to myself and Prue
and Paul that I <i>can</i> do technicals.

602
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,520
I wasn't expecting to come second.

603
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,040
I thought that I was
at the bottom of the pile there.

604
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,639
When I came first
in the technical last time,

605
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,040
it was like I was
just the best of a bad bunch.

606
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,399
And I was the worst
of a good bunch this time.

607
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,520
So, erm, yeah.
I'm not gonna cry over it.

608
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,120
<i>There's just
one challenge remaining</i>

609
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:41,840
<i>before we crown the winner</i>
<i>of</i> The Great British Baking Show.

610
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,280
Good luck, everyone.

611
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,840
Can Laura win this?

612
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,040
We've seen stranger things
in the tent before.

613
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,000
I've seen people, it's all theirs to lose,

614
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,560
and when it came to the final challenge,
they lost it.

615
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:55,760
Could I just say we've written
Laura off quite a few times?

616
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,679
I do think she's got

617
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,159
a huge mountain to climb
because, really, the...

618
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,480
God is very angry
with what you've just said, Prue.

619
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,399
- Listen to that thunder.
- God is agreeing with me.

620
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,439
Of course He is. He wouldn't dare not to.

621
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,040
He doesn't want to get snubbed
from your next dinner party.

622
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,800
None of us do.
He knows it'll be a key party.

623
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,040
Do you think that'll stay in?

624
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,280
Welcome back for your final
showstopper challenge.

625
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,120
The judges would like you
to make a colossal dessert tower

626
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:38,639
reflecting your personal experience.

627
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,720
Your tower of treats must feature
a large cake at its base,

628
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,320
and then the rest of the tower
must show off

629
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,879
at least three different
baking disciplines.

630
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:52,639
You have just four and a half hours.

631
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,879
- On your marks...
- Get set...

632
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,399
Bake!

633
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,199
The final challenge, it's their own
personal showstopper, really.

634
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,919
It's a kind of exhibition
at the end of a term

635
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,439
where you show off
everything you've learnt.

636
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:16,000
A big cake underneath,
and then three other bakes on top.

637
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,919
They can go down the choux, the pastry,
the biscuit, the pudding, the bread.

638
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,360
But all I want is the perfect
of whatever they choose to do.

639
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:26,399
I'm just hoping
that the bakers go out feeling,

640
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,600
"I did my best and it was bloody good."

641
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,159
- Morning, Laura.
- Hello, Laura.

642
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,320
- Morning, Laura.
- Morning!

643
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,919
Tell us about your showstopper.

644
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,959
It's based on a favourite quote of mine
by G.K. Chesterton, which is,

645
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:42,560
"When it rains on your parade,
look up, not down,

646
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:44,959
for without the rain,
there would be no rainbow."

647
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,520
<i>Laura will attempt
to put her troubles behind her</i>

648
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,040
<i>with carrot-and-walnut cake,</i>

649
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,919
<i>warm and spicy
chocolate-orange Chelsea buns,</i>

650
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,840
<i>lemon macarons, and miniature versions
of her Star Baker-winning key lime tart.</i>

651
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:59,480
Nice choices.
How do you feel about today?

652
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,679
Yesterday was a bit topsy-turvy for you.

653
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,120
Yesterday was just
really not a good day for me,

654
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:06,280
but I genuinely don't mind what happens.

655
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,080
I just want to do myself proud.

656
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,520
- Just do me one favour.
- Hmm?

657
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,000
Try and keep your bench clean for once.

658
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,480
- I don't think she can do that.
- That's a big ask.

659
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,120
Clean bench, clean mind,
focus on the cake. That's all.

660
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,679
There's method in that chaos, right?

661
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:25,040
<i>For this final showstopper,
more chaos could be on its way</i>

662
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,840
<i>and from an extremely unlikely source.</i>

663
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,879
My dessert tower, I've named it
the Bonkers Bake-off Bubble Cake.

664
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:37,480
It's to reflect my experience through
the cake being a little bit random,

665
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,040
so it's a bit more out there
than anything I've done.

666
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,560
<i>Peter will deliver</i>

667
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:44,719
<i>a Bonkers Baking Show
with a puffed-rice Christmas tree,</i>

668
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,120
<i>complete with friand Christmas puddings
and biscuit presents</i>

669
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,959
<i>clashing with French lemon
and blackberry choux buns,</i>

670
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,600
<i>and all balanced on
a great British Victoria sandwich.</i>

671
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:56,320
Like your Chris Hoy cake.

672
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,800
Yes, yeah.

673
00:32:57,879 --> 00:33:01,199
I tried to have a brainstorm thinking
about what my experience has been,

674
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,480
and I kind of came up
with two main themes.

675
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,000
One of them is the challenge
of the uncertainty.

676
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,560
A lot of uncertainty around when we're
coming, what we're doing, the unknown,

677
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:12,439
and the other aspect
is the joy of it all, you know?

678
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,120
I'm on the <i>Bake Off</i> in the final,

679
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:19,520
a show that I've watched half of my life,
and, sort of, dreamt about being on.

680
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,639
Don't say that. I feel really old.

681
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:24,719
Half of your life
is about five years.

682
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,240
Yeah.

683
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,679
Let's get it in.
Bit of a whopper, this cake, to be honest.

684
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,000
<i>Whilst Laura and Peter
aim to repeat previous triumphs...</i>

685
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,520
Absolutely ma-hoosive.

686
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,879
<i>...Dave's strategy
seems a little riskier.</i>

687
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:41,600
I'm calling my dessert tower
A Tower to Redemption.

688
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,879
I'm gonna do bakes
where I've done badly in some challenges.

689
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:48,719
I'm doing this to prove to Prue and Paul
that I have got what it takes.

690
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,800
It is a big risk.

691
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,240
The definition of insanity

692
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,040
is expecting different results
from trying the same thing.

693
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,000
It was Einstein that said it.

694
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,600
Dave Einstein.

695
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,000
<i>Dave is aiming
for redemption at last</i>

696
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,320
<i>with a new version of his fraisier cake
with amaretto syrup,</i>

697
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:07,040
<i>an improved chocolate babka recipe,
raspberry profiteroles,</i>

698
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,480
<i>and miniature white-chocolate-
macadamia-nut brownies.</i>

699
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,080
You set yourself a mildly monumental task

700
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,600
of succeeding
where previously you have failed.

701
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,440
- Exactly, yes.
- Fortune favours the bold.

702
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,040
So are you gonna have
a holiday after this is over?

703
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,400
We'll probably have a staycation
before little bubba comes along.

704
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,080
Yes! I'd like to be your baby
if you're gonna bake like that.

705
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,120
- That got weird again, didn't it?
- It did get weird, yeah.

706
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,679
- I might leave.
- Could always feed you later if you want.

707
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,480
<i>In this epic final showstopper,</i>

708
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,239
<i>baking the largest cakes the competition
has seen so far is just the beginning.</i>

709
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:52,199
So I'm gonna do my Chelsea buns.
It's in a really lovely enriched dough.

710
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,679
It's got a bit of cinnamon
and some orange extract in there, as well.

711
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,440
If I'm in the doghouse, I normally
make these for my husband.

712
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,000
Apparently, I'm a nagger.

713
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,240
I just say to him, "Well, if you just
did things, I wouldn't have to nag."

714
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,319
<i>Laura's not the only one
with an enriched dough</i>

715
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
<i>designed to make amends.</i>

716
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,120
Chocolate Week, we did babkas.
I took it out of the oven a bit too soon.

717
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,880
I didn't know the timings.

718
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,240
<i>Whilst Dave hopes the
second storey of his Tower of Redemption</i>

719
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:22,080
<i>will soon be on the rise...</i>

720
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,160
To Rowan.

721
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,040
<i>...it's lift off
for Peter's chaos theory.</i>

722
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm gonna start making
my biscuit dough.

723
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,120
Sort of an American-style
sugar cookie type thing.

724
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,400
<i>He's planning to make biscuits
that look like cakes.</i>

725
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,120
I've got
an orange-and-chocolate cookie.

726
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,160
It's gonna have a chequerboard effect,

727
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,720
like my orange-and-chocolate Battenberg,
which was my first baking attempt.

728
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,080
The dough looks fine.

729
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,319
I did a very poor job
of flipping one onto the other,

730
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
so they're very skewwhiff.

731
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,200
Bakers, you have three hours left!

732
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,600
Sponge looks nice and golden,
but not brown like last time.

733
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,280
You're what I can only describe
as a man in the zone.

734
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,240
Yeah.

735
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:09,480
But nobody who's won this
hasn't kissed Mr Spoon.

736
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,720
- You prepared to kiss Mr Spoon?
- Okay.

737
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:14,640
Go on, then.

738
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,040
Not there! On his face!

739
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,680
What? Where?

740
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,400
It's a family show! Mr Spoon!

741
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,040
Disgusting.

742
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,839
Unbelievable.

743
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,799
- He thinks you're gonna win.
- Thank you.

744
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,400
He says if you want his number,
ask the production office.

745
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
Yeah.

746
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,400
Choux's sounding nice,
but a bit too bubbly.

747
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,080
Choux's a bit too loud there.

748
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,920
Definitely cooked.
Racing through it today. Lightning speed.

749
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,200
I'm now going back
to make my Chelsea buns.

750
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,120
So we've got orange peel, dark chocolate
chips going into the filling itself.

751
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,640
Now I'm sorting the filling out,
so they're in sausage shapes.

752
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,640
That'll do.

753
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,480
Love watching you work.
Just by eye. No rulers involved?

754
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,120
I'm not Peter.

755
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,600
Peter's part ruler. His leg's a ruler.
He measures stuff as he runs.

756
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,560
<i>But Peter's Battenberg biscuits...</i>

757
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
Oh, my word.

758
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,240
<i>...aren't quite measuring up.</i>

759
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:12,520
Oh, that's really thick.

760
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,480
Erm, probably should've planned this,
shouldn't I?

761
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,680
After I've done this,
can start preparing the profiteroles.

762
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,600
This looks really bizarre.

763
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,520
Really happy with that dough.

764
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,720
I did do this in practice.
I don't know why my head isn't working.

765
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:33,359
I'm in the final,
that's why my head isn't working.

766
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,240
Right, that's that done.

767
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,440
I think we'll do the pastry for my tarts.

768
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,359
These Battenberg biscuits
are different to the plan.

769
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,359
Somehow in my head, I don't understand
how to make a chequerboard.

770
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,160
So they're not chequerboard biscuits,
they're now stripy biscuits.

771
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,160
So that's minorly concerning.

772
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,720
Let's get these in the oven.

773
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:03,920
Need to get the Chelsea buns in the oven.
Sleep well, my beauties.

774
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,520
These are the stripy accidents.

775
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:12,040
<i>Peter's Bonkers Bubble Cake
is proving more chaotic than he planned.</i>

776
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,440
I'm gonna try and cut some
to make them look like chequerboards.

777
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,680
Allowing myself to get a bit stressed out.

778
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,640
So, I'm piping out the profiterole.

779
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,120
I'm redeeming
myself from the éclairs that I made

780
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,839
in one of the technical challenges.

781
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,240
We'll add in the filling
of the lime tarts. They're nice and zesty.

782
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:33,319
And it just makes
such a difference cooking things I enjoy.

783
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,120
This is the craquelin.

784
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,160
When it grows,
it stretches out and goes all crispy.

785
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,319
It can stop the rise,
but hopefully, these are really nice.

786
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,000
Got some chequerboards.

787
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,640
Oh, my word. I think,
I was just being a bit of a silly-billy.

788
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,760
<i>Ninety minutes remaining...</i>

789
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:52,839
Okey cokey.

790
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,920
<i>...and the finalists'
daunting to-do lists...</i>

791
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,920
That's done.

792
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,520
<i>...now gets harder to manage.</i>

793
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,960
If I run out of time,

794
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,400
it better not be
because I was slacking in the middle.

795
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,280
<i>To stand a chance of finishing</i>

796
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:07,319
<i>their giant dessert towers
in time for judging...</i>

797
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,480
Doing all the cake components
at the moment.

798
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,720
<i>...they'll need
to begin construction</i>

799
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:14,400
<i>whilst also finishing
their showstopper fillings</i>

800
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,480
<i>and remaining treats at the same time.</i>

801
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,560
Moving on to brownies.
Making me hungry, all this baking.

802
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,280
They're not very
even and smart, but...

803
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,000
They're good.
The middle's come up.

804
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,560
Didn't roll them very tightly.

805
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,280
They're looking good.

806
00:39:31,799 --> 00:39:33,359
Hot.

807
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,160
The judges said
that my brownie was like a tray bake.

808
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,120
So no tray bake today.

809
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,960
The one thing that scares me a lot
is all the structural stuff.

810
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,240
On top,
we have a puffed rice cone.

811
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:47,520
I need to get on
with that structure soon,

812
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,120
so that
I'm not flapping at the last minute.

813
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,040
Oh, no!

814
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:54,839
Dang it.

815
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,440
How long have we got?

816
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,520
Bakers, you've got one hour left.

817
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,240
One hour. That's right. One hour.

818
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:03,680
Jeepers creepers.

819
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:07,240
<i>If the time
pressure wasn't enough...</i>

820
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:10,200
Sixteen more minutes for the brownies.

821
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,799
<i>...guests have begun arriving at
the most exclusive garden party of 2020.</i>

822
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,359
<i>Everyone in our bubble
who was locked down and worked so hard</i>

823
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,400
<i>to make the</i> Baking Show <i>happen this year</i>

824
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,960
<i>has been invited to see
who will be crowned champion.</i>

825
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,920
I feel like I can do this.

826
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,520
- You all right time-wise?
- Don't know.

827
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,120
I'm going as quick as I can.

828
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,400
- This will be ready when it's ready?
- Yeah.

829
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,839
This is the fraisier cake now.

830
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,760
So I need to get this done,
and then I need to start my nougatine.

831
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,920
<i>Now,
there's another task on the list.</i>

832
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,280
Gotta do my nougatine
but don't wanna do it.

833
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,839
Just hate that kind of thing.

834
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,280
<i>Without nougatine...</i>

835
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,480
Gotta take this up to 180 degrees.

836
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,160
<i>...the finalists' dessert towers
will have nothing to support the treats</i>

837
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,240
<i>that will stack on top of their cake.</i>

838
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:58,440
So now I'm making
little Christmas pudding friands.

839
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,000
I need to make caramel, though.
Fearful that we might run out of time.

840
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,640
I'm not fazed
by the amount of stuff going on.

841
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,040
It's going well.

842
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,839
I'm going into, like, stealth mode now.
I just need to hurry up a bit.

843
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,520
How long have we got left?

844
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,080
You have half an hour left.

845
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:15,080
Serious.

846
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,160
Come on.

847
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,560
It's hot enough.
The nougatine ready to work with.

848
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,400
Ideally, I'd just sit over this,
but against better judgment,

849
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,120
I will do two things at once.

850
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,040
Come on, Laura. Don't slack now.

851
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,560
Come on.

852
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:45,080
My friands are gonna have
the taste of the festive season.

853
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,880
That will do.

854
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,640
I just need enough time
to put the treats on.

855
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,960
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

856
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,000
This is the time to pick up the pace.

857
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,720
You can do this, kids.

858
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:05,920
Yes, we can.

859
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,720
I hate this stuff.

860
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:15,480
Sod it, sod it.
The treats are all over there.

861
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:33,799
- How long we got left?
- Five minutes left.

862
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,799
I'm not gonna get it all on.
I need more time.

863
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,799
So tense.

864
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,359
Oh, crumbs.

865
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,240
I'm pleased with how it came out.

866
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,960
Unfortunately,
slapdash is our friend today.

867
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,680
We're going for random vibes.

868
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,600
Oh.

869
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,440
Oh, it's too big. Argh!

870
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,040
I've some spare cake cards.

871
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,920
If you need to use them,
they're on this stall.

872
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,680
They're gonna knock me off points
'cause I haven't made it.

873
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,760
- Just need more time.
- Bakers, you have one minute left.

874
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,839
Go on, Peter.

875
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,600
Need a hand at all?

876
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,440
I'm all right. Thanks though, Dave.

877
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:19,240
Careful. Take your time.

878
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,640
Oh, well done, Peter.

879
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,839
Thank you.

880
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,839
Your time is up.

881
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:38,680
Well done, bakers. You did it.

882
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,560
Taken years off me and Matt's lives.

883
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,160
The stress.

884
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,400
Well done, gents.

885
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,600
- Group hug.
- Well done.

886
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,520
<i>It's judgment time
for this year's final showstoppers.</i>

887
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,359
Laura, would you like to bring up
your showstopper, please?

888
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,920
Individually, if we had a plate
with the key lime pie on

889
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,920
and a plate with the bun on
and a plate with the cake on,

890
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,240
I'd have gone, "That's nice."

891
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:29,760
I think individually,
they'd probably look better.

892
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:33,056
- Let's look at the base.
- It's a carrot and walnut cake

893
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,400
with a cinnamon-orange
cream cheese filling.

894
00:44:39,799 --> 00:44:42,120
- That's beautiful.
- Thank you.

895
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,319
Nice, moist,
full of flavour, full of texture.

896
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,600
- Perfectly baked.
- Heavenly cake.

897
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,680
- Mmm.
- Thank you.

898
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,000
Let's have a look at the key lime.

899
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,400
I put a bit of stem ginger in the filling.

900
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,760
Flavours are amazing in it.
I love the zing coming from that lime.

901
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:58,960
Tell us about this...

902
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,640
Chocolate and candied orange peel
Chelsea buns.

903
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,480
Nothing wrong with your baking, Laura.

904
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,160
I like Chelsea buns sort of
stretchy and squashy in the middle.

905
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,680
The flavour is fantastic.

906
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,080
And then the lemon macarons
are filled with lemon curd.

907
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,200
Great flavour, delicate.

908
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,799
I love the soft middle.

909
00:45:19,879 --> 00:45:23,120
You are such a good baker
and you're so good at flavour.

910
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,319
- Thank you. Thanks so much.
- Thank you.

911
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,640
- Well done, Laura.
- Well done, Laura.

912
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,160
Thank you.

913
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,359
Peter, would you like
to bring your showstopper up here?

914
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,680
- Scary...
- You all right?

915
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,680
Yeah. Once I get it up, it'll be...

916
00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:44,839
good to go.

917
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,040
I like the Christmas theme on the top.

918
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,280
That looks quite festive, doesn't it?
It's a battle of everything.

919
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,839
I think it looks lovely.

920
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,879
At the bottom,
it's a Victoria sandwich

921
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,400
with a strawberry jammy cream
in the middle.

922
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,640
Delicious flavour.

923
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,879
I think the flavour
and the texture is perfect.

924
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,480
A little drier than I thought.

925
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,040
You need that lovely,
thick layer of creamy strawberry.

926
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,799
In the middle,
lemon and blackberry choux buns.

927
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:41,160
Blackberry is delicious.

928
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,960
Sharp on both, blackberry and the lemon.

929
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,680
It's lovely
and silky smooth inside, as well.

930
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,600
The choux is nicely baked.
Craquelin's worked.

931
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,839
I love the little Battenberg biscuits.

932
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,080
They're softening a bit,
but they're delicious.

933
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,680
- Let's have a look at the...
- Friands.

934
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,319
That's a bit disappointing.

935
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,359
It's got that doughy texture.

936
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:09,879
It's a bit stodgy.

937
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,200
But all in all,
I think it's a good effort.

938
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,080
- Thank you, Peter.
- Thank you very much.

939
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:20,879
Well done.

940
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,040
- Well done, Peter.
- Thanks, Dave.

941
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,920
Dave, would you like to bring up
your showstopper, please?

942
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,720
It really looks original,

943
00:47:43,799 --> 00:47:46,680
enticing and very well designed.

944
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,120
Dangerous at the same time,
'cause what you've done is

945
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,280
pick things that you think
you could have done better.

946
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:54,040
So these are now perfect.

947
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:56,359
Just say yes.

948
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,600
Yes.

949
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,359
Let's see the fraisier cake.

950
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,520
My goodness. Look at that filling.

951
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,879
That is a luxury slice of cake.

952
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,960
This is tender as anything.

953
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,319
It's really lovely.

954
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,720
I think it's delicious.
Beautifully light, summery cake.

955
00:48:18,799 --> 00:48:20,920
Let's look at your brownie.

956
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,400
- This is macadamia nut and...
- White chocolate,

957
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,920
and there's
dark chocolate chunks inside, too.

958
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,720
What we were complaining about last time

959
00:48:27,799 --> 00:48:30,560
was that they were cake-like
rather than gooey.

960
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,640
Gooey, yeah.

961
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,600
Oh, I hit goo. That's better.

962
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,560
That's gooey.

963
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,560
You got that
light crack on the top.

964
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,120
You got texture and good flavour.
So they're all right.

965
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,280
Let's have a look at these.

966
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:43,720
Babkas.

967
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,480
Last time, you struggled with a babka

968
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,920
because you didn't understand
what you were asked for.

969
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,879
Yeah, I think I took them out
of the oven a bit too early.

970
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,720
Ironically, you brought these out
a bit too late.

971
00:48:56,799 --> 00:48:58,560
Just what I was gonna say.

972
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,799
The flavour's good,
but the dough is tough.

973
00:49:00,879 --> 00:49:02,799
It should be more open than that.

974
00:49:02,879 --> 00:49:05,080
Okay, let's try these choux buns.

975
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,600
Straightaway, they're too flat.

976
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,000
I also think you didn't bake them
for quite long enough.

977
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,160
They weren't crispy.

978
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,000
They're also not helped
by having a wet filling.

979
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,040
Cream needed to be a bit thicker.

980
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,760
Brownies, check.
Your main fraisier cake, check.

981
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:32,120
Your profiteroles and babka cakes...

982
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,200
still need work.

983
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,160
But I also think that fraisier cake is
one of the nicest things I've eaten.

984
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,440
- That was heaven.
- Thank you.

985
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,560
- Thank you very much.
- Well done.

986
00:49:46,879 --> 00:49:48,240
Well done.

987
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,839
I just don't know if I've done enough.

988
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,799
Prue wasn't so keen on the friand.

989
00:50:04,879 --> 00:50:07,879
It was a bit stodgy,
but I still love a bit of stodge.

990
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,799
Having just had that feedback

991
00:50:09,879 --> 00:50:11,879
and it being better than I expected,

992
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,440
I'm now really gutted
that I didn't do better yesterday

993
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,000
because I feel like
I could have done it, maybe.

994
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,799
I think it's definitely gonna be
between Peter and David.

995
00:50:20,879 --> 00:50:22,960
And I think Dave is gonna just nab it.

996
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,200
Bricking it.

997
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:29,080
I think it's gonna be so close
and we can't do anymore now.

998
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,920
It's all up to the judges.

999
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,879
<i>Whilst the finalists join</i>
<i>their fellow</i> Baking Show <i>bubblers,</i>

1000
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,680
<i>Prue and Paul have
an enormous decision to make.</i>

1001
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,799
You said this was delicious four times.

1002
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:50,240
I'll say it again.
It was utterly delicious.

1003
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,240
You said that was heavenly.

1004
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,879
The base cake on every one of the bakers

1005
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,560
was some of the best examples
of those cakes I've ever seen.

1006
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,560
At the beginning of the day,
you said Laura would have to excel.

1007
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,879
Her flavours were beautiful
on every single layer.

1008
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,799
But she's not in the running
to be the winner,

1009
00:51:09,879 --> 00:51:10,879
but the other two are.

1010
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,000
They are so close
because the two sponges

1011
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,280
are both perfect.

1012
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,920
Then we've got to judge on
the other three things.

1013
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,080
You said this was excellent,
this was excellent.

1014
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,399
These two could be improved.

1015
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,720
Two of Peter's
that you thought were excellent,

1016
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,319
two that could be improved.
They're neck and neck.

1017
00:51:27,399 --> 00:51:29,160
- How do you...
- It's a draw.

1018
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,399
How on earth do you come to a decision?

1019
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,280
This is as close to a draw
than I've ever seen.

1020
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,359
Wow.

1021
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,839
Bakers, would you like to come
and join us, please?

1022
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,520
Congratulations on reaching the final.

1023
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,879
Usually, you'd be here with your family,

1024
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,600
but this year, you're here
with a different kind of family,

1025
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,440
the amazing bubble who came together
to make this show.

1026
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,839
And I would just like to say
a huge thank you

1027
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,520
to everybody who worked on it

1028
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,040
and in particular, to the medics,

1029
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,600
to the cleaning team

1030
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,839
and to all the staff here at the hotel
who've looked after us.

1031
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,319
Thank you so much.

1032
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,640
So, it's time to find out who has won

1033
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,080
and the judges have said
it was the closest final they've ever had

1034
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,280
and the hardest decision
they've ever had to make.

1035
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:44,000
Okay, the winner is...

1036
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,920
Peter.

1037
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,480
It's bloody mental.

1038
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,440
You're the winner, mate.

1039
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:12,720
Well done, bro. Amazing. Amazing.

1040
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:22,560
No, I can't quite believe that I'm here.

1041
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,440
- Thank you, Matt.
- Congratulations, Peter! Amazing! Amazing!

1042
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,120
I can't believe I made it here.

1043
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,160
I can't quite believe
that the show happened.

1044
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,720
This is gonna be
a really huge chapter of my life.

1045
00:53:34,799 --> 00:53:36,040
Erm...

1046
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,440
And...

1047
00:53:38,839 --> 00:53:40,040
What a way for it to end.

1048
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,000
How close was it with David and Peter?

1049
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,799
It came down to little bits of crisp
on a choux bun.

1050
00:53:45,879 --> 00:53:49,040
It came down to flakes
in a rough puff pastry.

1051
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,040
It was honestly that close.

1052
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,839
Peter should be exceptionally proud.

1053
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,640
He's the youngest winner we've ever had

1054
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,440
and the first Scottish winner
we've ever had.

1055
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,200
I'm terribly proud of Peter.

1056
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,399
I feel as if he's my grandson
or something,

1057
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,200
because he's such a nice guy...

1058
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,480
I want a picture with you.

1059
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,280
...and he's so eager to learn.
You can't not like him.

1060
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,839
At my age, you feel they're all
my children or grandchildren

1061
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,480
or maybe even
great-grandchildren.

1062
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:19,520
I gave Peter a good run
for his money, but he really deserves it.

1063
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,920
I'm not disappointed at all.

1064
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,399
If someone told me that
I would be a runner up,

1065
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,920
I'd take that all day long.

1066
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,480
Overjoyed and then bittersweet
because it's over,

1067
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,399
but also looking forward to going home

1068
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,680
and I'm just really made up
I got some flowers, to be honest.

1069
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,160
And you really couldn't ask
for a better winner.

1070
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,000
Like, he really does deserve it.

1071
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,600
My flatmates told me
there's a really nice shelf

1072
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,879
in our new flat that I can shove it on.

1073
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,000
I wanted this a lot.

1074
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,560
When I was 12, watching the show,

1075
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,480
it got me into baking, big time.

1076
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,879
And... I think that was series three.

1077
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,799
That's my favourite series
of the <i>Bake Off.</i>

1078
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:58,720
James got to the final

1079
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,920
and John won that one.

1080
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,240
I've re-watched that series like,

1081
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,319
probably eight or nine times.

1082
00:55:05,399 --> 00:55:07,440
I mean, I'm a <i>Bake Off</i> nerd.

1083
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,839
I think 12-year-old Peter would be in awe.

1084
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,520
I think I'd believe it,

1085
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,080
but I'd be
just the most excited, giddy kid,

1086
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,000
which I feel like I am right now.

1087
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,080
I am that excited, giddy kid.

1088
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,200
Go and show it off to that lot.

1089
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,480
- Hey, Andrew.
<i>- Hey.</i>

1090
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,359
- Is everyone there?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1091
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,560
Erm...

1092
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,319
I just won the <i>Bake Off.</i>

1093
00:57:27,783 --> 00:57:29,783
