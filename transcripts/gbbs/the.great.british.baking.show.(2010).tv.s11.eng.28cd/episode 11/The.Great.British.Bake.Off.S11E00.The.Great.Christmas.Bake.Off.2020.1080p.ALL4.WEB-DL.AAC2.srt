1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,680
MATT: Wow, Noel,
your make-up is amazing.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,520
You look just like that guy
from Extra Slice.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,920
You mean the handsome Tom Allen?
I don't know his name.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,200
I never watch it.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,800
♪ Dashing through the snow

00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,000

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,200
ALL: Welcome to
the Great Christmas Bake Off.

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,040
For somebody who can't sing,
I thought I did very well, actually.

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,320
I thought I did very well.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,880
TOM: What better way
to celebrate Christmas

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,520
than with three wise men -
sorry - four bakers

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,160
journeying to the tent?

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,440
Back we are.

24
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,200
Getting their festive
bake on are Rosie...

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,680
Merry Christmas.

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,200
..Jamie...

27
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,080
It feels pretty surreal being back
in the tent, if I'm honest.

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,880
..James... It's lovely to be back.

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,640
..and Ruby. I love Christmas.

30
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,880
In season nine...

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,120
I had so many highs and lows.

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,360
..she not only managed
back-to-back Star Baker wins...

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,000
NOEL: The Star Baker is... Ruby.

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,600
..but an infamous structural
disaster.

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,440
I don't think you can get much lower
than your cake falling on TV.

36
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,160
Oh, BLEEP.

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,600
I still get sent that GIF on social
media, so I cannot get away from it.

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,520
Her flair and flavours got her
all the way to the final.

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,880
I love you all. Thank you.

40
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,120
MATT: Also returning is
uni student Jamie, from season ten.

41
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,720
Oh, my goodness. I forgot to add
the eggs.

42
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,440
Despite the odd mishap...

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,960
This is another,
not to mince words, failure.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,160
..he charmed the judges.

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,680
It was pretty awful. Thank you.

46
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,320
Although his bakes were
less of a hit...

47
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,960
I wish I could say that it looks
dreadful and tastes fantastic.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,400
But... Looks great as well.

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,320
..and he went home in week two.

50
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,400
I did leave kind of early
so to be coming back, you know,

51
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,960
I'm really grateful for that.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,560
TOM: He'll be joined by Rosie.

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,920
Thinking back
on my Bake Off experience,

54
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,200
I can't forget
throwing my tart on the floor.

55
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,200
But the vet got over her
custard pie catastrophe

56
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,680
and proved a whizz
at creating edible animals...

57
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,600
That's highly impressive.
The whole composition is a triumph.

58
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,640
..and went as far as the semifinal.

59
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,200
You're a very, very clever vet.

60
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,840
MATT: The last returning baker
is James.

61
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,000
Back in the tent for the first
time in three years,

62
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,760
I got my PTSD back again.

63
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,120
He got halfway through
series eight...

64
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,560
I'm a little more confident
than I'm letting on.

65
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,160
..but got his fingers burnt
in Pudding Week.

66
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,640
It's absolutely raw. Look.

67
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,080
It's a bit sickly.
A bit of a failure.

68
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,280
I went week five
and I still had more to give.

69
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,560
So, which baker will land
the ultimate festive accolade...

70
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,000
On paper, I'm the worst here.

71
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,480
I have so much alcohol in my bakes,
and so does everybody,

72
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,960
so as long as you go last,
they'll be in a really good mood.

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,600
..and walk away with
the coveted Star Baker crown?

74
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,160
Do I want to win Star Baker?

75
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,120
I'm going to say no.

76
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,080
RUBY: I don't know if anyone's
really competitive,

77
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,680
or maybe they're luring me
into a false sense of security.

78
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,080
Have I been played?

79
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,920
Merry Christmas,
all you Ghosts of Bakers Past.

80
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,560
Welcome back to the tent.

81
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,080
Now, as you know, Christmas
is all about a child being born,

82
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,240
and Noel has just become a father
again, so I am here in his place.

83
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,840
So, for your Signature Challenge,

84
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,000
Paul and Prue would like you to

85
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,360
make 12 festive-themed
miniature panettones.

86
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Your panettones must be made
from an enriched yeasted dough...

87
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,680
Mm, that sounds delicious.

88
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
..and must have a highly
decorative finish.

89
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,360
You have three hours.

90
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,720
On your marks... Get set... Bake.

91
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,840
Merry Christmas.

92
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,960
HE LAUGHS

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,600
Do you know how to switch this on?

94
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,040
I have no idea!

95
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,120
I'm back. Feels like I never left.

96
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,840
It is so bizarre being
back here at Christmas.

97
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,280
Merry Christmas.

98
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,160
I've never made any panettone,

99
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,960
I've never actually
eaten a panettone.

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,400
I have no point of reference.

101
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,800
But sometimes that's good,
because then you're not stressing

102
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,120
about actually making it right.

103
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,560
The signature Christmas challenge
we set the bakers,

104
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,680
they've got to make 12 panettones
in three hours.

105
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,000
What is a panettone?

106
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,880
Think brioche. It's quite light,
slightly chewy, very buttery bread.

107
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,480
If they put too much fruit into
their panettone, it won't rise

108
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,160
quickly enough and they'll end up
with sort of little rock buns.

109
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,080
That's always a danger.
It does slow down the rising.

110
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,320
The thing is, you don't
want a dense panettone.

111
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,520
Panettones are light,
and that's what we're expecting.

112
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,360
The other danger is that Christmas
makes us think of really good booze.

113
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,680
But alcohol slows the rise as well,

114
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,560
so I think they should
avoid alcohol.

115
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,880
And I'm hoping they'll be fantastic
because I love panettone.

116
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,480
No, I've never made
panettone before,

117
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,360
cos I'm not actually
a massive fan of it.

118
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,440
TOM: A panettone dough traditionally
takes a long, slow prove

119
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,000
that can take days.

120
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,000
ROSIE: Trying to make something
with an enriched dough so quickly,

121
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,080
I'm trying every little thing I can

122
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,720
just do to try and help
a little bit.

123
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,480
The liquid you add needs to
be warm to get the yeast working.

124
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,280
It's tough making panettone this
quick, but we'll see how it goes.

125
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,400
Right, let's get this baby mixing.

126
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,800
Hi, Ruby. Hello, Ruby. Hello.

127
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,720
How does it feel being back
in the tent? I'm actually OK.

128
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,840
I thought I was going to be
petrified, but the more that

129
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,920
you look at me like that,

130
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,000
it's kind of bringing back
a bit of bad memories.

131
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,800
I'm starting sweat
a little bit more now!

132
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,400
You've got to go one step more than
you did last time. No pressure, eh?

133
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,520
MATT: Ruby's hoping to secure a win

134
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,560
with chai, cherry
and chocolate panettones,

135
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,480
packed with amaretto-soaked
fruit and spices,

136
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,040
topped with chocolate ganache

137
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,920
and a yet-to-be-determined

138
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,280
set of decorations.

139
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,360
Have you practised this?
I have practised bits of it.

140
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,680
I've practised the bread.
I have done the bread.

141
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,800
The decoration not so much.
Don't want to tell you,

142
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,000
cos it's a secret what I'm
decorating it with on top.

143
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,920
In case you change it? Also cos
I just don't know what it is yet.

144
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,240
THEY LAUGH

145
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,360
Yeah, that makes sense.
Good luck, Ruby. Thank you.

146
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
Bye-bye, Ruby. Thank you.

147
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah, it's going good.
My panettones are kneading.

148
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,200
I'm on it this time.

149
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,480
Dough's looking nice
and well-developed,

150
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,240
so I can get it out
and start proving.

151
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,320
Just popping that one in
for its first prove now.

152
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,720
The dough needs to rise in
a perfectly warm, draft-free spot.

153
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,200
I hope my proving drawer works.

154
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,360
Too high a temperature
may kill the yeast.

155
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,040
Too low and the prove will go slow,

156
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,040
eating into the bakers'
precious time.

157
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,280
JAMES: They'll go in for about
20 minutes to start with.

158
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,520
Hi, James. Hello, James.
Hello, Paul.

159
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,400
Hi. Welcome back to the tent.
Thank you.

160
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,200
It's a joy to be back. Bread to
start with. You staring at me.

161
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,760
THEY LAUGH

162
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,760
No pressure.
Tell us about your panettones.

163
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,200
So I'm going for
a pina colada panettone.

164
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,120
James's cocktail-inspired panettone

165
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,520
will have lime and coconut
flavouring,

166
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,800
pineapple chunks soaked
in lashings of rum,

167
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,480
and come adorned with
pineapple compote

168
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,560
and dried pineapple Christmas trees.

169
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,760
So your flavour's going to
come from the proving?

170
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,360
Some of the proving, but also,
as you bite in, you'll get lumps

171
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,320
of pineapple in there
and bits of coconut,

172
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,920
so they'll also just add to it.

173
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,640
All right, well, nice idea, James.
Thank you. Fingers crossed...

174
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,880
Sounds lovely! ..they're edible
at the end. Good luck.

175
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,760
Cheers. Thank you.

176
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,720
Now just got to live up
to what I promised.

177
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,640
And I've also built myself
a little plan.

178
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,600
I'm a project manager by trade,
so the plan's going to work.

179
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,720
If not, I had no plan,
so if you could edit that bit out,

180
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,160
that'd be great.

181
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,000
TOM: As the panettones prove,

182
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,760
attention turns to festive
decorations.

183
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,720
I might as well get
the decoration on the go

184
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,480
because I don't know what
I'm doing for it.

185
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,240
Just like Christmas, it's going
to be a surprise... for everyone,

186
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,840
me included. Pineapple time.

187
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,320
I'm going to make some little
pineapple Christmas trees.

188
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,520
Welcome to Large Bald Gentlemen
Wear Christmas Shirts.

189
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,000
This week, James is wearing
a reindeer with a Christmas hat.

190
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,360
How about that?

191
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,960
I'm going to decorate my panettone
with little gingerbread houses.

192
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,320
A village for the elves.

193
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,880
TOM: And Rosie's not be only one
crafting gingerbread adornments.

194
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
I'm going to start
making my gingerbread.

195
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,080
What I'm doing is, like,
an American football theme,

196
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,520
cos I'm going to try and make, like,

197
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,960
a pitch out of gingerbread
and marzipan,

198
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,320
and then I'm going to
make little helmets

199
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,160
for the top of the panettones.

200
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,800
Jamie's mixed spice and
ginger panettone

201
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,120
will be flavoured with
ginger and dried fruit.

202
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,320
It will be decorated with American
football helmet biscuits

203
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,040
and served on a gingerbread pitch.

204
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,240
How have you got on with
practising with this?

205
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,880
Because it's quite tricky,
panettone.

206
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,560
Yeah, I've been
getting on all right.

207
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,800
Have you been baking since
you've been at university?

208
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,320
Yeah, I've done a few bake sales,
that sort of thing. Have you?

209
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,320
Yeah. Made some cupcakes. They were
50p, so they sold out... luckily.

210
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,720
THEY LAUGH

211
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,200
But, yeah. Looking forward to this.

212
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,040
Welcome back to the tent. Thank
you very much. Good luck. Good look.

213
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,320
Thank you very much.
Merry Christmas.

214
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,680
HE LAUGHS

215
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,000
These will take about
an hour and a half to cook,

216
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,560
so I kind of have to get them in.

217
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,920
The gingerbread gets
about 15 to 20 minutes.

218
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,080
My gingerbread are
going in for ten minutes.

219
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,680
As biscuits go in,
panettone comes out,

220
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,640
as the first prove is up.

221
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,480
So I'm now going to start
mixing in my ingredients

222
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,200
and then get it in
for a second prove,

223
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,160
cos I think the second
prove's the important one -

224
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,480
that's where you really
want it to rise.

225
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,080
I'm going to go in with my cherries.

226
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,760
But the more festive ingredients
the bakers pack in,

227
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,440
the greater the risk of
hindering the yeast

228
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,240
and jeopardising
the all-important rise.

229
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,120
Going to go for
a few extra apricots.

230
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,400
Plenty of rum and pineapple, so
can't wrong with that combination,

231
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,880
I think. I've got a couple of
other rums to cram in there as well.

232
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,280
I'm getting everyone drunk

233
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,160
and no-one'll know
what they taste like.

234
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,280
RUBY: I'm adding my chocolate.
Why not chocolate?

235
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,840
Chocolate is Christmas, isn't it?

236
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,160
ROSIE: These are my dates
that I'm putting in.

237
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,360
At Christmas, there's always
box of dates around,

238
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,320
and they're completely ignored

239
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,120
while there's sort of better stuff.

240
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,120
And then New Year comes around,
and you eat them

241
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,240
and you sort of remember, "Oh, yeah,
they are quite nice, actually."

242
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,840
Rosie's date-laden dough's
got a lot to do,

243
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,040
as her mace-flavoured panettones

244
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,560
will also be packed with
cider brandy-soaked cranberries

245
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,280
and mixed peel.

246
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,520
They'll be topped with cider brandy
snow icing

247
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,760
and a host of miniature
gingerbread houses.

248
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,080
The worst disasters were when
I didn't give long enough

249
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,160
on the second prove and

250
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,480
I made rock cakes that you could
kill someone with.

251
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,400
You're a decent baker, Rosie.
Oh, thank you.

252
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
We're looking forward to
some good panettones.

253
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,960
Thank you. Good luck.

254
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
Paul just said I'm a decent baker.

255
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,760
I just hope they work.
That's the aim now. We'll see.

256
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,240
I'm just weighing out all
the individual panettones and

257
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,920
I'm going to shape them and
put them in their little pots.

258
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,680
I'm in schedule, I think.
"In schedule"?

259
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,440
Not "on schedule"? On and in.

260
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,040
And in. Around schedule.
All sorts... Around schedule.

261
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,320
Around schedule. Yeah.

262
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,800
It's just a slop, isn't it?
It's super sticky.

263
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,720
ROSIE: I'm going to prove them
in their cases,

264
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,160
and then they've got these to help
them when they rise up,

265
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,560
otherwise they just go,
bluh, over the top,

266
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,280
which is, you know, a bit ugly.

267
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,520
About 75, 80g into each one.

268
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,480
Hopefully,
they're not coming up really high,

269
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,640
they come up to about the top.
Just a little dome.

270
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,360
The rise in the second prove
is critical

271
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,040
if the bakers are to create
the light, soft crumb that

272
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,200
panettone is famous for
and the judges are expecting.

273
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,240
These are going to go in for as long
as I possibly can. That'll do.

274
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,880
HE LAUGHS

275
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,160
So I put it in for about
45 minutes to start.

276
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,240
These, I would like to give them
an hour.

277
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,440
RUBY: 40 maybe, 45 I'd like.

278
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,680
50, let's be honest, I'd like more
time.

279
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,120
ROSIE: We will see. What happens
happens with those now.

280
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,640
I'm really, really hoping today
that they rise and, you know,

281
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,040
a recognisable panettone.

282
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,400
Bakers, you're halfway through.
Yikes.

283
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,480
MATT: I think the right one's
bigger than the left.

284
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,720
Let's do some marzipan.

285
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,200
What? Don't do that.

286
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,040
It's not going to work any more.

287
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,200
Oh, no.

288
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,280
OK, that's enough.
I can't do it any more, Paul.

289
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,000
He must practice that in, like,
the mirror or something at home.

290
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
That was ridiculous.

291
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,720
So I'm making the marzipan.

292
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,080
Hopefully it's all going to come
together in a second.

293
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,720
This is the pineapple compote.

294
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,000
So there'll be little diced
bits of pineapple that

295
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,960
look like presents on top.
This will be caramel.

296
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,880
Then I've got royal icing to pipe.

297
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,280
The biggest stress at the moment

298
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,360
is that the panettones aren't doing
anything.

299
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,840
Is yours moving?
Not really, not much.

300
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,280
Gonna look in the drawer for me?
That's not a euphemism, is it?

301
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,760
SHE LAUGHS
Which one? This one here.

302
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,040
You want to just...? Down here?
Is anything happening?

303
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,240
How do you know
when something has been proved?

304
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,120
You've just got to hope and wish.

305
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,280
ROSIE: Absolutely nothing has
happened. At all.

306
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,800
SLIDE WHISTLE BLOWS

307
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,560
Bakers, you have one hour left.

308
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
SLIDE WHISTLE BLOWS

309
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,200
Gingerbread are looking pretty good.

310
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,840
Pretty happy with those.
There we go - that's the marzipan.

311
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,760
I won't do that again.
Imagine if I dropped it!

312
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,840
These are my little gingerbread
houses.

313
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,520
Cutting them out while it's hot.
It's where the elves live.

314
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,680
Prue actually said that
I look a bit like an elf

315
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,360
because I have very sticky-outy
ears. That's a bit mean, isn't it?

316
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,720
I wouldn't mind being an elf,

317
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,200
and then I could live in the
panettone world of Rosie's elves.

318
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,360
They have risen a bit,
not as much as I would have liked.

319
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,960
Well, they're warm. Need a tiny bit.

320
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,440
Oh, my God.
They haven't really risen.

321
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,800
They've literally done nothing.

322
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,480
My panettones haven't risen at all.

323
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,720
They've had an hour
and they've done absolutely nothing.

324
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,360
Literally nothing.

325
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,840
We're going in.

326
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,280
Good luck. Don't fail me.

327
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,040
SHE SHUDDERS

328
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,560
These need at least 25 minutes.

329
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,720
We'll see what they do.

330
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,800
They've got to go in now or
they're not going to be baked,

331
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,600
but they are going to be rock-solid.

332
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,440
They've done absolutely nothing.

333
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,320
Right, time for a cup of tea.

334
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,840
What's all the panic about?

335
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,120
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

336
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,920
Yikes.
TIMER BEEPS

337
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,040
Everything is getting
slightly more chaotic.

338
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,520
A bit nervous now.

339
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,640
So I'm rolling out my marzipan,
and I'm going to pipe the pitch.

340
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,160
They're a bit messy with the
caramel but, to be honest,

341
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,600
with flat panettones, slightly
messy caramel on my houses

342
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,440
is literally the least of
my worries right now.

343
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,400
I cut them a bit too fine,
so they've dried out super quickly.

344
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,080
Christmas tree forests are all
different sizes, aren't they?

345
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,240
The plan for the decoration
is to wing it.

346
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,600
I'm trying to make a holly leaf

347
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,680
and it's proving to be the most
difficult thing!

348
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,120
These holly leaves are going to
be the death of me.

349
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,640
What sort things do normally
decorate your panettones with?

350
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,160
If that's not a personal question.

351
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,720
No-one decorates their panettone.

352
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,560
No-one even makes it.
You just buy it.

353
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,800
It takes so long to make it.

354
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,640
And let's be honest, Ruby, it's just
a dried up bit of old fruit.

355
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,800
SHE LAUGHS

356
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,280
It's like a Yorkshire pudding that's
been in the fridge for too long.

357
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,000
MATT:
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

358
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,120
Right, let's get these
panettones out.

359
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,320
They should be cooked.

360
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,880
Oh, dear Lord. I don't know what has
happened,

361
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,800
but they are certainly
not panettones.

362
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,960
RUBY: They didn't rise as much as
I would have wanted.

363
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,640
Time to drench in booze.

364
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,480
This is pineapple rum
and a little bit of black pepper.

365
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,680
These haven't risen.
That's so annoying! Oh, man...

366
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,920
What even is that? They've got,
like, craters in them.

367
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,040
RUBY: Bit of freestyle.

368
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,440
Going to go for some snow now.

369
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,280
This is just to add a little
bit of crunch, the nib sugar.

370
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,480
Well, if anything else,

371
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,000
I've got three balls to
go on top of my panettone.

372
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,600
And I'll say they're baubles.

373
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,520
Bakers, you have one minute left.

374
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,400
Ooh!

375
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,080
Panic time.

376
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,400
Yeah, they look all right.

377
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,680
The saddest elf village.

378
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,080
Bakers, your time is up.

379
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,760
Please step away from your bakes.

380
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,640
I'm hitting the rum in a minute.
HE CHUCKLES

381
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,800
A little snap.
HE LAUGHS

382
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,400
Oh, they look so cute!

383
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,880
Oh, my God, yours look sick!

384
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,880
Not thought about decoration,
my arse!

385
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,440
The festive bakers now face
the judgment of Paul and Prue.

386
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,280
Hello, Ruby. Hello.

387
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,080
They do look lovely. Very pretty.

388
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,640
They're pretty heavy.

389
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,680
They're very stodgy,
but I love the flavour. OK.

390
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,040
Oh, no, what, Paul?

391
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,760
He's just giving that look.
Too much?

392
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,720
There's too much fruit in there.
Right, OK.

393
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,560
Um, it is more pudding-like
than panettone-like.

394
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Right. However, it is delicious.
Right, OK.

395
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,400
And it is a well-baked panettone,
plum pudding, Christmas pudding.

396
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,680
A sort of malt loaf, really.

397
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,120
I mean, your decoration is lovely,
the marzipan is excellent.

398
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,360
Thank you. Yeah, I think
you've done a decent job with that.

399
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,240
It's just the volume of fruit.
OK, I'll take that.

400
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,640
Nice panettone. Thank you.

401
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,240
I must say, it looks wonderful.
Thank you.

402
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,760
The trees are a little bit...

403
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,880
They are different.

404
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,560
Oh, it's like
the 12 nights of Christmas.

405
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,080
They gradually get worse and worse,

406
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,160
and that one's ready
to go out the door. Yeah.

407
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,440
It's New Year's Day.
Trees never look the same.

408
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,840
Exactly, a forest never
looks perfect, does it?

409
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,800
They do taste very coconuty
and very pineappley.

410
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,680
They're too dense and too stodgy.

411
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,360
You get a lot of alcohol and
a lot of things going on in there,

412
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,760
and I think that's probably
retarded the yeast a little bit

413
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,360
and stopped that from growing
as fast as it probably could. Yeah.

414
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,440
It's more cake-like than it is
panettone-like. Fair enough.

415
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
What?

416
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,480
Do you want me to
say something about it? Yeah.

417
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
Do you like it?
I think it's really nice.

418
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,160
Thank you. I don't think
it was dense. It's a panettone,

419
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,920
which is never very nice, is it?
Don't know why you set it, really.

420
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,840
THEY LAUGH

421
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,480
No, James, it's not
your finest hour, is it? Sure.

422
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,200
Well, they tasted OK.
Thank you. Cheers.

423
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,400
I mean, it's a terrible cake,
but I liked it.

424
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,720
The panettone's down at the bottom

425
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,840
there, isn't it?

426
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,320
It's quite small,
cos it sort of sits inside.

427
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,160
I had some issues.
Underproving is one.

428
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,480
Yeah, potentially.

429
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,480
THEY LAUGH

430
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,080
Oh, Jamie, Jamie!
Oh, Jamie! Oh, Jamie...

431
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,760
They're raw, mate. Ugh.
Have they actually been in the oven?

432
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,400
Yeah, they were in
for, like, half an hour.

433
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,920
I don't actually know what happened.

434
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,800
It just doesn't have enough
liquid in it. OK, yeah.

435
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,120
And that's why it didn't move.

436
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,800
The flavour, actually, is nice.
Mm-hm.

437
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,960
I think the flavour's OK. Thank you.
Thank you, Jamie. Cheers. Thanks.

438
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,320
Thank you, Jamie. Thank you.

439
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,640
I think they look amazing,
like an Alpine ski resort.

440
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,720
It's a whole village,
and it's absolutely beautiful.

441
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,040
The decoration is so exact.

442
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,400
If they taste half as good as
they look, I'll be delighted.

443
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,520
Yeah, the second prove was an hour
and 20 minutes at 32 degrees,

444
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,480
and they didn't budge,
they did not move at all.

445
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,320
The sort of structure and texture
you've got is nearly there.

446
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,040
Your dough needed to be wetter.

447
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,760
And a softer dough would have given
you what you needed,

448
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,760
because you have
a very, very intense flavour,

449
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,240
and sometimes that
fights against the yeast.

450
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,760
But the overall flavour
is indeed pungent,

451
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,480
and it's powerful and I do like it.

452
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,760
The look is perfection.
I really think it's beautiful.

453
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,720
To achieve that in the time is
great. It looks amazing. Thank you.

454
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,320
So much better than I thought.

455
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,240
Like I got away with it, you know,
like a child,

456
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,200
you've done something naughty,
no-one found out.

457
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,240
No, I can't really complain,
they loved the flavours,

458
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,720
even if it was more of a pudding
side than a bread.

459
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,440
I don't care. They still liked it.

460
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,960
A bit deflated, I was hoping
that they would come out better.

461
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,720
Another four hours,
I would've been perfect!

462
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,680
They said that there wasn't
enough liquid in the mix.

463
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,880
If I ever make panettones again,
which I won't,

464
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,480
I'll know for next time!

465
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,760
MATT: The bakers now have
another chance to demonstrate

466
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,560
their festive baking skills.

467
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,720
Well, bakers, it's time for
your Christmas technical,

468
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,280
which today has been set by Prue.

469
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,560
Any advice, Prue?

470
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,400
Believe it or not, this works.

471
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,160
Merry Christmas.

472
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,120
THEY LAUGH

473
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,520
Well, thank you very much, Prue.

474
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,920
As ever,
this challenge is judged blind,

475
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,560
so we shall ask the judges
to leave the tent.

476
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,520
You two, off you go.

477
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,000
Where do you think they're going?
Fight club.

478
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,840
Oh! But they're not supposed to
talk about it. No. Fair enough.

479
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,440
For your Technical Challenge,

480
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Prue would like you to make

481
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,880
a quick Christmas pudding

482
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,440
with mincemeat made from scratch.

483
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,120
I don't think I've ever had
anything made from scratch before.

484
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,120
Oh, it's delicious.
Yeah, scratch is very moreish.

485
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,040
Also, you should serve,
with your Christmas pudding,

486
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,840
an orange-liqueur creme anglaise.

487
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,240
Bakers, you have one hour
and 15 minutes.

488
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,040
On your marks. Get set. Bake!

489
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,560
Crikey.

490
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,360
A Christmas pudding in an hour
is crazy.

491
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,880
It's a great challenge, though.

492
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,280
I have made
a Christmas pudding last year,

493
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,360
and then I vowed to
not ever do it ever again.

494
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,720
I've never made Christmas pudding
before.

495
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,080
HE LAUGHS

496
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,480
Has Prue actually lost it this time?

497
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,760
An hour and 15
to make your Christmas pudding?

498
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,360
But, hey, Prue did say it works.

499
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,680
So, Prue, you've chosen
a Christmas pudding,

500
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
which I thought takes
hours and hours,

501
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,920
as the Technical Challenge.

502
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,080
It doesn't take hours and hours.
It's cooked in a microwave.

503
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,600
It's exactly the same ingredients
that you'd normally have,

504
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,280
but everything is speeded up.

505
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,880
So how long is it for
the cooking time of this, then?

506
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,520
35 minutes altogether,
half of it on low,

507
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,320
half of it on medium - about.

508
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,840
That looks soft enough, doesn't it?

509
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,160
It does, doesn't it?
It smells very festive.

510
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,480
You know, we always say
that a perfect creme anglaise

511
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,560
should just coat
the back of the spoon.

512
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,960
Mm! The citrus, the fruit.

513
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,160
There's such
a Christmassy flavour to it.

514
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,440
The thing is, it is quite filling,
Christmas pudding,

515
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,440
so we've got to go back in
and have four of these.

516
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,960
That's fine.

517
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,120
"For the fruit,
mix together the ingredients,

518
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,120
"cover bowl with clingfilm and
put in a microwave on high power."

519
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,560
There you go. Simples!

520
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,080
I think Prue's on the naughty list
for this one.

521
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,600
She's been a bit naughty,
cos she hasn't put timings on it.

522
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,280
What a stitch-up, guys.
What a stitch-up!

523
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,160
There's no timings for any of it,
like none.

524
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,760
70g of molasses. It definitely
smells like Christmas.

525
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,120
It smells lovely.

526
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,720
So this is all the fruits,
the sultanas, raisins,

527
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,280
currants, mixed in with brandy
and orange juice as well.

528
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,480
So it's all just
soaking into the fruit. Lovely.

529
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,560
Normally, you'd steam them
for about four hours.

530
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,960
Not the best telly, probably.

531
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,120
Oh, no, I've seen worse shows
than that.

532
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,080
Not on this channel, of course.

533
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,360
I think they are saying
to microwave just because

534
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,200
it will help the fruit
soak all the booze.

535
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,440
It's just a quicker way.

536
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,240
Going to start
with a minute and a half,

537
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,280
and see if it looks warm enough
and take it from there.

538
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,840
Two minutes, sweet.

539
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,240
Go... Go.

540
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,560
Right, for the pudding.

541
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,400
So this is a lot of
the other ingredients.

542
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,760
That should bring it together.

543
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,920
I'm just adding
a teaspoon of cinnamon.

544
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,160
They've actually told us
the amounts of spice to put in.

545
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Very, very unlike them.

546
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,680
I'm making breadcrumb.

547
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,440
I've only just noticed
this loaf of bread on my surface.

548
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,280
I was like, "Breadcrumbs, right,
which pot are they in?"

549
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,520
MATT: Your Instagram blew up
after you were on this show.

550
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,960
Everybody's talking about Jamie.

551
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,800
At university, did everyone
freak out when they seen you?

552
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,720
Nothing crazy,
Winchester's a small place.

553
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,640
Are you the most famous person
in Winchester? No, no! Who is?

554
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,800
A guy from Made In Chelsea
walks around Winchester.

555
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,800
So you're the second most
famous person in Winchester.

556
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,520
I don't... I don't know, you can
say that if you want. I will.

557
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,640
I'm not going to say that.

558
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,760
You're the second most
famous person in Winchester.

559
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,440
It's quite hot now.

560
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,480
So that's taken in most
of the liquid now, I think.

561
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,480
The fruit has kind of...
I think it's done it's fruity thing.

562
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,520
So I just put the bicarbonate
of soda in. Oh, my goodness me.

563
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,880
HE LAUGHS

564
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,200
Ooh! Does fizz a bit, doesn't it?

565
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,880
Just stirring in the bicarb,
which is already reacting.

566
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,440
"And then mix well until combined."

567
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,160
So I'm now mixing all the butter,
breadcrumbs, a couple of eggs,

568
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,960
flour, the cinnamon, mixed spice
and then warm fruit.

569
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,200
It smells lovely.

570
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,040
Pretty wet.
Just need to mix it in properly.

571
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
Fill half the pudding bowl
with the mixture,

572
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,240
then sit the candied clementine
in the centre.

573
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,160
Sounds like Heston Blumenthal,
doesn't it, ?

574
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,600
"Cover the remaining mixture,

575
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,480
"cut a disc of greaseproof paper to
fit the top of the base and cover."

576
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,760
It's got to the bit where you cook
it, and it just says,

577
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,280
"cook it on low for... and
then cook it on medium for..."

578
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,720
Medium-low for ten, I think.

579
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,960
Let's see what happens.

580
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,440
I've shoved it in for ten minutes,
and then I'm going to poke it,

581
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,320
and then I'm going to shove it in
for a bit longer

582
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,520
on a bit higher,
and then poke it again.

583
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,120
And then still have no idea.

584
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,040
I put it on for five minutes on low,

585
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,440
and I want to put it
on five minutes on medium.

586
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,440
Medium-low,
I'm going to go for ten minutes,

587
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,120
and then hit it up to the next level
for another ten minutes.

588
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,680
How long have we got left?

589
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,120
Bakers, you have... How long?

590
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,040
Uh, 30 minutes-ish.

591
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,360
30 minutes-ish left!

592
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,600
I am going to get on
with the creme anglaise.

593
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,400
There's no method for this.
It's just "make it".

594
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,240
It's like a custardy sort of thing.

595
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,880
Right, um...

596
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm going to heat the cream
and the milk in a pan.

597
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,040
We're left to thicken this
just with egg yolks.

598
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,680
So it's going to take quite
a while to thicken, I think.

599
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,560
So beat up the eggs until
they are kind of quite pale.

600
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,080
It certainly warms you up
on Christmas Day.

601
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,080
I've got wrist strain
from doing that.

602
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,800
HE LAUGHS
I'll have to go and see the medic!

603
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,520
Ruby, how does it feel to be
back doing a Technical Challenge?

604
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,600
Absolutely dreadful. Why?!

605
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,880
Oh, my God, it's the stress,
I don't know what I'm doing!

606
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,280
You're always saying you're
stressed. You never seem stressed.

607
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,760
It all seems perfectly under
control to me. What's worrying you?

608
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,400
Who's microwaved a pudding before?

609
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,240
Look, it's just a bit of bread
and a few currants,

610
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,320
ding it in the microwave...
You seem a lot easier to please

611
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,240
than Prue and Paul, though.
That's why I'm not a judge.

612
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,720
It's looking wet.

613
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm going to put it on
for another ten minutes on medium.

614
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,320
It's still really wet,
so I'm going to crank it up.

615
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,640
Up to medium.

616
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,560
I don't know, I'm going to do
another 15 on medium, I think.

617
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,680
Right, let's deal with this.

618
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,240
I love custard,
even the rubbish kind.

619
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,720
It's just starting to bubble.

620
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,800
Oh, we're starting to thicken.

621
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,600
I prefer a runny custard
than a thick custard.

622
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,720
I don't know how thick
they want their creme anglaise.

623
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,120
It's personal preference, innit?

624
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,600
Creme anglaise, you just want it
to coat the back of a spoon,

625
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,720
I'm pretty sure it is.

626
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,800
What you've got here
is looking a bit like...

627
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,160
..it's going to end up looking
like cheese on toast.

628
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,240
Oh, I haven't stirred it.

629
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,520
Do you know if this is heatproof?

630
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,800
If I'm honest with you,
and I hate to be,

631
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,240
I think that's
the last of your worries.

632
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,120
This looks like
a student flat right now.

633
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,560
Bakers, you have ten minutes left!

634
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,640
Ooh, hoo!

635
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,400
Oh, my God. What?

636
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,160
I don't know that it's ready.

637
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,560
It actually looks cooked.
It's a miracle.

638
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,360
I'm just going to have to go for it,
aren't I?

639
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,840
Right, what have we got here?

640
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,320
Looks all right.
It's a little spongy.

641
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,520
It's risen up a little bit.

642
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,120
I don't know of any test

643
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,240
for a microwave Christmas
pudding being done.

644
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,000
It's out. It is out.

645
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,960
You're going to have to get
your skates on, pal.

646
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,480
I reckon that'll be good enough.

647
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,240
Just pass it through a sieve,
get any lumps out.

648
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,480
It's not really lumpy,
but it's not perfect.

649
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,800
It looks like it's split, and
I don't know how to recover that.

650
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,720
I'm such a numpty.

651
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,520
Going to turn it. Ooh!

652
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,760
Ooh, very ungraceful.

653
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,920
Ah...

654
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,200
I don't know if I'm happy with it.
I'm happy it came out of the bowl.

655
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,080
Oh, you beauty!

656
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,840
It looks like a Christmas pudding.

657
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,160
Thank God. Happy days.

658
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,600
Now I'm going to spend
six minutes arranging my holly.

659
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,400
Bakers, you have one minute.

660
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,000
Right.

661
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,560
There's a Christmas pud!

662
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,800
Looks good.

663
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,400
Bakers, your time is up!

664
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,080
HE EXHALES SHARPLY

665
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,760
Please bring your Christmas puddings
awkwardly to the gingham altar

666
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,520
and place them behind
your beautiful photographs.

667
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,760
The judges are expecting
perfectly baked Christmas puddings

668
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,840
full of flavour
with an orange creme anglaise.

669
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,440
OK.

670
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,280
Let's have a look at this one.

671
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,920
It's nice and sharp, the line down
the bottom is nice and sharp.

672
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,200
It feels OK. It looks really good.

673
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,560
Well, there's the clementine there.

674
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Looks perfect.

675
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,200
I'm going to pour a bit
of creme anglaise on there.

676
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,520
Actually, it's rather good.
Very good.

677
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,880
I think that's delicious.

678
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,640
It's really quite light.

679
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,640
There's nice balance, isn't there?

680
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,720
And the creme anglaise...
The creme anglaise is very good.

681
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,720
OK, moving on to number two.

682
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,840
This looks a little bit lighter,
doesn't it?

683
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,960
Looks as if it broke
a bit coming out.

684
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,480
Yeah, it's not mixed well enough.
See these bits here?

685
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,000
Let's have a look inside.

686
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,200
This feels a bit more firm.

687
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,400
I like the fact that you can see the
fruit separately from the cakey bit.

688
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,640
It's not just solid fruit.
It's a little bit more rubbery.

689
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,280
Too long in the microwave, yeah.

690
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,920
And we have scrambled egg as well
for creme anglaise.

691
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,560
It's split.

692
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,680
Yeah, it's split quite badly.

693
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,200
That's a shame.

694
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,000
OK, let's move on to number three.

695
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,240
This is quite smooth,
colour's a little bit darker.

696
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,400
This feels a bit rubbery too.

697
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,280
It's breaking apart very easily.

698
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,360
That's a little bit overcooked
for me.

699
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,960
It's just slightly overcooked.
But lovely flavour.

700
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,200
Flavour's fine.
Very good creme anglaise.

701
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,960
The creme anglaise is nice, though.

702
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,160
OK, last and hopefully not least...

703
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,360
This has got a very big dip
in the middle.

704
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,200
It has, and there's a bit of a soggy
bit there in the middle as well.

705
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,720
Let's have a look inside here.

706
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,120
Now, that holds together...
Yeah, nicely.

707
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,360
..not bad.

708
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,520
This is a bit...
just on the turn, look.

709
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,760
It's not actually split,
but it's about to.

710
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,640
That one's not bad, that.

711
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,160
Not quite as cooked as the other
two, so it's got more to it.

712
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,720
It holds together better,
doesn't it? More pudding-like.

713
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,080
OK, this is interesting. This
is going to be really difficult...

714
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,720
It is going to be difficult.
..because they're very good.

715
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:56,120
Paul and Prue will now rank the
Christmas puds from worst to best.

716
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,120
In the fourth spot,
we have this one.

717
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,320
Jamie, overcooked,
and your creme anglaise is split.

718
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,320
And in third spot, we have this one.

719
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:09,000
Ruby, this is a little bit stodgy,
which I think is from overcooking.

720
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,120
In second spot, we have this one.

721
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,640
It's actually pretty good,
it's been cooked well.

722
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,440
It's probably needed a couple
of minutes with the top bit.

723
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,440
It's just a little bit raw at
the top, but otherwise pretty good.

724
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,520
Thank you.

725
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,160
Which means...
Rosie has the best one.

726
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,240
It was absolutely perfect.

727
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,920
I would've loved that
for my Christmas pudding.

728
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,640
Really, really, really happy
with that,

729
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,920
especially winning one
where everybody's done well.

730
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,280
Cooking everything in a microwave,
an odd Bake Off challenge,

731
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,720
the microwave challenge.

732
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,040
Third sounds great to me,
so I'm going to say, "I was third."

733
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,680
If anyone asks
how many people were there,

734
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,120
I'm just going to say,
"I was third."

735
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,800
I did come last, which is not
where wanted to come.

736
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,320
It was looking so good and then...

737
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,400
I'm not crying, by the way,
I've just got an itch in my eye.

738
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,840
Day two of the baking festivities,

739
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,680
and it's the final challenge
before Prue and Paul

740
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,000
decide who will be crowned winner
of the Great Christmas Bake Off.

741
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,360
I think after these
first two challenges,

742
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,920
you can see some of them have just
become a little bit more polished.

743
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,160
Some of the bakers haven't, um...

744
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,040
Are there any that have got worse?

745
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,840
I wouldn't say worse.
OK, just checking.

746
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,880
I would say "not better".

747
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,760
Who is surprising you the most?

748
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,720
Rosie is doing very well. I think
she did well in the signature.

749
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,480
She won the technical.

750
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,360
Ruby's signature
was very, very good as well.

751
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,240
It did slip a bit -
third place in technical.

752
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,200
But, on the other hand,
James has lifted himself up.

753
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,920
Does Jamie have no chance?

754
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,320
At the moment, I would say
Jamie is out of the picture. Aw.

755
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,360
What would have to happen is
the other three don't turn up,

756
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,080
or the other three
all do incredibly badly.

757
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,080
Well, Merry Christmas to us all.
What a year it's been.

758
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,200
It's nice to be back in the tent,
our safe place.

759
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,960
And, Prue,
may I say how wonderful it is

760
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
that you finally
stopped dyeing your hair

761
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,640
and you're letting the natural blue
come through.

762
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,200
Good morning, bakers.

763
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,320
Welcome back to the tent
for your showstopper challenge.

764
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,800
Prue and Paul would like you
to make a spectacular illusion cake,

765
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,880
representing your ultimate
Christmas Day feast.

766
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,720
The judges are looking for
a deliciously deceptive display,

767
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,560
which includes
one large centrepiece cake.

768
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,040
And an array of
realistic-looking edible delights.

769
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,160
Oh, I love realistic-looking food,

770
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,920
like when a apple
looks like a apple.

771
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,120
Oh, yes, it's so clever.

772
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,640
And a sharon fruit looks just
like my mum's friend Sharon. Oh.

773
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,400
You have four hours.

774
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,520
On your marks. Get set. Bake!

775
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,440
I have got a lot to do,

776
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,480
but this is the last showstopper
I'm ever going to do,

777
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,800
so, you know,
you've got to go for it.

778
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,400
I've got about, probably eight,
nine elements to make.

779
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
Four hours is not
a long time at all,

780
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,320
so fingers crossed
we'll get through it all.

781
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,760
I have practised elements of this,
I might just do it.

782
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,880
Might. It'll be a Christmas miracle
if I do.

783
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,000
The showstopper challenge
we set the bakers

784
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,760
is they've got to make
a festive feast illusion cake.

785
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,920
The real danger
with an illusion cake

786
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,200
is that it becomes style
over substance.

787
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,000
They mustn't be too clever
for their own good.

788
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,840
It's still got to be
a delicious cake.

789
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,240
You've got to dedicate
a lot of time to the decoration.

790
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,960
So the idea is,
get your sponge done,

791
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,600
get it cooled,
and then spend three hours possibly

792
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,680
decorating this
to make it look amazing.

793
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,000
It's a tricky challenge.

794
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,720
This is the last showstopper
for 2020.

795
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,120
And it's not been the
greatest year for everyone.

796
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,800
So I really hope it's a good one,

797
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,200
and it would be lovely
to go out with a joyous bang.

798
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,080
MATT: The bakers are
creating multiple elements.

799
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,600
Smells nice.

800
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,040
With time against them,

801
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,680
they must get the masses of
tasty cake mixture they will need...

802
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,480
The coffee just brings
the chocolate flavour out.

803
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,120
It's not actually a coffee cake.

804
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,320
..mixed up and in the oven pronto.

805
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,720
The main flavour of my cake
is cardamom sponge.

806
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,360
It's going to be really luxurious,
really delicious.

807
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,200
My illusion cake today
is going to be a baked cola ham,

808
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,800
which is a chocolate
cola flavoured cake.

809
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,440
I'm going to have marzipan
carrots, amaretti cookie potatoes,

810
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,400
truffle Brussels sprouts, Yorkshire
puddings that are sweet and spicy.

811
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,320
So it will be
a full-on Christmas feast.

812
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,880
James really has
got his work cut out.

813
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,560
His illusion ham centrepiece
will come with all the trimmings,

814
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,760
including white chocolate
ganache peas,

815
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,520
cranberry and port compote
in an isomalt dish

816
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,520
and rosemary caramel gravy.

817
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
Is this your schedule?
Uh, yes, it is.

818
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,240
This is very impressive.

819
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,560
It mainly says "make" and "bake".

820
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,960
Very technical.

821
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,200
It's going to be really tight.

822
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,360
When I did this in practice,
I had a minute to spare.

823
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,080
Good luck.
Thanks very much, guys. Cheers.

824
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,360
All right, these go in the oven.

825
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,080
All right, in we go.

826
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,920
These are going in.

827
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,560
I just popped it in for 25 minutes.
I'll check it then.

828
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,240
Now it's roast potato time,
cos they're amaretti,

829
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,080
they'll crack a bit on the top,
a bit like a proper roast potato.

830
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,280
So I'm making shortbread,

831
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,480
which is going to make
my sandwiched biscuit tarts.

832
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,960
A new Rubes invention!

833
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,360
This is the mixture
for my cheesecakes.

834
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,320
So it sort of looks a little bit
like a Yorkshire pudding.

835
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,440
I'm making my batter for churros.

836
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,120
Jamie! Hiya, how are you?

837
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,480
Right, tell us all
about your illusion cake.

838
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,080
The idea is to do a twist
on, like, a turkey dinner,

839
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,080
so I'm going to do
a fried turkey bucket.

840
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,440
A fried turkey bucket?

841
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,880
You know, a fried turkey bucket.

842
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,960
You know, Prue, you go for
a fried turkey bucket sometimes.

843
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,600
Is this your Christmas festive meal?
Well, no, it's not.

844
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,520
I'm doing a twist because...
But it's what you'd like it to be.

845
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,480
..yeah, everyone's doing
Christmas dinner,

846
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,480
so I thought,
"I'll do a twist on it."

847
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,760
It's going to be fried turkey,
not chicken.

848
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,720
Right.
So how is it going to look, than?

849
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,440
I'm allowed to tell you
it's chocolate.

850
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,520
As opposed to? Well, it's meant
to be in illusion, isn't it?

851
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,720
Built of chocolate sponge
and brandy buttercream,

852
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,560
Jamie's illusion
takeaway turkey bucket

853
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,040
will also have the judges gorging
on chocolate mousse milkshakes

854
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,800
and churro chips.

855
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,400
It sounds really delicious,
but I don't like the theme at all.

856
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,320
Oh, really? You may not know this,

857
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,520
but in Japan, a lot of Japanese
go to a very famous takeaway

858
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,120
for buckets of chicken
Christmas Day.

859
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,440
Are you basing it on that, Jamie?
Uh, yeah.

860
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,680
That ties in as well,
my research told me that.

861
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,120
Good luck, then, Jamie. Yeah, thank
you very much. Thank you. Cheers.

862
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,680
There is one baker who's chosen
to present their fake turkey cake

863
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,480
in a classic style.

864
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,120
I'm making a very traditional
Christmas dinner,

865
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,560
roast turkey with all the trimmings.

866
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,640
It is quite ambitious.

867
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,040
I just really, really want
to finish it.

868
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,480
Pulling out all the stops,
Rosie's turkey centrepiece

869
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,000
will come with burnt
Basque cheesecake Yorkshire puds,

870
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,040
two types of veg and double spuds,

871
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,680
with caramelised sponge
roast potatoes

872
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,400
and champagne and
white cacao mousse mash.

873
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you have
mashed potato and roast potato?

874
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,040
Double carb? Ditto!

875
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,480
Really? You'll have mash
and roast potatoes?

876
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,880
Is there anything
that's not beige on your plate?

877
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,440
Excuse me, this is about
Rosie's illusion piece.

878
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,520
Sorry, I was distracted
by so many carbohydrates.

879
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,320
I started putting on weight just
at the mention of so many of them.

880
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,000
Right, good luck, then, Rosie. Look
forward to it. Thank you very much.

881
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,280
Ooh, cake timer.

882
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,920
Right. Going to come out
with the cake.

883
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,120
Yep, they're nice,
they're just dry enough on the top.

884
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,640
Just let them cool a bit,
then I'll tip them out.

885
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,040
They are looking OK.

886
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,200
I think they're fine.

887
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,040
Oh, yeah.

888
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,680
MATT: The sponges may be done,

889
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,960
but in this most complex
of challenges,

890
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,480
the bakers have multiple
illusion elements to create.

891
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,120
Are my spuds done?

892
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,720
I'm going to fry these churros.

893
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,200
Smells like fish and chips,
doesn't it?

894
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,680
HE CHUCKLES

895
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,960
This is agar-agar, which is like
a vegetarian setting agent

896
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,400
for my chocolate spaghetti.

897
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,040
Hi, Ruby. Hello.

898
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,120
Tell us all about
your illusion cake, please.

899
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,560
So, my illusion cake
is a breakfast fit for an elf.

900
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,600
So it's a scene from one of
my favourite Christmas films,

901
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,760
and he's sat at a table
eating a bowl of "cereal",

902
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,720
and it looks disgusting,
but he's having a great time.

903
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,160
MATT: Made of cardamom sponge
and Swiss meringue buttercream,

904
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,600
Ruby's cereal bowl will be topped
with white chocolate spaghetti

905
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,920
and dark chocolate
truffle meatballs.

906
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,880
It'll come with chocolate ganache,
shortbread slop tarts

907
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,480
and a rice puff elf hat
for good measure.

908
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,080
I'm not going to say it's going to
look like you want to tuck into it,

909
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,120
but I quite like that,
because it will be delicious,

910
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,240
it will taste great.

911
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,240
OK, thank you very much, Ruby.
Thank you very much.

912
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,720
I'm making two different batches

913
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,520
of salted brandy truffles
at the moment.

914
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,400
The dark chocolate
will be the sprouts.

915
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,600
I do like sprouts. I actually do.

916
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,920
I've got white chocolate ganache
with peppermint in.

917
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,840
Get it cooled,
and then melon-ball it

918
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,400
into little Brussel sprouts shapes.

919
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,800
This is for the sweetcorn.

920
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,240
What do you think Prue Leith
has for Christmas dinner?

921
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,280
I reckon there's ham,
turkey and beef.

922
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,600
Ham, turkey AND beef?

923
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,520
When you say beef,
do you just mean an argument?

924
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't know, Prue's pretty tame.

925
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,040
If she had beef with you, Jamie,
you'd know about it.

926
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,400
She's got Paul on her side -
he's got very stocky legs.

927
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,920
He walks like he's just got
off a horse. No comment.

928
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,160
So this is my chocolate spaghetti.

929
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,400
I really hope this works,

930
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,320
because without that,
there's basically nothing.

931
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,600
Oh, my God. Did it hit anyone?! Woo!

932
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,800
Bakers... You... are...

933
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,400
..half... way... through!

934
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,080
Yikes. Everything, basically,
is what I've got left to do.

935
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,080
It is like Christmas Day.
You've got just as much to do.

936
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,680
Time to ice this bad boy.
HE CHUCKLES

937
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,560
This festive feast illusion cake,
I think they have to be

938
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,560
very, very, very creative
and artistic to get it right.

939
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,680
You need quite a firm sponge
to carve. There is a lot of turkey.

940
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,760
They've all chosen a variety
of different things,

941
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,720
from spaghetti, meatballs,
we've actually got a full roast.

942
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,240
Yeah, we've got two proper
Christmas dinners with all...

943
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,360
We've got a bucket of fried turkey.
I know - well, that's Jamie.

944
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,400
I think he really would
rather go to a very famous

945
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,200
takeaway for his Christmas dinner.

946
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,280
I'm going to put a fondant over it.

947
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,880
This is raw turkey skin.

948
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,240
Good, I'm quite pleased with it.

949
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,880
It's not going to win any
competitions in a beauty contest.

950
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,480
It just needs
a bit of make-up on it.

951
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,080
How good are they going to look,
this is the thing. Yeah, exactly.

952
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,880
You know, the illusion
has got to look like

953
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,240
what they're setting out to do.

954
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,360
Nice spuds.

955
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,200
Later, I'll give them
a little brush with butter,

956
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,600
make them a little bit darker.

957
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,960
They look pretty good, don't they?
Chips.

958
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,520
I think they're going
to feel the pressure.

959
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,240
Certainly, it's going to matter
for at least three of the bakers

960
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,800
today to see who's going to win.

961
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,200
Kind of want it a bit marbled,
a bit like ham is.

962
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,560
Jamie, do you want a top-up on your
tan while I've got the brown out?

963
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,880
HE LAUGHS

964
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,160
Jealousy's ugly, James.

965
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,160
It's Christmas.
We'll leave them alone now

966
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,200
and see what they can come up with.
OK.

967
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,520
This is for my elf hat.

968
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,840
It's become like a melty mess.

969
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,920
This is Swiss meringue.

970
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,760
This will make my champagne
and white chocolate mousse,

971
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,120
which is mashed potato.

972
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,120
I'm confusing myself so much
at the moment.

973
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,360
This is my chocolate mousse
milkshake.

974
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,680
Not on my rec...
Oh, it is on my recipe.

975
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,800
That's a nightmare, that is.

976
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,000
Bakers, you have one hour left.
One hour!

977
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,760
It's getting serious now.

978
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,040
This is chaos.

979
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,400
JAMES: It's going to be tight.

980
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,400
Now, that's a proper
Yorkshire pudding.

981
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,440
I think I'm happy with these
cheesecakes. Yeah, they'll do.

982
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,840
Um, uh... somewhere to put them.

983
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,920
Pink ketchup. I think
Prue will prefer it that colour,

984
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,040
it'll look less fake.

985
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,120
The technique for this
is hope and pray.

986
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,120
You are the only person in here
who's been a star baker,

987
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,560
and the only person here
who's made it to the final.

988
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,640
WHISPERS: Stop it!

989
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,600
So you've got to be
the favourite today.

990
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,000
No, I'm most definitely not.
You can't be flapping.

991
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,880
All right, the carrots are done.

992
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,280
Now on to making my peas.

993
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm making potatoes.

994
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,960
It's nice when you finish
the little elements.

995
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,440
They're really little tiny things,
but then they're done.

996
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,960
This is my elf hat.

997
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,600
Ah! Or is it not glueing on there?

998
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,920
Now I'm going to carve
a drumstick shape.

999
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,280
Noticing that about you -
obsessed with fried poultry.

1000
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,440
That looks really good,

1001
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,600
and I know the Colonel
would be delighted with that.

1002
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,120
If only he'd share with his
recipe with you, but he will not.

1003
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,480
It's a secret recipe.
It's a secret recipe.

1004
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,320
But it is... finger-licking good.
Mm.

1005
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,040
Bakers, you have 30 minutes left.

1006
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,320
Imagine having only half an hour.

1007
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,760
Oh! This has stopped being fun
a long time ago.

1008
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,080
Panic time.

1009
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,400
It's looking OK. Disaster averted.

1010
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,560
What would Christmas Day be
without a surprise?

1011
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,680
And James has one for the judges.

1012
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,000
So I've also hid a real sprout,

1013
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,080
and I've just dipped it
in the chocolate as well,

1014
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,000
so hopefully I'll be able to sneak
it in and they won't spot it.

1015
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,920
This is for the sweetcorn.
I'm going to give it some grooves.

1016
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,600
Rosie, for a vegetarian, you've done
pretty well at making a meat feast.

1017
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,360
What about if
I was not a vegetarian,

1018
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,400
is it just a bit rubbish?
Then it just suggests to me

1019
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,560
that maybe you've been lying
about being a vegetarian.

1020
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,680
Everyone likes
a turkey-flavoured cake.

1021
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,200
Don't leave us alone. Don't leave us
alone with it, Rosie, we'll eat it.

1022
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,280
It's now the bakers must
complete their magic act...

1023
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,000
I've got to construct it now.

1024
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,240
..pulling off an illusion
that tricks the judges

1025
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,160
into thinking their Christmas feasts
are anything but cake.

1026
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,800
Lots of focus now.

1027
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,240
It smells delicious.

1028
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,360
JAMIE: Yeah, they look all right.
Yeah, I'm happy with that.

1029
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,200
ROSIE: Have I got everything?
This is my massive paranoia.

1030
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,680
That does not look appealing
in the slightest.

1031
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,960
I literally can't remember
which one's the real Brussel.

1032
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,320
I reckon it's that one.

1033
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,240
Little sticker to put on the side,
Bake Off Bucket and Fried Turkey.

1034
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,120
ROSIE: I need to season,
season things, and gravy.

1035
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,560
Right, we are getting there.

1036
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,760
Sprouts, Brussels, carrots, peas,
Yorkie puds, gravy.

1037
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,960
You can't skimp
for a Christmas dinner.

1038
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,880
I don't have fried chicken on
Christmas Day. That would be stupid.

1039
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,960
I've just got to pour my gravy.
I think that's it.

1040
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,200
Here you go.

1041
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,760
Bakers, your time is up.

1042
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,520
Please step away
from your showstoppers.

1043
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,160
A little bit messy,
but I'm pretty happy.

1044
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,040
HE CHUCKLES

1045
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,160
Sure, it does not look great,
but it will be delicious.

1046
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,000
Fingers crossed.

1047
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,680
It's clever, it's clever.

1048
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,040
It's very clever and it's very witty
and it's unusual.

1049
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,800
It just has to taste good now.
Yes, indeed.

1050
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,960
What sponge did you use for this?

1051
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,320
It's cardamom sponge.

1052
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,880
Vanilla Swiss meringue buttercream

1053
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,480
and some fresh raspberries
running through it.

1054
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,000
That sponge is lovely.
The sponge is delicious.

1055
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,200
Perfect. It's a nice cake, actually,
blended together.

1056
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,760
Mm. These biscuits look good.

1057
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,560
Breaking very easily.

1058
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,480
They're really nice. The chocolate's
just soft enough. Yeah.

1059
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,200
Biscuits are beautiful. It's very
delicate and melts in the mouth.

1060
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,400
Clever. What's the spaghetti like?

1061
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,840
It's strange, cos it's
quite rubbery, isn't it?

1062
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,680
Actually, the spaghetti melts
in your mouth. It's fine.

1063
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,280
Do you know, Ruby, I think
you've done a fantastic job.

1064
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,680
Your baking is terrific. Thank you.

1065
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,360
Overall, you've come up
with some really neat ideas.

1066
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,880
Very good. Thank you. Thanks
very much. Well done. Thank you.

1067
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,800
What a relief!

1068
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,040
It does look like fried turkey.
Big lumps of turkey.

1069
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,960
Big lumps of it, yeah. Slabs.

1070
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,760
That's rather impressive, isn't it?

1071
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,440
A bit thick, that fondant
round the edge.

1072
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,240
It's odd for me to say this,

1073
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,600
cos there's so much buttercream
and icing,

1074
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,000
but the cake itself
is not very sweet at all.

1075
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,440
Quite bitter, isn't it?
Yeah. Oh, goodness me.

1076
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,280
Not good. No. No, it's OK,
it's not bad. OK.

1077
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,480
It's not a bad cake. It's just...
It's bitter, which I didn't expect.

1078
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,040
The churros actually
look like churros.

1079
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,360
Rather than chips. You should have
had a smooth piping nozzle.

1080
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,760
I can't resist them.
They are the most delicious things.

1081
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,600
I liked yours. And the mousse...

1082
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,360
This is a very strange
Christmas feast.

1083
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,480
Oh, I love that.

1084
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,920
Yeah, it's very good. Oh, yay.

1085
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,360
I think it's a clever design,

1086
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,080
and you did complete what you said
you were going to do.

1087
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,640
It's astonishing. It's incredible.

1088
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,600
You see a lot of novelty cakes
out there, and this qualifies

1089
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,560
as some of the professional levels.

1090
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,120
This is really, really good.
Thank you.

1091
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,080
Some of the best illusion stuff
we've seen in the tent.

1092
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,720
I think it's wonderful.
I love the Yorkshire cheesecakes

1093
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,520
and, do you know what,
I can't help myself,

1094
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,440
I just want this
to be mash and gravy.

1095
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,440
THEY LAUGH

1096
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,760
It's delicious as mousse.

1097
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,760
It is amazing, cos you do think
it's going to be mash.

1098
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,200
Oh, it's lovely.

1099
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,600
My main cake is
chocolate orange sponge

1100
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,360
with a Swiss meringue buttercream.

1101
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,040
Oh, beautiful. Look at that.

1102
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,600
They're beautifully neat.

1103
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,560
You seem to have a similar
consistency all the way through.

1104
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,400
The citrus flavours
that you've got in there,

1105
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,080
that orange really lifts it.
It's quite a light sponge as well,

1106
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,000
isn't it? There's not too much
of the sugar paste on the outside,

1107
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,680
which is nice. It's neat.

1108
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,920
I really think the texture
is absolutely lovely,

1109
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,400
and I love the buttercream.

1110
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,040
I want to try this cheesecake.

1111
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,960
It's lovely.

1112
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,480
Amazing job.
Really, I can't fault it.

1113
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,840
If I'm going to be really picky,
the Brussels sprouts don't really

1114
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,880
look like Brussels sprouts.
The colours are wrong.

1115
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,280
But the overall look, and the gravy

1116
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,840
and the mash and the turkey -
superb. A big success.

1117
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,640
Terrific success. Thanks very much,
indeed. Thank you. Well done.

1118
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,480
Well done, Rosie.

1119
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,240
Forgot this, too.

1120
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,880
APPLAUSE

1121
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,440
I've not done that before.

1122
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,960
Well done, bakers.

1123
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,400
Now, if you want to step outside,
we're all going to sit down

1124
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,360
and talk about you
behind your back.

1125
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,080
CHEERING

1126
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,920
Here to witness
the Star Baker announcement

1127
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,800
are a limited number of friends
and family for cake and bubbly

1128
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,520
in their socially-distanced bubbles.

1129
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,040
Well, that's the bake to go out on,
isn't it?

1130
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,600
Finally got a handshake. Literally
couldn't have been any better.

1131
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,080
Perfect way to end.

1132
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,320
I'm chuffed with that.

1133
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,400
There were some mixed comments
but there was nothing horrendous.

1134
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,760
Think Prue warmed up a bit.

1135
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,760
She didn't say anything bad
about the way it looked, really.

1136
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,240
Fantastic judging. Lovely
comments from both Paul and Prue.

1137
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,720
I love that Prue got
the real Brussels sprout.

1138
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,560
Payback after a full season
of Bake Off.

1139
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,400
Prue said my baking was terrific,
and I will take that.

1140
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,440
I always wanted to impress Prue
last year, and I've done it

1141
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,760
at Christmas time,
so what a lovely little present!

1142
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,920
Well, well, well. 'Tis the season
to be jolly, and we have been jolly.

1143
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,040
We have.
I'm now feeling slightly sick.

1144
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,560
Well, you did eat a lot.
You really gorged yourself there.

1145
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,840
I did. I did.

1146
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,240
I thought the effect everybody
set out to do they accomplished,

1147
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,920
and that's a big thing.

1148
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,560
It's nice to see they've all
improved since they left the tent.

1149
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,760
So, who's in the lead here?
Who's in the running?

1150
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,920
I think Rosie's edged it
coming into today,

1151
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,880
but has she done enough to win it
altogether after the Showstopper?

1152
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,800
I don't know. I thought Ruby
has a really good chance.

1153
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,160
She let herself down a little bit
on the Technical, but she did bounce

1154
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,880
back on the Showstopper today.

1155
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,360
And I think James has done enough
as well. He's got better.

1156
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,760
You know, even Jamie...
Leave it out, will you?

1157
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,600
I know Jamie won't make Star Baker,
but the truth is that

1158
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,160
if you look at that lot,
it's all worth the calories.

1159
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,200
Well, there's only one Star Baker,

1160
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,680
but there's also one star presenter.

1161
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,920
And that is dear Tom Allen, who
so kindly joined us. Thank you, Tom.

1162
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,840
Oh... Well, it was my pleasure.

1163
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,040
There was no room at the inn, so
they said, "There's a tent round

1164
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,080
"the back. Would you like to go
and present there?"

1165
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,680
You've been amazing filling in.
I have, haven't I?

1166
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,280
I've been like a delicious
buttercream. Not as tasty as Noel.

1167
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,080
No, I'm not as tasty as Noel.
You're right.

1168
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,160
I'm a bitter bit of cake,
and I don't mind that.

1169
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,720
CHEERING

1170
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,480
Bakers, thanks so much
for returning to the tent.

1171
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,120
You've all been amazing
but, of course,

1172
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,240
there can only be one winner.

1173
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,240
So it is my pleasure to announce
that the winner

1174
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,480
of The Great Christmas Bake Off
is...

1175
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,240
..Rosie!

1176
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,800
CHEERING

1177
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,920
I can't really believe it, to be
honest. I'm so happy, so happy.

1178
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,720
It's just the perfect end
to a lovely couple of days.

1179
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,240
PRUE: Well done, Rosie.

1180
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,760
A round of applause
for all of our bakers.

1181
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,080
I'm so pleased for Rosie,

1182
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,360
because she never won
Star Baker and, of course,

1183
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,440
she never had a handshake, and she
achieved both of those things today.

the same as I do.

1220
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,040
I woke up this morning and
I just felt physically sick.

1221
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,800
..we're celebrating the New Year...

1222
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,960
I've come back to haunt you.
I'm so weird.

1223
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,840
..with a festive baking frenzy...

1224
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,320
I recommend you use
something called an oven.

1225
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,120
..taking on a fruity Signature...

1226
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,240
I'm just having a squeeze
of your plums.

1227
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,480
..a street-food Technical...
This is hell.

1228
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,960
..and a Showstopper
for a big birthday.

1229
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,320
My 21st was in 1975.

1230
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,760
Who will be the first
Star Baker of 2021?

1231
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,360
It's harder than it looks, actually.

1232
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,600
PFFT!
