00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,400
Hello, it's Dessert Week.
I wonder where Matt is.

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,160
Welcome to <i>The Great British Baking Show.</i>

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,080
Cherry Bakewell,
have you seen Matt Lucas?

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,400
No, I haven't.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,080
- Can you tell him I'm looking for him?
- Okay.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,919
- I love you a little bit.
- I don't mind you.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,199
<i>Now, the quarter final.</i>

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,559
Oh! Help, help, help.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,760
<i>It's all about desserts.</i>

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,080
Jeepers creepers. That's not awful.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,520
They're not set. Great.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,960
- <i>The bakers hope cheesecakes...</i>
- Whoa...

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,559
<i>...don't leave them
feeling cheesed off.</i>

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,120
They're sinking back in on themselves.
That's concerning.

15
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:50,760
- <i>They have to elevate jelly...</i>
- Wow, that's tremendous.

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,160
<i>...to new heights
of baking artistry.</i>

17
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:55,800
I think it is completely beautiful.

18
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,640
<i>And they're
taken back to the 17th century...</i>

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,519
Got a leakage situation.

20
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:03,480
<i>...in an old-school
suet-and-citrus technical.</i>

21
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:07,160
- I am having a suet breakdown.
- Why? Why?

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,000
One step away from...

23
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,320
One, two, three, quarter finals!

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,080
I didn't think
I would make it through to this week,

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,680
and I was telling the other bakers,
"I left a few eggs in my fridge,

26
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,680
thinking I'll come back
to those."

27
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,720
They won't be good now, will they?

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,360
- Quarter finalist.
- That's cool, innit?

29
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,600
All my family are super proud of me
that I've managed to get this far.

30
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,839
Yeah, madness, innit?

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,520
Suddenly you realise there is
a possibility I could be in the final,

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
and that's a little bit scary.

33
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:01,960
This week
is kind of nerve-wracking.

34
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,679
There's been some practice
that hasn't gone so well,

35
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,320
so it's the week
that I'm most unsure about so far.

36
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,920
Hello, bakers.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,440
Today, the judges would love you to make
12 identical, baked mini cheesecakes.

38
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:19,880
Mini ones?

39
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,920
- I know.
- Aw.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,840
Your disappointingly small cheesecakes
should have a baked filling.

41
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,239
Your virtually
invisible cheesecakes

42
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,560
should have a base
that is made from scratch.

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,080
Hardly worth it.
You have two and a half hours.

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,880
- On your marks...
- Get set...

45
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,120
Bake.

46
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,440
I think it's only my mum
that doesn't like cheesecakes.

47
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,200
I don't eat many cheesecakes.
I have an aversion to cheese in general.

48
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,320
I've made
a New York-style cheesecake,

49
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,440
but that did have that massive
Grand Canyon crack down it.

50
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,480
It's the quarter finals.
Actually, this is where the bakers

51
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,360
really do have to
take it up a couple of notches.

52
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,519
I want the cheesecake filling
to be full of flavour but silky smooth.

53
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,160
For the base, I'd like to have
a little bit more texture to it.

54
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,760
Just stirring some oats in a pan,
making a lovely oaty crumble.

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,239
The top should be very decorative

56
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,120
and there must be good flavour.

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,160
It's tiny, so you want a punch.

58
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,040
Got to do
a lot of multitasking today.

59
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,080
We're asking for 12 of them
and they are to be very exquisite.

60
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,600
It has to look beautiful.

61
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:28,880
We've got five bakers remaining
and all of them are Star Bakers this year.

62
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,000
It's the first time it's happened,
so I'm expecting some sublime bakes.

63
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,440
What could go wrong?

64
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,959
Gosh, can't see a thing out of those.

65
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,200
- Good morning, Peter.
- Good morning.

66
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,799
- Hello.
- Cheesecakes.

67
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,320
What have you decided to do?

68
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:47,079
I'm making, er,
ginger-and-lime cheesecakes.

69
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,359
So it's key lime pie-esque.

70
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,519
Key lime pie vibes.

71
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,720
Pretty much what I would've chosen to do.

72
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,799
Oh, that's good.

73
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,440
You've just got to do it right now.

74
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,720
<i>Peter's tiny take
on one of Paul's favourite desserts</i>

75
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,720
<i>will see baked lime cheesecakes
on an oat and gingernut biscuit base,</i>

76
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,760
<i>delicately decorated with
crystallised ginger and dots of lime curd.</i>

77
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:10,519
This is the first
baked one that I've made.

78
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,040
I think I made a couple
of set ones at school in Home Ec, maybe.

79
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,320
Baby-faced assassin. Come on.

80
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,880
If you're not in the final,
I'll be disappointed.

81
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,320
Making
a traditional digestive base.

82
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,800
<i>All great cheesecakes
start with a delicious biscuit.</i>

83
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,960
I've never made a biscuit
for my cheesecake before.

84
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:30,760
Don't know who does that,
but it's a challenge.

85
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,680
Right, what's next?

86
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
Oh!

87
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,960
Good job I made more, isn't it? Whoopsie.

88
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,440
<i>Laura's honey-and-oat biscuit</i>

89
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,080
<i>will form the base of her vanilla-
and-passion fruit cheesecakes.</i>

90
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,960
<i>With a topping
of firm-set passion fruit curd,</i>

91
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,120
<i>she's hoping to avoid a repeat
of last week's meltdown.</i>

92
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,840
Been having nightmares
about that ice cream cake, to be honest.

93
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,280
- Like, loads.
- So have I.

94
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,240
I don't wanna make any more mistakes now.

95
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,200
- Just focus now.
- That's the plan.

96
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,599
- All right.
- Good luck.

97
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,800
Thank you.

98
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,200
<i>While everyone's biscuits
will be flavoured differently...</i>

99
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,320
I'm getting the pulp
out of the passion fruit.

100
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,120
<i>...there's a common theme
emerging to the bit that goes on top.</i>

101
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,280
I've just added in passion fruit extract

102
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,520
and it just gives it
a bit more va-va-voom.

103
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,039
We're all doing
our own interpretation of passion fruit.

104
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,080
- Morning, Dave.
- Good morning.

105
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,400
Tell us
about your mini cheesecakes.

106
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,919
I'm calling it a citrus cheesecake.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,080
The filling will be a traditional
lemon cheesecake filling.

108
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,919
And then on top there will be
a passion fruit and orange glaze.

109
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,640
<i>Dave's adding orange juice
and zest to his shortbread biscuit,</i>

110
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,800
<i>topping each cheesecake with lime kisses,</i>

111
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,359
<i>and setting his passion fruit
and orange glaze with gelatine.</i>

112
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,960
Quite a lot of gelatine.

113
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,039
I've found, because of the citrusness
of the orange and passion fruit,

114
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,960
it sometimes doesn't set properly.

115
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,560
Rather than cutting down the citrus,
you add more gelatine?

116
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,440
- Yeah.
- I'm playing golf later.

117
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,640
Maybe I could use one of your cheesecakes.

118
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,720
<i>Cheesecakes should offer
a mouth-watering blend</i>

119
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,720
<i>of contrasting textures.</i>

120
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,080
A nice crunch at the bottom.
Nice soft filling,

121
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,960
then hopefully, a nice,
easy cut-able glaze on the top.

122
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,560
<i>Everyone's using moulds
to support these layers during baking.</i>

123
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,240
You need a bit of structure there
to support the cheesy creamy filling.

124
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,799
<i>And reigning Star Baker Hermine</i>

125
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,599
<i>is making her mould
part of her presentation.</i>

126
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,760
I like anything to do with jars.
I make my own jam at home.

127
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,160
I quite like to decorate them cutely.

128
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,479
<i>Hermine's hoping her mini jam jars</i>

129
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,200
<i>will produce perfect cheesecakes as well.</i>

130
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,720
<i>Her combination of a cinnamon-biscuit base</i>

131
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:42,000
<i>and a curd decorated
with meringue kisses and lime zest</i>

132
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,320
<i>will also be the third
signature flavoured with passion fruit.</i>

133
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,479
Oh.

134
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,359
There's a battle of passion fruit
in the tent, it seems.

135
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,080
I don't really like passion fruit.

136
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,680
- No?
- No. I've sort of gone off it.

137
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
- Really?
- He's lying.

138
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,440
Don't worry, Hermine. He loves it.

139
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,799
So you'll leave them
in the jar, then, will you?

140
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,280
- I will leave them in the jar.
- Okay, that's interesting.

141
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:04,799
It should be wonderful. Good.

142
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,359
- Thank you, Hermine.
- Thank you.

143
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,760
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

144
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,479
Bakers, you are halfway through.

145
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh, that's not good.

146
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,200
- Matthew.
- Yes.

147
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,400
- I'd like you to meet one of my friends.
- Ooh, yes.

148
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,599
Couple of series ago, there was a guy
called Mr Spoon that was here.

149
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,176
- Yeah, I loved him.
- He went missing.

150
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,360
- Do you remember him?
- I do.

151
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,520
- Well, this is his cousin.
- Ooh! Hello.

152
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,880
- Would you like to touch him?
- Yes, what's his name?

153
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,440
His name is, er, Andre.

154
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,120
- Andre Spoon.
- Andre.

155
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,200
I need to
get down to business now.

156
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,919
Just filling up my
cheesecakes with the topping.

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,120
Just trying to get it as even as possible.

158
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,479
<i>How the mini
cheesecakes are baked...</i>

159
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,719
Bain-marie helps
get a better textured cheesecake.

160
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:47,359
I didn't go down the bain-marie route.
Might regret that.

161
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,000
<i>...is critical in determining
the silky smooth-filling texture</i>

162
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,640
<i>that Paul and Prue are looking for.</i>

163
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:55,520
Rinky-dink. We are good to go.

164
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,479
- <i>Once in the oven...</i>
- Low and slow.

165
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,719
<i>...precision with
temperature and timings is crucial.</i>

166
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:06,159
Ten minutes, and then
I reduce it another ten minutes.

167
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:08,280
They're very temperamental little things.

168
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:09,560
Okay, get these in.

169
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,760
<i>Marc is the only
baker going citrus-free.</i>

170
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,120
Vanilla cheesecake is my favourite.

171
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,120
There's nowhere to hide with it,
so I'm hoping I can pull it off

172
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,799
and make it a good cheesecake.

173
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,080
<i>He's bringing pecans,
apricots and almond</i>

174
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:27,719
<i>to a vanilla-and-mascarpone take
on the classic New York-baked cheesecake.</i>

175
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,359
Why don't we take this show
and put it on Broadway,

176
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,199
and turn it into a musical?

177
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,440
- Do you sing?
- No.

178
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,080
- Well, don't let that stop you.
- Okay.

179
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,535
What's the first number?

180
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:57,440
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

181
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,520
- That ain't very long, is it?
- How was that?

182
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,680
I don't know what that means.
He's been in a lot of therapy.

183
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,160
Difficult to tell.

184
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,480
There's a pretty fine line between over-
and underbaked on the cheesecakes.

185
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,040
If you overbake them,
they're gonna start cracking.

186
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,839
Underbaked, and you're
gonna get some weird eggy mixture

187
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,760
that doesn't set, and it's gonna be gross.

188
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,320
Got a bit of a dip in the middle.

189
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,520
You could've warned me.
I've inhaled quite a lot of steam.

190
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,760
You just let off some kettles in my face.

191
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,079
Look all right.

192
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,040
How can you tell?
You need to put something in them.

193
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,920
Gosh, yeah, they're ready.
Maybe a little bit too much.

194
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,360
<i>The cooling of the cheesecakes
is another baking balancing act.</i>

195
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,120
You can't trust a cheesecake.

196
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:39,040
- <i>If rushed...</i>
- A few cracked.

197
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,320
<i>...there's a risk
of cracking and dipping.</i>

198
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,880
They're sinking back in
on themselves quite a lot.

199
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,600
Not exactly the sight
that we were wanting to see.

200
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,959
<i>If cooled too slowly...</i>

201
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,680
Turned the oven off. I'll let
them cool down in the oven.

202
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,360
Leave them there as long as possible.

203
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,480
<i>...the mini
cheesecakes won't set in time</i>

204
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,120
<i>to support the toppings and decorations.</i>

205
00:09:57,199 --> 00:09:58,640
And now we watch them.

206
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,000
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

207
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,839
They're just about set.
Now my passion fruit coulis.

208
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,199
The curd's pretty thin.
That's slightly concerning.

209
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,320
It's quite central to the decoration.

210
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,959
Do I just melt a tiny bit of butter
and add that in?

211
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,480
Yeah, I'm gonna give that a shot.

212
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,360
- I think they're set.
- They need longer.

213
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,920
They're gonna collapse otherwise.

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,160
- Very neat.
- Thank you.

215
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,760
- I've gotta release them yet.
- Gotta release them.

216
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,560
- Gotta release them...
- Fly, my pretties.

217
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,760
Whoa, that's hot.

218
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,280
Turning-out time.

219
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,320
No, they're not set.

220
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,160
How long have we got left?

221
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,040
Bakers, you only have five minutes left.

222
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,600
Can you ask Mr Spoon
to get out of my chair, please?

223
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,520
- He's just relaxing.
- I just don't trust him.

224
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,959
All right.

225
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,959
The curd is not good

226
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,040
and I shouldn't have added that butter,
so I think it's not usable.

227
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,280
Yeah, we're looking
for taste on this, I think.

228
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,800
Mr Spoon didn't like
how that last time call went.

229
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,760
- I don't like Mr Spoon.
- He wants an apology.

230
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,160
He's not getting one from me.

231
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,880
- Do you like him?
- Love Mr Spoon.

232
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,839
You do? He wants to kiss you.

233
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,400
Mr Spoon says
he wants to see Peter naked.

234
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,240
Okay. Even more reason
to dislike Mr Spoon.

235
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,640
Whoa, whoa,
whoa... Slippery little buggers.

236
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:23,520
So the gelatine's just about set.
Just hope they turn out well.

237
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Great.

238
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,520
I've got a bit
of lime syrup in here.

239
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,640
This is baking on the fly, definitely.

240
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:30,920
Come on.

241
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,400
It's not gonna be that refined,
I must admit.

242
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
They're a little bit squidgy.

243
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,520
The next layer
is the meringue kisses.

244
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Bakers, you have one minute left.

245
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,480
Gosh, one minute to go.

246
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,199
I'm getting the shakes now.

247
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,040
Okay. Let's just do what we can.

248
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:54,560
I'm filling them more than planned

249
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,120
due to the rather
cratering dip in the middle.

250
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:01,880
They just didn't set in time. Rubbish.

251
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,839
Bakers, your time is up.

252
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,240
Please place your mini cheesecakes
at the end of your work stations.

253
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,280
Think they're actually still warm.
I think they'll taste nice.

254
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,800
<i>The baked cheesecakes will now
face the scrutiny of Prue and Paul.</i>

255
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,280
- Hi, Dave.
- Hello.

256
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Hi, Dave. Right.

257
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,120
I think they look very neat.
They do look very good.

258
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:50,199
Thank you.

259
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,000
They cut neatly.

260
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,199
The custard middle, I think,
is absolutely delicious

261
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,440
and the texture's perfect.

262
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,360
Thank you.

263
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,640
The jelly is
surprisingly thick and I like it.

264
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,920
I was worried
about the amount of gelatine.

265
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,800
Did you hold back
or did you put it all in?

266
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
I did put it all in.

267
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,920
I was expecting it to be
a little bit rubbery.

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,720
- But it wasn't, 'cause it did melt.
- Yeah.

269
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,400
I think you've done a good job.
You've ticked all the boxes.

270
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,536
- It's neat. And it tastes good.
- Thank you, cheers.

271
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,599
- Well done.
- Thank you.

272
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,360
They do look really pretty.

273
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,599
They look amazing.

274
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:36,079
It's a bit stodgy.

275
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,440
It's not as silky as I'd hoped.

276
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,040
The base is very soft.

277
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,280
There's no way that base could
be solid in the bottom of that

278
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,160
because it's gonna sweat in there.

279
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,440
The moisture from the cheesecake filling
will drop in there and soften it up.

280
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,199
There's not enough lime in there.

281
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
Or passion fruit.

282
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,040
- Or passion fruit.
- Hmm.

283
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,959
It looks good. Thank you.

284
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,160
Thank you.

285
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,040
- They're not canapé size.
- Okay.

286
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,040
I would've done it
slightly bigger than the apricot.

287
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,000
- That's too big and too thin.
- Yeah.

288
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,680
You don't get any apricot at all
until you hit the apricot.

289
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,160
- Don't get the vanilla, either.
- Really? Oh, no.

290
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,439
It needed to be smaller,
packed with more flavour.

291
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,920
More vanilla.

292
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,920
- And just look much neater.
- Sure, okay.

293
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,800
The apricot should've been everywhere

294
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,160
'cause when you get a bit of
apricot with it, it was truly delicious.

295
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
- Sure, okay.
- Thank you.

296
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:34,479
Thank you.

297
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Well done.

298
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,760
Hmm. It doesn't
look like a cheesecake. Erm...

299
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,599
- Oh.
- The mixture itself must be delicate.

300
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,199
It has formed a little cauldron.

301
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,160
There's your cheesecake.
Look at the ridge round there.

302
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,839
You've dropped a lot of height on that.

303
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,880
I think the flavour is absolutely lovely.

304
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,199
But the shape of it's not perfect.

305
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,360
I'm getting the lime.
The ginger's very light.

306
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,360
It's a nice flavour but it is lime.
I'm not getting much ginger

307
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:12,719
and it doesn't look
the best thing you've done.

308
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,839
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

309
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,640
Don't apologise to them.

310
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,640
So, Laura, just remind us
what's in your cheesecakes?

311
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,719
It's a vanilla cheesecake
with an oat-and-honey base,

312
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,760
passion fruit curd
and a passion fruit and mango...

313
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,280
what's supposed to be a compote on top
but it's a bit of a mudslide.

314
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,736
- I'm so sorry.
- Looks a bit messy.

315
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,240
What I like is the ratio
to the base and height

316
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,680
and that's pretty consistent
however wobbly they are.

317
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,880
I hope you like the taste.
I think they're nice.

318
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:52,680
Mmm, it's delicious.

319
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,959
- Yay.
- That's fantastic.

320
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,800
The textures are all there from the top
to the cheesecake to the base

321
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,319
which you actually break through.

322
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,520
And the passion fruit's there
but not overwhelming.

323
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:05,280
There's absolutely nothing
the matter with this...

324
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:06,680
except the look.

325
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,079
- I'll take that. Thank you.
- Thank you, Laura.

326
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,520
- Well done.
- Thank you.

327
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,680
I feel great after that.

328
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,800
Wasn't expecting that,
to be honest.

329
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,599
I was expecting to get rinsed.

330
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,719
Oh!

331
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,760
When Prue
and Paul say it's delicious

332
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:24,280
and you've got the textures right,

333
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,640
that is like, yeah, box ticked.

334
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,680
I'm disappointed with that.
Quite in there.

335
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,079
I really did go into this pretty blind.

336
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,839
It wasn't the best bake
but we'll have to see.

337
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,240
<i>For the next challenge,</i>

338
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:47,599
<i>the bakers face a mystery
wrapped in enigmatic gingham.</i>

339
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,920
Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.

340
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,359
It's time for your technical challenge

341
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:56,280
and today, it's been set
for you by the lovely Prue.

342
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:57,920
Prue, any words of wisdom?

343
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,199
You are all excellent bakers,

344
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,560
so we haven't given you
any extra ingredients.

345
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,720
Get it right the first time.

346
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,919
As ever, the technical challenge
will be judged blind

347
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,680
so we're gonna ask
these two poppets to leave the tent.

348
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,560
- Off you go.
- Just do one, will ya?

349
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,599
This is our park, we play here.

350
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,640
They've got their own park.

351
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,280
Prue has popped back
to the 1700s for this technical.

352
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:26,760
She would like you each to make
two Sussex pond puddings.

353
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,040
Pond puddings. I'm imagining frog spawn.

354
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,880
Ugh. Your puddings should
be made with suet pastry

355
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,600
and when steamed should be golden.

356
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,159
When cut into,
the fillings should ooze out...

357
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,720
- Hmm.
- ...creating a lemony, syrupy pond.

358
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,880
Hmm, yeah.

359
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,480
You should also serve
a silky smooth crème anglaise.

360
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,960
You have two and a half hours.
On your marks...

361
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,560
- Get set...
- Bake.

362
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,840
Never heard of
a Sussex pond pudding.

363
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,919
I think my nan would probably know
what it was. Can I call her?

364
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,240
Like probably everyone else,
never seen it before.

365
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,880
I think it's just
an encased pastry with...

366
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,560
by the sounds of it, a whole lemon inside.

367
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,760
So, our quarter final
technical challenge

368
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,200
is Sussex pond pudding.

369
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,880
A particular favourite of mine.

370
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,560
This is not
the prettiest pudding in the world,

371
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,680
but it's sort of surprising
because there's a whole lemon inside.

372
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,640
Two and a half hours
for this challenge.

373
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,360
Where do you think they'll go wrong?

374
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,679
Suet pastry is not the easiest pastry
to deal with because it's so pliable.

375
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
And if it's too floppy, it will tear.

376
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,760
Squidge.

377
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,000
How do they know when it's ready?

378
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,440
You haven't given any time.

379
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,720
They should steam it
for as long as they've got...

380
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,159
an hour and a half, two hours.

381
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,520
Puddings like this
go back so far in British history.

382
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,880
Steamed puddings is
what we were known for.

383
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,720
That sharpness from the lemon,

384
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,840
the sweetness from
the sugar and the butter,

385
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,760
rich pastry that melts in the mouth
and this gorgeous crème anglaise,

386
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,919
silky smooth and that kick of vanilla
as well, it's delicious.

387
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,320
I think it's beautiful.

388
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:03,280
We've got five great bakers in that tent.

389
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,679
Can't wait to see what they come up with
'cause this is delicious.

390
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,720
"Make the pastry."

391
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,679
The suet looks like cheese.
What am I supposed to do with that?

392
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,640
Suet is the lovely protective fat

393
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,960
from animals that surrounds the livers,
the kidneys.

394
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,080
Yum-yum. Never used suet.
I don't really eat meat.

395
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,880
I mean, does anybody
even eat this in 2020?

396
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,919
I made suet dumplings quite a few times.

397
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,320
- Suet dumplings.
- Oh, they're good.

398
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:34,440
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

399
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,840
Lighter than you think.
You can move after six hours.

400
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,520
So it just says "whole milk".
This is really helpful.

401
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,280
Doesn't even tell you how much
milk you're supposed to add.

402
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,800
This is evil.

403
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,880
So I'm just gonna add it bit by bit until
it comes into a nice, pliable soft pastry.

404
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,080
Why? Why? Why would Prue do this to me?

405
00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:58,200
- She's trying...
- Why?

406
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,440
...to test you.

407
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,640
You're having a breakdown.

408
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,200
- I am having...
- Why? Why?

409
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,000
...a suet breakdown.

410
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,960
One...

411
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,760
Logical part of me says
make it like a normal pastry,

412
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,919
so don't overwork it, keep it cold.

413
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,720
So I'm gonna let it rest a little bit.

414
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,480
I have no idea if that's right.

415
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
So I've made suet pastry before.

416
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,679
We need to knead it until really smooth.

417
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,720
I'm also kneading.

418
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,600
Following blindly.

419
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,480
"Prepare and line
the pudding moulds,"

420
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,440
which I've interpreted as butter

421
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,919
and line with flour,

422
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,440
'cause on the ingredients it says,

423
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,800
"Self-raising flour
plus extra for dusting."

424
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,720
I've greased the sides, I'm putting
a baking parchment circle at the bottom.

425
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,600
It's a bit tricky
'cause you've got a tapered bowl.

426
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,440
It can't be too creased in there.
You want nice, smooth pudding.

427
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,800
What went through your mind when you heard
you had to make a Sussex pond pudding?

428
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,120
Little bit of panic.

429
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,240
You panicked about making
the pond pudding?

430
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,640
Is that what happened? Is it?

431
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,200
- That's what happened.
- Fair enough.

432
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,480
"Step three,
line the moulds with pastry,

433
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,120
reserving some for the lids."

434
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,640
It's not very even, is it?

435
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,520
And they want precision.

436
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,600
I'll do that one again.

437
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,640
So, now I've gotta make the filling.

438
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,440
"Mix butter and sugar together."

439
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,360
It's like the most unhealthy
dessert imaginable.

440
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,840
Fatty suety pastry
and then a filling of butter and sugar.

441
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,600
I mean, it's gonna taste good.

442
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,399
Place some in the base
of the pudding moulds.

443
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,320
It feels like it might be
quite heavy, in a medieval way.

444
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:35,000
Yes, definitely very medieval.

445
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,520
"Prick the lemons
and place them in the pastry-lined mould."

446
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,159
How much pricking
am I supposed to do?

447
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,480
I think a lot of pricks.

448
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,960
I don't fancy eating
a whole lemon in a bit of pastry.

449
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,360
Sorry, Prue, but that's not how
we do it in Gravesend.

450
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:56,000
And then it says, "Cover with
the remaining butter and sugar."

451
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,919
One for you. One for me.

452
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,360
One other for you, and one for me.
There you go.

453
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:04,880
We're all done.

454
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,120
"Top the pastry with lids and seal."

455
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,080
Putting a bit of milk on to try and
get it to stick a bit better to the top.

456
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,159
Right, do we crimp or do we not crimp?
Is he crimping?

457
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,480
I'm just trying to crimp the...
Oh, dang it.

458
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,520
I'm messing it up a little bit,
to be honest.

459
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,919
It doesn't say to crimp it
but Paul loves a crimp, don't he?

460
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,200
Don't know if it'll look nice
but I was thinking of

461
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,960
pressing it down slightly
with a fork like you do with a pie.

462
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,280
"Cut two circles of paper

463
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,520
and two circles of foil larger than
the top of the pudding moulds."

464
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,919
That's not quite a circle, is it?

465
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,439
The only thing I'm confused about
is the next step now.

466
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,679
Where it says, "Fold a pleat
into the centre then cover."

467
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,800
I don't understand
this pleat business.

468
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,880
- It's quite minimal.
- Very minimal.

469
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,120
Just words, aren't they?
"Go, do, now. Thanks."

470
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,800
Prue, not worth the calories.

471
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,159
What's everyone doing?

472
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,360
I've gotta pleat...

473
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,280
Just comes undone.

474
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,320
Yeah, so it's that. So that when
the steam rises, it goes like that.

475
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:12,040
There's room for it to expand.

476
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,480
I forgot that.

477
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,040
"Cover the mould
with the pleated paper and foil,

478
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,080
secure with string,
looping it around the rim

479
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:21,480
then across the top to make a handle."

480
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,399
<i>The string needs to hold
the foil tightly in place</i>

481
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,280
<i>to prevent moisture getting into
the pastry, making it soggy.</i>

482
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,240
Marc's done a lot of climbing,
so he'll be good with these knots.

483
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Could even go for
a figure of eight.

484
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:36,480
Damn it.

485
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,439
I feel ungentlemanly not helping

486
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,360
but I think it wouldn't be
in the spirit of the competition.

487
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:43,439
Can you cross your fingers?
There we go. It's done.

488
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,440
- It worked.
- I think... Wait, actually, wait...

489
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,080
I can't... I've got to uncross them.

490
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,000
- No.
- But I can't...

491
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,560
Cross them again. Keep them crossed.

492
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,159
There we go.

493
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,040
It just pushes off.

494
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:59,560
Bakers, you are halfway
through your pond puddings.

495
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,520
It says, "Make a handle."
I'm gonna just do it my way.

496
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,439
"Place the moulds
in the steamer and steam."

497
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,159
How long you gonna steam for?

498
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,000
An hour?

499
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:12,399
Don't ask me.

500
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,120
Probably an hour-fifty in the end.

501
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,640
Do you ever have dim sum?

502
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,560
They steam those, don't they, sometimes?

503
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,480
They nice?

504
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,240
Well, I like dim some of them.

505
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,480
Nice.

506
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,200
How long did that one take you?

507
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Took me... Well, we workshopped it.

508
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,240
Then I decided not to use it.

509
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,320
So the only thing left to do is

510
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:34,240
to make a crème anglaise.

511
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,919
<i>Crème anglaise is
a combination of egg yolks and sugar</i>

512
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,800
<i>beaten together,
tempered with warm cream and milk</i>

513
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,159
<i>and delicately flavoured with vanilla.</i>

514
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,000
Prue said that
we are not able to do it again,

515
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,640
so if we mess up, that's it.

516
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,919
It says half the vanilla pod.

517
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,640
And I put a full vanilla pod in there.

518
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,280
Let's remove a little bit.

519
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,320
I'm adding my egg yolk
and sugar mixture slowly,

520
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:01,040
or else you end up with scrambled eggs.

521
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,960
<i>While the rest of the bakers
are making their crème anglaise,</i>

522
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,480
<i>Dave hasn't even started steaming.</i>

523
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,480
Gotta try and get this knot in here.

524
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:11,919
I think it's ready 'cause it's thickened.

525
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
That one's not so great.

526
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,520
That's the custard done.

527
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,679
All done.

528
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,240
Whether good or not, we shall find out.

529
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,360
Has everyone else finished apart from me?

530
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:26,520
Yeah.

531
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:32,679
<i>All the bakers can do now is wait.</i>

532
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,159
What can we do?
Surely there's something we can do.

533
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,320
We could do something with string,
couldn't we?

534
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:47,280
We could tie up Peter
and ruin his bake.

535
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,080
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

536
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,520
Half an hour.

537
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,240
Not that you seem that bothered,
you're all just sitting about.

538
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,240
Let's see what it looks like.

539
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,880
So I'm looking for it to be
a little bit more brown

540
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,199
and a little bit sort of crispier.

541
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,000
Just going to neglect the string now.

542
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,360
That's gonna be fine.

543
00:26:07,439 --> 00:26:10,120
- <i>Last to go in...</i>
- Gosh!

544
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:11,800
<i>...Dave is first to come out.</i>

545
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:16,640
So, the last thing to do is
turn out and serve.

546
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Ooh!

547
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:30,480
There you go, some pond puddings.

548
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,040
Oh, disgusting.

549
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,800
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

550
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
Five minutes.

551
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,640
I'm gonna take out my pond puddings.

552
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,000
Oh, think it's looking okay.

553
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,159
Lovely, soggy suet.

554
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,439
It's a wet pond in the middle,

555
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,199
so not much structure to it.

556
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,720
I'm gonna turn that now, I think.

557
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:57,080
Well, well. It's a pond pudding.

558
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,040
Bakers, you have one minute left.

559
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,360
Let's try another way of unmoulding it

560
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,720
Ooh. Got a leakage situation.

561
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,800
Pre-cut for them.

562
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,080
It has collapsed.

563
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,919
That's a shame
but it looks rather impressive.

564
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,840
This one's sunk a bit. I did my best.

565
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,280
Okay, bakers, your time is up.

566
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,399
There's a pond, there's a pudding.

567
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,080
If you'd like to bring your puddings

568
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:40,040
and place them
behind your photographs, please.

569
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,159
<i>The bakers'
Sussex pond puddings now face</i>

570
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,320
<i>the exacting judgement of Prue and Paul.</i>

571
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,679
Right, bakers, we were asking for

572
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,240
some well-steamed suet pastry pudding

573
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,840
filled with a whole lemon

574
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,240
and a butter and sugar filling,

575
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,679
and some silky crème anglaise.

576
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
So, what have we got?

577
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,360
Let's start with this one.
It's leaking already.

578
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:10,360
They are whole and you can see the shape,
which is a good thing.

579
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,159
The pastry
would've been really good

580
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,560
if it had had
a little longer in the steamer

581
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,919
because you can see
it's beginning to flake.

582
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,040
That's a bit thin, that sauce.

583
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,159
The taste of everything's okay.

584
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,320
It just needed cooking out
a little bit more.

585
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,880
Now these, erm, pasties...

586
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:28,000
That's raw.

587
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,760
- That looks good custard.
- Yeah.

588
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,040
- Nice and vanilla-y.
- It's nice.

589
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,480
That needed sealing
and longer in the steamer.

590
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,480
Now we have one which needed longer.

591
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,439
- It's fallen apart.
- It's shaped nicely.

592
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Yeah, absolutely.

593
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,320
This one is a little more cooked
but it's still not enough.

594
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:47,480
That lemon is bullet hard.

595
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,879
- The crème anglaise is all right.
- Hmm.

596
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:51,240
- It's a shame.
- Yeah, it is.

597
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,800
Now this one, I'm not quite sure
what happened here,

598
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:56,280
whether it's just collapsed in on itself...
Yeah, it has.

599
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,120
- It's just raw.
- It is.

600
00:28:58,199 --> 00:29:01,840
In another hour, that pastry
would've been flaky and lovely.

601
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,720
The crème anglaise is nice.

602
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,840
It's spot-on.

603
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,959
We have one whole one here.

604
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,360
Let's see if we can
get through the middle of this.

605
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,399
It's not been cooked again.

606
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,879
The problem with under-steaming

607
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:16,840
is the lemon doesn't soften enough,
the juice doesn't come out

608
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,360
and the sauce becomes
more sugar and butter.

609
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:21,040
The flavours are okay.

610
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,840
It's gonna be an interesting judge.

611
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,879
Although the shapes are there,
it's not been steamed long...

612
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:30,040
<i>Prue and Paul will now rank
the puddings from worst to best.</i>

613
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,439
In fifth place is this one.

614
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:36,639
David, this was very under-steamed.

615
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,120
The custard was nice.

616
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:40,320
In fourth spot, we have this one.

617
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,720
Massively under-steamed.

618
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,040
It was falling through
and the lemon was still hard.

619
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:48,000
In third place, Hermine.

620
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,600
The flavour was good
but it needed two hours steaming.

621
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,159
In second spot, we have this one.

622
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,320
- Whose is this?
- Mine.

623
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:59,639
At least you had
two likeable-looking suet puddings

624
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,720
but it needed longer
to break down the lemon and the filling.

625
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,080
Which means that
in first place is this one.

626
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,199
Laura, I wish I could say
it was wonderful,

627
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,040
but it wasn't much better than the rest.

628
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,199
I'm sorry.

629
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,280
It was under-steamed.

630
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,840
Would've been great, custard too thin.

631
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:18,120
We still normally have
a round of applause for the winner.

632
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,199
Came first in a technical,
can you believe that?

633
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,919
I'm not jumping up for joy,
but I'll take that. I'm happy.

634
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,840
I didn't think I'd get second.

635
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:31,240
Was hoping to be last. I'm usually last.

636
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,199
Super smashing great.
Dessert Week not going too well.

637
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:42,439
It's still not an unmitigated disaster
because the crème anglaise was good.

638
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,520
So we'll take that as a win.

639
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:53,639
Well, good luck, everybody.

640
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:59,240
We talk every week now, about the margins
getting slimmer and slimmer and slimmer.

641
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,959
There wasn't that much
in it in the signature,

642
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,159
and we've just had a technical where
everyone pretty much did the same.

643
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,520
My favourite pudding
in the whole world is Sussex pond

644
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,080
and I'll tell you what,
they made a complete mess of it.

645
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,199
But it does occur to me
that I'm 80 years old,

646
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,000
and a steamed pudding, I grew up
with them and I absolutely love them.

647
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,399
And I'm 40 and I...

648
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,159
I still like steamed pudding, too.

649
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,480
Weird. Your hair then
is a lot older than you are.

650
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,320
Fine, all right, move on.

651
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,240
Laura won the technical,

652
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,800
and because she had a strong signature,
she's put herself into a...

653
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:35,679
- In line for Star Baker.
- She has.

654
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,600
Again.

655
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:39,360
You've got Hermine, Marc, and David

656
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,800
who are all in the middle,
could go either way.

657
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:46,120
Peter is at the bottom, which isn't
something we've really seen very often.

658
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:48,600
He's really gotta try his best
in the showstopper

659
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:51,320
because he's sitting
right down at the bottom.

660
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:58,639
Good morning, bakers, welcome back to
the tent for your showstopper challenge.

661
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:03,719
Now today, the judges would like you each
to make a jelly art design cake.

662
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,480
This layered dessert
needs to have a visually spectacular

663
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,120
jelly art topping or coating.

664
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:14,719
At least one element of your cake
should include a baked sponge.

665
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,520
Er, Noel, what jelly art would you make?

666
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,600
Nude sculpture of Paul Hollywood?

667
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,560
Oh. What flavour would the nipples be?

668
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,719
- Lime.
- Oh. Authentic.

669
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,040
Exactly.

670
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,439
You have four and a half hours.

671
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,175
- On your marks...
- Get set...

672
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:29,199
Bake!

673
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,800
I think of eating jelly as, er,
an Anglo-Saxon thing.

674
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,520
I'm ready for the jelly, yeah.

675
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,639
This is a first
for the <i>Bake Off</i> tent.

676
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:45,199
There's a baked element,
a mousse, and then this jelly.

677
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,679
I look forward to the jelly.

678
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,600
It's like going back
to when you were a kid.

679
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:52,399
The setting of the jelly
is really critical.

680
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,879
Most of the bakers, I'm sure,
will use gelatine. They may use agar-agar.

681
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,679
Gelatine is a bit of a scary beast

682
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,840
because you don't know
if it's gonna be enough

683
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:03,439
until you've completed it
and it's set in the fridge.

684
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,159
Too much, it'll be like rubber
and won't break down.

685
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,760
Thirty-five leaves of gelatine.

686
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,600
Thirty-five leaves of pig hide.

687
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:17,879
If you don't have your nail and your hair
growing after this, you've got a problem.

688
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:19,800
Too little, it'll be like water.

689
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:21,879
In my last practice,
I had a bit of a collapse.

690
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,600
To make the jelly art,

691
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:29,879
the bakers need to inject
liquid jelly into set jelly.

692
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,360
It really takes a lot of skill.

693
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:33,959
You bet I'm worried.

694
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,240
The stress levels
are gonna be high.

695
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,560
The bakers are gonna
start thinking of the final.

696
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:40,639
They're only a couple of weeks away now.

697
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,520
I hope it doesn't play
on their mind too much

698
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,360
because what we want
are five amazing bakes

699
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:48,360
from actually five fantastic Star Bakers.

700
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:51,959
Calm, cool, collected Laura
is what you're gonna see today.

701
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,719
Need a bit of skill, a bit of luck.
I'm hoping they all come together today.

702
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,655
- Hello, Marc.
- Hi.

703
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,480
- Morning.
- Tell us about your jelly design cake.

704
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,480
Okay,
so I'm making effectively a mousse cake

705
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,799
with a panna cotta insert in the centre,

706
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,760
dacquoise top and then two layers
of apple with jelly on top.

707
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,560
- Two layers of apple jelly.
- Yeah, two-tier jelly.

708
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,000
This is gonna be interesting.

709
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,080
- Oh.
- As usual,

710
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,319
- you're doing an enormous amount.
- Not again.

711
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,679
Actually, the last time,
you pulled it off and got it out on time.

712
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,600
<i>Marc's chocolate
and strawberry mousses</i>

713
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,239
<i>will be sandwiched between two layers
of ground hazelnut meringue.</i>

714
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,719
<i>His two tiers of jelly will be flavoured</i>

715
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:36,880
<i>with apple and display jelly art roses
and jasmine flowers.</i>

716
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,360
- You're injecting your flowers, are you?
- Yes, yeah.

717
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,639
And have you done this a lot before?

718
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,040
I've not done it a lot.

719
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,480
If you wanna get through to the
semi finals, you've gotta smash this one.

720
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,159
Okay, I'll try my best.

721
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,239
Did that help?

722
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,960
No, not at all.

723
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,799
- It's very ambitious.
- Thanks.

724
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,760
I have some confidence that you'll do it.

725
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,280
It's time to be ambitious.

726
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,400
- I'll try my best.
- It's the time to try.

727
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,520
I've got a bit of orange
and cranberry flavour.

728
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,120
They're mainly clear in colour
and very concentrated,

729
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,960
so it doesn't affect the texture
or the look of the jelly.

730
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,920
<i>All of the bakers
are adding artificial flavourings</i>

731
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,360
<i>to their main jelly features
before setting them in the fridge.</i>

732
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,520
I was originally going
for elderflower,

733
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,120
but realised it tasted
a little bit of smelly feet.

734
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,376
- Did it?
- Yeah.

735
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,200
How often have you eaten feet?

736
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,040
- I've already eaten one.
- That's answered a lot of questions.

737
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,680
Getting quite firm
which is a really good sign.

738
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,319
I'm worried about
jelly not setting enough.

739
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,280
That could be a big issue.

740
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,640
<i>With the large elements setting,</i>

741
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,920
<i>most of the bakers are making the coloured
jelly they'll use to make the jelly art.</i>

742
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,480
This is becoming
more and more blood-like isn't it?

743
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,760
Vampires can't see me do that.

744
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:48,360
Know any vampires?

745
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,400
Yeah, there's one standing next to me,

746
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,799
- apparently.
- Hey. That's a rumour.

747
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,880
You have got quite a lot
of neck exposed though.

748
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,799
They're not as set
as they normally are.

749
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,560
I'm actually gonna do the fish again.

750
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,920
Fly, little fishy.

751
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,280
Wouldn't do that to mine at home, promise.

752
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,960
<i>Inspired by
the real one in her garden,</i>

753
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,160
<i>Laura's jelly art will be a koi pond</i>

754
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,160
<i>complete with fish
and injected aquatic plants.</i>

755
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,480
<i>It will sit atop layers of genoise sponge,</i>

756
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,880
<i>raspberry mousse
and white chocolate bavarois.</i>

757
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,680
I mean, it sounds amazing.
The flavours are often good from you.

758
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,120
So we expect that.
What are you using to set your jelly?

759
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,799
Agar-agar, which I
imported from Australia,

760
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,520
erm, which I think is like professional
use for this kind of thing.

761
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,799
Will it be clear enough?

762
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,200
It does set clear.

763
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,000
Is the grasshopper,
is that part of it as well?

764
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,400
Who's that guy?

765
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,480
- Oh, no.
- Isn't he sweet?

766
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,839
He's gonna be in the pond.

767
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,360
- He'll be in it, as well.
- Yeah.

768
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,680
Thank you. Good luck.

769
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,760
Very good luck.

770
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,080
I need it.

771
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,040
Let's wait and see what these ones do.

772
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,560
<i>While Laura needs her fish
to set before filling her pond,</i>

773
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,120
<i>Dave's opted for a paint-as-you-go
approach to his aquatic-themed jelly art.</i>

774
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,839
My jelly art is layered.

775
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,920
Each layer will build up an image
of like a 3D perspective of a beach scene.

776
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
That goes in the fridge to set
then I put another clear layer on,

777
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,120
then I've gotta do another
colour layer and so forth.

778
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,359
<i>Dave's jelly incarnation
of surfers' paradise Newquay</i>

779
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,520
<i>will taste of apple and guava,</i>

780
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,799
<i>riding a wave of fudge cake
and clotted cream mousse.</i>

781
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,160
- Do you surf?
- I tried to surf.

782
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,799
It's the thing that you go,
"I wanna be good at surfing."

783
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Then, "It's too hard."

784
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,600
Yeah, like, "It looked easier."

785
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,400
- On <i>Point Break</i> it looks easy.
- Yeah. What a great film.

786
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,680
If they remade it with me and you,
you'd have to be Keanu

787
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,240
and I'd have to be Swayze.

788
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,839
- Yeah, you reckon?
- Yeah, not reckon. That's a fact.

789
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,160
Er, my dad's dog's called Swayze.

790
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,240
- After Patrick Swayze?
- After Patrick Swayze.

791
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:42,160
Wow.

792
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,480
Swayze, if you're watching this, respect.

793
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,319
Good luck.

794
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,960
While I'm waiting for it to set,
I'm gonna start my cake.

795
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,920
<i>For the foundations
of their jelly constructions,</i>

796
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,319
<i>most of the bakers have chosen
a type of sponge.</i>

797
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,560
Just making my genoise sponge.

798
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,359
I think it should be pronounced "gen-oir,"

799
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,600
but I'm from Gravesend,
so it's a "genoise."

800
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,240
Does it annoy me
when people say "genoise"?

801
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:07,359
Well, if you're gonna speak a language,
you've gotta make the effort.

802
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,560
And that's about
all I'm gonna say.

803
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,319
They'll be in 170
for about 20 to 30 minutes,

804
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,359
quite a broad window
I've given myself there.

805
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,319
Putting that in for 40 minutes.

806
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,680
I need it to be fudgy,
I don't want it to be dry inside.

807
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,359
<i>But Marc's two-tiered creation
will be underpinned with airy meringue.</i>

808
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,319
This is a hazelnut dacquoise,
basic French meringue with folded nuts.

809
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,760
<i>While Hermine's
risking possible subsidence</i>

810
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:36,200
<i>by adding a cherry liqueur drizzle
to her genoise sponge.</i>

811
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,160
Who can possibly hate a cake
with a bit of alcohol in it?

812
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,839
<i>Her sponge
needs to hold up two mousse layers</i>

813
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,960
<i>and a domed jelly decorated
with a giant poppy flower.</i>

814
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,560
<i>She's wrapping the whole cake
in a chocolate collar</i>

815
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,760
<i>and finishing with
a white chocolate ganache.</i>

816
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,839
So, when we put our knife through,
is it gonna hold?

817
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,799
Well, I hope it does.

818
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,600
Did it hold in practice?

819
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,160
- I've practised them separately.
- Oh.

820
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,080
And I've never
put one on top of the other.

821
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,359
So, it's gonna be a first.

822
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,000
And have you done
injecting jelly before to make flowers?

823
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,200
A couple of times.

824
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,760
It is a bit tricky
'cause the jelly can split.

825
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,120
- Good luck. Thank you, Hermine.
- Thank you. Thanks. Gonna need it.

826
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,000
<i>While Hermine's gambling
with a soggy sponge...</i>

827
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,839
Shall we name them as we put them in?

828
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,560
<i>...Laura's showstopper
is taking solid shape.</i>

829
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,720
Which one's got evil eyes?

830
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:35,839
Sorry, Paul, in you go.

831
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,359
I'm gonna move on
to the strawberry mousse.

832
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,120
<i>As well as the baked element
and melt-in-the-mouth jelly,</i>

833
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,920
<i>Prue and Paul want to see
a perfectly set mousse.</i>

834
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,520
I've got orange juice
and cranberry juice to reduce down,

835
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,440
and this is gonna be part
of the base for my mousses.

836
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,280
Clotted cream going in.

837
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,160
Gelatine will be added to this.

838
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,359
It just helps the mousses set 'cause we
do not want another ice cream splat.

839
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,760
Can't. Having nightmares about it.

840
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,640
It did say stir in the egg yolks
and it's gone kind of gloopy.

841
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,359
<i>Peter's also trying to make
his mousse less loose...</i>

842
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,240
I'm adding in a bit of corn flour

843
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,760
to make the custard base
for the mousses slightly thicker.

844
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:22,240
<i>...but he's the only baker whose use
of custard extends to his jelly art.</i>

845
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:27,319
Now, I'm making the panna cotta
for my moulded panna cotta shapes.

846
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,839
Just wanted to make sure
I get every step right.

847
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,400
Can't be doing with easy slip-ups today.

848
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,640
<i>His panna cotta
will form Christmas decorations</i>

849
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,720
<i>to fit to the inside of
his clear snow globe jelly.</i>

850
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:42,640
<i>The extra sturdy cranberry
and orange juice mousses</i>

851
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,040
<i>will hopefully add stability and fill
the cut-out centre of his sandwich cake.</i>

852
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,880
Is there enough time to set everything?

853
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,799
Hopefully so.

854
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,920
How long did it take to set in practice?

855
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,120
Don't know.
I didn't time it completely.

856
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,440
- You didn't time it?
- No.

857
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,319
- That's useful.
- We'll do it today.

858
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,160
- Good luck.
- I've got faith.

859
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,360
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

860
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,000
Fakey cakey bakers,
you have one hour left.

861
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,520
Righty-ho. Rinky-dink. Okay-dokey.

862
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,960
I need to stay at a nice, fast lick.

863
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,359
<i>The bakers need
their mousses to start setting</i>

864
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,080
<i>and their baked elements cooling...</i>

865
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,359
I'd better get my prick.

866
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,520
I've cooked it
on a lower temperature for longer

867
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,000
to purposefully give it
a really crunchy texture.

868
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,080
<i>...before they
return their attention</i>

869
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,359
<i>to the star of this week's showstopper.</i>

870
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,240
Sideways swimming fishies.

871
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:34,200
I think with the flowers above it,
it should look okay.

872
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,359
Here we go.

873
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,319
When you insert it in the cut,

874
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,319
as you press and draw back,
that fills it with colour.

875
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,520
It's a crazy technique.

876
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,319
Just doing lots of petals.

877
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,359
It's got a ragged edge
to emulate the peony, really.

878
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,560
Now, I'm gonna do the weirdest thing
in the world, cookie cutting panna cottas.

879
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,799
Oh, you bugger.

880
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,400
Didn't want that to happen.

881
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,200
These are reindeer.

882
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,280
They're being a little bit tricky today.

883
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,319
This is quite loose.

884
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:05,640
Come on. Got a blockage.

885
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,120
It's kind of baking.

886
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,760
Baking but not as we know it.

887
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,359
Well,
I'm not out of the wood yet.

888
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,319
My mousse still hasn't set.

889
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,319
It's like
surgical operation, isn't it?

890
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,960
Hopefully the jelly won't feel
any pain afterwards.

891
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,680
I might get some jelly flowers

892
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,400
- put into my liver.
- Yeah.

893
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,080
- Will you do it?
- Yeah.

894
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,520
I don't wanna be out though,
I wanna see it all.

895
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,120
Wow, look at that.

896
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,000
- Yeah, get in there.
- Tremendous.

897
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,960
Gonna call myself
the jelly Picasso.

898
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,440
I like the look of it.

899
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,920
Didn't know I had it in me.

900
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,080
I'm heating up the inside bowl
here to melt the edge of the jelly.

901
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,880
And I'll be able to add in
the panna cotta figures now.

902
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,000
This is so annoying.

903
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,040
You've got a bit hanging off
and you don't know where to start it.

904
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,000
Looks tricky.

905
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,319
- So sorry.
- We're talking about opening foil

906
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,400
so we'll leave you.

907
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,799
Matt, you stay there
until you've worked it out.

908
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,319
I've got to figure this out.

909
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,080
This is gonna be the bottom of the jelly.

910
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,160
Where you look through it,
you see a green background on the bottom,

911
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,640
then the flowers can lift.

912
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,000
Just wanna seal the top.

913
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,040
I think I'll put it
in the fridge like that.

914
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,160
I think I've figured it out, Laura.

915
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,880
Notorious for my mess, aren't I?
You'd be disappointed if I wasn't.

916
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,600
Bakers, you have 30 minutes left.

917
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:33,359
Just need it to set and then I need it
to release from the bowl perfectly.

918
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,720
<i>With his cake
setting in the fridge,</i>

919
00:43:35,799 --> 00:43:38,120
<i>all Dave has to do is wait.</i>

920
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,280
<i>For the rest of the bakers,
it's time to build.</i>

921
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,280
You all right?

922
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,760
Things haven't set
as much as I'd like them to.

923
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,280
How do I do this?

924
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,879
Oh, help, help, help, help, help.

925
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,480
It's okay, it's okay.

926
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,080
Why is this so stressful?

927
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,920
It cracked a bit on the side.

928
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,839
Do a lot of DIY here.

929
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,640
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

930
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,440
I'm going to attempt to put
the jelly on the cake.

931
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,920
Then the jelly on the jelly.

932
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,200
I'm gonna dip this in some hot water.

933
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,160
<i>Held too briefly in the water,</i>

934
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,400
<i>the bakers risk tearing the jelly
when they flip it over.</i>

935
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,920
It all hangs on this.

936
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,080
It's hot as well, this water.

937
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,000
<i>Leave it too long
and they risk melting it.</i>

938
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:33,960
That is very melty.

939
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,000
Too melty, probably.

940
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,319
- Releasing now.
- Come on, Pete.

941
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,799
That does not wanna come.

942
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,200
Come on, release.

943
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,600
Bloomin' heck.

944
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,839
We have a wibble-wobble.

945
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,839
Jeepers creepers.

946
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,080
That's not awful.

947
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,160
Bakers, you have one minute left.

948
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,080
Oh, gosh.

949
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,960
Oh, I did it.

950
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,400
Bakers, your time is up.

951
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,680
Done it. Yeah!

952
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,920
Please step away
from your jelly art desserts.

953
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,760
I'm so happy with that.

954
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,120
I think it looks really cool.

955
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,960
Look at what happened,
I've done a jelly cake.

956
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,520
The good news is I never
have to make one of those again.

957
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,839
<i>After four and a half hours
of jelly artistry</i>

958
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,760
<i>and with a place
in the semi final at stake,</i>

959
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,200
<i>the bakers have to face the judges.</i>

960
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,440
Laura, would you like
to bring up your showstopper.

961
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,200
You can see it reminds you

962
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,799
- of, uh, a pond.
- Yeah.

963
00:46:20,879 --> 00:46:23,440
I love the way
you've put the flowers in there.

964
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,120
It's got bubbles in it.
That's the koi bubbling.

965
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,920
- Yeah.
- It's brilliant.

966
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,200
I'd like the sponge
to have been covered.

967
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,879
- Oh, okay.
- So it looks neater.

968
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,640
That jelly looks nice and soft.

969
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,240
Mmm. The raspberry mousse
is particularly good.

970
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:44,440
- Thank you.
- Lovely.

971
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,680
- It's perfect.
- Lovely.

972
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,440
Every layer is excellent.
The jelly melts in the mouth,

973
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,560
the elderflower works really well,
every single texture,

974
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,160
every single flavour is spot on for me.

975
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,680
- Wow. Thank you so much.
- Well done.

976
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,760
Thanks.

977
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,600
- Smashed it, well done.
- Thank you.

978
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,879
David, I think
it is absolutely astonishing.

979
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,720
It is completely beautiful.
They are my colours exactly.

980
00:47:16,799 --> 00:47:19,400
Yeah, if Prue was
a jelly design cake, that'd be it.

981
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,480
Erm.

982
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,920
Very clever.

983
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,520
I've given you a massive piece.

984
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,359
David, that is so neat.

985
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,520
Thank you.

986
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,920
Jelly is fantastic. It's nice and light,
melts in the mouth.

987
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,600
But your downfall is the bit underneath.
Is that clotted cream mousse?

988
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,520
- Yes.
- Too much gelatine in it.

989
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,960
- Yeah.
- It's too stodgy.

990
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,640
Your sponge itself,
I'm not getting chocolate,

991
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,400
and I'm certainly not getting the fudge.
So when you eat that with that,

992
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,640
- it feels dry.
- All right, okay.

993
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,359
I wouldn't be quite so harsh.
My only quarrel is with the mousse,

994
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,799
which isn't as silky soft as you expect.

995
00:47:56,879 --> 00:48:00,400
But do you know what, I think
it's quite an achievement, David, really.

996
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,560
- Thank you.
- I think it's beautiful.

997
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,960
- Thank you.
- Well done.

998
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,880
- It does look phenomenal.
- Cheers.

999
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,720
It's very abstract.

1000
00:48:14,799 --> 00:48:18,080
So that's a reindeer,
and that's a snowman.

1001
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,440
And that's a Christmas tree.
Then it's repeated.

1002
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,200
I don't think it looks very like
a snow globe.

1003
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,160
Needed bolder colours.

1004
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,640
When you think of a Christmas tree,
you don't think pale.

1005
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,600
- Yeah.
- You needed more vibrancy to it

1006
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,080
'cause it's a bit pastel.

1007
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,600
Let's have a look inside.

1008
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,080
There's mousse right down to the centre.

1009
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,480
Not the easiest cake to cut.

1010
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,600
No.

1011
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,000
I question whether those mousses
are actually set properly yet.

1012
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,319
They're very, very soft.

1013
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,240
Okay.

1014
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,480
Your sponge is slightly overbaked,
you can tell by the colour.

1015
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,600
It shouldn't be as dark as that.

1016
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,440
The flavours, though, are beautiful.

1017
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,440
I think the main problem
is with the size.

1018
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,560
Because it's difficult
to get a huge slice out.

1019
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:03,040
And because the mousses are only just set,
it's just like a good trifle.

1020
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,600
- I'm gonna have the other mouthful.
- Thank you.

1021
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,400
- Well done.
- Well done, Peter.

1022
00:49:09,879 --> 00:49:10,920
Well done, Peter.

1023
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,760
The strawberry mousse looks curdled
and not set.

1024
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,280
- Yeah.
- This is gonna be an interesting cut.

1025
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:27,920
It's on a board, as well...

1026
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,720
The jelly's on top of a board?

1027
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:30,839
Yeah.

1028
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,000
Oh, dear. It's slightly overdone.

1029
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,520
- Yeah.
- It's like concrete.

1030
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,839
Oh, dear.

1031
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,359
Excuse me, Prue.

1032
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:51,240
Is that meant to be mousse,
that chocolate?

1033
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:52,760
- Supposed to be.
- Is it?

1034
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:54,400
That's more like a ganache.

1035
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,400
Your chocolate is hard.

1036
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,800
- Yeah.
- The mousse split.

1037
00:49:57,879 --> 00:50:00,440
- The dacquoise is overbaked.
- And the jelly is...

1038
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,960
The jelly's too rubbery.

1039
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,319
But besides that, brilliant.

1040
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,280
I like the design. You're the only one

1041
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:08,120
- who thought to do a two-tier.
- Yeah.

1042
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,160
I just don't think
you organised the cake as a one-piece.

1043
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,960
- I don't think the concept was right.
- No.

1044
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,080
Right.

1045
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,879
- Beautiful.
- Absolutely.

1046
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,760
- Thank you.
- Straight out of a Parisian patisserie.

1047
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,319
And I'll tell you what,
I'm a hot stuff gardener

1048
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:36,920
and that is the most perfect
Japanese poppy.

1049
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,200
Thank you.

1050
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,600
Right.

1051
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,000
It's absolutely gorgeous.

1052
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,440
The raspberry, the chocolate mousse
work beautifully well together.

1053
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,399
And you've got that aromatic flavour
coming from the jelly. Fantastic.

1054
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,080
All the layers are interesting.

1055
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,040
The poppy top is fantastic.

1056
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,799
And you know how to make genoise,
and you've made a perfect one.

1057
00:51:02,879 --> 00:51:05,080
- Thank you.
- It's a real triumph, lovely.

1058
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,200
Well done, Hermine.

1059
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,560
Oh, the white chocolate ganache
is delicious, too.

1060
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,920
- It is.
- Take it away.

1061
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,280
Go away before we find something

1062
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:14,200
- to complain about.
- Thank you.

1063
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,480
Well done.

1064
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:21,240
I just can't believe it.

1065
00:51:21,319 --> 00:51:26,640
I was happy enough
getting a jelly cake out.

1066
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,920
And those comments,

1067
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,440
oh, my God. I just can't believe it.

1068
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:35,520
That went great, didn't it?

1069
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,359
Er, it could've gone...
It could've gone better.

1070
00:51:40,879 --> 00:51:44,440
This is by far the week
I'm closest to the bottom of the pile.

1071
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,440
I'm not sure if I've done enough.
I think I have.

1072
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,720
Wow, that was incredible.

1073
00:51:58,799 --> 00:51:59,799
It was good.

1074
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,879
I think it was
the most amazing day today.

1075
00:52:04,359 --> 00:52:06,680
- Hermine?
- She's done an amazing job.

1076
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,600
It reminded me of looking in the window
of Fauchon in Paris.

1077
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,240
You know, it's got that elegance to it.

1078
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:16,520
And Laura's was really good.
It was a bit untidy round the edges.

1079
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,200
- Yeah.
- But the cake was great,

1080
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,680
the two mousses were good.
The topping was lovely.

1081
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,799
When you look at David's,
for me, it was two halves.

1082
00:52:23,879 --> 00:52:25,200
The top half was amazing.

1083
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,560
Probably the best one.
But, for me, the bottom half didn't work.

1084
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,799
Peter's tasted really nice,

1085
00:52:30,879 --> 00:52:33,080
but it wasn't
the best thing he's ever done.

1086
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,960
- You said it was too big to cut.
- It was, a bit.

1087
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:40,040
When you cut a slice, you wanna be
taking that around to show people.

1088
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,760
- Yeah.
- As opposed to Marc's, a chainsaw.

1089
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:46,080
Because the dacquoise was just overbaked.

1090
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,080
- I could've stood on that.
- Poor Marc.

1091
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,480
I felt so sorry for him.

1092
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,640
- Yeah.
- We all do.

1093
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,000
Nothing went right.

1094
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,879
We're beginning to narrow it down,
so we're looking at mistakes.

1095
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,359
The technical was bad for all of them,

1096
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,080
even for the winner, Laura.

1097
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,640
Then we look at the signature,
it was fairly tight,

1098
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,920
you know, they all managed to produce
mini cheesecakes of one form or another.

1099
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,560
So when it came to the showstopper,
we've gotta look at that more carefully

1100
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,240
because it was
a four and a half hour challenge.

1101
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,520
You can't just brush that off.

1102
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,680
We've got to look
at the showstopper properly.

1103
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:25,000
Bakers, I have got the great job
of announcing who is Star Baker this week.

1104
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,960
Before I do that, I just wanna say
that showstopper was off the hook.

1105
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,240
It really was amazing,
so well done, all of you.

1106
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,760
Now, this week's Star Baker is...

1107
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,480
Hermine.

1108
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,799
- Well done.
- Thank you.

1109
00:53:45,879 --> 00:53:47,200
Wow. Thank you.

1110
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:53,440
Well, it falls to me then to tell you
who's leaving us this week.

1111
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,480
It's someone who's been
on an incredible journey,

1112
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:00,319
and I know that that journey
will continue after this show.

1113
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,720
And the person
who is leaving us this week is...

1114
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:10,520
I'm so sorry, it's Marc.

1115
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,600
It's okay.

1116
00:54:12,879 --> 00:54:14,000
- Come on.
- See you.

1117
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,520
- Give us a hug.
- Cheers, mate.

1118
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:17,839
Enjoy the sun.

1119
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,799
Yeah. Thank you, Prue.

1120
00:54:19,879 --> 00:54:20,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

1121
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,160
I knew I'd reached my limit this week.

1122
00:54:23,879 --> 00:54:27,399
I'm feeling, erm,
surprisingly okay, actually.

1123
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,240
- I'll miss you.
- You, too.

1124
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:32,720
I've come to the <i>Bake Off</i>
to kind of face my anxieties,

1125
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:37,760
failure, all those things that, as people,
we're uncomfortable about dealing with.

1126
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,080
I've definitely learnt more about myself.

1127
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,560
Maybe, from what lots of people have said,
it's just to give myself a bit more credit

1128
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,200
as well, which I don't.

1129
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,399
Cheers, Paul.

1130
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,080
Marc's been great.

1131
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,399
He's been on probably the biggest journey
out of all the bakers.

1132
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,520
He started off pretty badly,
and then, as each week has passed by,

1133
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,720
he's got better and better and better.

1134
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,560
And it's a shame to see him go.

1135
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,960
- Survived.
- Just.

1136
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,280
I'm through to the semi final.
I'll take that.

1137
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,920
It's kind of hard right now
'cause it's like, fortunate for me,

1138
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,120
but I'm gonna miss Marc
and it's a bit of an odd feeling.

1139
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,480
Bittersweet.

1140
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,040
Happy you've got through
but the shine's taken off of it,

1141
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,799
especially when you lose someone
you're close to.

1142
00:55:20,879 --> 00:55:24,799
And, erm, I think Marc was,
erm, a real gent.

1143
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,319
- Well done, Hermine.
- Thank you.

1144
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,399
Can't believe it.
I still think myself in the tent,

1145
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,560
nervous about
whether that jelly will set or not.

1146
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,760
And I can't believe they liked
that flower and the whole thing.

1147
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,160
Aren't you a clever girl?

1148
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,720
Hermine, her second Star Baker in a row.

1149
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,839
She is an amazing baker.

1150
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,399
In the past, she's done really well
because she's kept it quite safe,

1151
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,640
but this time,
she made this amazing Japanese poppy.

1152
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,120
It was just beautiful.

1153
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,720
Semi-final week next week.

1154
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,240
And we've got four fantastic bakers,

1155
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,319
and I still cannot call
who's gonna be in the final.

1156
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,520
I don't think it's sunk in yet
that the semi final is coming up.

1157
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,120
I don't... It just doesn't feel real.

1158
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,520
Like, mind blown.

1159
