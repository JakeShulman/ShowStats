1
00:00:02,054 --> 00:00:03,863
Hello. It's Dessert Week.

2
00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:05,743
I wonder where Matt is.

3
00:00:05,744 --> 00:00:08,873
Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off!

4
00:00:08,874 --> 00:00:11,303
Hey, Cherry Bakewell, you haven't
seen Matt Lucas, have you?

5
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:12,543
No, I haven't seen him.

6
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:15,223
Well, if you do, can you tell him
I'm looking for him? Yeah, OK.

7
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,023
I love you a little bit.
I don't mind you.

8
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:19,332
Last time...

9
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,233
This one doesn't play
to my strengths.

10
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:24,233
...the heat was on as the
bakers tackled ice cream.

11
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:26,543
I need to work quite fast
before it melts.

12
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:28,103
Hermine kept her cool...

13
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:30,663
You're doing classical
things beautifully.

14
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:32,983
...to win Star Baker
for the first time.

15
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:35,262
Congratulations.

16
00:00:35,263 --> 00:00:36,512
Cherry on the icing.

17
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:37,873
...while a silly mistake...

18
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:39,743
Didn't press the ice setting.

19
00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:42,103
...threatened Laura's place
in the competition.

20
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:43,903
It just went from bad to worse.

21
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:45,462
Pretty embarrassed about this one.

22
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:47,773
But it was Lottie who
had a meltdown...

23
00:00:47,774 --> 00:00:48,624
It's game over.

24
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:49,873
...and had to say goodbye.

25
00:00:49,874 --> 00:00:52,314
Lottie. Just give me a minute.

26
00:00:53,343 --> 00:00:55,623
Now, the quarterfinal...

27
00:00:55,624 --> 00:00:57,382
Oh! Help, help, help, help.

28
00:00:57,383 --> 00:00:59,663
...and it's all about desserts.

29
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:00,873
Jeepers creepers.

30
00:01:00,874 --> 00:01:02,623
That's... not awful.

31
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:04,233
They're not set. Great.

32
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:05,953
The bakers hope Cheesecakes...

33
00:01:05,954 --> 00:01:07,262
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34
00:01:07,263 --> 00:01:09,153
...don't leave them
feeling cheesed off.

35
00:01:09,154 --> 00:01:10,773
They're sinking back in on
themselves.

36
00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:12,063
That's slightly concerning.

37
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:13,313
They have to elevate jelly...

38
00:01:13,314 --> 00:01:14,543
Wow, that's tremendous.

39
00:01:14,544 --> 00:01:17,262
...to new heights of
baking artistry...

40
00:01:17,263 --> 00:01:19,592
I think it is completely beautiful.

41
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:22,382
...and they're taken back
to the 17th century...

42
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:24,033
Oh, got a leaky situation.

43
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:26,623
...in an old-school suet
and citrus technical.

44
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:28,903
I... am... having... a...

45
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:30,903
...suet...break...down.

46
00:01:30,904 --> 00:01:33,674
One step away from...
MIMICS "PSYCHO" THEME

47
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:55,823
TOGETHER: One, two, three -
quarterfinals!

48
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,064
Here we go!

49
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:00,753
I didn't think I would
make it to this week

50
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,262
and I was telling the other bakers,

51
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:07,262
I left a few eggs in my fridge,
thinking, "I'll come back to those."

52
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:09,623
Well, they won't be
good now, will they?

53
00:02:09,624 --> 00:02:11,983
Quarterfinals.
That's cool, innit? Yeah.

54
00:02:11,984 --> 00:02:15,873
All my family are super proud of me,
that I've managed to get this far.

55
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:17,592
Yeah, madness, isn't it?

56
00:02:17,593 --> 00:02:21,313
Suddenly, you realise there is a
possibility I could be in the final,

57
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:23,193
and that's a little bit scary.

58
00:02:23,194 --> 00:02:25,262
This week is kind of nerve-racking.

59
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:27,903
There's been some practice
that hasn't gone so well.

60
00:02:27,904 --> 00:02:30,984
So I think it's the week that
I'm most unsure about so far.

61
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:35,392
Hello, bakers.

62
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:40,063
Today, the judges would love
you to make 12 identical...

63
00:02:40,064 --> 00:02:42,512
...baked mini Cheesecakes.

64
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:45,913
Mini ones? I know. Oh...

65
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:48,342
Your disappointingly
small Cheesecakes

66
00:02:48,343 --> 00:02:49,873
should have a baked filling.

67
00:02:49,874 --> 00:02:53,033
Your virtually invisible Cheesecakes

68
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:56,113
should have a base that
is made from scratch.

69
00:02:56,114 --> 00:02:57,423
Hardly worth it.

70
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:59,063
You have two-and-a-half hours.

71
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:01,393
On your marks...
..get set... bake!

72
00:03:03,143 --> 00:03:06,142
LAURA: I think it's only my mum
that doesn't like Cheesecakes.

73
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:08,113
So, I don't eat many Cheesecakes.

74
00:03:08,114 --> 00:03:10,703
I have an aversion to
cheese in general.

75
00:03:10,704 --> 00:03:12,472
I've made a New York-style
cheesecake,

76
00:03:12,473 --> 00:03:16,063
but that did have that massive
Grand Canyon crack down it.

77
00:03:16,064 --> 00:03:18,522
It's the quarterfinals,
and, actually, this is where

78
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:21,883
the bakers really do have to
take it up a couple of notches.

79
00:03:21,884 --> 00:03:26,272
I want the cheesecake filling to be
full of flavour but silky smooth.

80
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:29,753
For the base, I'd like to have a
little bit more texture to it.

81
00:03:29,754 --> 00:03:33,472
Just stirring some oats in a pan,
making a lovely oat-y crumble.

82
00:03:33,473 --> 00:03:35,783
PRUE: The top should
be very decorative

83
00:03:35,784 --> 00:03:37,602
and it must be good flavour,

84
00:03:37,603 --> 00:03:39,993
cos you're only getting a tiny one,
you want a punch.

85
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:42,352
Got to do a lot of
multitasking today.

86
00:03:42,353 --> 00:03:46,713
We're asking for 12 of them,
and they are to be very exquisite.

87
00:03:46,714 --> 00:03:48,602
It has to look absolutely beautiful.

88
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,142
We've got five bakers remaining

89
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:52,993
and all of them are
star bakers this year.

90
00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:56,753
It's the first time it's happened,
so I'm expecting some sublime bakes.

91
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:58,633
What could go wrong?

92
00:03:58,634 --> 00:04:00,473
Gosh. Can't see a thing
out of those.

93
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:05,602
Good morning, Peter.
Good morning. Peter. Hello.

94
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:07,993
Cheesecakes. Yes.
What have you decided to do?

95
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:10,713
I'm making ginger
and lime Cheesecakes.

96
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:14,194
So it's Key lime pie-esque.
Key lime pie vibes, yeah.

97
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:17,490
That's pretty much what I would've
chosen to do. Oh, that's good.

98
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,340
You've just got to do it right, now.

99
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,379
Peter's tiny take on one of
Paul's favourite desserts

100
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,339
will see baked lime Cheesecakes on
an oat and gingernut biscuit base,

101
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,900
delicately decorated
with crystallised ginger

102
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:31,980
and dots of lime curd.

103
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:34,339
This is the first baked one
that I've ever made.

104
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,670
I think I made a couple of
set ones at school, I think,

105
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:37,780
in Home Ec, maybe.

106
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:40,100
Baby-faced disaster, come on.

107
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:42,540
If you're not in the final
I'll be disappointed.

108
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,180
Just making a traditional
digestive base.

109
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:48,750
All great Cheesecakes start
with a delicious biscuit.

110
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:51,459
I never made the biscuits
for my cheesecake before.

111
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,180
I don't know who does that, but...

112
00:04:53,181 --> 00:04:54,620
...it's a challenge!

113
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:56,589
Right, what's next?

114
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,420
Oh, BLEEP.

115
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:01,700
Good job I made more, isn't it?

116
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,310
Whoopsie.

117
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:05,030
Laura's honey and oat biscuit

118
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:08,700
will form the base of her vanilla
and passion fruit cheesecakes.

119
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:11,540
With a topping of firm-set
passion fruit curd,

120
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,830
she's hoping to avoid a repeat
of last week's meltdown.

121
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:17,180
I've been having nightmares
about that ice cream cake,

122
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:19,870
to be honest with you. So have I!
Like, loads!

123
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:22,219
I don't wanna make
any more mistakes now.

124
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,540
Just focus now, that's it. Yeah.
That's the plan. All right.

125
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,831
Good luck. Thank you.

126
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,950
NOEL: While everyone's biscuits
will be flavoured differently...

127
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:33,139
I'm getting the pulp out of
the passion fruit.

128
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,860
...there's a common theme emerging
to the bit that goes on top.

129
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:38,900
So I've just added in
passion fruit extract,

130
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:41,259
and it just gives it a
bit more va-va-voom.

131
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,750
We're all doing our own
interpretation of passion fruit.

132
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:46,060
Morning, Dave. Good morning.
Hello, David.

133
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:47,830
Tell us about your mini Cheesecakes.

134
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:49,620
I'm calling it a citrus cheesecake.

135
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:52,860
The filling will be a traditional,
like, lemon cheesecake filling,

136
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:57,589
and then on the top there will be
a passion fruit and orange glaze.

137
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,339
Dave's adding orange juice and zest
to his shortbread biscuit,

138
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,700
topping each cheesecake
with lime kisses

139
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:07,060
and setting his passion fruit
and orange glaze with gelatine.

140
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:08,589
That's quite a lot of gelatine.

141
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,950
I found because of the citrus-ness
of the orange and passion fruit,

142
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:14,550
it sometimes doesn't set properly.

143
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:17,249
So rather than cutting down the
citrus you just add more gelatine.

144
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,170
Yeah. Do you know what?
I'm playing golf later.

145
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,470
Maybe I could use one of
your Cheesecakes.

146
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:26,469
Cheesecake should offer a
mouth-watering blend

147
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,060
of contrasting textures.

148
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:29,750
A nice crunch at the bottom.

149
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:34,700
Nice soft filling and hopefully a
nice easy cut-able glaze on the top.

150
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:38,139
Everyone's using moulds to support
these layers during baking...

151
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,990
You need a bit of structure there to
support the cheesy, creamy filling.

152
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:44,349
...and reigning Star Baker Hermine

153
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,190
is making her mould
part of her presentation.

154
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:49,780
I like anything to do with jars.

155
00:06:49,781 --> 00:06:51,780
I make my own jam at home.

156
00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:54,830
I quite like to decorate
them cutely.

157
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,139
Hermine's hoping her mini jam jars

158
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,830
will produce perfect
Cheesecakes as well.

159
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:02,389
Her combination of a
cinnamon biscuit base

160
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,680
and a curd decorated with
meringue kisses and lime zest

161
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:09,030
will also be the third signature
flavoured with passion fruit.

162
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:10,219
Oh.

163
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,070
There's battle of the passion fruit
in the tent, it seems.

164
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:14,790
I don't really like passion fruit.

165
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,329
No? No. I've sort of gone off it.

166
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,249
Really? He's lying.

167
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,050
Don't worry, Hermine, he loves it.

168
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:23,410
So you'll leave them in
the jar, then, will you?

169
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:26,410
I will leave them in the jar.
OK, that's interesting.

170
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:28,730
So, it should be wonderful. Good.

171
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:31,411
Thank you, Hermine. Thank you!
Good luck. Thanks!

172
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:35,090
NOEL: Bakers, you
are halfway through.

173
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:36,610
Oh, that's not good.

174
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:39,810
Matthew. Yes? I'd like you to meet
one of my friends. Ooh, yes, please.

175
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:41,090
Couple of series ago... Yes.

176
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:42,840
...there was a guy called
Mr Spoon that was here...

177
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:44,850
Oh, yeah, I loved him!
..and he went missing.

178
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:48,129
Do you remember him? Yeah, I do!
Well, this is his cousin. Oh, hello!

179
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,449
Would you like to touch him?
Yes, what's his name?

180
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,379
His name is, er...

181
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,661
...Andre. Andre Spoon. Andre!

182
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,209
HERMINE: Well, I need to
get down to business now.

183
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,690
Just filling up my Cheesecakes
with the topping.

184
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:02,690
Just trying to get it as even
as possible.

185
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,050
NOEL: How the mini Cheesecakes
have baked...

186
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:08,329
Bain-marie helps get a better
texture of cheesecake.

187
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,850
I didn't go down the bain-marie
route. Might regret that.

188
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:14,530
...is critical in determining the
silky smooth filling texture

189
00:08:14,531 --> 00:08:16,410
that Paul and Prue are looking for.

190
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:19,130
Rinky-dink. We are good to go.

191
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:21,300
Once in the oven...

192
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,180
Low and slow.

193
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:26,050
...precision with temperature
and timings is crucial.

194
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:29,850
Ten minutes and then I reduce
it and another ten minutes.

195
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:31,740
They're very temperamental
little things.

196
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:33,290
OK. Get these in.

197
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,459
Mark is the only baker
going citrus-free.

198
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,180
Vanilla cheesecake is my favourite,

199
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:40,050
and there's kind of nowhere
to hide with it

200
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:43,850
so I'm just hoping I can pull it off
and make it a good cheesecake.

201
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:46,660
He's bringing pecans,
apricots and almond

202
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:48,540
to a vanilla and mascarpone take

203
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,410
on the classic
New York baked cheesecake.

204
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:55,050
MATT: Why don't we take this show
and put in on Broadway

205
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:57,020
and turn it into a musical?
A musical!

206
00:08:57,021 --> 00:08:59,490
Do you sing? No. Well, don't
let that stop you. OK.

207
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:02,770
What's the first number in
Bake Off: The Musical?

208
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:05,100
SNAPPING FINGERS
# It's over-baked

209
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:06,970
# It's under- baked

210
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:10,459
# I'm never happy at all

211
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,930
# Impossible to please

212
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:14,900
# What a tease

213
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,690
# That's Paul

214
00:09:16,691 --> 00:09:18,330
# That's Paul! #

215
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:24,379
Bakers, you have half an hour left!
That isn't very long, is it?

216
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,020
How was that?
I don't know what that means.

217
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:30,339
He's been in a lot of therapy.
Difficult to tell.

218
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,900
There is a pretty fine line

219
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:34,379
between over and under-baked
on the Cheesecakes.

220
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,930
If you over-bake them,
they're gonna start cracking.

221
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:39,540
Under-baked and you're gonna get
some weird, eggy mixture

222
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,900
that doesn't set and
is gonna be gross.

223
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:43,620
They've got a bit of
a clip in the middle.

224
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:45,209
NOEL: Oh, you could've warned me!

225
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,540
I've inhaled quite a lot of steam.

226
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,410
You just let off some
kettles in my face.

227
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:51,379
They look all right. Do they?
How can you tell?

228
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,660
Can you put something in them?

229
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,129
Gosh, yeah, they're ready.

230
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,620
Maybe a little bit too much.

231
00:09:56,621 --> 00:10:00,100
MATT: The cooling of the cheesecakes
is another baking balancing act.

232
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:02,060
Can't trust a cheesecake.

233
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,379
If rushed...

234
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,770
A few cracked.

235
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,180
...there's a risk of
cracking and dipping.

236
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:09,620
So, they're sinking back in
on themselves quite a lot.

237
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:11,930
Not exactly the sight that
we were wanting to see.

238
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:13,129
If cooled too slowly...

239
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,620
I've just turned the oven off

240
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:16,980
and I'm gonna let them cool down
a little in the oven.

241
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:19,670
Leave them there long as possible.
..the mini Cheesecakes won't set

242
00:10:19,671 --> 00:10:22,490
in time to support the
toppings and decorations.

243
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:24,061
And now we watch them.

244
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,339
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left!

245
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,980
HERMINE: They've just about set.

246
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:32,621
Now my passion fruit coulis.

247
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,290
The curd's pretty thin.

248
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,100
That's slightly concerning.

249
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:38,930
It's quite central
to the decoration.

250
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,980
Do I just melt a tiny bit of
butter and add that in?

251
00:10:41,981 --> 00:10:43,701
Yeah, I'm gonna give that a shot.

252
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:46,030
I think they're set.

253
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:48,700
Any longer, I think they're
gonna collapse anyways.

254
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:51,820
They look very neat. Thank you.
I've got to release them yet.

255
00:10:51,821 --> 00:10:55,650
Gotta release them! Yeah, release
in the air. Fly, my pretties!

256
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:57,620
Whoa! That's hot.

257
00:10:57,621 --> 00:10:58,901
Turning out time.

258
00:11:00,821 --> 00:11:03,389
No, they're not set.

259
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,980
How long have we got left?

260
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:07,930
NOEL: Bakers, you only have
five minutes left!

261
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:09,650
LAURA GROANS

262
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:12,030
Can you ask Mr Spoon to
get out of my chair please?

263
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:15,580
He's just relaxing. Yeah, I
just don't trust him. All right!

264
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:17,620
The curd is not good,

265
00:11:17,621 --> 00:11:21,540
and I shouldn't have added that
butter so I think it's not usable.

266
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,861
Yeah, we're looking for
taste on this, I think.

267
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,580
Mr Spoon didn't like how
that last time call went.

268
00:11:27,581 --> 00:11:29,469
I don't like Mr Spoon.
He wants an apology.

269
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,420
Well, he's not getting one from me.
Do you like him? Love Mr Spoon.

270
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:34,750
You do? Yeah. He wants to kiss you.

271
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:37,780
Mr Spoon says he wants
to see Peter naked. OK.

272
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:38,980
NOEL GIGGLES

273
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:42,009
Even more reason
to dislike Mr Spoon.

274
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,910
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

275
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,469
Slippery little buggers.

276
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,750
So the gelatine's just about set.

277
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:49,500
Just hope they turn out well.

278
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,219
Great!

279
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,580
So I've got a bit of
lime syrup in here.

280
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:55,910
This is baking on the fly,
definitely.

281
00:11:55,911 --> 00:11:57,020
Come on!

282
00:11:58,111 --> 00:12:00,420
It's not gonna be that refined,
I must admit.

283
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:02,339
They're a little bit squidgy.

284
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,940
The next layer is
the meringue kisses.

285
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:07,219
Bakers, you have one minute left!

286
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,631
Gosh, one minute to go.

287
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,019
I'm getting the shakes now.

288
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,421
OK, let's just do what we can.

289
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:20,300
I'm filling them slightly more
than planned

290
00:12:20,301 --> 00:12:22,831
clue to the rather cratering clip
in the middle.

291
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,061
They just didn't set in time.
Rubbish.

292
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,941
Bakers, your time is up.

293
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,019
SHE SIGHS

294
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,751
Please place your mini Cheesecakes
at the end of your work stations.

295
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:45,349
Think they're actually still warm.

296
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,071
I think they'll taste nice.

297
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:07,080
MATT: The baked Cheesecakes will now
face the scrutiny of Prue and Paul.

298
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:08,440
Hi, Dave. Hello.

299
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:09,881
H I, Dave, right.

300
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:20,570
I think they look very neat, they
do look very good. Thank you.

301
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:22,211
Well, they cut neatly, don't they?

302
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:28,489
The custard middle I
think is absolutely delicious,

303
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,390
and the texture's perfect.
Thank you.

304
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:32,750
The jelly is surprisingly
thick, and I like it.

305
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:34,680
I was a bit worried about
the amount of gelatine

306
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,029
you were putting in there.
Yeah. Did you hold back,

307
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,800
or did you put it all in?
I did put it all in, yeah.

308
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:41,520
I was expecting it to be a little
bit rubbery. OK. And it wasn't...

309
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,850
Yeah... cos it did melt.
But I think you've done a good job.

310
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:45,359
I think you've ticked all the boxes.

311
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,109
It's neat, and it
tastes good. Thank you.

312
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,721
Cheers. Well done. Thank you. Oh!

313
00:13:57,841 --> 00:13:59,280
They do look really pretty.

314
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:00,511
They look amazing.

315
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:05,720
It's a bit stodgy. Mm.

316
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,560
It's not as silky as I'd hoped.

317
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:10,999
The base is very soft. There's
no way that base could be solid

318
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,520
in the bottom of that because
it's going to sweat in there,

319
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:16,160
the moisture from the cheesecake
filling will drop in there

320
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:19,080
and soften it up anyway.
There's not enough lime in there.

321
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:20,590
Or passion fruit.

322
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:21,879
Or passion fruit.

323
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,160
It looks good.

324
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:25,000
Thank you.

325
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:36,999
They're like canape size. OK.

326
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,770
I would've done it slightly
bigger than the apricot.

327
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:41,521
That's too big and too thin. Yeah.

328
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:47,560
You don't get any apricot at
all until you hit the apricot.

329
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:49,919
You don't really get the
vanilla either. Really? Oh, no.

330
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,490
I just think it needed to be
smaller, packed with more flavour.

331
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,720
Yeah, more vanilla. And just
look much neater. Sure, OK.

332
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:57,690
And the apricot should've
been everywhere,

333
00:14:57,691 --> 00:15:00,909
cos when you get a bit of apricot
with it, it was truly delicious.

334
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,630
Sure, OK. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

335
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:05,401
WHISPERS: Well done.

336
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:14,680
Hmm.

337
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:17,270
It doesn't look
like a cheesecake. Oh. Um...

338
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:19,789
The mixture itself
must be quite delicate.

339
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,711
It has formed a little cauldron.

340
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:26,989
There's your cheesecake there.
Look at the ridge around there.

341
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,680
You've dropped
a lot of height on that.

342
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:30,989
I think the flavour
is absolutely lovely,

343
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,510
but the shape of it's not perfect.

344
00:15:33,511 --> 00:15:36,480
I'm getting the lime.
The ginger's very light. OK.

345
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:37,950
It's a nice flavour, but it is lime.

346
00:15:37,951 --> 00:15:40,350
I'm not getting too much
ginger, and it doesn't look

347
00:15:40,351 --> 00:15:42,760
the best thing you've done.
Thank you. Sorry about that.

348
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:44,511
WHISPERS: Don't
apologise to these people.

349
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,510
So, Laura, just remind us
what's in your Cheesecakes.

350
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:59,510
It's a vanilla cheesecake
with an oat and honey base,

351
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:02,840
passion fruit curd and
passion fruit and mango,

352
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:05,950
what's supposed to be a compote, on
top, but it's a bit of a mudslide.

353
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:07,510
So sorry. It does
look a bit of a mess.

354
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:09,950
What I do like is the ratio
to the base and height,

355
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:13,070
and that's pretty consistent,
however wobbly they are.

356
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:15,361
I hope you like the taste.
I think they're nice.

357
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:20,789
Mm.

358
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,760
It's delicious. Yay!

359
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:23,999
That's fantastic.

360
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,400
The texture's are all there,

361
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,720
from the top, to the
cheesecake, to the base,

362
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,230
which you actually break through.

363
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:31,590
And the passion fruit's
there, but not overwhelming.

364
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,360
There's absolutely nothing
the matter with this,

365
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,200
except it looks a mess. I'll take
that. Thank you, Laura. Thank you.

366
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:38,950
Thanks.

367
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:40,640
Bloody hell.

368
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:42,441
WHISPERS: Well done. Thank you.

369
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:45,869
I feel great after that.

370
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,720
I wasn't expecting that,
to be honest,

371
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:49,690
I was expecting to get rinsed.

372
00:16:49,691 --> 00:16:50,919
Oh...

373
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,590
When Prue and Paul
say "It's delicious,

374
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:54,230
"and you've got the textures right,"

375
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,481
that is like, yeah, box ticked.

376
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:59,080
I'm disappointed at that.

377
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:01,770
Quite a few mistakes in there.

378
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,080
I really did go into
this pretty blind.

379
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:06,119
It wasn't the best bake,

380
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,721
but we'll have to see.

381
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,520
MATT: For the next challenge,

382
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:17,130
the bakers face a mystery
wrapped in enigmatic gingham.

383
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:20,879
Hello, bakers.
Welcome back to the tent.

384
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,640
It's time for your
Technical Challenge.

385
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:26,410
And, today, it's been set
for you by the lovely Prue.

386
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:27,919
Prue, any words of wisdom?

387
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,440
You are all excellent bakers,

388
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:33,520
so we haven't given you
any extra ingredients.

389
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:36,310
Get it right the first time.

390
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:38,799
As ever, the Technical Challenge
will be judged blind,

391
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,600
so we're going to have to ask
these two poppets to leave the tent.

392
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:42,720
Off you go.

393
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:45,799
THICK ACCENT: Just do it, will you?
This is our park, we play here.

394
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,161
They've got their own park.

395
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:52,310
Prue has popped back to
the 17005 for this technical.

396
00:17:52,311 --> 00:17:56,770
She would like you each to
make two Sussex pond puddings.

397
00:17:56,771 --> 00:18:00,320
Pond puddings. I'm imagining
frog spawn. Ew.

398
00:18:00,321 --> 00:18:03,360
Your puddings should be
made with suet pastry,

399
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:06,129
and when steamed, should be golden.

400
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,129
When cut into, the
filling should ooze out,

401
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,770
creating a lemony, syrupy pond.

402
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:13,640
Mm. Yeah.

403
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:16,640
You should also serve
a silky smooth creme anglaise.

404
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:20,491
You have two and a half hours.
On your marks. Get set. Bake.

405
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:25,960
I've never heard of
a Sussex pond pudding.

406
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:29,080
I think my nan would probably
know what it was. Can I call her?

407
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:31,601
Like probably everyone else,
never seen it before.

408
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:36,490
I think it's an
encased pastry with...

409
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,361
...it sounds like
a whole lemon inside.

410
00:18:40,491 --> 00:18:44,879
PAUL: So our quarterfinal Technical
Challenge, a Sussex pond pudding.

411
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,240
A particular favourite
of mine, actually.

412
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:49,679
This is not the prettiest
pudding in the world,

413
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,720
but it's sort of surprising because
there's a whole lemon inside.

414
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:55,650
Two and a half hours for
this challenge. Mm-hm.

415
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:57,490
Where do you think
they're going to go wrong?

416
00:18:57,491 --> 00:19:00,320
Suet pastry is not the
easiest pastry to deal with

417
00:19:00,321 --> 00:19:03,799
because it's so pliable, and
if it's too floppy, it will tear.

418
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,600
Squidge. How do they know
when it's going to be ready?

419
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:08,240
You haven't given
any time, have you?

420
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:10,570
They should steam it for as
long as they've got, really,

421
00:19:10,571 --> 00:19:12,210
an hour and a half, two hours.

422
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:15,370
Puddings like this go back
so far in British history.

423
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,651
You know, steamed puddings
is what we were known for.

424
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:21,879
That sharpness from the lemon,
the sweetness from the sugar

425
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,929
and the butter, rich pastry
that melts in the mouth.

426
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,730
And then you have this gorgeous
creme anglaise, silky smooth,

427
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:30,040
and that kick of vanilla
as well. It's delicious.

428
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,240
I think it's beautiful.

429
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:33,600
We've got five great
bakers in that tent.

430
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:36,041
I can't wait to see what they
come up with, cos this is delicious.

431
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:40,090
"Make the pastry."

432
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:43,679
The suet looks like cheese. I mean,
what am I supposed to do with that?

433
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,679
Suet is the lovely
protective fat from animals

434
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,879
that surrounds
the livers, the kidneys.

435
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,170
Yum, yum. Never used suet.

436
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:54,570
I don't really eat meat.

437
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:58,960
I mean, does anybody
even eat this in 2020?

438
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:01,290
I've made, like, suet
dumplings a few times.

439
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,241
Suet dumplings?

440
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,929
Oh, they're good! Really?

441
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,530
Oh, yeah. Lighter than you think.

442
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:07,879
You can move after six hours.

443
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,809
LAURA: So it just says, "whole
milk", which is really helpful.

444
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,370
They don't even tell you how much
milk you're supposed to add!

445
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:16,371
This is evil.

446
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:19,090
So I'm just going to
add it bit by bit

447
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:22,290
until it comes into
a nice pliable, soft pastry.

448
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:26,850
Why, why, why would
Prue do this to me?

449
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,257
She's trying to test you. Why?!

450
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:31,660
HE LAUGHS HEARTILY
You're having a breakdown.

451
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:36,381
I am having a suet breakdown.

452
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:37,990
HE LAUGHS

453
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:40,351
The logical part of me just says
make it like you would

454
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:42,990
a normal pastry, so don't
overwork it, keep it cold.

455
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,910
So I'm going to let it
rest a little bit.

456
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,711
I have no idea if that's right.

457
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:49,660
DAVE: So I've made
suet pastry before,

458
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:51,990
you need to knead it
until really smooth.

459
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:53,790
I'm also kneading.

460
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,741
Following blindly.

461
00:20:57,202 --> 00:20:58,990
"Prepare and line
the pudding moulds,"

462
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:02,951
which I've interpreted as
butter and lined with flour,

463
00:21:02,952 --> 00:21:05,311
cos on the ingredients,
it says self-raising flour

464
00:21:05,312 --> 00:21:06,841
plus extra for dusting.

465
00:21:06,842 --> 00:21:07,990
I've greased the sides,

466
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:10,740
and I'm putting a baking
parchment circle at the bottom.

467
00:21:10,741 --> 00:21:13,120
Which is a bit tricky, cos
you've got a tapered bowl,

468
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:14,740
but you don't want it
to increase in there,

469
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,231
you want a nice, smooth pudding.

470
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:19,120
What went through your mind when you
heard you've got to make a Sussex...

471
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:20,631
EMPHASISES Ps: ..pond pudding?

472
00:21:20,632 --> 00:21:22,101
A little bit of panic.

473
00:21:22,102 --> 00:21:25,871
EMPHASISES Ps: You panicked about
making the pond pudding?

474
00:21:27,232 --> 00:21:29,201
EMPHASISES Ps: Is that what
ha-ppened?

475
00:21:29,202 --> 00:21:31,561
Is it? That's what
happened, yeah. Fair enough.

476
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:34,431
PETER: "Step three, line
the pudding moulds with pastry,

477
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:36,711
"reserving some for the lids."

478
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,561
It's not very even, is it?

479
00:21:38,562 --> 00:21:40,152
And they want precision.

480
00:21:42,121 --> 00:21:43,481
We'll do that one again.

481
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:45,481
So now I've got to make the filling.

482
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:48,511
"Mix butter and sugar together."

483
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:51,231
PETER: It's like the most
unhealthy dessert imaginable.

484
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,591
Fatty, "suety" pastry

485
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:56,031
and then a filling
of butter and sugar.

486
00:21:56,032 --> 00:21:57,790
I mean, it's going to
taste good, isn't it?

487
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,391
Place some in the base
of the pudding moulds.

488
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:03,031
It feels like it might be
quite heavy in a medieval way.

489
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:05,001
Yes, definitely very medieval.

490
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:10,281
"Prick the lemons and place
them in the pastry lined moul

491
00:22:10,282 --> 00:22:13,951
How much pricking
am I supposed to do?

492
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:15,392
I think a lot of pricks.

493
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:19,951
LAURA: I don't really fancy a whole
lemon in a bit of pastry, do you?

494
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:22,441
Sorry, Prue, but that's not
how we do it in Gravesend.

495
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:25,951
And then it says, "Cover with
the remaining butter and sugar."

496
00:22:25,952 --> 00:22:29,591
One for you, one for me.

497
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:31,561
One other for you,

498
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:33,361
and one for me, there you go.

499
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:34,362
We're all done.

500
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,311
DAVE: "Top the pastry
with lids and seal."

501
00:22:38,312 --> 00:22:41,031
Put a bit of milk on just to try
and get it to stick a bit better

502
00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:42,082
to the top.

503
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:46,231
All right, so we crimp
or do we not crimp?

504
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,641
Is he crimping?

505
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:51,441
I'm just trying to
crimp the, oh, dang it.

506
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:53,951
I'm kind of messing it up
a little bit, to be honest.

507
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,920
It doesn't say to crimp it
but Paul loves a crimp, doesn't he?

508
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:58,441
Don't know if it will look nice but

509
00:22:58,442 --> 00:23:01,391
I was sort of thinking of pressing
it down slightly with a fork,

510
00:23:01,392 --> 00:23:04,161
like you do with a pie.

511
00:23:04,162 --> 00:23:06,161
"Cut two circles of paper

512
00:23:06,162 --> 00:23:10,841
"and two circles of foil larger
than the top of the pudding moulds."

513
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:12,920
That's not quite a circle, is it?

514
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:15,800
The only thing I'm confused
about is the next step now,

515
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:18,591
where it says, "Fold a pleat
into the centre, then cover."

516
00:23:18,592 --> 00:23:20,391
I don't understand
this pleat business.

517
00:23:20,392 --> 00:23:23,031
NOEL: It's quite minimal, I've seen
the instructions. Very minimal.

518
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:26,031
Just words, aren't they? Just
words. "Go, do, now, thanks."

519
00:23:26,032 --> 00:23:29,920
"Prue... not... worth...
..the... calories"

520
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:31,951
What's everyone doing?

521
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,242
Oh, the pleat.

522
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:36,441
Just crimp and done.

523
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:40,800
Yeah, so it's that, so that when
the steam rises, it goes like that.

524
00:23:40,801 --> 00:23:42,032
There's room for it to expand.

525
00:23:43,162 --> 00:23:44,641
I forgot that.

526
00:23:44,642 --> 00:23:47,311
"Cover the pudding mould with
the pleated paper and foil

527
00:23:47,312 --> 00:23:50,081
"and secure with string,
looping it first around the rim,

528
00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:52,441
"then across the top
to make a handle."

529
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:55,241
The string needs to hold
the foil tightly in place

530
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:59,161
to prevent moisture getting into
the pastry, making it soggy.

531
00:23:59,162 --> 00:24:00,571
Marc's clone a lot of climbing

532
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,281
so he's going to be good
with these knots.

533
00:24:02,282 --> 00:24:03,751
Could even go for a figure of eight.

534
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:06,281
Damn it.

535
00:24:06,282 --> 00:24:08,641
MATT: I feel a bit un-gentlemanly
not offering to help

536
00:24:08,642 --> 00:24:11,000
but I think it wouldn't be
in the spirit of the competition.

537
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:12,391
Yeah, can you cross your fingers?

538
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:14,321
There we go, it's on...
It worked... I think.

539
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:16,680
Wait, actually, wait. Wait,
now I've got to uncross.

540
00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:18,111
No, no. I can't, because...
Cross them again.

541
00:24:18,112 --> 00:24:19,750
Cross them, keep both
of them crossed. OK.

542
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,361
There we go.

543
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:22,602
It just pushes off.

544
00:24:25,272 --> 00:24:29,660
Bakers, you are halfway
through your pond puddings!

545
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:32,222
It says make a handle. I'm
just going to do it my way.

546
00:24:34,942 --> 00:24:37,381
"Place the moulds in
the steamer and steam."

547
00:24:37,382 --> 00:24:39,660
How long are you going to steam for?

548
00:24:39,661 --> 00:24:41,501
An hour?

549
00:24:41,502 --> 00:24:43,341
Don't ask me.

550
00:24:43,342 --> 00:24:45,092
Probably about
an hour 50 in the end.

551
00:24:46,222 --> 00:24:47,740
Did you ever have dim sum?

552
00:24:47,741 --> 00:24:49,660
They steam those,
don't they, sometimes?

553
00:24:49,661 --> 00:24:53,351
Are they nice? Well, I
like dim SUM of them. Nice.

554
00:24:53,352 --> 00:24:54,660
How long did that one take you?

555
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,221
Yeah, it took me...
Well, we workshopped it,

556
00:24:57,222 --> 00:24:59,271
then I decided not to use it.

557
00:24:59,272 --> 00:25:04,221
So, the only thing left to do
is to make a creme anglaise.

558
00:25:04,222 --> 00:25:07,301
NOEL: Creme anglaise is
a combination of egg yolks

559
00:25:07,302 --> 00:25:10,711
and sugar beaten together,
tempered with warm cream and milk,

560
00:25:10,712 --> 00:25:13,301
and delicately
flavoured with vanilla.

561
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:15,780
Prue said that we are
not able to do it again,

562
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:17,660
so if we mess up, like, that's it.

563
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:19,990
It says half a vanilla pod,

564
00:25:19,991 --> 00:25:22,581
and I put up full
vanilla pod in there.

565
00:25:22,582 --> 00:25:25,501
Let's remove a little bit.
SHE CHUCKLES

566
00:25:25,502 --> 00:25:28,101
I'll add in my egg yolk
and sugar mixture slowly.

567
00:25:28,102 --> 00:25:31,101
Otherwise, you're going
to end up with scrambled eggs.

568
00:25:31,102 --> 00:25:34,021
MATT: While the rest of the bakers
are making their creme anglaise,

569
00:25:34,022 --> 00:25:36,740
Dave hasn't even started steaming.

570
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:39,271
I've got to try and
get this knot in it.

571
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:42,551
I think it's ready
cos it's thickened.

572
00:25:42,552 --> 00:25:44,102
That one's not so great.

573
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,102
That's the custard done.

574
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:53,431
All clone. Whether it's good
or not, we shall find out.

575
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:55,740
Is everyone else finished
apart from me?

576
00:25:55,741 --> 00:25:56,861
Yeah.

577
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:02,660
All the bakers can do now is wait.

578
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:03,991
HE EXHALES HEAVILY

579
00:26:09,661 --> 00:26:12,431
What can we do? Surely
there's something we can do.

580
00:26:12,432 --> 00:26:14,790
We could do something
with string, couldn't we?

581
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:17,581
We could tie up Peter
and ruin his bake.

582
00:26:17,582 --> 00:26:21,351
Bakers, you have half
an hour left, half an hour!

583
00:26:21,352 --> 00:26:24,351
Not that you seem that bothered,
you're all just sitting about.

584
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:25,791
PETER: Let's see what it looks like.

585
00:26:28,072 --> 00:26:31,021
So I'm looking for it to be
a little bit more brown

586
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:33,790
and a little bit, sort of, crispier.

587
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:36,231
Just going to
neglect the string now.

588
00:26:36,232 --> 00:26:37,351
That's going to be fine.

589
00:26:37,352 --> 00:26:38,910
MATT: Last to go in...

590
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:41,382
Gosh.
..Dave is first to come out.

591
00:26:43,022 --> 00:26:46,182
So, the last thing to do
is turn out and serve.

592
00:26:47,871 --> 00:26:49,312
Ooh.

593
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,790
There you go, some pond puddings.

594
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:01,990
Oh, disgusting.

595
00:27:01,991 --> 00:27:05,351
Bakers, you have five
minutes left, five minutes!

596
00:27:05,352 --> 00:27:07,312
I'm going to take
out my pond puddings.

597
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:14,311
MARC: Well, I think it's looking OK.

598
00:27:14,312 --> 00:27:16,181
Lovely soggy suet.

599
00:27:16,182 --> 00:27:20,540
It's a wet pond in the middle,
so not much structure to it.

600
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:21,671
I'm going to turn mine now, I think.

601
00:27:24,072 --> 00:27:25,951
Well, well.

602
00:27:25,952 --> 00:27:27,821
It's a pond pudding.

603
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:30,151
Bakers, you have one minute left.

604
00:27:30,152 --> 00:27:32,432
Let's try another way
of un-molding it.

605
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:41,901
Oh...

606
00:27:41,902 --> 00:27:43,282
Got a leakage situation.

607
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:47,641
Pre-cut it already for them.

608
00:27:47,642 --> 00:27:49,540
It has collapsed.

609
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:52,751
That's a shame, but it
looks rather impressive.

610
00:27:54,182 --> 00:27:56,471
This one sunk a bit. I did my best.

611
00:27:56,472 --> 00:28:01,182
NOEL: OK, bakers, your time is up.

612
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:04,721
There's a pond, there's a pudding.

613
00:28:04,722 --> 00:28:07,081
MATT: If you'd like to
bring your puddings

614
00:28:07,082 --> 00:28:09,392
and place them behind
your photographs, please.

615
00:28:11,032 --> 00:28:13,920
The bakers' Sussex pond puddings
now face

616
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:16,671
the exacting judgment
of Prue and Paul.

617
00:28:18,902 --> 00:28:20,441
Right, bakers,

618
00:28:20,442 --> 00:28:25,281
we were asking for some
well-steamed suet pastry pudding

619
00:28:25,282 --> 00:28:31,281
filled with a whole lemon
and a butter and sugar filling

620
00:28:31,282 --> 00:28:34,721
and some silky creme anglaise.
So, what have we got?

621
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:37,391
Let's start with this one.
Well, it's leaking already.

622
00:28:37,392 --> 00:28:40,311
They are whole and you can see
the shape, which is a good thing.

623
00:28:40,312 --> 00:28:42,231
The pastry would've been really good

624
00:28:42,232 --> 00:28:44,591
if it had had a little
longer in the steamer,

625
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:47,191
because you can see
it's beginning to flake.

626
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,641
That's a bit thin, that sauce.

627
00:28:49,642 --> 00:28:51,191
The taste of everything is OK,

628
00:28:51,192 --> 00:28:53,800
it just needed cooking out
a little bit more. Yeah.

629
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:56,870
Now these, um, pasties.

630
00:28:56,871 --> 00:28:58,641
That's raw.

631
00:28:58,642 --> 00:29:01,441
Well, that looks like
a good custard. Yeah.

632
00:29:01,442 --> 00:29:04,000
Nice and "vanilla-y".
It's nice, that needed sealing

633
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:05,561
and longer in the steamer.

634
00:29:05,562 --> 00:29:08,521
Now we have one which needed longer.

635
00:29:08,522 --> 00:29:11,641
But at least it's shaped
nicely. Yeah. Absolutely, yeah.

636
00:29:11,642 --> 00:29:15,271
This one is a little more cooked,
but it's still not enough.

637
00:29:15,272 --> 00:29:17,591
That lemon is bullet hard.

638
00:29:17,592 --> 00:29:20,000
The creme anglaise
is all right. Mm-hm.

639
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:22,361
It's a shame. Yeah, it is
a shame. Now, this one...

640
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:23,831
I'm not quite sure
what happened here

641
00:29:23,832 --> 00:29:26,161
whether it's just collapsed
in on itself. Yeah, it has.

642
00:29:26,162 --> 00:29:27,831
It's just raw. It is.

643
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:32,241
In another hour, that pastry
would've been flaky and lovely. Mm.

644
00:29:32,242 --> 00:29:35,311
The creme anglaise is nice
on that one. It's spot on.

645
00:29:35,312 --> 00:29:36,831
We have one whole one here.

646
00:29:36,832 --> 00:29:39,800
Let's see if we can get
through the middle of this.

647
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:41,471
It's not been cooked again.

648
00:29:41,472 --> 00:29:45,241
And the problem with under steaming
is the lemon doesn't soften enough.

649
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:47,081
The juice doesn't come out of it,

650
00:29:47,082 --> 00:29:49,800
and the sauce becomes
more sugar and butter.

651
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:51,031
I mean, the flavour's OK.

652
00:29:51,032 --> 00:29:53,081
So this is going to be
an interesting judge.

653
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:56,111
Although, the shapes of the...
It's not been steamed long enough.

654
00:29:56,112 --> 00:30:00,471
MATT: Prue and Paul will now rank
the puddings from worst to best.

655
00:30:00,472 --> 00:30:02,321
In fifth place...

656
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:04,161
...is this one.

657
00:30:04,162 --> 00:30:08,081
David, this was very under
steamed. The custard was nice.

658
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:10,471
In fourth spot, we have this one.

659
00:30:10,472 --> 00:30:12,550
Massively under steamed.

660
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:15,831
It was falling through,
and the lemon was still hard.

661
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:19,391
In third place, Hermine,
the flavour was good,

662
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,721
but it needed two hours' steaming.

663
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:24,471
And second spot, we have
this one. Whose is this?

664
00:30:24,472 --> 00:30:29,651
Mine. At least you had two
likeable looking suet puddings,

665
00:30:29,652 --> 00:30:32,630
but it just needed longer to break
down the lemon and the filling.

666
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:36,241
Which means that in
first place is this one.

667
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:38,111
Laura, I wish I could say
it was wonderful,

668
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:40,041
but it really wasn't
much better than the rest.

669
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:43,321
I'm sorry. It was under-steamed,
would've been great.

670
00:30:43,322 --> 00:30:44,831
Custard too thin.

671
00:30:44,832 --> 00:30:47,321
And at this point, we still
normally have a round of applause

672
00:30:47,322 --> 00:30:49,911
for the winner, don't we?
Well done, Laura.

673
00:30:49,912 --> 00:30:52,961
Came first in a Technical.
Can you believe that?

674
00:30:52,962 --> 00:30:56,630
I'm not jumping up for joy, but
I'll take that. I'm still happy.

675
00:30:56,631 --> 00:30:58,961
I didn't think I'd get second.

676
00:30:58,962 --> 00:31:01,321
I was hoping to be last,
I'm usually last!

677
00:31:01,322 --> 00:31:04,760
Super, smashing,
great Dessert Week(!)

678
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:07,191
Not going too well!

679
00:31:07,192 --> 00:31:10,321
It's still not
an unmitigated disaster

680
00:31:10,322 --> 00:31:14,631
because the creme anglaise was good,
so we'll take that as a win.

681
00:31:21,722 --> 00:31:23,721
MATT: Well, good luck, everybody.

682
00:31:23,722 --> 00:31:26,051
We talk every week now

683
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:29,211
about the margins getting
slimmer and slimmer and slimmer.

684
00:31:29,212 --> 00:31:31,690
There wasn't that much in it
in the signature,

685
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:35,181
and we've just had a Technical where
everyone pretty much did the same.

686
00:31:35,182 --> 00:31:38,411
PRUE: My favourite pudding in the
whole world is a Sussex pond,

687
00:31:38,412 --> 00:31:40,101
and I tell you what,

688
00:31:40,102 --> 00:31:42,491
they made a complete mess of it.

689
00:31:42,492 --> 00:31:46,131
But it does occur to me that
I'm 80 years old,

690
00:31:46,132 --> 00:31:49,820
and steamed pudding, I grew up with
them and I absolutely love them.

691
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:53,570
And I'm 40, and I still really
like steamed pudding, too.

692
00:31:53,571 --> 00:31:56,621
That's weird. Your hair, then,
is quite a lot older than you are.

693
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:58,621
All right, move on!

694
00:31:58,622 --> 00:32:02,091
Laura won the Technical, and
because she had a strong Signature,

695
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:04,450
she's put herself into...
In line for Star Baker.

696
00:32:04,451 --> 00:32:06,851
In line for Star Baker.
Yes, she has. Again.

697
00:32:06,852 --> 00:32:09,450
You've got Hermine, you've got Marc,
and you've got David,

698
00:32:09,451 --> 00:32:11,931
who are all sort of in the middle,
could go either way.

699
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:13,700
Peter is at the bottom,

700
00:32:13,701 --> 00:32:16,091
which isn't something we've
really seen very often.

701
00:32:16,092 --> 00:32:18,450
He's really got to
try his best in the Showstopper,

702
00:32:18,451 --> 00:32:21,092
because he's sitting
right down at the bottom.

703
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,731
Good morning, bakers.

704
00:32:25,732 --> 00:32:28,621
Welcome back to the tent
for your Showstopper Challenge.

705
00:32:28,622 --> 00:32:31,341
Now, today, the judges would
like you each to make

706
00:32:31,342 --> 00:32:33,700
a jelly art design cake.

707
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:38,421
This layered dessert needs
to have a visually spectacular

708
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:41,261
jelly art topping or coating.

709
00:32:41,262 --> 00:32:44,731
At least one element of your cake
should include a baked sponge.

710
00:32:44,732 --> 00:32:47,731
Noel, what jelly art would you make?

711
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:50,650
Nude sculpture of Paul Hollywood.
Oh.

712
00:32:50,651 --> 00:32:52,981
What flavour would the nipples be?
Lime.

713
00:32:52,982 --> 00:32:54,780
Oh. Authentic. Exactly.

714
00:32:54,781 --> 00:32:56,501
You have four and a half hours.

715
00:32:56,502 --> 00:32:58,862
On your marks... Get set... Bake!

716
00:33:03,142 --> 00:33:05,061
I didn't grow up eating jelly.

717
00:33:05,062 --> 00:33:07,780
It's an Anglo-Saxon thing.

718
00:33:07,781 --> 00:33:10,371
# I don't think you're
ready for this jelly! #

719
00:33:10,372 --> 00:33:12,261
I'm ready for the jelly, yeah.

720
00:33:12,262 --> 00:33:14,011
This is a first
for the Bake Off tent.

721
00:33:14,012 --> 00:33:15,931
There's a baked element,
there's a mousse,

722
00:33:15,932 --> 00:33:18,541
and then you have this jelly.
Now, I look forward to the jelly.

723
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:20,981
It's like going back to
when you were a kid again.

724
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:23,811
The setting of the jelly
is really critical.

725
00:33:23,812 --> 00:33:26,981
Most of the bakers, I'm sure,
will use gelatine.

726
00:33:26,982 --> 00:33:28,731
They may use agar-agar.

727
00:33:28,732 --> 00:33:31,341
Gelatine is a bit of a scary beast,
because you don't know

728
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,861
if it's going to be enough
until you've completed it

729
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:35,191
and it's set in the fridge.

730
00:33:35,192 --> 00:33:37,941
Too much, it'll be like rubber and
it won't break down in the mouth...

731
00:33:37,942 --> 00:33:40,421
35 leaves of gelatine.

732
00:33:40,422 --> 00:33:44,371
35 leaves of pig hide.

733
00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:48,061
If you don't have your nail
and your hair growing after this,

734
00:33:48,062 --> 00:33:49,780
you've got a problem.

735
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:51,621
...too little, it'll be like water.

736
00:33:51,622 --> 00:33:54,061
In my last practice,
I had a bit of a collapse.

737
00:33:54,062 --> 00:33:55,910
PRUE: To make the jelly art,

738
00:33:55,911 --> 00:34:02,301
the bakers need to inject
liquid jelly into set jelly.

739
00:34:02,302 --> 00:34:03,981
It really takes a lot of skill.

740
00:34:03,982 --> 00:34:05,861
You bet I'm worried!

741
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:08,221
The stress levels in the tent
are going to be quite high.

742
00:34:08,222 --> 00:34:10,580
The bakers are going to start
thinking of the final,

743
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,421
they're only a couple of weeks
away now.

744
00:34:12,422 --> 00:34:14,381
I hope it doesn't play on their mind
too much,

745
00:34:14,382 --> 00:34:16,861
because what we want are
five amazing bakes

746
00:34:16,862 --> 00:34:20,271
from, actually,
five fantastic Star Bakers.

747
00:34:20,272 --> 00:34:23,631
Calm, cool, collected Laura is
what you're going to see today.

748
00:34:23,632 --> 00:34:25,660
Need a bit of skill, a bit of luck.

749
00:34:25,661 --> 00:34:28,092
I'm hoping that they all
come together today.

750
00:34:31,742 --> 00:34:33,631
Hi, Marc. Hi, Paul. Hi, Prue.
Morning, Marc.

751
00:34:33,632 --> 00:34:36,171
All right, Marc, tell us all about
your jelly design cake.

752
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:38,221
OK, so I'm making, effectively,
a mousse cake

753
00:34:38,222 --> 00:34:40,580
with a panna cotta insert
in the centre,

754
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:44,101
dacquoise top, and then two
layers of apple jelly on top.

755
00:34:44,102 --> 00:34:45,631
Two layers of apple jelly.

756
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,221
Yeah, two-tier jelly.

757
00:34:47,222 --> 00:34:48,660
This is going to be interesting.

758
00:34:48,661 --> 00:34:51,021
As usual,
you're doing an enormous amount.

759
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,381
Oh, no, not again!
Yeah, but actually, the last time,

760
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:56,021
you did pull it off and managed to
get it out on time. I did, I did.

761
00:34:56,022 --> 00:34:58,991
Marc's chocolate and strawberry
mousses will be sandwiched

762
00:34:58,992 --> 00:35:02,021
between two layers of
ground hazelnut meringue.

763
00:35:02,022 --> 00:35:03,501
His two tiers of jelly

764
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:05,171
will be flavoured with apple

765
00:35:05,172 --> 00:35:09,101
and display jelly-art roses
and jasmine flowers.

766
00:35:09,102 --> 00:35:11,780
So you're injecting your flowers,
are you? Yes, yeah.

767
00:35:11,781 --> 00:35:14,351
And have you done this a lot before?

768
00:35:14,352 --> 00:35:15,861
I wouldn't say I've done it a lot.

769
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:18,181
Well, if you want to get
through to the semifinals,

770
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,460
you've got to smash this one.

771
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:20,941
OK, I'll try my best.

772
00:35:20,942 --> 00:35:23,580
Did that help, by the way?
No, that didn't help at all, Paul.

773
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:25,631
Marc, it's very ambitious.
Thank you.

774
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:27,991
I have some confidence
that you'll do it.

775
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:31,460
It's time to be ambitious.
It's time. Yeah, I will try my best.

776
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:34,301
PETER: So we've got a little bit
of orange and cranberry flavour.

777
00:35:34,302 --> 00:35:36,910
They're mainly clear in colour
and very concentrated,

778
00:35:36,911 --> 00:35:39,821
so that it doesn't affect the
texture or the look of the jelly.

779
00:35:39,822 --> 00:35:42,551
All of the bakers are adding
artificial flavourings

780
00:35:42,552 --> 00:35:44,381
to their main jelly features,

781
00:35:44,382 --> 00:35:45,991
before setting them in the fridge.

782
00:35:45,992 --> 00:35:48,351
MARC: I was originally going
to go for elderflower,

783
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,660
but realised it tasted
a little bit of smelly feet.

784
00:35:50,661 --> 00:35:51,741
Did it? Yeah.

785
00:35:51,742 --> 00:35:54,151
Well, how often have you eaten feet?
How would you know?

786
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,351
Well, I've already eaten one, haven't I!
Now, that's answered a lot of questions!

787
00:35:57,352 --> 00:35:59,351
Getting quite firm,

788
00:35:59,352 --> 00:36:00,871
which is a really good sign.

789
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:03,941
HERMINE: I'm worried about jelly
not setting enough.

790
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:07,351
That could be a big issue.

791
00:36:07,352 --> 00:36:10,660
With the large elements setting,
most of the bakers are making

792
00:36:10,661 --> 00:36:13,821
the coloured jelly they'll use
to make the jelly art.

793
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:16,301
This is becoming more
and more blood like, isn't it?

794
00:36:16,302 --> 00:36:18,590
Vampires got the same idea.

795
00:36:18,591 --> 00:36:20,021
Do you know any vampires?

796
00:36:20,022 --> 00:36:22,431
Yeah, there's just one
standing next to me.

797
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:24,460
Hey, come on, that's a rumour!

798
00:36:24,461 --> 00:36:27,660
You have got quite a lot of
neck exposed, though, right now!

799
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:29,511
SHE LAUGHS

800
00:36:29,512 --> 00:36:31,460
They're not as set
as they normally are.

801
00:36:31,461 --> 00:36:33,460
I'm actually going to
do the fish again.

802
00:36:33,461 --> 00:36:35,101
Bye, little fishy.

803
00:36:35,102 --> 00:36:37,821
I wouldn't do that to one at home,
promise!

804
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:41,710
Inspired by the real one in
her garden, Laura's jelly art

805
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:45,741
will be a koi pond, complete with
fish and injected aquatic plants.

806
00:36:45,742 --> 00:36:49,271
It will sit atop layers of genoise
sponge, raspberry mousse

807
00:36:49,272 --> 00:36:51,101
and white chocolate bavarois.

808
00:36:51,102 --> 00:36:52,590
I mean, it sounds amazing.

809
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:55,151
The flavours are often good
from you, so we expect that.

810
00:36:55,152 --> 00:36:56,901
What are you using to
set your jelly?

811
00:36:56,902 --> 00:36:59,431
Agar-agar,
which I imported from Australia,

812
00:36:59,432 --> 00:37:03,231
which I think is like, professional
use for, like, this kind of thing.

813
00:37:03,232 --> 00:37:06,101
And will it be clear enough?
Yeah, it does set clear.

814
00:37:06,102 --> 00:37:08,710
Is the grasshopper,
is that part of it, as well?

815
00:37:08,711 --> 00:37:10,231
Who's that guy?

816
00:37:10,232 --> 00:37:12,151
Oh, wow. Oh, look at him,
isn't he sweet?

817
00:37:12,152 --> 00:37:15,151
He's going to be in the actual pond.
He'll be in it, as well. Yeah.

818
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:17,460
Thank you. Good luck, Laura.
Very good luck.

819
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:18,901
Going to need it!

820
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:20,920
Just wait and see
what these ones do.

821
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:24,071
While Laura needs her fish to set
before filling her pond,

822
00:37:24,072 --> 00:37:26,710
Dave's opted for a paint-as-you-go
approach

823
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,045
to his aquatic-themed jelly art.

824
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,475
My jelly art is layered.

825
00:37:30,476 --> 00:37:32,721
Each layer will build up
an image of, like,

826
00:37:32,722 --> 00:37:34,510
a 3D perspective of a beach scene.

827
00:37:34,511 --> 00:37:36,201
That goes in the fridge to set,

828
00:37:36,202 --> 00:37:37,971
then I'll put another
clear layer on,

829
00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:40,431
then I've got to do another
colour layer, and so forth.

830
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:45,151
MATT: Dave's jelly incarnation
of surfers' paradise Newquay

831
00:37:45,152 --> 00:37:47,001
will taste of apple and guava,

832
00:37:47,002 --> 00:37:50,201
riding a wave of fudge cake
and clotted cream mousse.

833
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:51,611
NOEL: Do you surf?

834
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:54,871
I try to surf. It's a thing that you
go, "Oh, I want to be good at surfing,"

835
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:56,560
and then you go,
"Oh, it's quite hard."

836
00:37:56,561 --> 00:37:58,481
Yeah, you're like,
"Oh... It looked easier."

837
00:37:58,482 --> 00:38:01,081
On Point Break, it looks easy.
Yeah! What a great film.

838
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:02,841
If they remade it with me and you,

839
00:38:02,842 --> 00:38:04,481
you'd have to be Keanu...
You reckon?

840
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,801
...and I'd have to be Swayze.
Yeah, you reckon?

841
00:38:06,802 --> 00:38:08,611
Yeah, not I reckon, that's a fact!

842
00:38:08,612 --> 00:38:10,921
My dad's dog's called Swayze.

843
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:13,841
After Patrick Swayze?
After Patrick Swayze. Wow!

844
00:38:13,842 --> 00:38:16,921
Swayze, if you're watching this,
respect!

845
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:18,411
Good luck.

846
00:38:18,412 --> 00:38:21,161
While I'm waiting for it to set,
I'm going to start my cake.

847
00:38:21,162 --> 00:38:23,520
For the foundations of their
jelly constructions,

848
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:26,001
most of the bakers have
chosen a type of sponge.

849
00:38:26,002 --> 00:38:27,971
Just making my genoise sponge.

850
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,841
I think it should be pronounced
"gen-wa" but I'm from Gravesend,

851
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,520
so it's a "gen-oh-ese"!

852
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:35,131
Does it annoy me when
people say "gen-oh-ese"?

853
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:37,481
Well, if you're going to
speak a language,

854
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:41,132
you've got to make the effort, and
that's about all I'm going to say!

855
00:38:42,492 --> 00:38:44,841
They'll be in at 170
for about 20 to 30 minutes.

856
00:38:44,842 --> 00:38:47,161
It's quite a broad window
that I've given myself there.

857
00:38:47,162 --> 00:38:48,971
Putting that in for 40 minutes.

858
00:38:48,972 --> 00:38:51,411
I need it to be fudgy,
I don't want it to be dry, so...

859
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,081
But Marc's two-tiered creation
will be underpinned

860
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,971
with airy meringue...

861
00:38:55,972 --> 00:38:57,640
This is a hazelnut dacquoise,

862
00:38:57,641 --> 00:39:00,132
basically, French meringue
with folded nuts.

863
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:04,411
...while Hermine's risking possible
subsidence

864
00:39:04,412 --> 00:39:07,770
by adding a cherry liqueur drizzle
to her genoise sponge.

865
00:39:07,771 --> 00:39:12,520
Who can possibly hate a cake
with a bit of alcohol in it?

866
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:15,411
Her sponge needs to hold up
two mousse layers

867
00:39:15,412 --> 00:39:18,361
and a domed jelly decorated
with a giant poppy flower.

868
00:39:18,362 --> 00:39:21,131
She's wrapping the whole
cake in a chocolate collar

869
00:39:21,132 --> 00:39:23,801
and finishing with a
white chocolate ganache.

870
00:39:23,802 --> 00:39:26,601
So when we put our knife through,
is it going to hold?

871
00:39:26,602 --> 00:39:28,520
Well, I hope it does.

872
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:32,931
Has it held up in practice?
I've practised them separately,

873
00:39:32,932 --> 00:39:37,971
and I've never put
one on top of the other.

874
00:39:37,972 --> 00:39:40,291
So it's going to be a first!

875
00:39:40,292 --> 00:39:44,241
And have you done injecting jelly
before, to make flowers?

876
00:39:44,242 --> 00:39:49,291
A couple of times. It is a bit
tricky cos the jelly can split.

877
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:51,881
Well, good luck. Thank you, Hermine.
Thank you. Thanks.

878
00:39:51,882 --> 00:39:53,441
Going to need it!

879
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:57,690
While Hermine's gambling
with a soggy sponge...

880
00:39:57,691 --> 00:40:00,211
Shall we name them
as we put them in?

881
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:03,241
...Laura's Showstopper
is taking solid shape.

882
00:40:03,242 --> 00:40:05,520
Which one's got evil eyes?

883
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:08,331
Sorry, Paul. In you go!

884
00:40:08,332 --> 00:40:11,961
I'm going to move on to
the strawberry mousse.

885
00:40:11,962 --> 00:40:14,491
As well as the baked element
and melt-in-the-mouth jelly,

886
00:40:14,492 --> 00:40:17,690
Prue and Paul want to see
a perfectly-set mousse.

887
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:21,291
PETER: I've got orange juice
and cranberry juice to reduce down,

888
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:24,161
and this is going to be
part of the base for my mousses.

889
00:40:24,162 --> 00:40:27,770
Clotted cream, going in.
Gelatine will be added to this.

890
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:29,411
It just helps the mousses set,

891
00:40:29,412 --> 00:40:32,570
cos we do not want another
ice cream splat.

892
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:34,372
Can't. Having nightmares about it.

893
00:40:35,732 --> 00:40:39,092
It did say, "Stir in the egg yolks,"
but it's gone kind of gloopy.

894
00:40:40,602 --> 00:40:43,881
Peter's also trying to
make his mousse less loose.

895
00:40:43,882 --> 00:40:46,291
I'm just adding in a little bit
of cornflour to make

896
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:49,450
the custard base for the mousses
slightly thicker.

897
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:53,851
But he's the only baker whose use
of custard extends to his jelly art.

898
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:59,091
Now I'm making the panna cotta
for my moulded panna cotta shapes.

899
00:40:59,092 --> 00:41:01,570
Just wanted to make sure
that I get every step right.

900
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:03,852
Can't be doing with
easy slip-ups today.

901
00:41:05,451 --> 00:41:08,061
His panna cotta will
form Christmas decorations

902
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:11,191
to fit to the inside of his
clear snow globe jelly.

903
00:41:11,192 --> 00:41:13,911
The extra sturdy cranberry
and orange juice mousses

904
00:41:13,912 --> 00:41:15,911
will hopefully add stability

905
00:41:15,912 --> 00:41:19,191
and fill the cut-out centre
of his sandwich cake.

906
00:41:19,192 --> 00:41:22,401
Is there enough time to set
everything? Hopefully so.

907
00:41:22,402 --> 00:41:24,760
How long did it take
to set in practice?

908
00:41:24,761 --> 00:41:27,111
I don't know.
I didn't really time it completely.

909
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,791
You didn't time it? No.
That's useful.

910
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:31,680
We'll do it today, though. I've got
faith. All right, well, good luck.

911
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:34,041
Got faith in you. Thank you.
Good luck!

912
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:37,791
Fakey cakey bakers,
you have one hour left.

913
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,071
Righty ho, rinky dink, okey dokey.

914
00:41:40,072 --> 00:41:43,760
I need to stay at a nice, fast lick.

915
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:46,071
The bakers need their mousses
to start setting

916
00:41:46,072 --> 00:41:47,760
and their baked elements cooling...

917
00:41:47,761 --> 00:41:49,122
I'd better get my prick.

918
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:52,991
I've cooked it on a lower
temperature for longer,

919
00:41:52,992 --> 00:41:55,711
purposely trying to give it
a really crunchy texture.

920
00:41:55,712 --> 00:41:57,680
...before they return their attention

921
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:01,151
to the star of this week's
Showstopper.

922
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:03,071
Sideways swimming fishes.

923
00:42:03,072 --> 00:42:05,841
I think with the flowers above it,
it should look OK.

924
00:42:05,842 --> 00:42:07,351
Here we go.

925
00:42:07,352 --> 00:42:10,430
When you insert it in the cut,
as you press and draw back,

926
00:42:10,431 --> 00:42:13,310
that fills it with colour.
It's a crazy technique.

927
00:42:13,311 --> 00:42:15,231
LAURA: Just doing lots of petals.

928
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:17,662
It's got a ragged edge to emulate
a peony, really.

929
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:21,430
Now I'm going to do the
weirdest thing in the world,

930
00:42:21,431 --> 00:42:23,760
cookie cutting panna cottas.

931
00:42:23,761 --> 00:42:26,952
Oh, you bugger.
Didn't want that to happen.

932
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:30,041
These are reindeer.

933
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:32,351
They're being a little bit
tricky today.

934
00:42:32,352 --> 00:42:34,630
This is quite loose.

935
00:42:34,631 --> 00:42:37,791
Come on... I've got a blockage.

936
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:39,711
It's kind of baking.

937
00:42:39,712 --> 00:42:41,482
Baking, but not as we know it.

938
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:48,151
Well, I'm not out of the wood, yet.
My mousse still hasn't set.

939
00:42:48,152 --> 00:42:49,991
It's like a surgical operation,
isn't it?

940
00:42:49,992 --> 00:42:52,680
Hopefully the jelly won't
feel any pain afterwards!

941
00:42:52,681 --> 00:42:56,201
I might get some jelly flowers
put into my liver. Yeah.

942
00:42:56,202 --> 00:42:57,560
Will you do it? Yeah.

943
00:42:57,561 --> 00:43:00,002
I don't want to be out, though.
I want to see it all.

944
00:43:01,482 --> 00:43:04,281
Wow, look at that! Yeah, getting
there. Come on, that's tremendous.

945
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:06,711
I'm going to call myself the jelly
Picasso.

946
00:43:06,712 --> 00:43:09,712
I like the look of it.
I didn't know I had it in me!

947
00:43:12,311 --> 00:43:16,641
I'm heating up the inside bowl here
to melt the edge of the jelly.

948
00:43:18,592 --> 00:43:21,560
And then I'll be able to add in
the panna cotta figures now.

949
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:24,121
This is so annoying, look. You've
got a bit sort of hanging off,

950
00:43:24,122 --> 00:43:25,871
and you don't know
where to start it.

951
00:43:25,872 --> 00:43:27,401
This looks tricky. I'm so sorry.

952
00:43:27,402 --> 00:43:30,151
We're just talking about opening
foil, so we're going to leave you.

953
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:32,525
Matt, you stay there until
you've worked it out.

954
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,942
I've got to figure this out.

955
00:43:36,126 --> 00:43:38,782
This is going to be
the bottom of the jelly.

956
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,501
When you look through it,
you see, like,

957
00:43:40,502 --> 00:43:43,352
a green background on the bottom,
and then the flowers should lift.

958
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:45,662
I just want to seal the top.

959
00:43:45,663 --> 00:43:47,992
I think I'll put it
in the fridge right now.

960
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:49,502
I think I've figured it out, Laura.

961
00:43:53,193 --> 00:43:56,143
I'm notorious for my mess, aren't I?
You'd be disappointed if I wasn't.

962
00:43:57,502 --> 00:44:00,222
Bakers, you have 30 minutes left.

963
00:44:00,223 --> 00:44:02,551
Just need it to set.

964
00:44:02,552 --> 00:44:05,272
And then I need it to release
from the bowl perfectly.

965
00:44:05,273 --> 00:44:10,112
With his cake setting in the fridge,
all Dave has to do is wait.

966
00:44:10,113 --> 00:44:13,023
For the rest of the bakers,
it's time to build.

967
00:44:14,793 --> 00:44:15,992
You all right?

968
00:44:15,993 --> 00:44:19,072
Things haven't set
as much as I'd like them to.

969
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,353
How do I do this?

970
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,761
Oh, help, help, help, help, help.

971
00:44:30,762 --> 00:44:33,512
It's OK. It's OK.
Why is this so stressful?

972
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:38,582
It cracked a bit on the side.

973
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:40,631
Doing a bit of DIY here.

974
00:44:40,632 --> 00:44:43,352
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

975
00:44:43,353 --> 00:44:46,992
I'm going to attempt to
put the jelly on the cake.

976
00:44:46,993 --> 00:44:48,592
Then the jelly on the jelly.

977
00:44:48,593 --> 00:44:50,912
I'm going to clip this
in some hot water.

978
00:44:50,913 --> 00:44:52,872
Held too briefly in the water,

979
00:44:52,873 --> 00:44:56,152
the bakers risk tearing the jelly
when they flip it over.

980
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:57,912
It all hangs on this.

981
00:44:57,913 --> 00:44:59,712
It's hot, as well, this water.

982
00:44:59,713 --> 00:45:02,203
Leave it too long
and they risk melting it.

983
00:45:04,762 --> 00:45:07,912
That is very melty.
Too melty, probably.

984
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,202
Releasing now.

985
00:45:09,203 --> 00:45:10,793
Come on...

986
00:45:19,432 --> 00:45:21,353
That does not want to come.

987
00:45:26,843 --> 00:45:28,203
Come on, release!

988
00:45:30,123 --> 00:45:31,432
Doing it...

989
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,872
We have a wibble wobble.

990
00:45:37,873 --> 00:45:39,511
Jeepers creepers.

991
00:45:39,512 --> 00:45:41,353
That's not awful.

992
00:45:42,562 --> 00:45:44,312
Bakers, you have one minute left.

993
00:45:46,562 --> 00:45:47,793
Gosh...

994
00:46:00,432 --> 00:46:03,002
Bakers, your time is up.

995
00:46:03,003 --> 00:46:05,352
Done it! Yeah!

996
00:46:05,353 --> 00:46:09,761
Please step away from
your jelly art desserts.

997
00:46:09,762 --> 00:46:12,792
I'm so happy with that.
I think it looks really cool.

998
00:46:12,793 --> 00:46:15,672
Look at what happened,
I've done a jelly cake!

999
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:18,392
The good news is, I never have
to make one of those again!

1000
00:46:27,532 --> 00:46:30,892
After four and a half hours
of jelly artistry

1001
00:46:30,893 --> 00:46:33,212
and with a place in the semifinal
at stake,

1002
00:46:33,213 --> 00:46:36,252
the bakers have to face the judges.

1003
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:39,452
Laura, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

1004
00:46:49,532 --> 00:46:52,862
You can see it. It reminds you of
a pond, doesn't it? Yeah.

1005
00:46:52,863 --> 00:46:54,842
I love the way you've put
the flowers in there,

1006
00:46:54,843 --> 00:46:57,222
I think they look great.
And it's got bubbles in it.

1007
00:46:57,223 --> 00:47:00,012
That's the koi bubbling.
Yeah. Well, it's brilliant.

1008
00:47:00,013 --> 00:47:03,092
I'd like to have seen the sponge
covered with something. OK.

1009
00:47:03,093 --> 00:47:05,531
So it looks... neater.

1010
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,813
That jelly looks quite nice
and soft too.

1011
00:47:11,582 --> 00:47:15,972
Mm! The raspberry mousse is
particularly good. Thank you.

1012
00:47:15,973 --> 00:47:18,292
Really lovely.
It's perfect, actually. Lovely.

1013
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,692
Every layer is excellent.

1014
00:47:19,693 --> 00:47:23,222
The jelly melts in the mouth,
the elderflower works really well.

1015
00:47:23,223 --> 00:47:27,762
Every single texture, every single
flavour is spot-on for me. Wow.

1016
00:47:27,763 --> 00:47:30,651
Thank you so much.
Well done. Thanks.

1017
00:47:30,652 --> 00:47:33,613
Smashed it, well done. Thank you.

1018
00:47:42,763 --> 00:47:44,692
David, I think it is
absolutely astonishing.

1019
00:47:44,693 --> 00:47:46,692
It is completely beautiful.

1020
00:47:46,693 --> 00:47:48,772
They are my colours exactly.

1021
00:47:48,773 --> 00:47:53,451
Yeah, Prue as a jelly design cake,
that would be it. Very clever.

1022
00:47:53,452 --> 00:47:57,451
I've given you a massive piece
there, Prue. David, that is so neat.

1023
00:47:57,452 --> 00:47:58,452
Thank you.

1024
00:48:00,693 --> 00:48:01,842
Your jelly is fantastic.

1025
00:48:01,843 --> 00:48:03,842
It's nice and light
and it melts in the mouth,

1026
00:48:03,843 --> 00:48:06,172
but your downfall is
the bit underneath.

1027
00:48:06,173 --> 00:48:07,972
Is that clotted cream mousse? Yes.

1028
00:48:07,973 --> 00:48:10,302
Well, you've probably put
too much gelatine in it. Yeah.

1029
00:48:10,303 --> 00:48:11,531
It's too stodgy.

1030
00:48:11,532 --> 00:48:15,092
Your sponge itself, I'm not getting
chocolate and I'm certainly

1031
00:48:15,093 --> 00:48:18,382
not getting fudge, though
when you eat that with that,

1032
00:48:18,383 --> 00:48:20,692
it feels dry. Oh, right. OK.

1033
00:48:20,693 --> 00:48:22,102
I wouldn't be quite so harsh.

1034
00:48:22,103 --> 00:48:27,492
My only quarrel is with
the mousse, which isn't as silky

1035
00:48:27,493 --> 00:48:29,852
soft as you expect,
but do you know what?

1036
00:48:29,853 --> 00:48:32,852
I think it's quite an achievement,
David, really. Cheers. Thank you.

1037
00:48:32,853 --> 00:48:35,852
And I think it's beautiful. Cheers.
Thank you. Well done.

1038
00:48:35,853 --> 00:48:38,853
Well done.
It does look phenomenal. Cheers.

1039
00:48:45,532 --> 00:48:48,172
It's very abstract, isn't it?
So, that's a reindeer

1040
00:48:48,173 --> 00:48:50,972
and that's a snowman
and that's a Christmas tree

1041
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:52,612
and then it's repeated.

1042
00:48:52,613 --> 00:48:55,772
I don't think it looks
very like a snow globe.

1043
00:48:55,773 --> 00:48:58,612
Probably needed bolder colours.
When you think of a Christmas tree,

1044
00:48:58,613 --> 00:49:01,461
you don't think of something as pale
as that. You needed more vibrancy

1045
00:49:01,462 --> 00:49:04,253
to it because it's a bit pastel.
Let's have a look inside.

1046
00:49:05,332 --> 00:49:08,461
There's mousse right down
to the centre.

1047
00:49:08,462 --> 00:49:10,742
Not the easiest cake to cut.

1048
00:49:10,743 --> 00:49:11,772
No.

1049
00:49:11,773 --> 00:49:16,132
I question whether those mousses
are actually set properly yet.

1050
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:18,461
They're very, very soft. OK.

1051
00:49:18,462 --> 00:49:20,182
I think your sponge
is slightly over baked

1052
00:49:20,183 --> 00:49:21,932
and you can tell by the colour.

1053
00:49:21,933 --> 00:49:23,742
It shouldn't be
quite as dark as that.

1054
00:49:23,743 --> 00:49:25,612
The flavours, though, are beautiful.

1055
00:49:25,613 --> 00:49:27,972
I think the main problem
is with the size,

1056
00:49:27,973 --> 00:49:31,022
because it's really difficult
to get a huge slice out.

1057
00:49:31,023 --> 00:49:33,331
And because the mousses
are only just set,

1058
00:49:33,332 --> 00:49:34,742
it's just like a good trifle

1059
00:49:34,743 --> 00:49:37,102
and I'm going to have
the other mouthful.

1060
00:49:37,103 --> 00:49:39,383
Thank you. Well done.
Well done, Peter.

1061
00:49:40,933 --> 00:49:42,462
Well done, Peter.

1062
00:49:53,542 --> 00:49:56,622
The strawberry mousse looks curdled...
It has, yeah... and not set.

1063
00:49:56,623 --> 00:49:58,346
This is going to be
an interesting cut.

1064
00:49:58,347 --> 00:50:00,601
It's on a board as well, actually...

1065
00:50:00,602 --> 00:50:02,882
The jelly's on the top of a board?
Yeah. Yeah.

1066
00:50:04,962 --> 00:50:09,551
Oh, dear. It's slightly overdone,
this. Yeah. It's like concrete.

1067
00:50:09,552 --> 00:50:10,802
Oh, dear.

1068
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:17,931
THEY LAUGH

1069
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,082
Excuse me, Prue.

1070
00:50:20,271 --> 00:50:24,111
Is that meant to be mousse, that
chocolate? It's supposed to be, yes.

1071
00:50:24,112 --> 00:50:26,601
Is it?! That's more like a ganache.

1072
00:50:26,602 --> 00:50:28,440
Your chocolate is too hard. Yeah.

1073
00:50:28,441 --> 00:50:31,681
The mousse has split,
the dacquoise is over baked. Yeah.

1074
00:50:31,682 --> 00:50:34,041
And the jelly is...
The jelly's too rubbery.

1075
00:50:34,042 --> 00:50:37,041
But besides that, brilliant.
I like the design.

1076
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:39,551
You're the only one, sort of,
to do a two-tier design. Yeah.

1077
00:50:39,552 --> 00:50:43,238
I just don't think you've organised
the whole cake as a one-piece.

1078
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:45,759
I don't think the concept
was right at all. No. Right.

1079
00:50:57,518 --> 00:51:01,829
Beautiful. Thank you. Straight out
of a Parisian patisserie.

1080
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:06,267
And I'll tell you what,
I'm a hot-stuff gardener

1081
00:51:06,268 --> 00:51:08,958
and that is the most perfect
Japanese poppy.

1082
00:51:08,959 --> 00:51:11,679
Thank you. Right.

1083
00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:20,118
It's absolutely gorgeous.

1084
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:23,038
The raspberry, the chocolate mousse
work beautifully well together

1085
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:25,368
and then you've got that
almost aromatic flavour

1086
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:27,088
coming from the jelly. Fantastic.

1087
00:51:27,089 --> 00:51:29,008
All the layers are interesting.

1088
00:51:29,009 --> 00:51:33,397
The poppy top is fantastic
and you know how to make genoise

1089
00:51:33,398 --> 00:51:37,238
and you've made a perfect one.
So it's a real triumph. Lovely.

1090
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:38,447
Well done, Hermine.

1091
00:51:38,448 --> 00:51:41,397
Oh, the white chocolate ganache
is delicious too. It is.

1092
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:42,958
Take it away. Quickly!

1093
00:51:42,959 --> 00:51:45,559
Go away before we find something
to complain about. Thank you.

1094
00:51:47,198 --> 00:51:48,478
Well done.

1095
00:51:48,479 --> 00:51:50,317
Thank you.

1096
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:53,088
I just can't believe it.

1097
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:58,647
I mean, I was happy enough
getting a jelly cake out

1098
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:03,369
and those comments... Oh, my God.
I just can't believe it.

1099
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:06,959
LAUGHING: That went great,
didn't it?

1100
00:52:08,009 --> 00:52:11,278
Er... it could have gone better.

1101
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:16,478
This is by far the week that I'm
closest to the bottom of the pile.

1102
00:52:16,479 --> 00:52:18,758
I'm not sure if I've done enough.

1103
00:52:18,759 --> 00:52:19,889
I think I have.

1104
00:52:29,059 --> 00:52:31,058
Wow! That was incredible.

1105
00:52:31,059 --> 00:52:33,128
It was good, wasn't it?

1106
00:52:33,129 --> 00:52:36,258
I think it was the most
amazing day, today.

1107
00:52:36,259 --> 00:52:39,008
What about Hermine? I think she's
done an amazing job with that.

1108
00:52:39,009 --> 00:52:43,058
It reminded me of looking in
the window of Fauchon in Paris.

1109
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,778
You know, it's got that elegance
to it.

1110
00:52:45,779 --> 00:52:48,138
And then I thought Laura's was
really good.

1111
00:52:48,139 --> 00:52:50,618
It was a bit untidy round the edges,
but the cake was great,

1112
00:52:50,619 --> 00:52:53,457
the two mousses were good,
the topping was lovely.

1113
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:56,178
I think when you look at David's,
for me, it was too halves.

1114
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:58,898
The top half was amazing,
probably the best one.

1115
00:52:58,899 --> 00:53:01,207
But, for me, the
bottom half didn't work.

1116
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:03,287
Peter's tasted really nice,

1117
00:53:03,288 --> 00:53:05,648
but I don't think it was the best
thing he's ever done.

1118
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:08,258
You said it was too big, as well,
so it was hard to cut a slice.

1119
00:53:08,259 --> 00:53:09,568
When you cut a slice,

1120
00:53:09,569 --> 00:53:12,698
you want to be taking that around to
show people, don't you?

1121
00:53:12,699 --> 00:53:15,818
As opposed to, when you look at
Marc's, a chainsaw!

1122
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:18,568
Because the dacquoise was just
over-baked.

1123
00:53:18,569 --> 00:53:20,898
Honestly, I could have stood
on that.

1124
00:53:20,899 --> 00:53:22,618
Poor Marc. I felt so sorry for him.

1125
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:24,498
Nothing went right in that.

1126
00:53:24,499 --> 00:53:26,287
We're really beginning
to narrow it down now.

1127
00:53:26,288 --> 00:53:27,648
So we're looking at mistakes.

1128
00:53:27,649 --> 00:53:29,648
Now, the technical was pretty bad
for all of them,

1129
00:53:29,649 --> 00:53:31,498
even the person that won,
which was Laura.

1130
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:34,287
And then we look at the Signature,
and it was fairly tight on that.

1131
00:53:34,288 --> 00:53:37,498
They all managed to produce
mini-Cheesecakes of one form

1132
00:53:37,499 --> 00:53:39,858
or another so, when it came
to the Showstopper

1133
00:53:39,859 --> 00:53:42,217
we've got to look at that
more carefully

1134
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:44,188
because it's a four-and-a-half-hour
chauenge

1135
00:53:44,189 --> 00:53:45,988
and you can't just brush that off.

1136
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:48,268
We've got to look at the Showstopper
properly.

1137
00:53:52,448 --> 00:53:55,598
Bakers, I have got the great job
of announcing

1138
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,598
who is Star Baker this week.

1139
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,428
Before I do that, I just want to say
that Showstopper was off the hook.

1140
00:54:01,429 --> 00:54:04,558
It really was amazing,
so well done, all of you.

1141
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:09,198
Now, this week's Star Baker is...

1142
00:54:12,198 --> 00:54:14,168
...Hermine.

1143
00:54:14,169 --> 00:54:15,678
SHE EXHALES

1144
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:18,277
Well done, Hermine.
Thank you.

1145
00:54:18,278 --> 00:54:20,598
SHE MOUTHS

1146
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:25,918
Well, it falls to me, then, to tell
you who's leaving us this week.

1147
00:54:25,919 --> 00:54:28,708
It's someone who's
been on an incredible journey

1148
00:54:28,709 --> 00:54:33,118
and I know that this journey will
continue after this show.

1149
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,559
And the person who is leaving us
this week is...

1150
00:54:41,398 --> 00:54:42,998
I'm so sorry, It's Marc.

1151
00:54:42,999 --> 00:54:44,527
It's OK.

1152
00:54:44,528 --> 00:54:47,248
Cheers, guys.
Give us a hug.

1153
00:54:47,249 --> 00:54:48,608
Cheers, mate.

1154
00:54:48,609 --> 00:54:51,168
Enjoy the sun! Yep.

1155
00:54:51,169 --> 00:54:52,608
Thank you, Prue.

1156
00:54:52,609 --> 00:54:55,638
I'm sorry, Marc. No, no, I knew
I'd reached my limit this week.

1157
00:54:55,639 --> 00:55:00,118
I'm feeling... surprisingly OK,
actually.

1158
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:02,478
Gonna miss you.
Yeah, miss you too.

1159
00:55:02,479 --> 00:55:05,118
I mean, I came to the Bake Off
to kind of face my anxieties,

1160
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,277
to face failure, to face all those
things that, as people,

1161
00:55:08,278 --> 00:55:10,638
we're quite uncomfortable
about dealing with.

1162
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:12,998
I've definitely learnt a bit
more about myself,

1163
00:55:12,999 --> 00:55:15,358
and maybe,
from what a lot of people have said,

1164
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:18,438
it's to give myself a bit more
credit, as well, which I, I don't.

1165
00:55:18,439 --> 00:55:19,888
Cheers, Paul. Thank you.

1166
00:55:19,889 --> 00:55:22,248
Marc's been great.
And actually he's been on probably

1167
00:55:22,249 --> 00:55:24,758
the biggest journey out of all
the bakers in the tent this year.

1168
00:55:24,759 --> 00:55:26,407
He started off pretty badly,

1169
00:55:26,408 --> 00:55:29,918
and then, as each week has
passed by, he's got better

1170
00:55:29,919 --> 00:55:32,888
and better and better,
and it's a shame to see him go.

1171
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:35,327
Survived! Yes, survived.

1172
00:55:35,328 --> 00:55:37,358
I'm through to the semifinal!

1173
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,248
I'll take that!

1174
00:55:39,249 --> 00:55:41,768
It's hard right now because it's,
like, fortunate for me,

1175
00:55:41,769 --> 00:55:44,048
but I'm going to miss Marc so much,

1176
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,327
and it's a bit of an odd feeling.

1177
00:55:46,328 --> 00:55:47,838
Bittersweet, sort of happy,

1178
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:50,438
but the shine has definitely been
taken off of it,

1179
00:55:50,439 --> 00:55:53,248
especially when you lose someone
that you're close to,

1180
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:56,799
and then I think Marc
was... a real gent.

1181
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:04,558
Can't believe it. I'm still seeing
myself in the tent, nervous,

1182
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,968
about whether that jelly
will set or not.

1183
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:12,327
And I can't believe they liked
that flower and the whole bake.

1184
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:13,798
Aren't you a clever girl?

1185
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:19,438
Hermine, her second Star Baker
in a row. She is an amazing baker.

1186
00:56:19,439 --> 00:56:22,918
In the past, she's done really well
because she's kept it quite safe,

1187
00:56:22,919 --> 00:56:27,277
but this time, she made
this amazing Japanese poppy.

1188
00:56:27,278 --> 00:56:28,608
It was just beautiful.

1189
00:56:28,609 --> 00:56:30,568
Semifinal Week next week,

1190
00:56:30,569 --> 00:56:32,888
and we've got four fantastic bakers.

1191
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,639
I still cannot call who's going
to be in the final.

1192
00:56:36,919 --> 00:56:40,157
I don't think it's sunk in yet
that the semifinal is coming up.

1193
00:56:40,158 --> 00:56:41,608
It doesn't feel real.

1194
00:56:41,609 --> 00:56:44,078
HE EXHALES
Like, mind blown.

1195
00:56:45,929 --> 00:56:47,568
Next time,

1196
00:56:47,569 --> 00:56:48,848
the semifinal.

1197
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:50,207
Don't make mistakes!

1198
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:51,768
And temperatures rise again...

1199
00:56:51,769 --> 00:56:53,048
So warm in here.

1200
00:56:53,049 --> 00:56:55,358
...as the bakers meet
the challenge...

1201
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:56,688
Never eaten it, never seen it.

1202
00:56:56,689 --> 00:56:58,358
...with a mind-bending technical.

1203
00:56:58,359 --> 00:57:00,688
This is like rocket science.

1204
00:57:00,689 --> 00:57:03,048
Who will turn it up
in the Showstopper...

1205
00:57:03,049 --> 00:57:04,488
We're allowed to make
a lot of noise.

1206
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:06,848
...and who will be left
wooing the judges...

1207
00:57:06,849 --> 00:57:08,358
You have to imagine
it's Paul's face.

1208
00:57:08,359 --> 00:57:09,568
Ooh-ho!

1209
00:57:09,569 --> 00:57:13,568
...as they fight for a place in the
final of The Great British Bake Off?

1210
00:57:13,569 --> 00:57:16,439
How's it going?
I just don't have a logical brain.

1211
00:57:17,609 --> 00:57:19,928
Are you a Star Baker in the making?

1212
00:57:19,929 --> 00:57:22,688
