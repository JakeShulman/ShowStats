00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,160
Hello, and welcome to Biscuit Week.

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,800
- Oh, Uncle Noel.
- Yes?

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,560
I've got a couple of facts about biscuits.
May I share them?

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,439
- Let's hear them.
- Okay. Did you know

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,320
that biscuits were invented
by Sir Morris Biscuits in 1950-12?

6
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:28,520
And also, did you know

7
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,000
that over 40 biscuits a year
are sold in Europe alone?

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,160
Did you know that in America,
they're not called biscuits?

9
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,239
- Oh?
- They are called the sidewalk.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,519
Noel!

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,440
Welcome to the <i>Great British Baking Show!</i>

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,519
<i>This time, it's Biscuit Week.</i>

13
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:48,440
Whoa.

14
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:50,160
<i>With a sticky signature...</i>

15
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,519
<i>...that's tight on time.</i>

16
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:54,040
What a disaster.

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,760
<i>A tropical technical
that has the bakers bemused...</i>

18
00:00:57,839 --> 00:00:59,080
I've got no idea, mate.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,360
<i>...and a brittle showstopper...</i>

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,119
I might cry if this breaks.

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,320
<i>...that leaves
the whole tent anxious.</i>

22
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,360
I remember worrying a bit
about your very large nuts.

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,119
Morning! Another day. Ah!

24
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:43,240
I'm so happy to be back for week two.
I don't wanna flap today.

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,920
I'm gonna try and be cool,
controlled and calm.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,399
We'll see how that goes.

27
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,679
Hopefully, this week,
there'll be no more tears.

28
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,080
My mum did say to me, "Stop crying.
Don't know why you're crying."

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,960
She's so harsh.

30
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,720
I'm excited about Biscuit Week.
I'm not shaking, I'm all right.

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,960
Terrified. Absolutely terrified.

32
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,600
Biscuits are quite tricky. So, I think
it's gonna be a difficult week.

33
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:09,160
As long as I get through,
that's fine.

34
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,400
If I get Star Baker, that's my final.

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,799
Bakers, welcome back to the tent
for Biscuit Week.

36
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,760
And for your signature challenge,
the judges would like you each to make

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959
a batch of 36 chocolate Florentines.

38
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,760
Interesting fact, Florentines
were originally called Florentines.

39
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,480
Thank you, Noel.
I actually wrote that fact.

40
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,239
Your Florentines should be uniform
in terms of shape, texture and flavour,

41
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,600
and the judges will be expecting
a perfect snap.

42
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:52,880
Your Florentines must be dipped,
decorated or coated in chocolate.

43
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,480
You have two hours.

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,480
It is time for you to leap
onto your marks, please.

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,120
And make sure at that point then
that you get set.

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,200
For it is now time to very much bake!

47
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,440
Chocolate Florentines
is all about the snap.

48
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,120
Gotta have a good snap on a Florentine.

49
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,519
Nervous.

50
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, not about eating them,
but about making them, yes, I'm nervous.

51
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,720
It's Biscuit Week,
and we're kicking off with Florentines.

52
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,720
A really good classic Florentine
consists of nuts and dried fruit

53
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,359
bound together in a caramelly,
buttery mixture.

54
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,679
I mean, they are fattening,
but they're gorgeous.

55
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,799
This challenge is tricky.
They have to get the caramel right,

56
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,359
they have to get the filling right,
choice of chocolate.

57
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,720
I personally think dark chocolate
is the way forward.

58
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,359
The sweetness with the bitterness
of the dark chocolate

59
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,840
is a beautiful blend.

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,799
It would help if I put that bit in.

61
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,000
The perfect Florentine is neat as a pin
and small and thin.

62
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,679
Timing is everything.

63
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,560
Half a minute too long,
and they'll be burnt.

64
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,839
Half a minute too short,
and they won't have that crisp crack.

65
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,200
- Morning, Peter.
- Hello, hello.

66
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,359
You did really well last week.
What have you got in store for us?

67
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,239
I'm making sticky toffee Florentines,

68
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,440
inspired by what is in my opinion
the best pudding in the world,

69
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,920
sticky toffee pudding. I've got dark
muscovado sugar in the caramel.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,079
I've got lots of dates. So, it should have
those lovely toffee flavours.

71
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,080
<i>After pounding the trails
outside his hometown Edinburgh,</i>

72
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:28,680
<i>proud Scot Peter likes to replace
the lost calories</i>

73
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,159
<i>with some good hearty fare.</i>

74
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,360
Stick in till you stick out.

75
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,599
<i>Based on his favourite pudding
growing up,</i>

76
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,520
<i>Peter's sticky toffee Florentines</i>

77
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:40,320
<i>contain a gooey mix of dates,
sultanas, and chopped nuts,</i>

78
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,479
<i>topped with caramelized white chocolate.</i>

79
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,520
Will they be thin and have a snap to them,
or will they be sticky and squishy?

80
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:50,320
Both crunchy and chewy,
'cause when you bite into the dates,

81
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,560
that's gonna be chewy.

82
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,960
But also, I'm hoping
you'll be able to get a snap

83
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,599
from the caramel nut side
of the biscuit as well.

84
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,240
- Thank you. Good luck.
- Good luck, Star Baker.

85
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,880
Thank you very much.

86
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,039
<i>Peter's not the only baker
inspired by a childhood favourite.</i>

87
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,000
Traditionally, in Iran,
there's this brittle called Sohan,

88
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,000
which is cardamom, saffron and rosewater.

89
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,039
They're flavours I grew up on.
They're part of my heritage.

90
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:19,800
<i>When key worker Sura needs
to unwind from a hard day at the hospital,</i>

91
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,880
<i>she branches out with a spot of yoga.</i>

92
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,960
<i>Sura's Florentines, containing
toasted almonds and pistachios,</i>

93
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,440
<i>will be flavoured
with rosewater and saffron</i>

94
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
<i>brought back from her trips to Iran.</i>

95
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:35,080
<i>Alongside her biscuits,
she'll serve traditional cardamom tea.</i>

96
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,840
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

97
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,695
Are you over the old...

98
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:41,400
- Yeah, yeah.
- The...

99
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:44,400
- You gonna try that again?
- No!

100
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,200
Oh, look!

101
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,840
Oh, stop it, no, no, no.

102
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,079
- It was traumatic.
- You were in the corner like this.

103
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:54,000
Laughing to yourself.
What have you done on your days off?

104
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,440
Practice, practice, practice,
burnt myself out.

105
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,200
- Burnt yourself out?
- Yeah, I was really tired.

106
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,359
- I had a nightmare about Paul.
- I had a dream about Paul.

107
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,400
He was just in an apron.
It was pretty powerful.

108
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:10,840
- It's last night, actually.
- Stop!

109
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,320
- Good luck, yeah.
- You need to go away.

110
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,680
My Florentines are
one of my sister's favourite biscuits.

111
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,280
She had a really sweet tooth
when we were kids.

112
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:29,919
When my mum turned her back,
I used to quickly eat her dinner and...

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,719
So she could
get to her pudding quick.

114
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,719
<i>At the end of a hard day's weeding,</i>

115
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:37,640
<i>green-fingered Linda and partner Richard</i>

116
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:40,880
<i>love nothing more
than a refreshing pint in their shed.</i>

117
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:42,799
I don't normally kiss the barman.

118
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,280
<i>Decorated with delicate
sugar flowers and dark chocolate,</i>

119
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:50,400
<i>Linda's aiming to give her childhood
inspired Florentines a smooth finish.</i>

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,680
I blend the nuts down
into quite small chunks.

121
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,120
That way, hopefully, when they spread,
you get a much more even surface.

122
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:04,039
<i>But in terms of texture,
Linda's consistency is not for everyone.</i>

123
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,000
In my nuts, I want some bigger bits 'cause
you want, obviously, a bite of nuts.

124
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,719
<i>Mark's career has taken him
around the globe,</i>

125
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,680
<i>but when at home in Liverpool,
he loves nothing more than baking</i>

126
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,359
<i>for friends and wife, Laura.</i>

127
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,280
That's nice.

128
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:19,880
<i>Flavoured with cardamom</i>

129
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,080
<i>and decorated with waves
of white chocolate,</i>

130
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:26,359
<i>Mark's chunky Florentines contain a mix
of macadamia nuts and dried mango.</i>

131
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,919
We should sell some, shouldn't we,
at lunchtime?

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,880
- We can set up a tuck shop.
- Set up a kiosk.

133
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,479
- You make fresh, hot biscuits.
- Yeah, yeah.

134
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,200
I'll get a kiosk on the go.
We'll have it on wheels.

135
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,400
Be amazing, wouldn't it?

136
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,840
- It would be.
- Make a mint.

137
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,440
- Long way to transport...
- We'll make 37 euros each.

138
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,680
I love a biscuit, though.

139
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,520
I don't eat them. I like looking at them.

140
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,280
- Okay.
- I eat with my eyes.

141
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:51,039
That's why I'm not allowed in restaurants.

142

<i>But when it comes to the king
of fruits, Mark has competition.</i>

143
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:59,799
I know there's a lot of people in the tent
using mango as well today,

144
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,560
so I think it's a bit of a mango-off.

145
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,679
<i>Three other bakers
are also trying to tempt the judges</i>

146
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,039
<i>with this tropical treat.</i>

147
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,000
It's mango Florentine week, isn't it?

148
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,960
May the best mango win.

149
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,200
This is dried mango.
I'm just gonna put this in boiling water,

150
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,200
and let them soak for a bit.
Otherwise, it'll be too chewy.

151
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,840
- Ooh, juicy.
- Juicy ones.

152
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,880
<i>Not content with work, baking,
and taking care of his extended family,</i>

153
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,799
<i>Mak has also found the time
to write a novel.</i>

154
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
First draft finished.

155
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,719
<i>His Florentines feature a trio
of classic Indian ingredients,</i>

156
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:33,360
<i>mango, cashew and cumin.</i>

157
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:35,480
<i>But while Mak is familiar
with his flavours,</i>

158
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:39,319
<i>his hand-piped peacock feather design
will be a step into the unknown.</i>

159
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,319
I've never decorated them before.

160
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,720
So, a world exclusive.

161
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,000
My one's called
Feathered Chocolate Mango Florentines.

162
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,680
I really enjoy eating all things mango,

163
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,680
that's why I wanted to put mango in there.

164
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,160
<i>When not experimenting
with exotic flavours,</i>

165
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,800
<i>Dave and his girlfriend Stacey enjoy walks
with their Japanese hunting dog, Yoki.</i>

166
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,280
Come on, then, you pain.
He wasn't gonna come back.

167
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,000
<i>He's celebrating his love of mango</i>

168
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:13,480
<i>with Florentines containing a mix of nuts
and sesame seeds for added crunch.</i>

169
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,160
<i>He'll decorate each biscuit
by feathering three types of chocolate.</i>

170
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,480
I've weighed out each scoop,
so each scoop is about 25 or 26 grams,

171
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,319
so, hopefully, they should all come out
nice and uniform.

172
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,640
- <i>Whether the bakers use moulds...</i>
- I'm using these rings.

173
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,880
<i>...or choose to go freehand,</i>

174
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,800
<i>Paul and Prue will demand consistency
in size and shape across the batch.</i>

175
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,160
I make my Florentines the traditional way.

176
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,480
So, I've really gotta make sure
that I measure out the biscuit.

177
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,000
This is a cake pop scoop
to get my quantities right.

178
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:46,560
<i>Bake Off</i>, supposed to be identical.

179
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,600
I'm being precise
and weighing 18 grams into each mould.

180
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,400
They want perfection.
They want 36 identical Florentines.

181
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,240
About three quarters of a teaspoon
to a teaspoon in each one.

182
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:57,319
Some people measure.
I haven't got the patience.

183
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't want them too chunky
because they won't snap.

184
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,560
I'll be honest,
I haven't made Florentines before.

185
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,720
I'm from Gravesend.
Hobnobs are posh where I'm from.

186
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,319
<i>At home in Kent,
Laura isn't the only baker.</i>

187
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,319
<i>She shares her passion and pizza oven
with husband Matt.</i>

188
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,520
Oh, brilliant. Cheers.

189
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,400
<i>A self-confessed
salted caramel addict,</i>

190
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,800
<i>Laura will coat her almond,
pecan and raisin Florentines</i>

191
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,000
<i>in sweet milk chocolate.</i>

192
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:26,280
Because it's quite salty,
dark chocolate was too rich,

193
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,439
so I chose milk chocolate as a base.

194
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,760
My family, when I've made these,
have just absolutely devoured them.

195
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,720
<i>Lottie has also decided
to go with a family favourite.</i>

196
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,640
I am making
quarantine Florentines

197
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,000
for my grandparents
because it is their favourite biscuit.

198
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Nana and Papa.

199
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,640
<i>Although Lottie's grandparents live
down the road from her in Littlehampton,</i>

200
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,480
<i>it's been six months
since she's been able to give them a hug.</i>

201
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,959
- I love you!
- I love you, too.

202
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,400
I'll FaceTime you later.

203
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,640
<i>Her grandparents'
favourite Florentines</i>

204
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:02,959
<i>are a classic combination of chopped nuts,
ginger and sour cherries.</i>

205
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,040
<i>But when it comes to decoration,
Lottie's taking an abstract approach.</i>

206
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,560
If you're doing
Jackson Pollock-esque splashes,

207
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,160
will they all be uniform?

208
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,800
- No.
- Absolutely not.

209
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,959
That's why I'm doing
Jackson Pollock splashes.

210
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,880
- A uniform mess.
- A uniform mess. Exactly, Paul.

211
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,839
Bakers, you are halfway through...

212
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,319
Right.

213
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,719
- ...your lives.
- How's it going?

214
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,079
Right. In they go.

215
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,920
<i>Because they contain so much sugar,</i>

216
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,400
<i>judging the bake time of their Florentines
will test the bakers to their limit.</i>

217
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,319
Those are going in
at 180 for seven minutes.

218
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,199
These are going in for 12 minutes.

219
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,560
Eleven minutes on the top shelf
and eleven and a half on the bottom.

220
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,079
I have to be really careful
about the timing of these

221
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,120
'cause they can go over really quickly.

222
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,240
Twelve and a half minutes.
Actually, 12 minutes and 26 seconds.

223
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:58,800
I don't really do precision,
but I realised it's definitely called for.

224
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,079
<i>While most of the bakers have
their first batch of biscuits baking...</i>

225
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,480
I'm sorry, but I'm panicking.

226
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,360
<i>...Hermine is still moulding hers.</i>

227
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,120
I'm a little bit behind.

228
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:12,760
<i>Born and raised in West Africa
on her mother's pineapple farm,</i>

229
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,800
<i>Hermine moved to London
almost 20 years ago</i>

230
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,480
<i>and is studying to become an accountant.</i>

231
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,120
Think I've done enough for today.
I need a break.

232
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,319
<i>She's adding shredded dried mango
and coconut flakes</i>

233
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,640
<i>to her Florentines,
which she'll coat in ruby chocolate</i>

234
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,640
<i>and decorate with spray-painted trees.</i>

235
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:32,400
I'm worried about getting the snap
because, to be honest,

236
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,400
er, mine were quite chewy.

237
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,760
Apparently, Paul Hollywood
likes them with the snap,

238
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,480
so, yeah, bit nervous about that.

239
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:47,079
<i>Perfecting a batch
of 36 identical biscuits</i>

240
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,959
<i>will require the bakers
to walk a time and temperature tightrope.</i>

241
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,520
In practice, I took 'em out too soon,
so waiting for that golden colour.

242
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:57,319
I'm not quite sure
when they're going to be done.

243
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,880
Are they done, are they not?

244
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,480
It's just a hard one to call.
Gotta get that snap.

245
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,199
<i>Misjudge either...</i>

246
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,520
Let's see how they look.

247
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:08,160
<i>...and any chance of achieving
uniform texture and colour...</i>

248
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,280
- Oh.
<i>- ...will go up in smoke.</i>

249
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
I'm not happy with them.

250
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:14,400
They're not as brown
as I thought they would be at this stage.

251
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,000
Bottom ones just need a minute longer.

252
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,560
That sounded crunchy.

253
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,640
I cooked them for longer today,
which gives it a good snap.

254
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,319
I'm 90% sure they've got snap.

255
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,319
Second batch in.

256
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,079
They're just great. I'm happy with them.

257
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,240
I'm thinking, are they even?

258
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:33,599
Is that round?

259
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,000
What's Paul Hollywood gonna say?

260
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,680
They seem rather gooey.

261
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:42,520
Erm, my Florentines,
they're inspired by my grandmother,

262
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:46,599
who had a very lovely garden,
and who was a very good, homely cook.

263
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Very beautiful.

264
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:50,880
<i>A keen gardener himself,
when he's not pruning,</i>

265
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,199
<i>Rowan can be found bringing out the shine
on his large collection of antiques.</i>

266
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,319
That's a bit better.

267
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,680
<i>In homage
to his grandmother's garden,</i>

268
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,240
<i>Rowan's colourful Florentines
feature a trio of vibrant dried fruits.</i>

269
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:04,959
<i>But when it comes to decoration,</i>

270
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,520
<i>he's had to look no further
than his own flamboyant wardrobe.</i>

271
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,839
I'm coating them
with modelling chocolate waistcoats.

272
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
Which is in honour
of your waistcoat collection.

273
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,560
It is. And my garden on the back.

274
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,360
- Yes.
- Oh, lovely.

275
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,640
- How many waistcoats have you got?
- About a dozen or so.

276
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:25,319
I've got an 18th century one,
embroidered in France in about 1780,

277
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,439
which is beautiful.

278
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,880
Paul, this is what
posh people talk about, isn't it?

279
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:31,719
This is going right over my head.

280
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,400
<i>With their biscuits cooling,</i>

281
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:39,079
<i>the bakers can turn their attention
to chocolate.</i>

282
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,319
Gotta love the smell of chocolate.

283
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,935
I'm topping my Florentines
with caramelized white chocolate.

284
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,040
You bake it in the oven,

285
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,360
then it takes on a really dark,
caramelly colour and flavour

286
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:51,800
and it tastes so, so good.

287
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,920
I'm just melting some chocolate
and I'm tempering.

288
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,479
Tempering gives it that snap.

289
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,120
It's a frustrating process,
especially for white chocolate.

290
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,319
It's very precise.

291
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,520
Keep stirring this
'cause it's really hot, still.

292
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:05,400
Couple of degrees out, you have
to start the whole process again.

293
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:08,560
That looks delicious.
I'd sort of like to get in that.

294
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,479
I could stick my head in a bucket of that.

295
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,000
If I was an insect,
I'd get in that, like a sort of hot tub.

296
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:18,599
<i>But with her Florentines
only just out of the oven...</i>

297
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,959
<i>...Hermine is playing catch-up.</i>

298
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,839
Stabbing the Florentines.

299
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,760
Please!

300
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:28,959
It's, er, ruby chocolate,
and I only discovered it a few months ago.

301
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,536
And I was really surprised
about the flavour.

302
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,760
Almost like white chocolate,

303
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,280
but then you've got lovely sourness
coming through at the end.

304
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,839
<i>Now a sculptor,</i>

305
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,360
<i>Marc spent many years
working as a landscape photographer,</i>

306
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,400
<i>a passion he now shares
with youngest daughter, Rosie.</i>

307
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,479
Brilliant.

308
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,880
<i>Not only is Marc
using ruby chocolate</i>

309
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,880
<i>to give his Florentines extra flavour,</i>

310
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:51,160
<i>but he's adding ginger
to give his square-shaped biscuits a kick.</i>

311
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,360
What do you think of the shape?
Nice, isn't it?

312
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:54,679
I like the square shape.

313
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:57,280
I've never, ever seen a square before,

314
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,599
so I'm very...
Very excited about these biscuits.

315
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,175
- It's a completely new concept.
- Yeah.

316
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:04,959
'Cause I don't... I'm learning shapes.

317
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,560
- You know rhombus, don't you?
- I know rhombus.

318
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,319
- Cuboid?
- I don't know cuboid.

319
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,120
- You know circle.
- But I don't know semi-circles.

320
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:13,800
- No.
- I'm not onto them yet.

321
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,400
- We'll do that later.
- We'll learn it later.

322
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:22,800
Sweet, lovely bakers, you do be
having 30 of minutes remainings.

323
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
Yes!

324
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
How marvellous.

325
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,760
Oh, I'm melting chocolate.
No time to think.

326
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,120
I put some colour in this chocolate.

327
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,560
It's just gone a bit solid,
so I'm gonna reheat them.

328
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,160
I'm just slightly short of time.

329
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,719
Lots of little waistcoats.

330
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,040
There's a huge amount of work to do.
I'm always very ambitious.

331
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:48,280
I'm just going for
the standard dunk. Dunk and wipe.

332
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,959
A dip, a swipe and trying
to make them as neat as possible.

333
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,000
What I'm aiming to do is
just get a really thin layer on here,

334
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:02,040
sit the biscuits on, and then
the chocolate will set beautifully,

335
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,760
but they won't give me any stress.

336
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,359
Oh, gosh.

337
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,359
It's going well, isn't it?

338
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,239
You see if you communicate through rap...

339
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,960
- Right.
- ...the kids really take it in.

340
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,320
- They take it in better.
- Yeah.

341
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,040
Let's get them decorated.

342
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:23,639
I like to make flowers.

343
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,879
It's very therapeutic.

344
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,280
And I strive to get them as fine as I can
so that they look real.

345
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,920
- Look at these.
- Ooh!

346
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,840
I like foods that are pink.
Apart from taramasalata.

347
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,200
- How's it all going?
- Not too well.

348
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,080
I don't know if they'll set in time.

349
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Not bad.

350
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,640
I went to art school for this.

351
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,760
Slightly tight, to be quite honest.

352
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:53,280
Speed is of the essence.

353
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,375
How long have we got?

354
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:03,960
Bakers, you have... one minute left.

355
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,240
Hiding the worst ones at the bottom.

356
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,760
They look identical. Very happy.

357
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,120
It would've been nice
to finish more of them.

358
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:22,159
What a disaster.

359
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,560
- Want me to count them?
- Could you?

360
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:28,680
- You need one more.
- One, two, three, four, five.

361
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,800
It's 36, isn't it?

362
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:32,120
Thirty-five, thirty-six.
I've got 37. I'll eat one.

363
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,040
Bakers, your time is up.

364
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,879
Step away from your chocolate Florentines.

365
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,399
Get them on your plate quick.

366
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,200
- Mak.
- Sorry.

367
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,159
- Wow.
- Looks good, looks good.

368
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,840
Oh, mine didn't go well.

369
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:51,919
No?

370
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,720
They look good, though.

371
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:07,520
<i>The bakers' Florentines
will now be judged by Prue and Paul.</i>

372
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,879
- Hello, Dave.
- Hello.

373
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,560
It's like a Magic Eye poster.

374
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,760
'Cause of my jumper,
thought I was back on the rave scene.

375
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,120
You've done well with the feathering.
Three colours is quite difficult.

376
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,960
- Good snap.
- Massive snap.

377
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,560
You have the snap. Flavour's good.

378
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:33,560
You can taste the nuts and mango.
It all works.

379
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,159
Sesame seed, too, which I love.

380
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,399
I just think
you needed more texture in there.

381
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,320
Yeah.

382
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:40,879
I love the dark chocolate.
It's a nice biscuit.

383
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,440
- Thank you.
- Good.

384
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,320
Looks a little bit lumpy. Too lumpy.

385
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:55,639
Yes, I remember worrying a bit
about your very large nuts.

386
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Mainly because...

387
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,639
Right.

388
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,480
It snaps, though.

389
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,919
The white chocolate is quite dominant.

390
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,159
It needed something else.
Maybe a bit more fruit in there.

391
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,639
- Could be better.
- Okay.

392
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,919
Thank you.

393
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,720
- That's a pretty classic Florentine.
- Yeah.

394
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:25,000
Snaps quite well.

395
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,760
- I love that for flavours.
- Yes!

396
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,240
I think the issue is
you want something bitter.

397
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,040
If you'd kept it to dark chocolate,
you would've been on a winner.

398
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,919
But otherwise, that's a great Florentine.

399
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,216
- Thank you.
- Great, thank you.

400
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
- Well done.
- Thanks.

401
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,280
Have you practised these?

402
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,895
- Yes.
- Have you done them in the time?

403
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,399
- No.
- Right.

404
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,040
Do you remember what we said last week?

405
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,040
- Entirely.
- So my question is why did you do it?

406
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,640
- Course I have.
- Because I like them.

407
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,320
Anyway, it certainly does not snap.

408
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:59,720
- No.
- I love the flavours of it.

409
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,560
- It's not baked enough.
- The idea of the waistcoats, I love.

410
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:05,480
But, honestly, that modelling chocolate
ruins the biscuit.

411
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,320
- Okay.
- It's so sweet.

412
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,520
Great flavours. Again, simplify things
to get it done in time.

413
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,440
He's a dreamer. Don't stop dreaming.

414
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,440
But thank you anyway.

415
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,720
They look so sweet,
like little boats.

416
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,679
Looks amazing.

417
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:25,720
Mmm!

418
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,679
The crunch from the nuts is gorgeous.
You get a bit of saffron in there as well.

419
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,960
You've created a beautiful,
well-balanced Florentine.

420
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,040
It's lovely.
The only problem is we asked for a...

421
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,720
- Snap. Yeah.
- Snap.

422
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,240
- And what's the tea?
- Cardamom tea.

423
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,280
- That's delicious.
- Lovely.

424
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,480
- Can I take it with me?
- Thank you so much.

425
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:54,320
You've got the colour
of a sticky toffee pudding.

426
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:56,040
- Yeah.
- Smells like one, too.

427
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,600
Ooh, bit of a bend.

428
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,960
The flavour's delicious.
I've never had anything like it.

429
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
Particularly like that white chocolate.

430
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,840
I love that caramel flavour.

431
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,600
You're clever with your ideas.

432
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,679
You've come up with something
that's truly unique. Thank you.

433
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:17,120
That was touching, mate.
That smells delicious.

434
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,080
But as we all know,
eating's cheating, so...

435
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,560
They're a bit scruffy.

436
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:28,320
Time wasn't on my side.

437
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,399
You needed slightly longer in the oven.

438
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:37,960
There's something tough in there.
Is it the mango?

439
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,560
Probably, yes.

440
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:41,000
Hmm.

441
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,280
- It's like leather.
- Oh, God, this is agonising.

442
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,280
The mango needs to be soaked
'cause it's just too chewy.

443
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,240
- But love the flavour of it.
- Thank you.

444
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,439
It's very pretty
and neat as anything.

445
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,200
Unique. Unusual to use the ruby chocolate.

446
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,120
- Yeah.
- I do like the uniformity.

447
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,639
- Thank you.
- It isn't going to snap, though.

448
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,040
Yeah.

449
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,879
Ruby chocolate's quite tart
and blends well with ginger.

450
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,280
You've got a nice flavour.

451
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,720
I love the sour cherries. Very surprising,
very original and very delicious.

452
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,615
- Brilliant. I'll take that.
- Well done.

453
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:17,800
- Well done.
- Thank you.

454
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:29,919
I think you've lost in the appearance
what a Florentine is.

455
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,480
You should be able
to see much more texture.

456
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,840
You're not getting that,
it's flat as a pancake.

457
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,360
I bet it tastes nice.

458
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,760
And it has a snap.

459
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,560
Ginger tastes strong, which I like.

460
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:43,000
It's like having, erm, ginger brandy snap.

461
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,960
It's a delicious biscuit,
but it is not a Florentine.

462
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,760
- Okay.
- Thank you, Linda.

463
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,120
What's the decoration?

464
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,840
Supposed to be, er,
a sort of, of a peacock effect.

465
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,800
Peacock? Thought it was a tennis racquet
to celebrate Wimbledon.

466
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:02,960
Yes, it was.

467
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,320
They're gooey.

468
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:08,720
Could've stayed in there
another five minutes.

469
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,760
- You soaked your mango, didn't you?
- Yeah.

470
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,360
I imagine that contributed
to a sort of sogginess.

471
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:16,760
I like the flavours,
but it's not a Florentine.

472
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,920
Never mind. Thank you, Mak.

473
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

474
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,560
I have to say, I think they look good.

475
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:26,639
Thank you.

476
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,639
You've got a good tempered chocolate,
and I like the top, classic Florentine.

477
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,439
You've got a nice shine, it's busy,

478
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,600
and that's what a Florentine
should look like.

479
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,280
Bit of a snap.

480
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,800
It's chocolatey, it's nutty.
Love the sour cherry.

481
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:41,919
It's delicious.

482
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,639
The ginger and the cherry
with the dark chocolate is just fantastic.

483
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,919
And it does snap, it's nice and thin.

484
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,760
Can't find fault with them, really.

485
00:24:57,879 --> 00:25:00,080
- Well done.
- Thank you.

486
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:03,840
I'll take that one with me. Thank you.

487
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:10,120
What?

488
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,800
As if!

489
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:14,000
Completely mad.

490
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,800
Imagine, me?

491
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,000
Never gonna wash my hand again.

492
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,320
I like my fruit chunky,
but what can I say?

493
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:24,679
They're the experts.
If they're not right, they're not right.

494
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,199
I'm just disappointed.

495
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,560
That went well. I did get a snap.

496
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:30,760
That's what I was going for, the snap.

497
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,439
The concept was good,
but too ambitious.

498
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,399
I shall endeavour to take the advice.

499
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,760
It could've gone better.
I've just gotta stay calm.

500
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,120
Just put this morning behind me

501
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,879
and look forward to this afternoon.

502
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,679
<i>The bakers were able to
practise their signature bakes,</i>

503
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,560
<i>but have no idea
what technical mystery lies ahead.</i>

504
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Bakers, it's time
for your technical challenge,

505
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:03,320
which today has been set by Prue.

506
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:05,040
Prue, any words of advice?

507
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,280
This is a classic.

508
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,040
So read your recipe, no going off-piste.

509
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,600
Your technical challenge
will be judged blind,

510
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:15,320
so we're gonna have to ask
the judges to leave the tent.

511
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:16,399
Off you pop.

512
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,759
Let's say things about them
while they're gone.

513
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,120
Prue would like you to make
12 hand-shaped coconut macaroons.

514
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:29,399
Six of them must be drizzled
and filled with chocolate

515
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,120
and six of them must be piped
with a delicious mango curd.

516
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,800
Sounds quite involved.

517
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:37,800
If I were you, I'd just go out
and buy some, much easier.

518
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:39,199
- It doesn't work like that.
- Oh.

519
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,879
They must be crispy

520
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,000
and golden on the outside,
but chewy on the inside.

521
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,800
You've got an hour and 45 minutes.

522
00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:47,600
- On your marks.
- Get set.

523
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,520
Go to the shops.

524
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,800
- Or bake.
- Or bake.

525
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,120
Oh, Jesus.

526
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:56,080
Macaroons? I've got no idea, mate.

527
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,240
I don't think I've eaten one,
let alone made one.

528
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,639
This is gonna be interesting.

529
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,240
I'm familiar with macaroons

530
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,840
and I've made them once
a very long time ago, but not filled.

531
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,360
I've made these, er,
with my mum before, but donkeys ago.

532
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:11,360
Haven't had macaroons for years.

533
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:13,279
They're okay, but they
get stuck in your teeth.

534
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,800
Prue, macaroons as
a technical challenge, good choice.

535
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:19,199
- A favourite of mine.
- I know. I love them, too.

536
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,480
They look so simple
and if you read the recipe,

537
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,240
it's, "Oh, no problem with that."

538
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,120
But I think they're trickier
than they sound.

539
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:28,360
It's important to get the mixture right.

540
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,199
We've given them coconut flakes

541
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,600
which they need to put
in a processor, briefly.

542
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,000
If they overdo it, they won't get
this nice, rough edge,

543
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,960
they'll get a smooth paste
which will stick together

544
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,399
and won't be nearly so pleasant.

545
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,760
I think these look beautiful.

546
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,600
They're all the same size, regardless
whether they're mango or chocolate.

547
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:48,480
I think I'll try the mango first.

548
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:51,320
As soon as you bite into it,
there's coconut.

549
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:54,879
The mango is beautiful as well.
It's just the right consistency.

550
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,240
Smooth as anything,
but it's set. It's not running.

551
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,280
You have to pipe a wall around the edge.

552
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,560
If you don't get high enough walls,
you don't get enough mango curd.

553
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:06,159
Moving on to the chocolate.

554
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,320
- Very neat lines on the top.
- Hmm.

555
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,919
And a good decent lump

556
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,560
- of chocolate in there.
- Mmm.

557
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:13,600
It's gorgeous blended with the coconut.

558
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,000
We've squeezed them a bit on time to get
this done. It is a challenge.

559
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,439
The most important thing
is timing in the oven,

560
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,760
because they need to be just golden brown,

561
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,639
crunchy on the outside, slightly chewy
and sticky in the middle.

562
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,040
The test is the colour.
Take it out when it looks like that.

563
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,360
There's nothing better.

564
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:35,120
It takes me back to when I was a kid.

565
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,959
Perfect with a great cup of tea.

566
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:41,199
First instruction, make the mango curd.

567
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:43,800
It's a little mean.

568
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,120
Trying to refresh my memory
of how to make a curd.

569
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,639
So you've got mango puree
in there, caster sugar,

570
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,840
you've got one egg and two yolks,

571
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,360
bit of lime juice
and a bit of unsalted butter.

572
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:58,480
And then very carefully cook it
over gentle heat.

573
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,639
What I don't want is scrambled egg.

574
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,159
Mango-flavoured scrambled egg.

575
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,159
Curd can take
a little while to thicken up.

576
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:07,560
Smells nice.

577
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,399
Have you made macaroons before?

578
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,600
No, I've made macarons before,
but not macaroons.

579
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:14,175
- They're a different food.
- Yes.

580
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,919
They've added an extra letter
and called it "macaroons".

581
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,919
They have.

582
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,600
Next year, people will have
to make macarooons

583
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:23,399
'cause they'll add another letter to it.

584
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,240
My curd is starting to thicken.

585
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,720
It should be quite drippy,
but quite thick.

586
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,840
It's important that
I do well in this challenge,

587
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:34,000
so that's why I'm
gonna be... extra careful.

588
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,120
I think that looks okay.

589
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:37,080
Let's add the butter.

590
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:40,280
If you add the cold butter
and then just keep whisking it in,

591
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,199
it should go really nice
and silky and smooth... I think.

592
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,399
Either that or I'm talking out my arse.

593
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,720
It's thickening nicely now.
That doesn't look too bad.

594
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,159
Mango curd has to chill. Keep it chill.

595
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,480
I'm trying to cool it quickly
by putting it in the freezer.

596
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,240
My mango curd is in the fridge.

597
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,639
"Using the round cutter as a guide,

598
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,439
draw 12 circles on the rice paper
and then cut out the circles."

599
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,840
Is this rice paper?

600
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:09,800
- Rice paper does look delicious.
- I never tried that.

601
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:12,240
You can... Yes, it's edibubble.

602
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,760
So far, so good.
I'm good at drawing circles.

603
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,679
I'm just waiting for my curd
to thicken a bit more.

604
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,959
Still a bit runny,

605
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,959
and so I really need to crack on
with everything else.

606
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,399
Glasses on.

607
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,639
Mean business.

608
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,320
Why is that? Hand shake?

609
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,760
Come on, spill the dirt.

610
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,080
- How did it feel when Hollywood...
- I...

611
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,320
...his big, sausage-y fingers
gripped your pale...

612
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,560
- Yeah. Thanks, yeah.
- ...ET-like fingers?

613
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:37,520
How did it feel?

614
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,679
- I felt nothing.
- Angry?

615
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,560
- I just felt shocked...
- You felt nothing?

616
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:42,199
- And like...
- Cold, dead inside.

617
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,199
No, I'm not dead inside, I just went numb.

618
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,360
I didn't know what was happening.

619
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:49,600
That's it, that's the pivotal moment
in your baking career.

620
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,879
Yeah, that's it. I've peaked for sure.

621
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:56,480
"For the macaroons, tip the shredded
coconut into the food processor

622
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,800
and blitz until the flakes
are small enough to pipe."

623
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,560
It's been very clear in the recipe
to not over-blitz the coconut,

624
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:05,000
so trying to listen to that.

625
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,320
I think that'll do.

626
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,080
It's hard not to lose your nerve
when you look around

627
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,840
and everyone else is miles ahead.

628
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:18,199
But I was really worried
about leaving this curd for too long.

629
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,159
I'm gonna go with that.

630
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,199
"Add the almond extract, rice flour,
condensed milk and pulse."

631
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,480
This is condensed milk, nice and sticky.
I love this.

632
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,360
- Could you drink that?
- I have.

633
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:30,399
- You've drunk condensed milk?
- I have.

634
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,639
- Really?
- I love it.

635
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,120
I leave you in disgust.

636
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,959
"Carefully fold whisked egg whites
into the coconut mixture."

637
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,199
It's just gonna help raise
and keep them light.

638
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,600
So, I guess it'll be kind of
like a meringue-y, chewy texture.

639
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,159
Now, I think that is done.

640
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,719
Bakers, you are halfway through.

641
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
So basically, you have
52 and a half minutes left.

642
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,240
I'm running behind.

643
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,560
So at the minute, I'm adding the coconut.

644
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:01,199
I think there was time in the recipe
to make the curd properly,

645
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,760
so I hope that I haven't just wasted that.

646
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:11,240
"Spoon half of the mixture into a piping
bag fitted with a large star nozzle."

647
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:15,959
The mixture looks yummy.
I kinda want to just eat the batter as is.

648
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,439
Mmm, I'd quite like
a bit of rum in there, I think.

649
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,679
Overall, mmm, nice.

650
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,240
"Pipe a ring of coconut
around the edge of the rice paper."

651
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,199
"Pipe a small amount
of mixture into the hole."

652
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,360
So, you're making a little dish,
really, for the curd.

653
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:32,560
I'm worried about how deep the hole
has to be in order to fit a filling in.

654
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:35,080
It's quite pipeable,
so it's holding its shape.

655
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,919
Come on, Laura, you know how to pipe.
I feel like mine's too thick.

656
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,520
I wonder whether
I haven't made it fine enough.

657
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,879
"For the remaining six macaroons,

658
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:50,959
place a spoonful of coconut mixture
on the remaining discs and flatten."

659
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,879
"Place a square of chocolate
into the centre of each coconut circle."

660
00:32:55,959 --> 00:33:00,560
Then I'm going to place
a spoon of the mixture over the top

661
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:01,760
and create a dome.

662
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,439
If you don't get
the chocolate covered up,

663
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,080
it's gonna start
running out of it as it's cooking.

664
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:10,560
I'm just trying to make sure
that it's all covered in now.

665
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,360
I'm just trying to get them
as even as I possibly can.

666
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:15,480
Save some time now.

667
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,080
On the recipe, it tells us to "bake".

668
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:21,879
Er... so, useful.

669
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,480
Gonna pop those in the oven now.

670
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,840
I genuinely have
no idea on timing.

671
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:28,520
It's on 130.

672
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,080
Gonna start with ten minutes.

673
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,159
Starting with ten minutes,
then I'll check them, see how they go.

674
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,760
With how much time's left,

675
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,120
it's an indication that it's probably
a longer bake than what everyone reckons.

676
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:40,760
I reckon 25 minutes in the end.

677
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,560
They're in. Thirty minutes.

678
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:44,600
It's a low and slow cook.

679
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,760
I do feel a little up against it.

680
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,520
They'll probably take 20 minutes to bake,
so it doesn't give me a lot of time.

681
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,800
My curd better be good.

682
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,159
Bakers,
you've got half an hour left.

683
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
Don't wanna wake Matt up.

684
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,800
Half an hour.

685
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:05,280
Come on.

686
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,159
It's taking so long.

687
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,520
They're not even toasty.

688
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,639
They did say that they wanted
a nice golden top.

689
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,799
Mine aren't golden.

690
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:16,000
I don't know, man.
What is golden, know what I mean?

691
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,960
Golden can mean anything, really.

692
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,400
I just don't know.

693
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,199
These are not gonna get
golden brown, I don't think.

694
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,120
Lordy, lordy, lordy.

695
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,600
It's really intense.

696
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,000
- I find it strangely relaxing.
- Do you?

697
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,600
Watching everyone else stress?

698
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,799
Seeing their dreams slide away.

699
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,120
Oh, God.

700
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,719
I don't have any patience.

701
00:34:40,799 --> 00:34:42,679
Certainly not looking golden,

702
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:45,159
but I think it'll take
a really long time to get golden.

703
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,319
What do you reckon?

704
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,639
Least another five minutes, I think.

705
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,159
They're taking ages.

706
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,336
They are, aren't they?

707
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,560
- A lot longer than I expected.
- Mmm.

708
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,239
I think I shouldn't have come down here.

709
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:56,839
I don't know if I can get back up.

710
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,720
That's what I think.

711
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,240
Oh, my Lord!

712
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:02,200
I'm all right.

713
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:04,319
Might go in with those. Let's have a look.

714
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
I think maybe one minute longer.

715
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,480
These are looking rustic,
but not too bad.

716
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,000
I've gotta get them cool.

717
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,520
I might pull mine, you know.

718
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,040
I'm gonna get them out now.

719
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,480
They're nice and golden.

720
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,160
Think I'm happy.

721
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,120
Don't know what
they should look like,

722
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,000
but I think they look all right.

723
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,440
Ooh, they look good.

724
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,240
Now, these ones are
quite a lot larger than those ones.

725
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:30,160
- Yes.
- Is that intentional?

726
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,680
Well... no.

727
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:35,080
Right. You should've said yes.
Oh, we'll do it again.

728
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,680
So these ones are a bit larger
than those ones. Is that intentional?

729
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:40,856
- Yes, they've got chocolate inside.
- That's... Right.

730
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,400
That's a good... approach.

731
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:48,560
I think the colour's looking good,
but I just don't think they're ready yet.

732
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,319
I think I'm at 28 minutes now.
I reckon a couple more minutes.

733
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,600
Just need
five more minutes, I'll be done.

734
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,080
Maybe they are ready.

735
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:58,400
How long have we got?

736
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,759
Bakers, you have five minutes

737
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,960
until we tell you that
you have ten minutes!

738
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,080
Matt.

739
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
You have 15 minutes.

740
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,200
That was mean.

741
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:09,120
I'm bad.

742
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,920
Gonna give them a bit longer.

743
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,496
What am I
supposed to put in this?

744
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,456
"Spoon a small amount of set curd
into each ring."

745
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,120
Okay, set curd.

746
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,000
That's the consistency
I would have

747
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,120
if I was making a lemon curd.

748
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,920
They're finally coming out.

749
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
Ow, ow, ow.

750
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,279
Dave's look rather sophisticated.

751
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,360
I like them.

752
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,240
Does look as if the cat's had an accident.

753
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:33,960
"To decorate the chocolate macaroons,

754
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,240
pipe fine lines across them
with melted chocolate."

755
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,440
That's what I'm going for, nice and neat.

756
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:42,799
That's more like it.
Bit more freestyle.

757
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,839
Putting the mango curd in the middle.

758
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,200
Ideally, I'd want them to be cool,
'cause I'm conscious I'm quite behind.

759
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:52,960
Bakers, it's basically too late now,
you've got one minute left.

760
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
Chocolate season.

761
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,536
- It's seized on me.
- Have mine.

762
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,359
Cheers, you've totally saved me.

763
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,799
There's not enough space
for all six.

764
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,920
Bakers, your time is up.

765
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,920
I think they're beautiful.

766
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,520
You can see the influence
of fine French patisserie.

767
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,960
Please bring your trays
forward to the front

768
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,120
and put them behind your photograph.

769
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,799
Sura, hang back a little bit.

770
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,520
I'm joking.

771
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:28,400
<i>Prue and Paul are looking
for 12 uniform coconut macaroons,</i>

772
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,759
<i>six filled with mango curd
and six filled with chocolate,</i>

773
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,520
<i>crispy on the outside
and chewy in the middle.</i>

774
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,799
So, let's have a look at the first one.

775
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,680
- I like them to be the same sizes.
- Yeah.

776
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,960
They look very similar.

777
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,000
They could've done
with a little bit longer.

778
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,560
It's delicious, but not quite
crisp enough on the outside

779
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,920
- and a bit too squashy.
- Hmm.

780
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,560
Let's have a check of that mango.

781
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:55,160
It's not bad.

782
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,560
Like to see more of a ridge
there to create a...

783
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,839
- A well.
- A pond in the middle, yeah.

784
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,400
Let's move on to the second one.

785
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,440
The chocolate ones look a bit untidy.

786
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,656
They're different sizes.

787
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,440
- That one's much smaller than that one.
- Yeah.

788
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,400
- Needed a bit longer those, actually.
- Hmm.

789
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,839
I like this decoration, the lines.

790
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,640
They're very different sizes.
These ones are tiny and these are big.

791
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:22,839
But does taste very good.

792
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,400
Slightly underbaked.

793
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,920
The piping's a little peculiar.

794
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,799
It is.

795
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,640
That one's a sort of squirt.

796
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,880
Mmm.

797
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,839
It's too soft.

798
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,960
The coconut that's underneath the mango
is almost like it went into the oven.

799
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,480
Yeah, but moving on.

800
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,960
I like this one 'cause you've got

801
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,600
- a nice caramelisation...
- Yeah.

802
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,600
...from the coconut. There you go.

803
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,839
Delicious.

804
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,120
Crispy on the outside, soft in the middle.
Mango's tasty as well.

805
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,216
- Moving on.
- Right.

806
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,680
I like these as well.

807
00:38:52,759 --> 00:38:54,880
They're uniform,
they're all the same size.

808
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,240
Nice browning effect.

809
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:58,359
- Decent amount of curd.
- Yeah.

810
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,200
- Good flavour.
- Curd's nice, too.

811
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:01,560
It's a little liquid.

812
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:04,000
And moving on.

813
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,120
They're equal, bit small,
a bit undercooked as well.

814
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,920
Definitely underbaked.

815
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,720
Lovely mango,
just needed longer in the oven.

816
00:39:12,799 --> 00:39:15,359
These are very neat.
I love these lines like that.

817
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,080
It's well baked as well.

818
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:20,680
That's got lovely flavour.

819
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:23,720
The curd is perfect,
it cuts, it doesn't just flow.

820
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:24,799
It's a good one.

821
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,799
This again, quite a decent one.

822
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,359
However, they over-blitzed the mixture.

823
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,560
Quite smooth.

824
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,520
- And it's good.
- Hmm.

825
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,279
And this one's well baked.

826
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,120
Could do more of a wall.

827
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,319
It's a bit hard.

828
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,120
- And they're quite chewy.
- Yeah.

829
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,080
Last one, neat, tidy, but underbaked.

830
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,640
But it's the colour,
you can see how pale that is.

831
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,600
It's going to be really squashy.

832
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,040
- Shame, 'cause that's neat.
- Hmm.

833
00:39:58,759 --> 00:40:02,960
<i>Prue and Paul will now rank
the coconut macaroons from worst to best.</i>

834
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,520
In eleventh place is this one.

835
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,120
Rowan. Bit underbaked,

836
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,720
not very good piping, a little uneven.

837
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:15,759
And in tenth position,
we have this one. Whose is this?

838
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,359
Down to colour only, Peter.

839
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,520
In ninth place is this one.

840
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,279
This is a really common problem
of not baking it quite long enough.

841
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,600
In eighth, we have this one.
Whose is this?

842
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,319
They were very small and
needed a little bit longer in the oven.

843
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,880
<i>Laura is seventh.</i>

844
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,839
<i>Sura, sixth.</i>

845
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,080
<i>Hermine, fifth, and Linda's fourth.</i>

846
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,640
And in third place is this one.
Who's that?

847
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,480
- Mak, these were absolutely excellent.
- Thank you.

848
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,799
In second, we have this one.

849
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:51,160
Loads of texture,
nice chocolate on the top.

850
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,240
Spot on.

851
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,839
Which leaves...

852
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,759
this one. Dave.

853
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,960
Really excellent macaroons.

854
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,000
Curd nice, even perfect.

855
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,080
Thank you.

856
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,759
Came first in technical.
What an improvement from ninth last week.

857
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:13,400
Makes me feel
more confident going into tomorrow.

858
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,000
Spring in the step for the morning.

859
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,279
It's a bit of a fall from grace
after this morning.

860
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,799
And now I'm just terrified for tomorrow.

861
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
I can't believe
what just happened, second.

862
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,680
I was chaotic,
I was running behind everyone else.

863
00:41:25,759 --> 00:41:26,839
So, I'm delighted.

864
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,200
It wasn't my best moment.

865
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,359
They did slightly look
like the cat's lavatory.

866
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,160
I'm feeling much better after that.

867
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,720
I think I've clawed
a bit back from this morning.

868
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:38,680
Er, so, it just
gives me hope for tomorrow.

869
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:47,319
<i>There's just
the showstopper challenge left</i>

870
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,520
<i>before Prue and Paul
decide who'll be leaving the tent</i>

871
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,160
<i>and who's destined for Star Baker.</i>

872
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,359
Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your showstopper challenge.

873
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,200
Today, the judges would like you
to make a 3D biscuit table setting

874
00:42:06,279 --> 00:42:08,600
from a memorable meal you once had.

875
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,920
They want you to sculpt your biscuit dough

876
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,799
to make highly decorative
and realistic looking biscuits

877
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,520
that deceive the eye

878
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:20,120
into thinking they're teapots
or cups or knives, etc. You get my drift.

879
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,799
You can use any type
of biscuits, any flavours,

880
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,600
but remember this is a showstopper,

881
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,120
so it can't just look good,
it has to taste fantastic.

882
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,880
You have 100,000 hours.

883
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,160
- Four.
- 400,000 hours.

884
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,016
- Just four hours.
- Just four, you'll never make it.

885
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,200
- On your marks... Bake!
- Get set...

886
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,920
I'm feeling really good.
Gotta keep my cool. I'm pumping.

887
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,799
Yeah, I'm feeling relaxed.
I'm just gonna enjoy it.

888
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,440
I have so much to do,
and I am absolutely... bricking it.

889
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,920
It's the showstopper, we're asking
the bakers to complete a dinner set,

890
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,640
but it must be moulded.

891
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,920
Rather than having straight biscuits,

892
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,440
I'd like to see something that
shows they're utilising their biscuit

893
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,319
to shape 'round something,
to mould, to sculpt.

894
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,000
We want the bakers
to use their dough as clay

895
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,319
to get this balance between
beautiful objects and delicious biscuits.

896
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,960
The big issue the bakers are gonna have

897
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,279
is almost the volume
of biscuit needed to create the set.

898
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,720
It's bulk, batch-baking.

899
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:22,200
It's not going to be easy.

900
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:26,880
- Rowan, how you doing?
- Hello. So far, so good.

901
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,920
- Right, table setting, what are you doing?
- Table setting.

902
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,240
I am doing a 90th birthday
breakfast tray for my great aunt.

903
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:39,120
So, the chocolate pot
is in the form of a lighthouse.

904
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,160
- Right.
- Hopefully with a flashing light.

905
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,040
And then there are a couple of shell...

906
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,319
...er, little plates.

907
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,359
<i>Rowan's aiming high again,</i>

908
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,240
<i>with a maritime masterpiece he's hoping
will keep him clear of disaster.</i>

909
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:53,759
<i>His lemon biscuit
lighthouse hot chocolate pot</i>

910
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,480
<i>will be adorned with
Viennese biscuit sea creatures.</i>

911
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,440
- You've practised this?
- I have.

912
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,815
- You've done it in the time?
- No.

913
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:00,839
Brilliant.

914
00:44:01,759 --> 00:44:04,440
You <i>will</i> finish
this challenge, okay, in four hours.

915
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,120
I wanna see what you can do.

916
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,000
- That's what's frustrating.
- I know.

917
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,640
- Do you understand?
- I know. I'll do my very best.

918
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,600
I'm just adding my spices.

919
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,720
I'm gonna put an extra
little bit in for good luck.

920
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:18,560
<i>To create a showstopper
that will wow the judges...</i>

921
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,680
This is extra brute cocoa powder.

922
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:22,560
Gives it a richer chocolate taste.

923
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,480
<i>...not only must
their biscuits be packed with flavour...</i>

924
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,560
There's 20 tablespoons of coffee.
Keep me going till lunchtime.

925
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,520
<i>...it's vital they're
strong enough to hold their shape.</i>

926
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,839
Whenever someone says a moulded biscuit
or a structure with biscuit,

927
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,560
everyone jumps to gingerbread,

928
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,120
so it's gonna be tough to stand out today.

929
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,960
<i>Peter's aiming
to grab the judges' attention</i>

930
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,520
<i>with a gingerbread haggis,</i>

931
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,319
<i>filled with Scottish raspberry
and oat cranachan cream.</i>

932
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,000
It is Scotland on a plate.
Scotland <i>as</i> a plate.

933
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,080
<i>Mark's taken
his inspiration from much further afield.</i>

934
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,160
My table setting
is an Ethiopian coffee ceremony.

935
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,520
I love it. Erm,
every time I'm in Ethiopia,

936
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,720
I have quite a lot of coffee.
I love coffee, yeah. Yeah.

937
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:05,000
<i>Decorated with
striking geometric icing,</i>

938
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,799
<i>Mark's ceremonial coffee set will be
made of a cinnamon and coffee dough,</i>

939
00:45:08,879 --> 00:45:10,879
<i>darkened with edible charcoal powder.</i>

940
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,720
This is where it gets messy.

941
00:45:13,799 --> 00:45:15,400
This recipe suits me quite well

942
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,040
because I'm a messy baker, so it feels
nice to get stuck into something.

943
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,960
<i>But he's not the only baker
opting for a dark dough.</i>

944
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,000
I am making a Viking table setting.

945
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,600
Vikings are just so cool,
they're just so badass.

946
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:33,359
<i>Lottie's creating a charcoal and
gingerbread dining set fit for Valhalla,</i>

947
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,440
<i>the great hall in Norse mythology,</i>

948
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,759
<i>where heroes slain in battle
are welcomed into the afterlife.</i>

949
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:41,560
- Are you a Viking? Are you from...
- Secretly.

950
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,680
- No. I'm really not.
- No?

951
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,879
I'm 98% British.

952
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,815
It's upsetting and boring.

953
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,120
If you mess this up, you won't
get into Valhalla, you know that?

954
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,160
And that's what worries me the most.

955
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,320
Let's see if we can open
the gates of Valhalla later.

956
00:45:54,279 --> 00:45:55,640
The shaping is important.

957
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,279
It needs to look realistic,
not like a five-year-old's done it, which,

958
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,640
I'm not gonna lie,
is a challenge.

959
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,839
<i>Sculpting biscuit dough will
not only test the bakers' creativity...</i>

960
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,000
This is what
stresses me out the most.

961
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,600
<i>...but will push
their technical know-how to the limit.</i>

962
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,240
These are gonna stay in its mould,

963
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,960
and when it's baked,
it should release straight away.

964
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,720
<i>Not only is it tricky to shape,
but can easily become tough if overworked.</i>

965
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:21,640
This is the lighthouse,

966
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,440
so I have found, if you foil it first,
it'll hopefully hold it all together.

967
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,560
This goes beyond baking knowledge

968
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,000
and takes you into
the realms of how to be a potter.

969
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,759
<i>While most bakers
are shaping then baking,</i>

970
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:37,279
<i>Mak is taking a unique approach.</i>

971
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,160
I'm not gonna be using moulds.

972
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,839
So, that's interesting.
So, instead of moulding your biscuit,

973
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,240
you are making all the pieces flat.

974
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:47,879
- So they'll be like hexagonal.
- Well, square-shaped.

975
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,879
<i>Mak's using flat pack</i>

976
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,879
<i>to create an art-deco style chai tea set</i>

977
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,160
<i>with oblong teapot and cuboid cups.</i>

978
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,600
How've you got on in practice?

979
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,120
To be quite honest
with you, I have struggled.

980
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,720
That's why I've actually
pared it down somewhat in the final bake.

981
00:47:03,799 --> 00:47:06,040
It's better to do something
which you can achieve.

982
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,200
That's right, yes.

983
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:11,799
<i>In contrast, Dave's aiming
to conjure up some magical curves.</i>

984
00:47:11,879 --> 00:47:13,160
An Aladdin's saucer.

985
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,560
So, they're gonna
look very similar to that.

986
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,920
If I rub them, I'd wish for Star Baker.

987
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,799
<i>Taking his inspiration
from a trip to Mexico,</i>

988
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:25,200
<i>Dave's coffee jugs will be part of a
chocolate and coffee flavour table setting</i>

989
00:47:25,279 --> 00:47:27,600
<i>decorated with the colours
of the Mexican flag.</i>

990
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,000
Gotta have the flavour,

991
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,720
but high detail, I think,
what they're after as well,

992
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:33,680
so if I keep my cool, should be good.

993
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,839
Are actually going in.

994
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,879
<i>Getting the larger pieces into
the oven as quickly as possible is vital...</i>

995
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,480
One down, two to go.

996
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,560
<i>...to give the
bakers time to prepare</i>

997
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,879
<i>the multitude of smaller biscuit bakes.</i>

998
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,680
This is the brandy snap.
Looks super healthy, doesn't it?

999
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:53,920
I've got this embossing mat. It gives
a lovely lacy detail to the biscuit.

1000
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,160
Just lift it up
and gently place it in the middle.

1001
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,799
Try to keep it as neat as you can.

1002
00:47:58,879 --> 00:48:00,440
This is the amoretti biscuit.

1003
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,040
Want it to look like
a woven sort of placemat.

1004
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,920
These are delicious biscuits.
They've got cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger,

1005
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,960
and black pepper, so they are amazing.

1006
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,120
<i>Sura's Ramadan tea set will be
made from a Dutch-style speculaas biscuit,</i>

1007
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,560
<i>each piece elaborately
decorated with intricate patterns.</i>

1008
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,600
During Ramadan,
we always have people over.

1009
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,839
You break your fast,
after that you sit down for tea,

1010
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,680
and that's what it's based around,
that social vibe.

1011
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,279
<i>However, favouring a more
solitary dining experience is Marc.</i>

1012
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,400
This is the mug,
knife and spoon, and plate.

1013
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,640
Just a basic breakfast tea set for one.

1014
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,600
<i>Marc will use
his experience as a sculptor</i>

1015
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,240
<i>to fashion his spiced ginger biscuit set,</i>

1016
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:45,080
<i>complete with toast rack and toast.</i>

1017
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,319
I've worked with woods
and metals for most of my life.

1018
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,759
It's different making
something out of biscuit.

1019
00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:54,160
- Right. Press on.
- They're ready to come out.

1020
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,056
They look good.
Gotta keep my eye on stuff,

1021
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,616
lots of different things going on at once.

1022
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,920
This is my haggis biscuit.

1023
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,319
It's still a bit bumpy,
but it is a sheep's stomach after all.

1024
00:49:03,879 --> 00:49:06,000
How does it look?
Rustic. Rustic's all right.

1025
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,680
Before it cools down,
I need to make my shapes.

1026
00:49:08,759 --> 00:49:10,319
They're looking okay.

1027
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,480
As long as it keeps going okay,
I'll be all right.

1028
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,440
I'm happy with it.
I'll be decorating it in colourful icing.

1029
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,160
Colourful icing? That was vague.

1030
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,120
- Yeah.
- Which is good.

1031
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,560
If you don't get it all done, you say,
"I was only supposed to do one blob there,

1032
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,279
a nipple there and a nipple there."

1033
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,616
- Exactly.
- They are like breasts.

1034
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,560
They are. There's no denying that.

1035
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,160
Just gonna get the next things in now.

1036
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,520
<i>To create all the elements
for their complex biscuit constructions...</i>

1037
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,759
Right. Going in.

1038
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:35,600
<i>...the bakers
must manage numerous batches...</i>

1039
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,120
That's the trencher
that my haggis will sit on.

1040
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,319
<i>...if they're to stand
any chance of finishing on time.</i>

1041
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,496
They've come out nice.

1042
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,640
You've gotta be so careful
because they split very, very easily.

1043
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,720
It's very, very delicate biscuit.

1044
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,120
<i>Inspired by
a high tea she had in Amsterdam,</i>

1045
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,400
<i>Linda's one of the few bakers
swerving sturdy gingerbread,</i>

1046
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,640
<i>gambling instead
on a delicate rosewater shortbread.</i>

1047
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,759
Everything you make is going to be
out of this very fragile short biscuit.

1048
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:03,976
- Okay.
- That's brave.

1049
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,960
It is very brave.

1050
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,759
- You've gotta be brave. Go for it.
- Absolutely.

1051
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,640
Oh, God, I've got to unmould this.

1052
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,359
I just need to
ease it into the plate.

1053
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,279
I don't wanna be giving them
a flat disc.

1054
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,399
<i>The bakers
now face the critical task</i>

1055
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,120
<i>of separating
the delicate biscuit from the mould.</i>

1056
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,200
If this does break, I can
stick it back together badly with caramel,

1057
00:50:26,279 --> 00:50:28,040
but I don't have time
to faff about with it.

1058
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,799
<i>They only get one chance.</i>

1059
00:50:29,879 --> 00:50:31,680
I just wanna get this out.

1060
00:50:31,759 --> 00:50:33,319
<i>If the biscuits shatter,</i>

1061
00:50:33,399 --> 00:50:35,399
<i>so will their showstopper dreams.</i>

1062
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,080
Collateral damage.
That's why I made extras.

1063
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,600
I might cry if this breaks.

1064
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,200
Oh, for goodness sake!

1065
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,720
No!

1066
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,960
Broken there slightly.

1067
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,640
This is very delicate.

1068
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,359
Hardly dare breathe.

1069
00:50:54,799 --> 00:50:55,960
Oh!

1070
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,240
I may have just
overbaked it by a minute or so.

1071
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,440
No way this is happening.

1072
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,480
Bakers, you have 200,000 hours left.

1073
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,200
- Time is ticking.
- Two hours, you're halfway through.

1074
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:14,080
200,000 hours.

1075
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,879
Can't believe it's been two hours already.

1076
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,960
I'm gonna let that cool.
It has a bit of a shape to it.

1077
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,120
Oh.

1078
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,960
- Let's get this tuile out.
- That looks done.

1079
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,319
I want to put it somewhere safe,
now it's made.

1080
00:51:26,399 --> 00:51:28,279
That's my amoretti placemat.

1081
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:30,759
As it cools,
that'll go really nice and crunchy.

1082
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:33,359
These are done. Perfection.

1083
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,815
See how they've cracked at the top?

1084
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:35,839
Happy with that.

1085
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,880
Almost good enough to eat.

1086
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,480
My last one going in.

1087
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,839
I had hoped to be
finished all my baking by now,

1088
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,375
but I've still got some things to finish.

1089
00:51:44,399 --> 00:51:48,200
I'm terrified because I've
completely lost track of what I'm doing.

1090
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:50,399
All I know is I've got half a boat there.

1091
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,520
Yeah, I've got so much to do.

1092
00:51:53,399 --> 00:51:55,000
I'm in a good place.

1093
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,720
I'm making a three-tier cake stand,

1094
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:00,000
and I'm trying
to replicate an afternoon tea

1095
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,960
that I had for my
lovely nan's 80th birthday.

1096
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,879
<i>Keen to do justice
to the family celebration,</i>

1097
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,399
<i>Laura's gingerbread and brandy snap bake</i>

1098
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,040
<i>comes with an extra sprinkle
of commitment.</i>

1099
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,759
I've probably practised 15 times
in total.

1100
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,759
I've changed the recipe,
I've changed the design.

1101
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:18,520
I just hope it tastes nice.

1102
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,440
<i>But Laura's got stiff competition
when it comes to tea time.</i>

1103
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,000
Sugar lace, I'm gonna use
for my tea canister.

1104
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,960
It's a showstopper
so one needs to be ambitious.

1105
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,160
<i>Hermine's creating
a Japanese style tea set</i>

1106
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,600
<i>also in gingerbread,</i>

1107
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,480
<i>adorned with hand-painted flowers
and cherry blossom.</i>

1108
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,680
Hermine said earlier
she enjoys my, er, comedy shows.

1109
00:52:39,759 --> 00:52:42,480
Do you enjoy Noel's comedy shows
or are you not sure who he is?

1110
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,399
- I didn't know Noel did comedy.
- Oh.

1111
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,160
Well, I'm being honest.

1112
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,359
Noel is one of Britain's
most popular children's entertainers.

1113
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,480
- This is my last bit.
- That's my baking done.

1114
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,000
Turning the oven off,
that feels really great.

1115
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,560
<i>As their biscuits cool,</i>

1116
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,160
<i>the bakers can turn their attention
to decorations.</i>

1117
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,319
I'm prepping the egg glaze.
It'll give that terra-cotta look.

1118
00:53:08,399 --> 00:53:10,680
I've made my own fondant
out of marshmallows.

1119
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,440
I think that is spot-on.

1120
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,440
In here I've got some oatmeal,
whipped cream, raspberries, honey, whisky,

1121
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,960
and that's gonna be
my cranachan cream filling.

1122
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,879
I'm making really soft-set jam.
I want it to look like blood.

1123
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,920
- Bit dark.
- How long have we got left?

1124
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,536
- Bakers.
- Bakers, bakers...

1125
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,560
- You.
- You, you...

1126
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,879
- Have. One.
- Have, have... One, one...

1127
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,080
- Hour.
- Hour, hour...

1128
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,200
Left, left, left...

1129
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:36,640
Echoey in here, isn't it?

1130
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,000
That's my teapot.

1131
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,120
If somebody can just hold it
all the way through...

1132
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,696
This is what's
gonna glue everything together.

1133
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,279
The bakers this year
are very talented.

1134
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:48,319
I think it's quite a tricky challenge.

1135
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:50,440
It is. What I like is the theme.

1136
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,600
We've got a Ramadan tea
and we've got a Valhalla, Viking.

1137
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,080
If it sticks, great.

1138
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,600
- Ethiopia.
- Ethiopian one.

1139
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,656
I hope they don't say
they can't taste the coffee.

1140
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,000
Viennese lighthouse.

1141
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,120
Slightly ragged
but I'll trim it afterwards.

1142
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,759
They are very imaginative. It's nice.

1143
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:09,879
I made a spoon.

1144
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,240
No spoons today.

1145
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,600
A lot rides on this for a few people.
I'd like to see them all finish on time.

1146
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,240
I'm currently running
six minutes over.

1147
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,759
Yeah, this is tight.
Like, every minute counts.

1148
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:25,879
I'm hoping
I haven't given myself too much to do.

1149
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,680
Go as fast as I can without panicking.

1150
00:54:28,759 --> 00:54:31,200
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

1151
00:54:31,759 --> 00:54:33,120
This is gonna be a tight finish.

1152
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,560
Just wanna curl up in a ball
and die quietly.

1153
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,600
I've got to decorate everything.

1154
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,279
It's not really on right.

1155
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,760
It's about getting the angle right.

1156
00:54:43,799 --> 00:54:46,120
Caramel,
it's difficult to work with.

1157
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,560
It sticks really quick and
if you've not got it right, it ruins it.

1158
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,799
Argh, look at this.
I need to wash my hands.

1159
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:58,080
Do you know what, it's not perfect,
but at this stage it's the best I can do.

1160
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,759
I'm just airbrushing
a bit of silver on them

1161
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,759
to try and build colour bit by bit.

1162
00:55:02,839 --> 00:55:06,759
The colour's the most important bit,
'cause Mexico is vibrant and colourful.

1163
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:09,319
Putting some royal icing on my cups.

1164
00:55:09,399 --> 00:55:11,879
Green is the colour
of the tea set I was given.

1165
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,279
This is royal icing.
It dries very quickly.

1166
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,920
This is meant to be rough.

1167
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,040
I'm not happy with this.
I've gone for a terra-cotta,

1168
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,920
but it's looking like a pinky-orange.

1169
00:55:22,399 --> 00:55:24,680
Oh, this is my favourite part.

1170
00:55:24,759 --> 00:55:26,560
This could be your challenge.

1171
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,920
I hope so. Depends what it tastes like,
Noel, doesn't it?

1172
00:55:30,759 --> 00:55:32,560
And breathe.

1173
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,160
Let's just decorate.

1174
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,799
Rushing, hate this.

1175
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:38,520
Can't stop my hand from shaking.

1176
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,680
No, I'm not working to a design.

1177
00:55:40,759 --> 00:55:42,640
I don't know what I'm doing,
if I'm honest.

1178
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,879
Hopefully I can put
a bit of fondant rim on it once it dries.

1179
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,000
I'm doing a semi-flood on this biscuit.

1180
00:55:50,399 --> 00:55:51,799
Oh, it's cracked.

1181
00:55:51,879 --> 00:55:53,200
It's been in a storm, this pot.

1182
00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:55,200
It's getting more and more rustic.

1183
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,600
Good. Let's try and work quicker.

1184
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,120
Just got the red dots to add.
Attention to detail.

1185
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,799
I enjoy the finishing touch,

1186
00:56:03,879 --> 00:56:04,879
make it look pretty.

1187
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,560
I've literally had to say in my head,
"Green, white, red. Green, white, red."

1188
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,720
The spout was always a risky part.
Oh, dear, dear, dear...

1189
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,960
This looks like
a child's done it.

1190
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,656
This is the most stressed
I've ever seen you.

1191
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,279
- Yeah, yeah...
- Shall I go?

1192
00:56:18,359 --> 00:56:20,640
- Could you?
- Is that what you're trying to say?

1193
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,879
Just be blunt with me,

1194
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,080
- I'm thick-skinned.
- I'm ready for you to leave now.

1195
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,200
You're just in the way.

1196
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,040
I'll get that on my CV,
"You're just in the way."

1197
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,560
The teapot is so gaudy,
they're gonna say, "This is disgusting."

1198
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,799
Right, come on, last push.

1199
00:56:35,879 --> 00:56:38,720
- That's my structure.
- This is my teapot,

1200
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:39,960
very delicate.

1201
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,799
They look square.

1202
00:56:41,879 --> 00:56:43,720
- They are square.
- Square teacups?

1203
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:45,960
- Yes.
- Is the tea square?

1204
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,799
It's sort of a loose leaf.

1205
00:56:47,879 --> 00:56:50,480
Okay, that feels fairly robust.

1206
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,496
- Fingers crossed.
- I'm filling my haggis

1207
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,319
with some cranachan, and that's it.

1208
00:56:54,399 --> 00:56:55,799
They're all done now.

1209
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,240
- I know it's not brilliant.
- Bakers, you have one minute left.

1210
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:03,160
What can I do
in one minute with gold leaf?

1211
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,480
Just shaking so much.

1212
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,919
Is time about to be up?

1213
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,640
Bakers, your time is up.

1214
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,480
I think that'll do.

1215
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,000
God, the pressure
in this tent doing that.

1216
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,520
Super happy. That went really well.

1217
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,120
I think Paul will be pleased.
It's largely finished.

1218
00:57:38,879 --> 00:57:42,640
<i>It's judgement time
for the bakers' showstoppers.</i>

1219
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,240
Rowan, would you like
to bring up your showstopper?

1220
00:57:48,279 --> 00:57:50,799
I'm calling this
Worse Things Happen at Sea.

1221
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,359
- We did get your flashing lighthouse.
- You get the flashing lighthouse.

1222
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,200
It looks like a lighthouse.

1223
00:57:58,279 --> 00:58:00,200
It does look a bit smaller than
a lighthouse.

1224
00:58:00,279 --> 00:58:02,080
Little bit.

1225
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,160
- Yeah.
- Is this gingerbread?

1226
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,799
It's all a lemon...

1227
00:58:05,879 --> 00:58:06,879
Biscuit.

1228
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,879
Lovely flavour.

1229
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,480
That's been worked so much.

1230
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,576
- Too thick.
- Tastes like rubber, it's a shame.

1231
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,120
'Cause the flavour's not bad.

1232
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,359
I feel it's not your best, Rowan.

1233
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,799
I know you can do more.
It's a bit disappointing.

1234
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,919
It's got a bit of a Roger Hargreaves vibe.

1235
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,879
- Hmm.
- It looks brilliant.

1236
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,200
The toast, the rack, the knife,

1237
00:58:34,279 --> 00:58:37,359
the way that you've done the buttercream
and that, looks great.

1238
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,600
Thank you very much.

1239
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:45,160
Because it's thick, which it needed to be
for the middle of the toast,

1240
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,600
- it's squishy in the middle.
- Okay.

1241
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,319
- But I like that.
- Overall,

1242
00:58:49,399 --> 00:58:51,560
- you've done an amazing job.
- Thank you.

1243
00:58:53,399 --> 00:58:56,120
They're a bit clumsy,
but they're all uniform

1244
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,799
and I like the colour on the outside.

1245
00:58:57,879 --> 00:58:59,919
It's beautiful.
It looks as if you sprayed it on.

1246
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Thank you.

1247
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,240
I'm not convinced on the flavour.

1248
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:06,960
It's all quite bitter, isn't it?

1249
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,640
See, it's gotta taste good
as well as look good.

1250
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,399
Underneath this is a stand
which you've just put this on the top of.

1251
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,319
I'm not convinced
that that's had a lot of work in it.

1252
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,240
- Lovely flavour.
- The flavour of the biscuit's nice.

1253
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:29,000
It's got a kick to it from the spices,
but in four hours,

1254
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,160
I'd wanted something a little bit neater.

1255
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,240
You've certainly made it
very pretty.

1256
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,359
It really is extremely well done.

1257
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,040
The biscuit has been worked
a little bit too much.

1258
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,080
The texture's not quite there.

1259
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,416
It was always gonna be an issue
with shortbread,

1260
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,600
but I think the design is very pretty.

1261
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,000
- It certainly looks very African.
- Scruffy, but it looks the part.

1262
00:59:59,759 --> 01:00:00,919
Love it.

1263
01:00:02,879 --> 01:00:04,560
- Strong, innit?
- It's lovely.

1264
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,120
- Very strong coffee flavour.
- I like that flavour, don't you?

1265
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,799
- Hmm.
- Never had anything like it before.

1266
01:00:09,879 --> 01:00:11,600
You'll be awake all night, Paul.

1267
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,480
I love the colours.

1268
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,560
- It's so Mexican. It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

1269
01:00:17,399 --> 01:00:18,600
That is remarkable.

1270
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,759
We were looking for form
and shaping and moulding,

1271
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,799
- I think you've done an amazing job.
- Thank you.

1272
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,480
It's very believable.

1273
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,480
That is lovely.

1274
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,680
Thank you.

1275
01:00:30,759 --> 01:00:33,000
- Mmm.
- That's actually delicious, yeah.

1276
01:00:33,879 --> 01:00:36,040
Overall, you've done a really good job.

1277
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,120
Thank you.

1278
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,160
We were looking for moulding,
you've gone flat.

1279
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,759
I know that the teapot's not moulded,

1280
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,359
but I like the look of it.

1281
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,200
That looks a bit bendy.

1282
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:57,799
I like the flavour.

1283
01:00:58,359 --> 01:00:59,359
Not much ginger.

1284
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,200
It's not a bad flavour, though.

1285
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:03,919
I just think
the whole thing's a bit clumsy.

1286
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,600
You needed more care, to be more precise.

1287
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,080
- Thank you, Mak.
- Thank you.

1288
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,640
It looks rushed to me.
You're normally very neat.

1289
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,720
That's not neat.

1290
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:20,279
- It's just the icing that is rushed.
- I agree.

1291
01:01:20,359 --> 01:01:22,480
Great flavour, though. Great snap.

1292
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,440
- Thank you.
- Really crispy. Delicious.

1293
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,240
- Hmm. Very good.
- Really nice.

1294
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:27,879
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1295
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,960
I like that. It looks very neat.
It's quite effective.

1296
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,480
- So that's the cranachan.
- Mmm-hmm.

1297
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,319
The mixture of oatmeal,
whisky, raspberries...

1298
01:01:38,399 --> 01:01:39,440
Honey and cream.

1299
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,200
Mmm. It's delic...

1300
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,399
You couldn't finish the word delicious,
it was so delicious.

1301
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,240
- Prue's in ecstasy.
- It's very witty.

1302
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,399
And actually, the biscuit's beautiful.

1303
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,000
It's well baked, it's tasty.

1304
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,680
- I think you've done a great job.
- Thank you very much.

1305
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:02,000
It's very impressive.

1306
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:06,240
I think the boat's there,
it's a shame you ran out of time

1307
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:09,279
'cause it's gone all over the place,
but you've moulded it nicely.

1308
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,640
Erm, the plate looks a bit rough.

1309
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:15,640
It is Viking, it's been under the ground
for the last 500 years or something.

1310
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,720
Thanks, Prue.

1311
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,496
It's good gingerbread.

1312
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,960
Very crisp, lovely flavour,
lots of ginger.

1313
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,399
It has got a nice flavour to it.

1314
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,160
- Overall, you've done a decent job.
- Very good.

1315
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,080
I think they could see the vision,
which is reassuring.

1316
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,720
I reckon I got away with that.
Flavours might pull me through.

1317
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,440
Biscuit Week wasn't my strongest.

1318
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,520
If I do make it through this round,
it'd be some kind of miracle.

1319
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,720
Hopefully, you know, the judges
will look favourably upon me.

1320
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,240
I think my position
is more than precarious, really.

1321
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,839
I think it's completely tipped over
onto the slidey slope to,

1322
01:02:53,919 --> 01:02:55,200
er, oblivion.

1323
01:02:59,279 --> 01:03:01,560
<i>It's decision time
for Prue and Paul.</i>

1324
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,520
<i>Who'll be named Star Baker
and who will leave the tent?</i>

1325
01:03:06,279 --> 01:03:09,279
So who do you think did the best
in that last challenge?

1326
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:12,480
- David's was very good.
- Absolutely lovely.

1327
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,200
I adored it and then I liked...

1328
01:03:14,279 --> 01:03:15,440
- Mark R.
- ...Mark.

1329
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,839
- His Ethiopian tea set.
- Marc E had a really good week.

1330
01:03:18,919 --> 01:03:20,480
- I really loved that.
- Very clever.

1331
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,720
The texture, the look, it's very neat.

1332
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,000
- Hmm.
- So the Marks...

1333
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,560
Top marks for the Marks.

1334
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,295
We've got a few people in the mix

1335
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:29,759
- for Star Baker.
- Hmm.

1336
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,399
But when it comes to who's going home,

1337
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,799
it's difficult between Mak and Rowan.

1338
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,480
Which of those two do you think is
the most likely to improve if they stay?

1339
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:42,240
Well, I have to say Rowan
doesn't seem to take any advice.

1340
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,919
Paul has been saying to him,

1341
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,399
"Try not to promise too much."

1342
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,080
"And, for goodness sake, finish."

1343
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,759
He hasn't done it once yet.

1344
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:51,759
You just want his execution to be better

1345
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,879
- because he has great ideas.
- I know.

1346
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,720
On the other hand, Mak is steady, good...

1347
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,879
- But he's not blowing your mind.
- Yeah.

1348
01:03:59,439 --> 01:04:01,120
I sense that you're torn.

1349
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,279
We'd better leave you
to make your decision.

1350
01:04:08,839 --> 01:04:12,160
Fortunately for me, I've got
the great job of announcing

1351
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,839
who is Star Baker.

1352
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,919
And Star Baker this week is...

1353
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,040
Dave.

1354
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,279
Thank you.

1355
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:26,799
Well done, you.

1356
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:29,480
Thank you. Thank you.

1357
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,399
So it falls to me

1358
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,120
to announce
who will be going home this week.

1359
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,680
I've never done it before
and I've been dreading this moment.

1360
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:39,680
I will say that it was very close.

1361
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,080
And it involved a lot of discussion.

1362
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,680
But I'm afraid to say the baker
going home this week is...

1363
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,120
- Mak.
- Thank you.

1364
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,560
Sorry, man.

1365
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,375
I was expecting that, thank you very much.

1366
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:01,439
- Unlucky, Mak.
- Okay, no, no, it's okay.

1367
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,759
I just felt in my bones that it was me.

1368
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:05,960
I know that I gave everything.

1369
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,720
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna miss you.

1370
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:09,919
It was a privilege to be here,

1371
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,200
meeting new people, making new friends.

1372
01:05:12,279 --> 01:05:13,319
It's just been amazing.

1373
01:05:13,399 --> 01:05:15,720
Oh, Mak, honestly, I'm astonished.

1374
01:05:15,799 --> 01:05:18,080
My ideas saved me this week.

1375
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,799
- The last, last chance saloon.
- I did my... I tried my hardest.

1376
01:05:22,879 --> 01:05:24,359
Just rein it in a little bit.

1377
01:05:24,439 --> 01:05:25,720
Going into next week,

1378
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:29,359
I'll hope to manage the technical side
of things rather better.

1379
01:05:29,439 --> 01:05:32,439
I'm happy that I'm through
but I'm really gutted that Mak's gone.

1380
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,520
He's such a lovely guy. It hurts.

1381
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,040
I'm gonna miss him.

1382
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,080
Can't believe it. I'm through!

1383
01:05:39,919 --> 01:05:42,439
The coffee was strong
and they got a kick from it.

1384
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,960
It's nice to hear that I'm probably
keeping Paul and Prue up all night.

1385
01:05:48,919 --> 01:05:50,160
It's been a good week for me.

1386
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,000
I'm ecstatic. That was amazing.
Super happy.

1387
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,240
Yeah!

1388
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:56,759
I'm Star Baker this week.

1389
01:05:56,839 --> 01:05:59,160
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- I know.

1390
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,319
<i>- No way!</i>
- Yeah, I can't believe it.

1391
01:06:01,399 --> 01:06:02,919
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

1392
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,640
What an end to the week.

1393
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,319
<i>Well done!</i>

1394
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:12,303
