1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,499
I've got a couple of facts
about biscuits. Let's hear them.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,819
Did you know that biscuits were

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,859
invented by Sir Morris Biscuits
in 1950-12?

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,619
And also did you know
that over 40 biscuits a year

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,939
are sold in Europe alone?

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,459
Did you know that in America
they're not called biscuits?

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,460
Oh. They're called the sidewalk.

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,060
Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,660
Don't go.

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,099
Last time, we met
our new Bake Off bubble.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,699
This is it!

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,499
For Cake Week...

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,179
I don't know if I've ever fancied a
cake before, but I slightly do now.

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,139
David's upside down cake...

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,299
Ooh!

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,859
..landed the wrong way up.

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,259
I'm so sorry.
Don't worry about it, it's fine.

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,579
Oh, don't cry, it's all right.

19
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,899
Peter kept his ear
close to the sponge...

20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,579
It's delicious. And it's witty.

21
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,820
..becoming our first Star Baker.

22
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,179
Rowan shot for the stars.

23
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,619
Inside is the temple
of enlightenment.

24
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,259
But came crashing down.

25
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,099
Say less and then do more.

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,819
Yes. Oh!

27
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,819
But it was Loriea
whose bubble-gum burst...

28
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,259
That's bone dry.

29
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,099
..as she was the first
to leave the tent.

30
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,139
Sorry. It's fine! Miss you.

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,419
This time, it's Biscuit Week...

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,940
Oh... with a sticky signature...

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,819
..that's tight on time.

34
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,459
What a disaster!

35
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,219
A tropical technical
that has the bakers bemused.

36
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,019
I've got no idea, mate.

37
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,379
And a brittle showstopper...

38
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,779
Ugh!

39
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,499
I might well cry if this breaks.

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,539
..that leaves
the whole tent anxious.

41
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,659
I remember worrying a bit
about your very large nuts.

42
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,659
LAUGHTER

43
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,140
HE GROANS

44
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,380
Morning, another day. Ah!

45
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,259
I'm so happy to be back
for week two.

46
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,539
I don't wanna flap today.

47
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,139
I'm gonna try and be cool,
controlled and calm.

48
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,819
We'll see how that goes.

49
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,339
Hopefully, this week,
there'll be no more tears.

50
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,739
Well, my mum did say to me,

51
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,579
"Stop crying,
dunno why you're crying."

52
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,259
She's so harsh.

53
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,779
I'm excited about Biscuit Week.

54
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,180
I'm not shaking, I'm all right.

55
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,339
Terrified.

56
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,459
Absolutely terrified.

57
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,379
Biscuits are quite tricky,
so I think it's gonna be

58
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,859
a bit of a difficult week.

59
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,219
As long as I get through,
that's fine.

60
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,740
If I get Star Baker,
that's my final.

61
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,819
Bakers, welcome back
to the tent for Biscuit Week.

62
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,779
And for your Signature Challenge,
the judges would like you each

63
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,419
to make a batch
of 36 chocolate Florentines.

64
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,299
Interesting fact, Florentines were
originally called Florentines.

65
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,899
Thank you, Noel.
I actually wrote that fact.

66
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,619
LAUGHTER

67
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,219
Your Florentines should be
uniform in terms of shape,

68
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,099
texture and flavour, and the judges
will be expecting a perfect snap.

69
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,339
Your Florentines must be dipped,
decorated or coated in chocolate.

70
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,059
You have two hours.

71
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,059
It is time for you to leap
onto your marks, please.

72
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,979
And make sure at that point, then,
that you get set.

73
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,660
For it is now time
to very much... bake!

74
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,819
For chocolate Florentines,
it's all about the snap.

75
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,579
Gotta have a good snap
on a Florentine.

76
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,059
Nervous.

77
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,460
Well, not about eating them, but
about making them, yes, I'm nervous.

78
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,219
It's Biscuit Week, and we're
kicking off with Florentines.

79
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,219
A really good classic Florentine
consists of nuts

80
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,619
and dried fruit bound together
in a caramelly buttery mixture.

81
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,099
I mean, they're fattening,
but they're gorgeous!

82
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,739
This particular challenge is tricky

83
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,339
because they've got to get
the caramel right,

84
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,739
they've got to get the filling
right, choice of chocolate.

85
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,259
I personally think dark chocolate's
the way forward because the

86
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,819
sweetness with the bitterness of the
dark chocolate is a beautiful blend.

87
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,099
BLENDER WHIRS

88
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,779
It would help if I put that bit in.

89
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,419
The perfect Florentine is
neat as a pin and small and thin.

90
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,179
Timing is everything.

91
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,179
Half a minute too long,
and they'll be burnt.

92
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,500
Half a minute too short, and
they won't have that crisp crack.

93
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,339
Morning, Peter. Hello, hello.

94
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,219
So you did really well last week.

95
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,819
What have you got in store for us?

96
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,059
I'm making sticky toffee Florentines
inspired by what is in my

97
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,659
considered opinion the best pudding
in the world, sticky toffee pudding.

98
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,139
So I've got a dark muscovado
sugar in the caramel.

99
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,899
I've got lots of dates so it should
have those lovely toffee flavours.

100
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,459
After pounding the trails
outside his hometown Edinburgh,

101
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,939
proud Scot Peter likes to replace
the lost calories

102
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,619
with some good hearty fare.

103
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,939
Stick in till you stick out. Ah!

104
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,699
Based on his favourite pudding
growing up,

105
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,019
Peter's sticky toffee Florentines

106
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,539
contain a gooey mix of dates,
sultanas

107
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,739
and chopped nuts topped with
caramelised white chocolate.

108
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,379
Will they be thin
and have a snap to them,

109
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,019
or will they will be sticky
and squishy?

110
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,179
Both crunchy and chewy,

111
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,699
cos obviously
when you bite into the dates,

112
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,019
that's gonna be really chewy,

113
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,099
but also I'm hoping that you'll be
able to get a snap from the caramel

114
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,859
nut side of the biscuit as well.

115
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,379
Well, thank you very much,
good luck.

116
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,579
Good luck, Star Baker.

117
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,860
Thank you very much.

118
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,459
Peter's not the only baker inspired
by a childhood favourite.

119
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,619
Traditionally, in Iran,

120
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,339
there's this brittle called sohan,

121
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,459
which is cardamom,
saffron and rose water.

122
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,139
They're flavours that I grew up on.

123
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,979
They're part of my heritage.

124
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,059
When key worker Sura needs to
unwind from a day at the hospital,

125
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,459
she branches out
with a spot of yoga.

126
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,419
Sura's Florentines
containing toasted almonds

127
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,619
and pistachios will be flavoured
with rose water and saffron,

128
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,979
brought back from her trips
to Iran.

129
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,579
Alongside her biscuits, she'll serve
traditional cardamom tea.

130
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,899
How are you?
I'm OK, how are you?

131
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,740
Are you over the old... whoosh?

132
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,179
Yeah, yeah.

133
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,139
Whoosh!

134
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,739
Are you gonna try that again?

135
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,219
No! Oh, look. Whoosh!

136
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,579
Oh, stop it, no, no, no.
That was traumatic.

137
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,899
I saw you in the corner going
like this, "He-he-he!"

138
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,539
And laughing to yourself.

139
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,499
What have you done on your days off?

140
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,859
Practice, practice, practice,
burnt myself out.

141
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,099
Burnt yourself out?

142
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,019
Yeah, I was really tired.
I had a nightmare about Paul.

143
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,899
I had a dream about Paul.

144
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,860
He was just in an apron -
it was pretty powerful.

145
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,699
It was last night, actually.
Stop it!

146
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,019
Good luck, yeah?
You need to go away.

147
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,420
HE LAUGHS

148
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:00,099
My Florentines are one
of my sister's favourite biscuits.

149
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,619
She had a really,
really sweet tooth when we was kids.

150
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,619
When my mum turned her back, I used
to quickly eat her dinner and...

151
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,979
So she could get
to her pudding quick.

152
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,059
At the end of a hard day's weeding,
green-fingered Linda

153
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,739
and partner Richard love nothing
more than a refreshing

154
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,459
pint in their shed.

155
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,299
I don't normally kiss the barman.

156
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,699
Decorated with delicate
sugar flowers

157
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,819
and dark chocolate, Linda's aiming
to give her childhood-inspired

158
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,899
Florentines a smooth finish.

159
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,419
I blend the nuts down
into quite small chunks.

160
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,899
That way, hopefully,
when they spread,

161
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,140
you get a much more even surface.

162
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,459
But in terms of texture, Linda's
consistency is not for everyone.

163
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,859
In my nuts, I want some bigger bits.

164
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,059
cos you want, obviously,

165
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,380
a bite of nuts.

166
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,819
Mark's career has taken him
around the globe,

167
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,259
but when at home in Liverpool,

168
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,419
he loves nothing more than baking
for friends and wife Laura.

169
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,659
Nice.

170
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,979
Flavoured with cardamom

171
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,339
and decorated with waves
of white chocolate,

172
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,619
Mark's chunky Florentines contain
a mix of macadamia nuts

173
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,899
and dried mango.

174
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,259
We should sell some,
shouldn't we, at lunchtime?

175
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,779
Yeah, we can set up a little shop.
A kiosk.

176
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,619
You make fresh hot biscuits.

177
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,939
Yeah, yeah.

178
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,459
And then I'll get a kiosk on the go.

179
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,660
We'll have it on wheels.

180
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,259
Amazing, wouldn't it? It would
be amazing. Make a mint. Yeah.

181
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,740
We'll make 37 euros each.

182
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,619
I'll have a biscuit, though.

183
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,499
Yeah, feel free. I don't eat them,
I like looking at them.

184
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,179
OK. I eat with my eyes.

185
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,460
That's why I'm not allowed
in restaurants.

186
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,539
But when it comes
to the king of fruits,

187
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,179
Mark has competition.

188
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,979
I know there's a lot of people in
the tent using mango as well today,

189
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,019
so I think it's a bit
of a mango-off.

190
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,219
Three other bakers are also trying
to tempt the judges with this

191
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,499
tropical treat.

192
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,339
It's mango Florentine week,
isn't it?

193
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,819
May the best mango win.

194
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,099
This is dried mango - I'm just gonna

195
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,259
put this in boiling water,

196
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,739
let them soak for a bit,

197
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,699
otherwise it'll just be too chewy.

198
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,179
Ooh! Ooh, juicy! Juicy ones.

199
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,579
Not content with work, baking and
taking care of his extended family,

200
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,259
Mak has also found the time
to write a novel.

201
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,459
First draft finished.

202
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,939
His Florentines feature a trio
of classic Indian ingredients -

203
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,779
mango, cashew and cumin.

204
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,139
But while Mak is familiar
with his flavours,

205
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,139
his hand-piped
peacock feather design

206
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,779
will be a step into the unknown.

207
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,220
I've never decorated them before.

208
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,940
So a world exclusive.

209
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,459
My one's called feathered chocolate
mango Florentines.

210
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,139
I really enjoy eating
all things mango,

211
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,179
so that's why I wanted to put
mango in there.

212
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,499
When not experimenting
with exotic flavours,

213
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,859
Dave and his girlfriend, Stacey,
enjoy walks

214
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,339
with their Japanese hunting dog,
Yoki.

215
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,219
Come on, then, you pain.

216
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,659
He wasn't gonna come back.

217
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,739
He's celebrating his love of mango
with Florentines containing

218
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,899
a mix of nuts
and sesame seeds for added crunch.

219
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,379
He'll decorate each biscuit by
feathering three types of chocolate.

220
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,419
I've weighed out each scoop,

221
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,899
so each scoop is
about 25 or 26 grams

222
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,300
so hopefully they should all come
out nice and uniform.

223
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,419
Whether the bakers use moulds...

224
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,099
I'm using these rings.

225
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,779
..or choose to go freehand,

226
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,899
Paul and Prue will demand
consistency in size and shape...

227
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,459
TIMER BEEPS
..across the batch.

228
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,819
I make my Florentines
the traditional way,

229
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,979
so I've really gotta make sure
that I measure out the biscuit.

230
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,219
This is a cake pop scoop,
to get my quantities right.

231
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,059
Bake Off, supposed to be identical.

232
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,579
I'm being quite precise and weighing
18 grams into each mould.

233
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,859
They want perfection.

234
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,939
They want 36 identical Florentines.

235
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,299
About three quarters of a teaspoon
to a teaspoon in each one.

236
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,660
Some people measure. To be honest,
I haven't got the patience.

237
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,419
I don't want them too chunky
because they won't snap.

238
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,739
I'll be honest,
I haven't made Florentines before.

239
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,899
I'm from Gravesend.

240
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,219
Hobnobs are posh where I'm from.

241
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,379
At home in Kent,
Laura isn't the only baker.

242
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,739
She shares her passion -
and pizza oven - with husband Matt.

243
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,419
Oh, brilliant. Cheers.

244
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,339
A self-confessed salted caramel
addict, Laura will coat her

245
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,459
almond, pecan and raisin Florentines
in sweet milk chocolate.

246
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,659
Because it's quite salty,
dark chocolate was too rich

247
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,539
so I chose milk chocolate as a base.

248
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:09,259
My family, when I've made these,
have just absolutely devoured them.

249
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,099
Lottie has also decided to go
with a family favourite.

250
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,979
I am making quarantine Florentines.

251
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,459
For my grandparents, because
it is their favourite biscuit.

252
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,339
Nana and papa?

253
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,299
Although Lottie's grandparents live
just down the road from her

254
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,659
in Littlehampton,
it's been six months

255
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,179
since she's been able to give them
a hug.

256
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,499
I love you. I love you too.
I love you too.

257
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,939
I'll Facetime you later.

258
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,499
Her grandparents' favourite
Florentines are a classic

259
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,019
combination of chopped nuts,
ginger and sour cherries,

260
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,099
but when it comes to decoration,

261
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,579
Lottie's taking
an abstract approach.

262
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,859
If you're doing
Jackson Pollock-esque splashes,

263
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,419
will they all be uniform?

264
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,739
LAUGHS: No. Absolutely not.

265
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,539
That's the reason I'm doing
Jackson Pollock splashes.

266
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,459
A uniform mess.
Uniform mess - exactly, Paul.

267
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,379
Bakers, you are halfway through.

268
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,899
Right.

269
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,059
Your lives.

270
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,179
How's it going?

271
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,739
Right...

272
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,659
In they go.

273
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,099
Because they contain
so much sugar,

274
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,539
judging the bake time
of their Florentines

275
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,899
will test the bakers
to their limit.

276
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,339
Those are going in
at 180 for seven minutes.

277
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,339
These are going in
for about 12 minutes.

278
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,979
11 minutes on the top shelf

279
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,019
and 11 and a half minutes
on the bottom shelf.

280
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,379
I have to be really careful
about the timing of these,

281
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,699
cos they can go over
really quickly.

282
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,219
12 and a half minutes.

283
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,539
Actually,
12 minutes and 26 seconds.

284
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,859
I don't really do precision,

285
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,339
but I realise
it's definitely called for.

286
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,179
While most of the bakers have their
first batch of biscuits baking...

287
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,939
I'm sorry, but I'm panicking.

288
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,419
..Hermine is still moulding hers.

289
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,739
I'm a little bit behind.

290
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,259
Born and raised in West Africa
on her mother's pineapple farm,

291
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,859
Hermine moved to London
almost 20 years ago

292
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,219
and is studying to become
an accountant.

293
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,779
I've done enough for today,
I need a break.

294
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,539
She's adding shredded dried mango

295
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,899
and coconut flakes
to her Florentines

296
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,899
which she'll coat in ruby chocolate

297
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,219
and decorate
with spray-painted trees.

298
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,499
I'm worried about getting the snap

299
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,659
cos, to be honest,

300
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,979
uh, mine were quite chewy.

301
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,179
Apparently, Paul Hollywood
likes them with the snap,

302
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,660
so, yeah, bit nervous about that.

303
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,859
Perfecting a batch of 36
identical biscuits will require

304
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,419
the bakers to walk a time
and temperature tightrope.

305
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,219
In practice, I took 'em
out the oven too soon,

306
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,179
so just trying to wait
for that golden colour.

307
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,019
I'm not quite sure
when they're going to be done.

308
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,979
Are they done, are they not?

309
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,819
It's just a hard one to call.

310
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,219
Gotta get that snap.

311
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,739
Misjudge either...

312
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,219
Right, let's see how they look.

313
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,379
..and any chance of achieving
uniform texture and colour...

314
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,659
Whoa... will go up in smoke.

315
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,019
I'm not happy with them.

316
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,339
They're just not as brown as I
thought they would be at this stage.

317
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,699
The bottom ones just need
a minute longer.

318
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,379
CRUNCH!
That sounded crunchy, didn't it?

319
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,779
I've cooked them
for a little bit longer today, which

320
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,739
I think's given me good snap.

321
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,659
I'm 90% sure they've got a snap.

322
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,979
Second batch in.

323
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,459
They're just great -
I'm happy with them.

324
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,739
I'm thinking, are they even?

325
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,059
Is that round?

326
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,419
What's Paul Hollywood gonna say?

327
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,660
They seem rather gooey, actually.

328
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,179
So my Florentines, they're inspired
by grandmother

329
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,699
who had a very lovely garden

330
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,059
and was a very good homely cook.

331
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,779
Very beautiful.

332
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,139
A keen gardener himself
when he's not pruning,

333
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,459
Rowan can be found
bringing out the shine

334
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,099
on his large collection of antiques.

335
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,739
That's a bit better.

336
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,059
In homage
to his grandmother's garden,

337
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,899
Rowan's colourful Florentines

338
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,539
feature a trio
of vibrant dried fruits.

339
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,579
But when it comes to decoration,
he's had to look no further

340
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,019
than his own flamboyant wardrobe.

341
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,299
I'm coating them
with modelling chocolate waistcoats.

342
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,659
Which is in honour
of your waistcoat collection.

343
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,099
It is, with my garden on the back.
Yes. Ah, lovely.

344
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,899
How many waistcoats have you got?

345
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,859
Uh, I think I've got about a dozen
or so.

346
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,259
I've got an 18th century one,
embroidered in France in about 1780,

347
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,699
which is beautiful.

348
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,620
Paul, this is what posh people
talk about, isn't it?

349
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,220
This is going right over my head.

350
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,539
With their biscuits cooling,

351
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,539
the bakers can turn their attention
to chocolate.

352
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,539
Gotta love the smell of chocolate.

353
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,299
I'm topping my Florentines
with caramelised white chocolate.

354
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,499
You bake it in the oven,
but then it takes on a really dark

355
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,379
caramelly colour and flavour,
and it tastes so, so good.

356
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,139
I'm just melting some chocolate,

357
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,019
and I'm tempering.
Tempering gives it that snap.

358
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,339
It's a really frustrating process,
especially for white chocolate

359
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,859
and it's very precise.

360
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,339
Just keep stirring this,
cos it's really hot still.

361
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,859
A couple of degrees out and you have
to start the whole process again.

362
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,219
That looks delicious.
I'd sort of like to get in that.

363
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,579
I know, I think I could stick
my head in a bucket of that.

364
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,700
If I was an insect, I'd get
in that like a sort of hot tub.

365
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,139
But with her Florentines
only just out of the oven...

366
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,419
..Hermine is playing catch up.

367
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,259
Stabbing the Florentines.

368
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,940
Please!

369
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,419
It's, uh, ruby chocolate,

370
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,299
and I only discovered it
a few months ago.

371
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,019
And I was really surprised
about the flavour.

372
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,139
Almost like white chocolate,

373
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,779
but then you've got this lovely
sourness coming through at the end.

374
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,179
Now a sculptor, Marc spent
many years working as a landscape

375
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,579
photographer, a passion he now
shares with youngest daughter Rosie.

376
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,979
Brilliant.

377
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,299
Not only is Marc using
ruby chocolate to

378
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,259
give his Florentines extra flavour,

379
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,739
but he's adding ginger to give
his square-shaped biscuits a kick.

380
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,419
What do you think of the square
shape? It's nice, isn't it?
I like the square shape.

381
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,179
I've never, ever seen
a square before,

382
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,539
so I'm very exc... very excited
about these biscuits.

383
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,939
It's a completely new concept.

384
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,819
Yeah, cos I don't...
I, I'm, I'm learning shapes.

385
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,739
You know rhombus now, don't you?

386
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,739
I know rhombus... Cuboid?
Dodecahedron. I don't know cuboid.

387
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,899
You do know circle.

388
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,179
But I don't know semicircles. No.

389
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,379
I'm not onto them yet.

390
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,660
We'll do that later.
We'll learn it later.

391
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,739
Sweet, lovely bakers, you do be
having 30 of minutes remainings.

392
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,339
Yes!

393
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,259
How marvellous. Pff!

394
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,179
Oh, I'm melting chocolate -
no time to think.

395
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,499
I put some colour in this chocolate.

396
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,779
It's just gone a bit solid,
so I'm gonna reheat them.

397
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,619
I'm just slightly short of time.

398
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,059
Lots of little waistcoats.

399
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,540
There's a huge amount of work to do.
I'm always very ambitious.

400
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,139
I'm just going
for the standard dunk.

401
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,740
Dunk and wipe.

402
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,420
A dip, a swipe and trying to make
them as neat as possible.

403
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,379
What I'm aiming to do is just get
a really thin layer on here,

404
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,739
sit the biscuits on,
and then the chocolate's gonna set

405
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,299
beautifully so that they don't give
me any stress whatsoever.

406
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,659
RATTLING
Oh, gosh.

407
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,019
It's going well, isn't it?
SHE LAUGHS

408
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,659
RAPS: Bakers, you've got
15 minutes left.

409
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,019
You see, if you communicate
through rap... Right.

410
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,699
..the kids really take it in.
They take it in better. Yeah.

411
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,700
Let's get them decorated.

412
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,139
I like to make flowers.

413
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,379
It's very therapeutic.

414
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,139
And I strive to get them
as fine as I can

415
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,659
so that they look real.

416
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,459
Look at these! Ooh!

417
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,179
I like foods that are pink,
apart from taramasalata.

418
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,379
How's it all going?

419
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,700
Uh, not too well. I don't know
if they'll set in time.

420
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,899
Not bad.

421
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,340
I went to art school for this.

422
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,699
Slightly tight, to be quite honest.

423
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,100
Speed is of the essence.

424
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,179
How long have we got?

425
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,100
Bakers, you have... one minute left.

426
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,579
I'm trying to hide the worst ones
at the bottom.

427
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,260
They look identical. Very happy.

428
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,099
It would've been nice to have
finished rather more of them.

429
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,019
What a disaster.

430
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,580
Do you want me to count check?
Yeah, yeah, could you?

431
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,379
You need one more.
One, two, three, four, five.

432
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,659
So it's 36, isn't it?

433
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,939
35, 36. I've got 37 - I'll eat one.

434
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,660
Bakers, your time is up.

435
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,619
Step away from your chocolat
Florentines.

436
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,299
Get them on your plate quick!

437
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,859
Mak. Sorry.

438
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,299
Ooph!

439
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,499
Wow.

440
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,779
Looks good, looks good.

441
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,380
Ooph!

442
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,939
Oh, mine didn't go well.

443
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,900
No? They look good, though.

444
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:45,579
The bakers' Florentines will now be
judged by Prue and Paul.

445
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,259
Hello, Dave. Hello.

446
00:19:51,979 --> 00:19:54,018
It's like a Magic Eye poster!

447
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:55,418
THEY CHUCKLE

448
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:57,898
It's cos of my jumper, I thought
I was back on the rave scene.

449
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:00,218
I think you've done pretty well
with the feathering.

450
00:20:00,219 --> 00:20:02,498
Three colours is... quite difficult.

451
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:05,299
Good snap. Massive snap.

452
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:09,858
You've got the snap,
the flavour's good.

453
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:11,818
You can taste the nut and mango,
it all sort of works.

454
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:14,218
Sesame seed as well, which I love.
I just think you need more

455
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:16,218
texture in there as well. Yeah.

456
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:18,298
I love the dark chocolate.

457
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,579
It's a nice biscuit. Thank you.
Good.

458
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,338
It looks a little bit lumpy.

459
00:20:28,339 --> 00:20:30,058
TOO lumpy.

460
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:33,778
Yes, I remember worrying
a bit about your very large nuts.

461
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:35,139
Mainly because...

462
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:41,778
Oh...

463
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:43,059
Right...

464
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:45,499
It snaps, though.

465
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,738
The white chocolate is quite
dominant.

466
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:52,778
It needed something else -
maybe a bit more fruit in there.

467
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:54,699
Could be better. OK. Thank you.

468
00:20:58,379 --> 00:21:00,778
That's a pretty classic Florentine.

469
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:02,218
Yeah.

470
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,299
Snaps quite well.

471
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:06,858
I love that for flavours. Yes!

472
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:09,778
Um, I think the issue is
you want something bitter.

473
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:12,178
If you'd just kept it to dark
chocolate underneath,

474
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,618
you would've been on a winner.

475
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:15,618
But otherwise, that's a great
Florentine. Thank you.

476
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:17,899
Great, thank you.
Well done! Thanks.

477
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:22,618
Have you practised these?

478
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:24,378
Yes. Have you done them in the time?

479
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:27,258
No. Right. Do you remember
what we said last week?

480
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:30,018
Entirely. So my question is,
why did you do it?

481
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:32,299
"Course I have!"
Because I like them.

482
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,698
Anyway, it certainly does not snap.

483
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:37,058
No. I love the flavours of it.

484
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:38,858
It's not baked enough.

485
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:41,178
The idea of the waistcoats, I love,

486
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:43,538
but honestly, that modelling
chocolate ruins the biscuit.

487
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:45,378
Oh, OK. Oh, all right.
It's so sweet.

488
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:48,578
Great flavours. Again, simplify
things to get it done in time.

489
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:50,858
He's a dreamer. Don't stop dreaming.

490
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:52,419
But thank you anyway.

491
00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:58,379
They look so sweet -
like little boats.

492
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:00,739
Looks amazing.

493
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:04,498
Mmm!

494
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:06,418
The crunch from the nuts
is gorgeous.

495
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,778
You do get a little bit
of saffron in there as well.

496
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:11,858
You've created a beautiful,
well-balanced Florentine.

497
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:13,298
It's lovely.

498
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,618
The only problem is, we asked for
a...

499
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:17,218
Snap. Snap. Yeah.

500
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:19,738
And what's the tea?
Cardamom tea.

501
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:21,378
That's delicious as well.

502
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:23,698
It's lovely, isn't it?
Can I take it with me?

503
00:22:23,699 --> 00:22:25,059
Thank you so much, thank you.

504
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:32,418
You've got the colour
of a... a sticky toffee pudding.

505
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,698
Yeah. Smells like one too.

506
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:36,019
Ooh, bit of a bend.

507
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:42,298
The flavour's delicious.
I've never had anything like it.

508
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,658
Particularly like
that white chocolate.

509
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:48,098
I LOVE that caramel flavour. Peter,
you're very clever with your ideas.

510
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:50,538
You've come up with something
that is truly unique.

511
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:53,738
Mm. Thank you. That was a touching
moment, wasn't it?

512
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,419
That smells delicious.

513
00:22:56,819 --> 00:22:59,459
But as we all know,
eating's cheating - so, no.

514
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:04,978
They're a little bit scruffy.

515
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:06,818
Time wasn't on my side.

516
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,139
Hmm...

517
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:12,858
They needed slightly longer
in the oven.

518
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:15,338
There's something really tough
in there.

519
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:17,658
Is it the mango? Probably, yes.

520
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,938
Hmm. It's like leather.

521
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:21,659
Oh, God, this is agonising.

522
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:25,778
The mango needs to be soaked
cos it is just too chewy.

523
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,059
Love the flavour of it, though.
Thank you.

524
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:33,378
It's very pretty,
and neat as anything.

525
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:36,338
Unique,
unusual to use the ruby chocolate.

526
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:38,778
Yeah.
And I do like the uniformity of it.

527
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:41,739
Thank you. It isn't
going to snap, though. Yeah.

528
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:46,538
Ruby chocolate's quite tart
and it blends really well with

529
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:48,858
the ginger, so overall you've got
a really nice flavour.

530
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:50,098
I love the sour cherries.

531
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:53,178
Very surprising,
very original and very delicious.

532
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:55,498
Brilliant, I'll take that.
Well done. Well done.

533
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:56,459
Thank you. Well done.

534
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:05,498
I think you've lost...

535
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:08,738
..in the appearance
what a Florentine is. Mm.

536
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,578
You should be able to see
much more texture,

537
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:12,978
and you're not getting that -
it's as flat as a pancake.

538
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:14,179
Well, I bet it tastes nice.

539
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:19,018
And it has a snap. Ginger's coming
through quite strong, which I like.

540
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:21,378
It's like having
a ginger brandy snap.

541
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:24,378
It's a delicious biscuit,
but it is not a Florentine.

542
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,979
OK. Thank you, Linda. Thank you.

543
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:34,618
What's the decoration?

544
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:37,298
Supposed to be, uh,
a sort of a peacock effect.

545
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:39,658
A peacock? I thought
it was a tennis racquet!

546
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:41,498
Uh, it's to celebrate Wimbledon!
Yes, it was.

547
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:43,018
THEY CHUCKLE

548
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:44,618
They're quite gooey.

549
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:47,138
Probably could've stayed in there
another four, five minutes.

550
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:49,058
You soaked your mango, didn't you?

551
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:51,498
Yeah. But I imagine that would've
contributed

552
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:55,258
to its sort of sogginess. I like the
flavour, but it's not a Florentine.

553
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:57,659
Never mind. Thank you, Mak.
Thank you. Thank you.

554
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:02,978
Well, I have to say, I think

555
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:05,298
they look rather good. Thank you.

556
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:07,658
I think you've got a good
tempered chocolate on there

557
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:10,258
and I do like the top - classic
Florentine. You've got a nice shine,

558
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,819
it's busy, and that's what
a Florentine should look like.

559
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:15,658
Bit of a snap.

560
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:18,738
It's chocolatey, it's nutty,
love the sour cherry.

561
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:20,338
It's delicious.

562
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:24,098
The ginger and the cherry with the
dark chocolate is just fantastic and

563
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:25,858
it does snap, it's nice and thin.

564
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,179
I can't find a fault with them,
really.

565
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:38,459
SHE GASPS
Well done. Thank you!

566
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:42,459
I'll take that one with me.
Thank you.

567
00:25:47,139 --> 00:25:50,298
What?! As if!

568
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,058
Completely mad.

569
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:54,299
Imagine, me!

570
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:57,458
Never going to wash my hand again.

571
00:25:57,459 --> 00:25:58,938
I mean, I like my fruit chunky,

572
00:25:58,939 --> 00:26:01,658
but what am I meant to say?
You know, they're the experts -

573
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:04,578
if they're not right, then they're
not right. I'm just disappointed.

574
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:07,098
I think that went really well.
I did get a snap.

575
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,858
That's what I was going for,
the snap. The concept was good,

576
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:13,858
but a bit too ambitious. I shall
endeavour to take the advice.

577
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:16,858
It could've gone better. I've just
got to stay... stay calm,

578
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:18,338
just put this morning behind me

579
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:20,619
and, you know, look forward
to this afternoon.

580
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:29,178
MATT: The bakers were able to
practise their signature bakes,

581
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:32,659
but have no idea what
Technical mystery lies ahead.

582
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:40,138
Bakers, it's time for your Technical
Challenge which, today, has been

583
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:43,418
set by Prue.
Prue, any words of advice?

584
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:48,498
This is a classic, so read
your recipe - no going off piste.

585
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:51,058
As ever, your Technical Challenge
will be judged blind,

586
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,738
so we're going to have to ask
the judges to leave the tent.

587
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:55,218
Off you pop.

588
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:57,499
Let's say things about them
while they're gone.

589
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:02,618
Prue would like you to make
12 hand-shaped

590
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:04,658
coconut macaroons.

591
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:07,538
Six of them must be drizzled
and filled with chocolate

592
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:11,578
and six of them must be piped
with a delicious mango curd.

593
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:13,258
Oh, sounds quite involved.

594
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:15,898
If I were you, I'd just go out
and buy some. Much easier.

595
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:17,578
It doesn't work like that. Oh.

596
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:19,898
They must be crispy and golden

597
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:22,418
on the outside, but chewy on the
inside.

598
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:24,058
You've got an hour and 45 minutes.

599
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,058
On your marks. Get set.

600
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:27,979
Go to the shops. Or bake. Or bake.

601
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,498
Oh, Jesus.

602
00:27:32,499 --> 00:27:34,218
Macaroons? I've got no idea, mate.

603
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:38,298
I don't think I've even eaten one,
let alone made one. This is going
to be really interesting.

604
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:38,859
I don't think I've even eaten one,
I'm familiar with macaroons,
and I've made them once,

605
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,218
I'm familiar with macaroons,
and I've made them once,

606
00:27:41,219 --> 00:27:42,658
a very long time ago.

607
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,058
But not filled.

608
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:46,698
I've made these, uh,
with my mum before.

609
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:47,898
But donkeys ago.

610
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:51,578
Haven't had macaroons for years!
They're all right, but they get
stuck between your teeth.

611
00:27:51,579 --> 00:27:55,138
So, Prue, macaroons as a Technical
Challenge, good choice!

612
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:57,578
Bit of a favourite of mine.
I know, I love them too.

613
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:00,098
They always look so simple,
and if you read the recipe it's,

614
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:01,738
"Oh, there's no problem with that!"

615
00:28:01,739 --> 00:28:04,098
But I think they're trickier
than they sound.

616
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,538
It's really important to get
the mixture right.

617
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:07,898
We've given them

618
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:11,938
coconut flakes, which they need
to put in a processor briefly.

619
00:28:11,939 --> 00:28:15,898
If they overdo it, they won't get
this nice, rough edge - they'll

620
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:18,218
get a smooth paste which will stick
together

621
00:28:18,219 --> 00:28:19,938
and won't be nearly so pleasant.

622
00:28:19,939 --> 00:28:21,618
And I think these look beautiful.

623
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:23,458
They're all the same size,
regardless

624
00:28:23,459 --> 00:28:25,378
whether they're mango or chocolate.

625
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:27,738
I think I'll try the mango one
first.

626
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,658
So as soon as you bite into it,
instantly there's coconut.

627
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:31,258
The mango is beautiful as well.

628
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:33,258
It's just the right consistency.

629
00:28:33,259 --> 00:28:35,538
Smooth as anything, but it's set.

630
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:36,698
It's not running.

631
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:40,138
You have to pipe a wall round
the edge, and if you don't get

632
00:28:40,139 --> 00:28:42,938
the high enough walls,
you don't get enough mango curd.

633
00:28:42,939 --> 00:28:44,778
OK, moving on to the chocolate one.

634
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:46,498
Very neat on the lines on the top.

635
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:49,498
And a good decent lump of chocolate
in there, isn't there?

636
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:52,178
Hmm, hmm. It's gorgeous blended
with the coconut, you're right.

637
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:55,498
We've squeezed them a little bit
on time to get this done -
I mean, it is a challenge.

638
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:58,618
The most important thing is timing
in the oven

639
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:01,538
because they need to be just
golden-brown,

640
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,258
crunchy on the outside,

641
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:06,138
slightly chewy and sticky
in the middle.

642
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:08,418
The test is the colour.

643
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:10,098
Take it out when it looks like that.

644
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:11,858
I think there's nothing better.

645
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:13,578
It takes me back
to when I was a kid again.

646
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:15,179
Perfect with a great cup of tea.

647
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:20,338
First instruction -
make the mango curd.

648
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:22,658
I think it's a little bit mean.

649
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:25,299
Trying to refresh my memory
of how to make a curd.

650
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:29,218
So you've got mango puree in there,
caster sugar,

651
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:30,898
you've got one egg and two yolks.

652
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:33,538
Bit of lime juice
and a bit of unsalted butter.

653
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:36,778
And then very carefully cook it
over the gentle heat.

654
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:40,658
What I don't want is scrambled egg,
mango-flavoured scrambled egg.

655
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:43,299
Cos curd can take a little while
to thicken up.

656
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:46,698
Smells nice anyway.

657
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:48,778
Have you made macaroons before?

658
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,138
No, I've made macarons before,
but not macaroons.

659
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:52,578
They're a different food. Yes.

660
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:55,418
They've added an extra letter
and called it macaroons.

661
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:58,578
They have. Next year, people will
have to make macarooons

662
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:01,298
cos they're going to add
another letter to it.

663
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,099
My curd is starting to thicken.

664
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:07,178
It should be quite droopy,
but quite thick.

665
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:09,538
It's very important
that I do well in this challenge

666
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,378
so that's why I'm going to be
extra careful.

667
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:14,658
I think that's looking OK.

668
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:15,858
Let's add the butter.

669
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:18,778
If you add the cold butter
and then just keep whisking it in,

670
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,218
it should go really nice and silky
and smooth - I think.

671
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,499
Either that,
or I'm just talking out my arse.

672
00:30:25,099 --> 00:30:27,978
Oh, yeah, it's thickening nicely
now. That doesn't look too bad.

673
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:30,658
Mango curd has to chill.
Keep it chilled.

674
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:34,058
I'm trying to just cool it quickly
by putting it in the freezer.

675
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:37,378
My mango curd is in the fridge.

676
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:41,418
So, "Using the round cutter as a
guide, draw 12 circles on

677
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:43,978
"the rice paper
and then cut out the circles."

678
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:47,258
Is this rice paper? That rice paper
does look delicious, doesn't it?

679
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:50,498
I never tried that.
You can - yes, it's edibubble.

680
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:53,338
So far, so good -
I'm good at drawing circles.

681
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:56,058
I'm just waiting for my curd
to thicken a bit more.

682
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:57,418
It's still a little bit runny

683
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:00,338
and so I really need to crack on
with everything else.

684
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:02,818
Glasses on. I mean business.

685
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,658
Why is that? Hand shake?

686
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:06,298
Come on, spill the dirt.

687
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,618
How did it feel when Hollywood...

688
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:12,418
..his big sausagey fingers
gripped your pale...

689
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:15,058
Yeah... ET-like fingers?
Thanks, yeah.

690
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:18,138
How did it feel? I felt nothing.
Angry? I just felt very shocked.

691
00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:20,698
You felt nothing?! And like...
Cold, dead inside.

692
00:31:20,699 --> 00:31:23,378
No, I'm not dead inside - I just
went numb, I didn't know what

693
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:24,858
was happening.

694
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:27,738
That's it, that's the pivotal moment
in your baking career.

695
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:30,259
Yeah, that's it.
I've peaked, for sure.

696
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:35,018
"For the macaroons, tip the shredded
coconut into the food processor

697
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:37,378
"and blitz until the flakes
are small enough to pipe."

698
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:41,738
It's been very clear in the recipe
to not over-blitz the coconut,

699
00:31:41,739 --> 00:31:43,379
so trying to listen to that.

700
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:46,899
I think... Do you know? That'll do.

701
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:49,818
It's hard not to lose your nerve

702
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:52,099
when you look around,
and everyone else is miles ahead.

703
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:55,978
But I just was really worried
about leaving this curd for too

704
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:57,858
long, you know?
I'm going to go with that.

705
00:31:57,859 --> 00:32:01,698
"Add the almond extract, rice flour,
condensed milk, and pulse."

706
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:04,618
This is condensed milk.
Nice and sticky. I love this.

707
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:06,538
Could you drink that?
Oh, I've had it.

708
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:08,858
What, you've just drunk condensed
milk? Yeah, I have.

709
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:10,098
Really?! I love it.

710
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:11,539
I leave you in disgust.

711
00:32:12,939 --> 00:32:16,298
"Carefully fold whisked egg whites
into the coconut mixture."

712
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:19,418
It's just going to help raise
and keep them light.

713
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:23,058
So I guess it'll be kind
of like a meringuey, chewy texture.

714
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:25,579
Now... I think that is done.

715
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:29,938
Bakers, you are halfway through.

716
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:32,458
So basically you have 52½
minutes left.

717
00:32:32,459 --> 00:32:34,378
I'm running behind.

718
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:37,498
So at the minute, I'm just adding
the coconut. I think there was

719
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:39,858
time in the recipe
to make the curd properly

720
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:42,499
so I hope
that I haven't just wasted that!

721
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:46,858
"Spoon half of the mixture
into a piping bag fitted with

722
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:49,219
"a large STAR nozzle."

723
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:52,218
The mixture looks all right.

724
00:32:52,219 --> 00:32:54,778
Looks yummy. I kind of want to
just eat the batter as it is.

725
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,658
Hmm, I'd quite like a bit of rum
in there, I think, but... overall,

726
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,178
mmm, it's nice.

727
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:01,538
"Pipe a ring of coconut
around the edge of the rice paper

728
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:03,978
"and pipe a small
amount of mixture into the hole."

729
00:33:03,979 --> 00:33:06,698
So you're making a little dish,
really, for the curd.

730
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:09,458
I'm worried about how deep the hole
has to be in order to fit

731
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:11,018
a filling in.

732
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:13,299
It's quite pipeable,
so it's holding its shape.

733
00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:18,138
Come on, Laura, you know how to
pipe. I feel like mine's too thick.

734
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:20,978
I wonder whether I haven't made it
quite fine enough.

735
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:25,458
"For the remaining six macaroons,
place a spoonful of coconut

736
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:29,138
"mixture on the remaining discs,
and flatten."

737
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:33,818
"Place a square of chocolate into
the centre of each coconut circle."

738
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:38,818
Then I'm going to place
a spoon of the mixture over the top

739
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:40,458
and create a dome.

740
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:43,498
If you don't get that chocolate
covered up, it's going to start

741
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:46,658
running all out of it as it's
cooking, so I'm just trying to

742
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:49,338
make sure that it's all covered in
now.

743
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:52,418
I'm just trying to get them
as even as I possibly can.

744
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:54,058
Save some time now.

745
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:57,178
On the recipe, it tells us to bake.

746
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:58,818
Er, so...

747
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:00,298
Useful.

748
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,178
Going to pop those in the oven now.

749
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:04,778
I genuinely have no idea on timing.

750
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:07,058
It's on 130.

751
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:09,138
Gonna start with ten minutes.

752
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:12,778
Starting off with ten minutes,
and then I'll check them,
see how long they go.

753
00:34:12,779 --> 00:34:15,938
With how much time's left, it's
an indication that it's probably

754
00:34:15,939 --> 00:34:17,778
a longer bake
than what everyone reckons.

755
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:20,338
I reckon 25 minutes in the end.
OK, they've gone in.

756
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:22,899
30 minutes.
It's a low and slow cook.

757
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:25,818
I do feel a little bit
up against it.

758
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:28,178
These are probably going to take
20 minutes to bake as well,

759
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:30,178
so it just doesn't give me
an awful lot of time.

760
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,539
My curd better be good.

761
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:36,338
QUIETLY: Bakers,
you've got half an hour left.

762
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:37,659
Don't want to wake Matt up.

763
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:41,778
Half an hour.

764
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,818
Come on!

765
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:46,098
It's taking so long!

766
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:47,258
They're not even toasty.

767
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:49,698
They did say that they wanted
a nice golden top.

768
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,498
Mine aren't golden.

769
00:34:51,499 --> 00:34:54,339
I don't know, man. What is golden -
do you know what I mean?

770
00:34:55,299 --> 00:34:57,578
Golden can mean anything, really.

771
00:34:57,579 --> 00:34:59,458
I just don't know.

772
00:34:59,459 --> 00:35:02,739
These are not going to get
golden-brown, I don't think.

773
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:05,538
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy.

774
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:08,698
It's really intense, innit?
I find it strangely relaxing.

775
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:11,058
Do you? What, just
watching everyone else stress?

776
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:12,859
Seeing their dreams slide away.

777
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:18,938
Oh, God. I don't have any patience.

778
00:35:18,939 --> 00:35:21,258
Certainly not looking golden.

779
00:35:21,259 --> 00:35:23,698
But I think it'll take a really,
really long time to get golden.

780
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:27,058
What do you reckon? Least another
five more minutes, I think.

781
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:29,738
They're taking ages, actually.
Yeah, they are, aren't they?

782
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:32,098
A lot longer than
I was expecting them to cook. Mmm.

783
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:34,418
I think I shouldn't have
come down here - I don't know

784
00:35:34,419 --> 00:35:35,618
if I'm gonna be able to get back up.

785
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:37,458
That's what I think.

786
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:39,818
Ooh, my Lord!

787
00:35:39,819 --> 00:35:42,778
No, I'm all right. Might go in
with those. Let's have a look.

788
00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:44,499
I think maybe one minute longer.

789
00:35:46,419 --> 00:35:50,778
These are looking rustic, but not
too bad. I've got to get them cool.

790
00:35:50,779 --> 00:35:53,058
I might pull mine, you know.

791
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:55,058
So I'm going to get them out now.

792
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:57,378
They're nice and golden.

793
00:35:57,379 --> 00:35:58,738
Think I'm happy.

794
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,178
I don't know what they're
supposed to look like,

795
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:03,778
but I think they look all right.
Ooh, they look good!

796
00:36:03,779 --> 00:36:06,658
Now, these ones are quite a lot
larger than those ones.

797
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:08,058
They are. Was that intentional?

798
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:10,338
Well... no.

799
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:12,138
Right. You should've said yes.

800
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:13,458
Oh, we'll do it again.

801
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:15,858
So these ones are a little bit
larger than those ones,

802
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:18,738
is that intentional? Yes, they've
got chocolate inside.

803
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:21,018
Right. That's a good approach.

804
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:22,978
MATT CHUCKLES

805
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:24,858
I think the colour's looking good,

806
00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:27,218
but I just don't think
they're ready yet.

807
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:30,858
I think I'm at 28 minutes now.
I reckon a couple more minutes.

808
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:33,178
Yeah, just need five more minutes,
I'll be done.

809
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:35,218
Maybe they ARE ready.

810
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:36,738
How long have we got?

811
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:39,098
Bakers, you have five minutes

812
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:42,338
until we tell you
that you have ten minutes.

813
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:44,618
Matt! You have 15 minutes.

814
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,298
That was mean!

815
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:47,578
I'm bad.

816
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:50,378
Gonna give them a little bit longer.
What am I supposed to put in this?

817
00:36:50,379 --> 00:36:52,938
"Spoon a small amount of set curd
into the centre of each ring."

818
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:54,338
OK, set curd.

819
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:56,658
That's the sort of consistency
I would have

820
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:58,578
if I was making a lemon curd.

821
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:00,139
They're finally coming out.

822
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:04,018
Ow, ow, ow!

823
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:06,418
Dave's look rather sophisticated.

824
00:37:06,419 --> 00:37:07,778
Yeah, I like them.

825
00:37:07,779 --> 00:37:10,618
Does look as if the cat's had
a bit of an accident.

826
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:13,738
"To decorate the chocolate maroons,
pipe fine lines across them

827
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:15,778
"with melted chocolate."

828
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:18,258
That's what I'm going for,
nice and neat.

829
00:37:18,259 --> 00:37:21,298
Oh, THAT'S more like it!
Bit more freestyle.

830
00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:23,218
Just putting the mango curd
in the middle.

831
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:25,098
Ideally, I would want them
to be cool.

832
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:27,458
Cos I'm conscious
that I'm quite behind.

833
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:31,058
Bakers, it's basically too late now.
You've got one minute left.

834
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:33,338
Chocolate's seizing...

835
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:35,178
It's totally seized on me.

836
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:37,938
Have mine. Cheers,
you've totally saved me there.

837
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:40,219
There's not enough space
for all six.

838
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:46,098
Bakers, your time is up.

839
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,618
Well, I think they're beautiful.

840
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:49,899
You can see the influence
of fine French patisserie.

841
00:37:55,818 --> 00:37:56,618
Please bring your trays forward
to the front

842
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:58,977
and put them behind your photograph.

843
00:37:58,978 --> 00:38:01,257
Sura, hang back a little bit.

844
00:38:01,258 --> 00:38:02,138
I'm joking.

845
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:09,457
Prue and Paul are looking
for 12 uniform coconut macaroons,

846
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:12,537
six filled with mango curd
and six filled with chocolate,

847
00:38:12,538 --> 00:38:15,617
crispy on the outside
and chewy in the middle.

848
00:38:15,618 --> 00:38:18,777
So let's have a
look at the first one.

849
00:38:18,778 --> 00:38:21,537
I like things to be the same when
you're looking at the sizes. Yeah.

850
00:38:21,538 --> 00:38:23,017
They do look very similar.

851
00:38:23,018 --> 00:38:25,298
They maybe could've done
with a little bit longer.

852
00:38:27,018 --> 00:38:30,457
It's delicious, but not quite crisp
enough on the outside

853
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:32,137
and a bit too squashy.

854
00:38:32,138 --> 00:38:35,257
Mm. Let's just have a check
of that mango.

855
00:38:35,258 --> 00:38:38,297
It's not bad. I'd like to see more
of a ridge around there to create...

856
00:38:38,298 --> 00:38:40,657
A well... a little pond in
the middle, yeah.

857
00:38:40,658 --> 00:38:42,337
Let's move on to the second one,
shall we?

858
00:38:42,338 --> 00:38:44,097
The chocolate ones look
a bit untidy.

859
00:38:44,098 --> 00:38:45,497
And they're different sizes.

860
00:38:45,498 --> 00:38:48,018
I mean, that one's much smaller than
that one. Yeah.

861
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:53,137
Needed a little bit longer
those, actually.

862
00:38:53,138 --> 00:38:55,697
Now, I like this sort of decoration,
the lines.

863
00:38:55,698 --> 00:38:57,257
They're very different sizes.

864
00:38:57,258 --> 00:38:59,538
These ones are tiny
and these ones are big.

865
00:39:01,898 --> 00:39:04,537
Well, it does taste very good.

866
00:39:04,538 --> 00:39:06,537
Moving on, slightly underbaked.

867
00:39:06,538 --> 00:39:09,577
The piping's a little peculiar.
It is odd, isn't it?

868
00:39:09,578 --> 00:39:10,818
That one's a sort of squirt.

869
00:39:12,698 --> 00:39:15,017
Hm, it's too soft.

870
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:16,897
The coconut that's underneath
the mango

871
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:19,657
is almost like it went
into the oven. Yeah.

872
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:22,017
But moving on, I like this one
cos you've got

873
00:39:22,018 --> 00:39:24,497
a nice bit of caramelisation
as well from the coconut. Yeah.

874
00:39:24,498 --> 00:39:25,498
There you go.

875
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:27,737
It's delicious.

876
00:39:27,738 --> 00:39:29,657
Crispy on the outside
and soft in the middle.

877
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,257
Mango's tasty as well. OK, moving
on. Right.

878
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:33,657
I quite like these as well.

879
00:39:33,658 --> 00:39:35,697
They're uniform,
they're all the same size.

880
00:39:35,698 --> 00:39:39,017
Nice browning effect. Decent amount
of curd. Yeah.

881
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:41,337
That's got a good flavour.
Hm, curd's nice too.

882
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,178
It's a little liquid.

883
00:39:43,498 --> 00:39:44,857
And moving on.

884
00:39:44,858 --> 00:39:47,897
They're equal, bit small
and a bit undercooked as well.

885
00:39:47,898 --> 00:39:49,338
Yeah, definitely underbaked.

886
00:39:51,378 --> 00:39:53,777
It's lovely with the mango,
just needed longer in the oven.

887
00:39:53,778 --> 00:39:56,257
These are very neat.
I love these lines like that.

888
00:39:56,258 --> 00:39:57,738
It's well baked, that one, as well.

889
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:02,657
That's got lovely flavour.
The curd is perfect.

890
00:40:02,658 --> 00:40:05,937
It cuts, it doesn't just
flow. It's a really good one.

891
00:40:05,938 --> 00:40:07,617
This, again, is quite a decent one.

892
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:10,137
However, they over-blitzed
the mixture.

893
00:40:10,138 --> 00:40:12,657
Quite smooth.

894
00:40:12,658 --> 00:40:14,337
It's good. Hm.

895
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:15,937
Again, this one's well baked.

896
00:40:15,938 --> 00:40:18,217
Could do more of a wall.

897
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:19,498
They're a little bit hard.

898
00:40:24,098 --> 00:40:26,577
And quite chewy. Yeah.

899
00:40:26,578 --> 00:40:28,937
Moving on to the last one.
Neat, tidy, but underbaked.

900
00:40:28,938 --> 00:40:31,218
But it's the colour - you can see
how pale that is.

901
00:40:32,578 --> 00:40:34,218
Yeah, that's going to be
really squashy.

902
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,618
It's a shame cos that's neat,
that. Hm.

903
00:40:39,498 --> 00:40:42,497
Prue and Paul will now rank
the coconut macaroons

904
00:40:42,498 --> 00:40:44,217
from worst to best.

905
00:40:44,218 --> 00:40:46,497
In 11th place...

906
00:40:46,498 --> 00:40:47,698
..is this one.

907
00:40:49,298 --> 00:40:52,417
Rowan, bit underbaked,
not very good piping,

908
00:40:52,418 --> 00:40:53,577
little uneven.

909
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:55,897
And in tenth position
we have this one.

910
00:40:55,898 --> 00:40:57,057
Whose is this?

911
00:40:57,058 --> 00:40:58,898
Down to colour only, Peter.

912
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:02,417
In ninth place is this one.

913
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:06,177
This is a really common problem
of not baking it quite long enough.

914
00:41:06,178 --> 00:41:08,737
In eighth we have this one.
Whose is this?

915
00:41:08,738 --> 00:41:10,217
They were very, very small

916
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,537
and you needed a little bit
longer in the oven.

917
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:15,657
Laura's seventh, Sura's sixth,

918
00:41:15,658 --> 00:41:19,457
Hermine's fifth and Linda's fourth.

919
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:22,098
And in third place is this one.
Who's that?

920
00:41:23,378 --> 00:41:25,697
Mak, these were absolutely
excellent.

921
00:41:25,698 --> 00:41:26,737
Thank you.

922
00:41:26,738 --> 00:41:29,097
In second we have this one.

923
00:41:29,098 --> 00:41:33,057
Loads of texture, nice chocolate
on the top, spot on.

924
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:35,617
Which leaves...

925
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,697
..this one.

926
00:41:36,698 --> 00:41:41,017
Dave, really excellent macaroons -

927
00:41:41,018 --> 00:41:43,297
curd nice, even, perfect.

928
00:41:43,298 --> 00:41:44,178
Thank you.

929
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:49,857
Came first in technical.

930
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,217
What an improvement from ninth
last week.

931
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,097
It makes me feel more confident
going into tomorrow.

932
00:41:54,098 --> 00:41:55,817
Spring in the step
for the morning, yeah.

933
00:41:55,818 --> 00:41:58,457
I mean, it's a bit of a fall from
grace after this morning, isn't it?

934
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:00,897
And now I'm just
terrified for tomorrow.

935
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:03,257
I can't believe
what just happened, second.

936
00:42:03,258 --> 00:42:06,537
I was chaotic. I was running behind
everyone else,

937
00:42:06,538 --> 00:42:08,097
so I'm delighted.

938
00:42:08,098 --> 00:42:10,017
It wasn't my best moment.

939
00:42:10,018 --> 00:42:12,377
They did slightly
look like the cat's lavatory.

940
00:42:12,378 --> 00:42:15,377
I'm feeling much better after
that. I think I've clawed a bit back

941
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:16,857
from this morning,

942
00:42:16,858 --> 00:42:19,338
so it just gives me hope
for tomorrow.

943
00:42:28,293 --> 00:42:29,253
There's just the Showstopper
challenge left

944
00:42:29,254 --> 00:42:31,132
before Prue and Paul decide

945
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:35,453
who will be leaving the tent
and who's destined for star baker.

946
00:42:38,853 --> 00:42:40,852
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

947
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:42,772
It's time for your
Showstopper challenge.

948
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:46,812
Today, the judges would like you to
make a 3D biscuit table setting

949
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:49,812
from a memorable meal
you once had.

950
00:42:49,813 --> 00:42:52,612
They want you to sculpt
your biscuit dough

951
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:54,412
to make highly decorative

952
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:57,892
and realistic-looking biscuits that
deceive the eye into thinking

953
00:42:57,893 --> 00:43:01,452
they're teapots or cups or knives,
etc, you get my drift.

954
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,892
You can use any type of biscuits,
any flavours you want,

955
00:43:03,893 --> 00:43:05,932
but, remember, this is a Showstopper

956
00:43:05,933 --> 00:43:09,292
so it can't just look good -
it has to taste fantastic.

957
00:43:09,293 --> 00:43:13,252
You have 100,000 hours.

958
00:43:13,253 --> 00:43:15,972
Four. 400,000 hours.
Just four hours.

959
00:43:15,973 --> 00:43:17,412
Just four, you'll never make it.

960
00:43:17,413 --> 00:43:19,692
On your marks... Get set.

961
00:43:19,693 --> 00:43:20,573
Bake!

962
00:43:22,093 --> 00:43:23,572
I'm feeling really good.

963
00:43:23,573 --> 00:43:25,532
Just got to keep my cool.
I'm pumping, yeah.

964
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:27,132
Yeah, I'm feeling relaxed.

965
00:43:27,133 --> 00:43:28,652
I'm just going to enjoy it,
you know.

966
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:32,692
I have so much to do
and I am absolutely bricking it.

967
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,532
It's the Showstopper and we're
asking the bakers to complete

968
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:38,052
a dinner set, but it must be
moulded.

969
00:43:38,053 --> 00:43:40,492
Rather than having straight
biscuits,

970
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,332
I'd like to see something
that shows

971
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,772
they're utilising their biscuit to
shape round something,

972
00:43:44,773 --> 00:43:47,132
to mould, to sculpt.

973
00:43:47,133 --> 00:43:50,132
We want the bakers to use
their dough as a clay

974
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:53,252
to get this balance between
beautiful objects

975
00:43:53,253 --> 00:43:55,572
and delicious biscuits.

976
00:43:55,573 --> 00:43:58,052
The big issue the bakers are going
to have is almost

977
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:00,372
the volume of biscuit needed
to create the set.

978
00:44:00,373 --> 00:44:02,292
It's bulk, batch baking.

979
00:44:02,293 --> 00:44:03,653
It's not going to be easy.

980
00:44:05,013 --> 00:44:07,852
Rowan, how are you doing?
Are you all right?

981
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,252
Hello. So far, so good.

982
00:44:09,253 --> 00:44:11,692
Right, table setting - what are you
doing?

983
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:15,292
Table setting. I am doing
a 90th birthday breakfast tray

984
00:44:15,293 --> 00:44:16,852
for my great-aunt,

985
00:44:16,853 --> 00:44:20,572
so the chocolate pot is
in the form of a lighthouse. Right.

986
00:44:20,573 --> 00:44:22,932
Hopefully, with a flashing
light on top,

987
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:27,012
and then, there are a couple
of shell, uh, little, little plates.

988
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:30,092
Rowan's aiming high again with
a maritime masterpiece

989
00:44:30,093 --> 00:44:32,812
he's hoping will keep him
clear of disaster.

990
00:44:32,813 --> 00:44:35,652
His lemon biscuit lighthouse hot
chocolate pot will be adorned

991
00:44:35,653 --> 00:44:38,012
with Viennese biscuit sea creatures.

992
00:44:38,013 --> 00:44:39,532
Have you practised this?
I have.

993
00:44:39,533 --> 00:44:41,252
And have you done it in the time?
No.

994
00:44:41,253 --> 00:44:42,892
Brilliant.

995
00:44:42,893 --> 00:44:45,212
You WILL finish this challenge, OK?

996
00:44:45,213 --> 00:44:47,612
In four hours. I want to see
what you can do.

997
00:44:47,613 --> 00:44:49,332
And that's what's so frustrating.
I know.

998
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:52,172
Do you understand?
I know. I'll do my very best.

999
00:44:52,173 --> 00:44:53,932
I'm just adding my spices.

1000
00:44:53,933 --> 00:44:57,252
I'm going to just put an extra
little bit in for good luck. Ha-ha!

1001
00:44:57,253 --> 00:45:00,252
To create a Showstopper
that will wow the judges...

1002
00:45:00,253 --> 00:45:02,092
This is extra brute cocoa powder,

1003
00:45:02,093 --> 00:45:04,452
gives it more of a richer
chocolate taste.

1004
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:06,772
..not only must their biscuits be
packed with flavour...

1005
00:45:06,773 --> 00:45:08,212
So there's 20 tablespoons of coffee.

1006
00:45:08,213 --> 00:45:10,172
Keep me going till lunchtime.

1007
00:45:10,173 --> 00:45:12,932
..it's vital they're strong enough
to hold their shape.

1008
00:45:12,933 --> 00:45:15,452
Whenever someone says a moulded
biscuit

1009
00:45:15,453 --> 00:45:17,052
or a structure with biscuit,

1010
00:45:17,053 --> 00:45:18,892
everyone instantly jumps to
gingerbread,

1011
00:45:18,893 --> 00:45:21,252
so it's going to be tough to
stand out in the crowd today.

1012
00:45:21,253 --> 00:45:23,612
Peter's aiming to grab the judges'
attention

1013
00:45:23,613 --> 00:45:26,412
with a gingerbread haggis filled
with Scottish raspberry

1014
00:45:26,413 --> 00:45:27,852
and oat cranachan cream.

1015
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:29,292
It is Scotland on a plate.

1016
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,972
Scotland as a plate.

1017
00:45:30,973 --> 00:45:34,372
Mark's taken his inspiration
from much further afield.

1018
00:45:34,373 --> 00:45:37,332
My table setting is an Ethiopian
coffee ceremony.

1019
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:40,132
Yeah, I love it, every time
I'm in Ethiopia,

1020
00:45:40,133 --> 00:45:43,332
I have quite a lot of coffee, yeah,
I love coffee, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1021
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:46,252
Decorated with striking geometric
icing,

1022
00:45:46,253 --> 00:45:49,412
Mark's ceremonial coffee set
will be made of a cinnamon

1023
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,492
and coffee dough, darkened with
edible charcoal powder.

1024
00:45:52,493 --> 00:45:54,972
This is where it gets messy.

1025
00:45:54,973 --> 00:45:57,692
And this, this recipe
suits me quite well

1026
00:45:57,693 --> 00:45:58,932
because I am a messy baker

1027
00:45:58,933 --> 00:46:01,292
so it feels quite nice to get
stuck into something.

1028
00:46:01,293 --> 00:46:04,132
But he's not the only baker
opting for a dark dough.

1029
00:46:04,133 --> 00:46:07,172
I am making a Viking table setting.

1030
00:46:07,173 --> 00:46:10,252
Vikings are just so cool,
they're just so badass.

1031
00:46:10,253 --> 00:46:12,132
Lottie's creating a charcoal

1032
00:46:12,133 --> 00:46:14,732
and gingerbread dining set
fit for Valhalla -

1033
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:17,052
the great hall in Norse mythology

1034
00:46:17,053 --> 00:46:20,372
where heroes slain in battle are
welcomed into the afterlife.

1035
00:46:20,373 --> 00:46:22,772
Are you a Viking,
are you from Viking...? Secretly.

1036
00:46:22,773 --> 00:46:25,172
No. No? I'm really not.
I'm 98% British.

1037
00:46:25,173 --> 00:46:27,492
It's very upsetting and boring.

1038
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,612
If you mess this up, you won't
get into Valhalla, you know that?

1039
00:46:30,613 --> 00:46:32,212
And that's what worries me the most.

1040
00:46:32,213 --> 00:46:35,172
Well, let's see if we can open
the gates of Valhalla later, then.

1041
00:46:35,173 --> 00:46:37,172
The shaping is really
important in this.

1042
00:46:37,173 --> 00:46:38,772
It needs to look realistic

1043
00:46:38,773 --> 00:46:41,252
and not like
a five-year-old's done it,

1044
00:46:41,253 --> 00:46:43,612
which, I'm not going to lie,
is a kind of a challenge.

1045
00:46:43,613 --> 00:46:46,852
Sculpting biscuit dough will not
only test the bakers' creativity...

1046
00:46:46,853 --> 00:46:49,212
This is the thing that stresses me
out the most.

1047
00:46:49,213 --> 00:46:51,892
..but will push their technical
know-how to the limit.

1048
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:54,252
So all these are just going to
stay in its mould,

1049
00:46:54,253 --> 00:46:55,692
and then, hopefully,
when it's baked,

1050
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:57,332
it should release straight away.

1051
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:58,892
Not only is it tricky to shape,

1052
00:46:58,893 --> 00:47:01,452
but can easily become tough
if overworked.

1053
00:47:01,453 --> 00:47:04,492
This is the lighthouse
so I have found,

1054
00:47:04,493 --> 00:47:05,812
if you foil it first,

1055
00:47:05,813 --> 00:47:07,852
it'll hopefully hold it all
together.

1056
00:47:07,853 --> 00:47:10,412
This definitely goes
way beyond baking knowledge

1057
00:47:10,413 --> 00:47:13,292
and takes you into the realms of
how to be a potter.

1058
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:16,012
While most bakers are shaping,
then baking,

1059
00:47:16,013 --> 00:47:18,612
Mak is taking a unique approach.

1060
00:47:18,613 --> 00:47:20,372
I'm not going to be using moulds.

1061
00:47:20,373 --> 00:47:22,292
So that's interesting.

1062
00:47:22,293 --> 00:47:24,612
So, instead of moulding your
biscuit,

1063
00:47:24,613 --> 00:47:26,412
you are making all the pieces flat

1064
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:28,052
so they'll be like hexagonal.

1065
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,372
Well, square-shaped.

1066
00:47:30,373 --> 00:47:35,172
Mak's using flat-pack to create
an Art Deco-style chai tea set

1067
00:47:35,173 --> 00:47:37,652
with oblong tea pot and cuboid cups.

1068
00:47:37,653 --> 00:47:39,092
How have you got on in practice?

1069
00:47:39,093 --> 00:47:41,452
To be quite honest with you,
I have struggled.

1070
00:47:41,453 --> 00:47:43,772
That's why I've actually pared
it down somewhat

1071
00:47:43,773 --> 00:47:45,092
in the final bake.

1072
00:47:45,093 --> 00:47:47,572
Well, it's better to do something
which you can achieve.

1073
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,732
That's right, yes.

1074
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:53,092
In contrast, Dave's aiming to
conjure up some magical curves.

1075
00:47:53,093 --> 00:47:54,532
An Aladdin's saucer.

1076
00:47:54,533 --> 00:47:57,012
So they're going to look very
similar to that.

1077
00:47:57,013 --> 00:47:59,372
If I rub them,
I'd wish for star baker.

1078
00:47:59,373 --> 00:48:02,172
Taking his inspiration from a trip
to Mexico,

1079
00:48:02,173 --> 00:48:04,492
Dave's coffee jugs will be part of

1080
00:48:04,493 --> 00:48:06,852
a chocolate and coffee flavour table
setting,

1081
00:48:06,853 --> 00:48:09,492
decorated with the colours
of the Mexican flag.

1082
00:48:09,493 --> 00:48:12,092
Got to have the flavour there,
but high detail, I think,

1083
00:48:12,093 --> 00:48:13,692
what they're after as well,

1084
00:48:13,693 --> 00:48:16,012
so, if I keep my cool,
should be good.

1085
00:48:16,013 --> 00:48:17,732
We are actually going in.

1086
00:48:17,733 --> 00:48:19,372
Getting the larger pieces
into the oven

1087
00:48:19,373 --> 00:48:21,092
as quickly as possible is vital...

1088
00:48:21,093 --> 00:48:23,372
One down, two to go.

1089
00:48:23,373 --> 00:48:25,452
..to give the bakers time to prepare

1090
00:48:25,453 --> 00:48:27,412
the multitude of smaller
biscuit bakes.

1091
00:48:27,413 --> 00:48:28,812
This is the brandy snap.

1092
00:48:28,813 --> 00:48:30,252
Looks super healthy, doesn't it?

1093
00:48:30,253 --> 00:48:32,172
I've got this embossing mat.

1094
00:48:32,173 --> 00:48:35,492
It just gives a really lovely lacy
detail to the biscuit.

1095
00:48:35,493 --> 00:48:38,492
Just lift it up
and gently place it in the middle.

1096
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:40,172
Try to keep it as neat as you can.

1097
00:48:40,173 --> 00:48:41,972
This is the amaretti biscuit.

1098
00:48:41,973 --> 00:48:44,292
Want it to look like a woven
sort of, uh, place mat.

1099
00:48:44,293 --> 00:48:46,012
These are delicious biscuits.

1100
00:48:46,013 --> 00:48:48,372
They've got cinnamon, nutmeg,
ginger

1101
00:48:48,373 --> 00:48:50,732
and black pepper,
so they are amazing.

1102
00:48:50,733 --> 00:48:53,252
Sura's Ramadan tea set will be
made from

1103
00:48:53,253 --> 00:48:55,572
a Dutch-style speculaas biscuit,

1104
00:48:55,573 --> 00:48:59,052
each piece elaborately decorated
with intricate patterns.

1105
00:48:59,053 --> 00:49:01,972
During Ramadan,
we always have people over.

1106
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:05,252
You break your fast, after that,
you sit down for tea

1107
00:49:05,253 --> 00:49:08,532
and that's what it's
based around - that social vibe.

1108
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:12,572
However, favouring a more solitary
dining experience is Marc.

1109
00:49:12,573 --> 00:49:15,572
This is the mug,
knife and spoon and plate.

1110
00:49:15,573 --> 00:49:19,052
Just a basic breakfast
tea set for one.

1111
00:49:19,053 --> 00:49:21,892
Marc will use his experience
as a sculptor

1112
00:49:21,893 --> 00:49:24,612
to fashion
his spiced ginger biscuit set,

1113
00:49:24,613 --> 00:49:26,652
complete with toast rack and toast.

1114
00:49:26,653 --> 00:49:29,492
I've worked with woods
and metals for most of my life.

1115
00:49:29,493 --> 00:49:31,932
It's a bit different
making something out of biscuit.

1116
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:33,652
Right. Press on.

1117
00:49:33,653 --> 00:49:35,132
Are they ready to come now?

1118
00:49:35,133 --> 00:49:36,452
Yeah, they're looking good.

1119
00:49:36,453 --> 00:49:39,212
Got to keep my eye on stuff, lots of
different things going on at once.

1120
00:49:39,213 --> 00:49:41,092
This is my haggis biscuit.

1121
00:49:41,093 --> 00:49:45,132
It's still a bit bumpy, but it is
a sheep's stomach after all.

1122
00:49:45,133 --> 00:49:47,692
How does it look?
Rustic, rustic's all right.

1123
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:50,212
Before it cools down complete,
I need to make my shapes.

1124
00:49:50,213 --> 00:49:51,812
They're looking OK, I think, yeah,

1125
00:49:51,813 --> 00:49:53,692
as long as it keeps going OK,
I'll be all right.

1126
00:49:53,693 --> 00:49:54,772
I'm happy with them.

1127
00:49:54,773 --> 00:49:56,692
I'll be decorating it
in some colourful icing.

1128
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:59,292
Colourful icing? That was vague...
Yeah... which is good.

1129
00:49:59,293 --> 00:50:00,732
Then, if you don't get it all done,

1130
00:50:00,733 --> 00:50:03,132
you'll say, "Well, I was only
supposed to do one blob there,

1131
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,932
"a nipple there and a nipple there."
Exactly. They are like breasts.

1132
00:50:05,933 --> 00:50:07,932
They are, aren't they?
There's no denying that.

1133
00:50:07,933 --> 00:50:09,652
Just going to get the next
things in now.

1134
00:50:09,653 --> 00:50:12,652
To create all the elements for their
complex biscuit constructions...

1135
00:50:12,653 --> 00:50:14,132
Right, going in.

1136
00:50:14,133 --> 00:50:17,012
..the bakers must manage
numerous batches...

1137
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:19,412
That's the trencher
that my haggis is going to sit on.

1138
00:50:19,413 --> 00:50:22,412
..if they are to stand any chance
of finishing on time.

1139
00:50:22,413 --> 00:50:23,812
They've come out nice.

1140
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:25,532
You've got to be so careful

1141
00:50:25,533 --> 00:50:27,892
because they split very, very
easily.

1142
00:50:27,893 --> 00:50:30,212
It's a very, very delicate biscuit.

1143
00:50:30,213 --> 00:50:33,812
Inspired by a high tea
she once had in Amsterdam,

1144
00:50:33,813 --> 00:50:36,692
Linda's one of the few bakers
swerving sturdy gingerbread,

1145
00:50:36,693 --> 00:50:40,052
gambling instead on a delicate
rose water shortbread.

1146
00:50:40,053 --> 00:50:41,532
Everything you make is going to be

1147
00:50:41,533 --> 00:50:43,892
out of this very fragile
short biscuit.

1148
00:50:43,893 --> 00:50:47,292
Oh, OK. I think that's quite brave.
It is very brave.

1149
00:50:47,293 --> 00:50:49,092
It's Bake Off,
you've got to be brave.

1150
00:50:49,093 --> 00:50:51,052
Yeah, absolutely.
Go for it.

1151
00:50:51,053 --> 00:50:52,892
Oh, God, I've got to unmould it.

1152
00:50:52,893 --> 00:50:56,372
I just need to ease
it into the plate.

1153
00:50:56,373 --> 00:50:59,332
I don't want to be giving them
a flat disc.

1154
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:01,772
The bakers now face
the critical task

1155
00:51:01,773 --> 00:51:04,772
of separating the delicate biscuit
from the mould.

1156
00:51:04,773 --> 00:51:07,412
If this does break, I can stick it
back together badly

1157
00:51:07,413 --> 00:51:10,132
with caramel, but I don't have time
to faff about with it.

1158
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,732
They only get one chance.

1159
00:51:11,733 --> 00:51:13,572
I just want to get this out.

1160
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:17,172
If the biscuits shatter,
so will their Showstopper dreams.

1161
00:51:17,173 --> 00:51:20,452
Collateral damage.
That's why I made extras.

1162
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:22,732
I might well cry if this breaks.

1163
00:51:22,733 --> 00:51:24,253
Oh, for goodness' sake.

1164
00:51:25,693 --> 00:51:27,413
Oh, no!

1165
00:51:28,573 --> 00:51:30,452
Broken there slightly.

1166
00:51:30,453 --> 00:51:31,853
This is very delicate.

1167
00:51:32,813 --> 00:51:34,413
Hardly dare breathe.

1168
00:51:36,653 --> 00:51:38,692
Oh.

1169
00:51:38,693 --> 00:51:42,212
I may have just overbaked it
by a minute or so.

1170
00:51:42,213 --> 00:51:44,453
There's no way this is happening.

1171
00:51:50,867 --> 00:51:51,227
Bakers, you have 200,000 hours left.

1172
00:51:51,228 --> 00:51:52,506
Time is ticking.

1173
00:51:52,507 --> 00:51:54,466
Two hours, bakers.
You're halfway through.

1174
00:51:54,467 --> 00:51:56,146
200,000 hours.

1175
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:58,066
Can't believe that we've been
two hours already.

1176
00:51:58,067 --> 00:51:59,106
I'm going to let that cool.

1177
00:51:59,107 --> 00:52:01,026
It has a bit of a shape to it.

1178
00:52:01,027 --> 00:52:02,027
Oh, thank BLEEP.

1179
00:52:03,627 --> 00:52:04,866
Let's get this tuile out.

1180
00:52:04,867 --> 00:52:06,266
That looks done to me.

1181
00:52:06,267 --> 00:52:08,586
I just want to put it somewhere safe
now I've made the thing.

1182
00:52:08,587 --> 00:52:10,466
That's my Amaretti place mat.

1183
00:52:10,467 --> 00:52:13,266
As it cools, that'll go really nice
and crunchy.

1184
00:52:13,267 --> 00:52:15,546
These are done. Perfection actually.

1185
00:52:15,547 --> 00:52:17,026
See how they've cracked at the top?

1186
00:52:17,027 --> 00:52:18,386
Happy with that.

1187
00:52:18,387 --> 00:52:20,746
Almost good enough to eat.

1188
00:52:20,747 --> 00:52:22,386
It's my last one going in.

1189
00:52:22,387 --> 00:52:24,946
I had hoped to be finished
all my baking by now,

1190
00:52:24,947 --> 00:52:26,706
but I've still got a couple of
things to finish.

1191
00:52:26,707 --> 00:52:28,586
I'm terrified, to be honest with
you,

1192
00:52:28,587 --> 00:52:30,586
because I've completely lost
track of what I'm doing.

1193
00:52:30,587 --> 00:52:32,546
All I know is that I've got
half a boat there.

1194
00:52:32,547 --> 00:52:34,387
Yeah, I've got so much to do.

1195
00:52:35,547 --> 00:52:37,866
I'm in a good place right now,
I think.

1196
00:52:37,867 --> 00:52:40,186
I'm making a three-tier cake stand

1197
00:52:40,187 --> 00:52:42,546
and I'm trying to replicate an
afternoon tea

1198
00:52:42,547 --> 00:52:45,346
that I had for my lovely
nan's 80th birthday.

1199
00:52:45,347 --> 00:52:48,986
Keen to do justice to the family
celebration, Laura's gingerbread

1200
00:52:48,987 --> 00:52:52,906
and brandy snap bake comes with
an extra sprinkle of commitment.

1201
00:52:52,907 --> 00:52:55,946
I've probably practised 15 times
in total.

1202
00:52:55,947 --> 00:52:58,746
I've changed the recipe,
I've changed the design.

1203
00:52:58,747 --> 00:53:00,706
I just really hope it tastes nice.

1204
00:53:00,707 --> 00:53:04,546
But Laura's got stiff competition
when it comes to tea time.

1205
00:53:04,547 --> 00:53:07,586
Sugar lace, I'm going to use for my
tea canister.

1206
00:53:07,587 --> 00:53:11,106
It's a show stopper so one needs to
be ambitious.

1207
00:53:11,107 --> 00:53:16,026
Hermine's creating a Japanese-style
tea set also in gingerbread,

1208
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:18,746
adorned with hand-painted flowers
and cherry blossom.

1209
00:53:18,747 --> 00:53:21,746
Hermine said earlier she enjoys my,
er, comedy shows.

1210
00:53:21,747 --> 00:53:24,987
Do you enjoy Noel's comedy shows or
are you not quite sure who he is?

1211
00:53:26,307 --> 00:53:28,106
I didn't know Noel did comedy.

1212
00:53:28,107 --> 00:53:29,187
Ooh!

1213
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:32,426
Well, I'm being honest!

1214
00:53:32,427 --> 00:53:35,627
Noel is one of Britain's most
popular children's entertainers.

1215
00:53:37,187 --> 00:53:38,906
This is my last bit.

1216
00:53:38,907 --> 00:53:40,626
That's my baking done.

1217
00:53:40,627 --> 00:53:43,226
Turning the oven off, that feels
really, really great.

1218
00:53:43,227 --> 00:53:45,106
As their biscuits cool, the bakers

1219
00:53:45,107 --> 00:53:47,466
can turn their attention to
decorations.

1220
00:53:47,467 --> 00:53:48,986
So I'm just prepping up
the egg glaze now,

1221
00:53:48,987 --> 00:53:50,866
so it will give that terracotta
look, yeah.

1222
00:53:50,867 --> 00:53:53,306
I've made my own fondant
out of marshmallows.

1223
00:53:53,307 --> 00:53:55,746
I don't normally say this,
but I think that is spot on.

1224
00:53:55,747 --> 00:53:58,626
In here, I've got some oatmeal,
whipped cream, raspberries,

1225
00:53:58,627 --> 00:54:01,386
honey, whisky and that's going to
be my cranachan cream filling.

1226
00:54:01,387 --> 00:54:02,466
It's good.

1227
00:54:02,467 --> 00:54:05,786
I'm making a really soft-set jam.
I want it to look like blood.

1228
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:07,106
Um, bit dark.

1229
00:54:07,107 --> 00:54:08,266
How long have we got left?

1230
00:54:08,267 --> 00:54:09,746
Bakers!
ECHOES: Bakers, bakers!

1231
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,666
You... You, you...
..have... have, have...

1232
00:54:11,667 --> 00:54:14,026
..one... one, one...
..hour... hour, hour...

1233
00:54:14,027 --> 00:54:17,186
..left, left, left, left, left.
..left, left, left, left, left.

1234
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,666
Very echoey in here, isn't it?

1235
00:54:18,667 --> 00:54:20,146
That's my basic tea pot.

1236
00:54:20,147 --> 00:54:23,506
So if somebody can just hold
it like that all the way through.

1237
00:54:23,507 --> 00:54:25,866
This is the glue that's going to
glue everything together.

1238
00:54:25,867 --> 00:54:28,226
I think the bakers this
year are very, very talented,

1239
00:54:28,227 --> 00:54:30,666
but, actually, I think it's quite a
tricky challenge.

1240
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,626
It is. What I like is the theme.

1241
00:54:32,627 --> 00:54:36,986
We've got a Ramadan tea
and we've got a Valhalla Viking.

1242
00:54:36,987 --> 00:54:38,306
If it sticks, great.

1243
00:54:38,307 --> 00:54:39,426
Ugh!

1244
00:54:39,427 --> 00:54:40,546
Ethiopian.

1245
00:54:40,547 --> 00:54:41,666
Ethiopian one.

1246
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:43,986
I hope they don't say
they can't taste the coffee.

1247
00:54:43,987 --> 00:54:45,786
Viennese lighthouse.

1248
00:54:45,787 --> 00:54:48,546
Slightly ragged at the bottom,
but I'll trim it afterwards.

1249
00:54:48,547 --> 00:54:49,786
They are very imaginative.

1250
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:50,826
It's nice, isn't it?

1251
00:54:50,827 --> 00:54:51,827
I made a spoon.

1252
00:54:54,827 --> 00:54:56,506
No spoons today.

1253
00:54:56,507 --> 00:54:58,866
A lot rides on this for a few
people.

1254
00:54:58,867 --> 00:55:00,346
I'd like to see them all finish on
time.

1255
00:55:00,347 --> 00:55:02,706
I'm currently running
six minutes over.

1256
00:55:02,707 --> 00:55:05,066
Yeah, this is tight. Like, every
minute counts.

1257
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:07,986
I'm just hoping I haven't given
myself vastly too much to do,

1258
00:55:07,987 --> 00:55:10,786
to go as fast as I can without
panicking.

1259
00:55:10,787 --> 00:55:13,146
Bakers, you have half an hour left!

1260
00:55:13,147 --> 00:55:15,506
This is going to be a tight finish.

1261
00:55:15,507 --> 00:55:18,946
Just want to curl up in a ball
and die quietly.

1262
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:21,386
I've got to decorate everything.

1263
00:55:21,387 --> 00:55:22,666
It's not really on right.

1264
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:24,146
Ugh!

1265
00:55:24,147 --> 00:55:26,506
It's about getting this angle right.

1266
00:55:26,507 --> 00:55:28,386
Caramel, it's very
difficult to work with.

1267
00:55:28,387 --> 00:55:31,706
It sticks really quick and if you've
not got it right, it ruins it.

1268
00:55:31,707 --> 00:55:34,866
Argh! Look at this.
I need to wash my hands.

1269
00:55:34,867 --> 00:55:35,906
HE EXHALES

1270
00:55:35,907 --> 00:55:37,506
Do you know what? It's not perfect,

1271
00:55:37,507 --> 00:55:40,266
but, at this stage, it's the best
I can do.

1272
00:55:40,267 --> 00:55:43,066
I'm just airbrushing a little
bit of silver on them now to try

1273
00:55:43,067 --> 00:55:44,906
and build colour bit by bit.

1274
00:55:44,907 --> 00:55:46,386
The colour's the most important
thing

1275
00:55:46,387 --> 00:55:48,706
cos Mexico is very vibrant and
colourful.

1276
00:55:48,707 --> 00:55:51,466
Putting some royal icing on my cups.

1277
00:55:51,467 --> 00:55:54,066
Green is the colour of the tea set I
was given.

1278
00:55:54,067 --> 00:55:55,946
This is royal icing.

1279
00:55:55,947 --> 00:55:57,426
It dries very quickly.

1280
00:55:57,427 --> 00:55:59,306
This is meant to be rough,
by the way.

1281
00:55:59,307 --> 00:56:00,466
I'm not happy with this,

1282
00:56:00,467 --> 00:56:01,906
I've gone for a terracotta,

1283
00:56:01,907 --> 00:56:04,266
but it's looking like a pinky orange
from here.

1284
00:56:04,267 --> 00:56:06,826
I love this. This is my favourite
part.

1285
00:56:06,827 --> 00:56:09,546
This could be it, this could be your
challenge. I hope so.

1286
00:56:09,547 --> 00:56:12,266
It depends what it tastes like,
though, Noel, doesn't it, really?

1287
00:56:12,267 --> 00:56:13,826
SHE EXHALES

1288
00:56:13,827 --> 00:56:15,106
And breathe.

1289
00:56:15,107 --> 00:56:17,466
Let's just decorate what I've got.

1290
00:56:17,467 --> 00:56:19,226
I'm rushing. Hate this.

1291
00:56:19,227 --> 00:56:20,866
Stop my hand from shaking. Come on.

1292
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:22,466
And no, I'm not working to a design.

1293
00:56:22,467 --> 00:56:24,826
I have no design. I don't know
what I'm doing, if I'm honest.

1294
00:56:24,827 --> 00:56:28,666
Hopefully I can put a bit of
fondant rim on it once it dries.

1295
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:30,987
I'm doing a semi-flood on this
biscuit.

1296
00:56:32,387 --> 00:56:35,386
Oh, it's cracked. It's definitely
been in a storm, this pot.

1297
00:56:35,387 --> 00:56:38,106
It's getting more and more rustic by
the moment.

1298
00:56:38,107 --> 00:56:39,346
That's good.

1299
00:56:39,347 --> 00:56:40,586
Let's try and work a bit quicker.

1300
00:56:40,587 --> 00:56:42,506
Just got the red dots to
put in the middle.

1301
00:56:42,507 --> 00:56:44,226
Attention to detail.

1302
00:56:44,227 --> 00:56:47,226
I enjoy the finishing touch,
make it look pretty.

1303
00:56:47,227 --> 00:56:48,706
I've literally had to say in my head

1304
00:56:48,707 --> 00:56:51,026
"Green, white, red,
green, white, red."

1305
00:56:51,027 --> 00:56:52,626
The spout was always a risky part.

1306
00:56:52,627 --> 00:56:54,986
Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear,
dear, dear, dear, dear.

1307
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:56,946
Honestly, this looks like a child's
done it.

1308
00:56:56,947 --> 00:56:59,426
This is the most stressed I've ever
seen you. Yeah, yeah, it...

1309
00:56:59,427 --> 00:57:01,306
Shall I go? Yeah, could you?

1310
00:57:01,307 --> 00:57:02,586
Is that what you're trying to say?

1311
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:04,426
Just be blunt with me,
I'm quite thick-skinned.

1312
00:57:04,427 --> 00:57:06,226
I'm ready... I'm ready for you to
leave now, Noel.

1313
00:57:06,227 --> 00:57:07,466
You're just in the way.

1314
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:08,666
HE LAUGHS

1315
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:10,626
I'll get that on my CV.

1316
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,266
"You're just in the way."

1317
00:57:12,267 --> 00:57:15,506
The tea pot is so gaudy they're
going to say, "This is disgusting."

1318
00:57:15,507 --> 00:57:17,346
Right, come on, last push.

1319
00:57:17,347 --> 00:57:18,946
That's my structure.

1320
00:57:18,947 --> 00:57:22,506
This is my tea pot. Very delicate.

1321
00:57:22,507 --> 00:57:23,946
They look quite square.

1322
00:57:23,947 --> 00:57:25,106
They are square.

1323
00:57:25,107 --> 00:57:26,666
Square tea cups? Yes.

1324
00:57:26,667 --> 00:57:28,386
Is the tea square?

1325
00:57:28,387 --> 00:57:30,186
No, actually, it's sort of a
loose-leaf.

1326
00:57:30,187 --> 00:57:32,466
OK, that feels fairly robust.

1327
00:57:32,467 --> 00:57:33,546
Fingers crossed.

1328
00:57:33,547 --> 00:57:36,546
I need to fill my haggis with some
cranachan and that'll be me.

1329
00:57:36,547 --> 00:57:37,987
They're all done now.

1330
00:57:39,347 --> 00:57:40,786
I know it's not brilliant.

1331
00:57:40,787 --> 00:57:43,106
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1332
00:57:43,107 --> 00:57:45,426
What can we do in one minute with
a bit of gold leaf?

1333
00:57:45,427 --> 00:57:46,627
Just shaking so much.

1334
00:57:58,507 --> 00:58:00,107
Oh, my God, is time about to be up?

1335
00:58:01,387 --> 00:58:03,866
Bakers, your time is up.

1336
00:58:03,867 --> 00:58:05,626
SHE EXHALES

1337
00:58:05,627 --> 00:58:07,946
I think that'll do.

1338
00:58:07,947 --> 00:58:10,946
God, the pressure in this tent,
doing that.

1339
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:12,706
Super happy. That went really well.

1340
00:58:12,707 --> 00:58:15,147
I think Paul will be pleased
it's largely finished.

1341
00:58:21,022 --> 00:58:25,421
It's judgement time for the
bakers' show stoppers.

1342
00:58:25,422 --> 00:58:28,982
Rowan, would you like to bring
up your show stopper, please?

1343
00:58:30,462 --> 00:58:33,382
I'm calling this
Worse Things Happen At Sea.

1344
00:58:35,062 --> 00:58:37,341
We did get your flashing lighthouse.

1345
00:58:37,342 --> 00:58:38,941
You get the flashing lighthouse.

1346
00:58:38,942 --> 00:58:40,541
Yeah, it does look like a
lighthouse.

1347
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:42,861
It does look a bit smaller
than a lighthouse.

1348
00:58:42,862 --> 00:58:44,661
Little bit smaller. Yeah.

1349
00:58:44,662 --> 00:58:46,261
Is this gingerbread?

1350
00:58:46,262 --> 00:58:48,061
It's all a lemon...

1351
00:58:48,062 --> 00:58:49,342
Biscuit.

1352
00:58:53,902 --> 00:58:55,661
Lovely flavour.

1353
00:58:55,662 --> 00:58:57,221
That's been worked so much.

1354
00:58:57,222 --> 00:58:58,861
It's too thick. Tastes like rubber,

1355
00:58:58,862 --> 00:59:01,341
which is a shame cos actually
the flavour's not bad.

1356
00:59:01,342 --> 00:59:04,021
I sort of feel it's not your best,
Rowan.

1357
00:59:04,022 --> 00:59:05,501
I know you can do more.

1358
00:59:05,502 --> 00:59:07,342
It's a bit disappointing.

1359
00:59:09,982 --> 00:59:12,341
It's got a bit of a
Roger Hargreaves vibe.

1360
00:59:12,342 --> 00:59:14,181
Yeah. It looks brilliant.

1361
00:59:14,182 --> 00:59:17,781
The toast, the rack, the knife,
the way that you've done

1362
00:59:17,782 --> 00:59:19,701
the buttercream and that,
it just looks great.

1363
00:59:19,702 --> 00:59:20,702
Thank you very much.

1364
00:59:23,502 --> 00:59:27,181
Because it's thick, which it needed
to be for the middle of the toast,

1365
00:59:27,182 --> 00:59:28,981
it's a bit squishy in the middle.

1366
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,701
Sure, OK. But I rather like that.

1367
00:59:30,702 --> 00:59:33,101
Overall, I think you've done
an amazing job. Thank you.

1368
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,102
Thank you very much.

1369
00:59:35,662 --> 00:59:38,101
They're a little bit clumsy,
but they're all uniform

1370
00:59:38,102 --> 00:59:40,461
and I do like the colour
on the outside.

1371
00:59:40,462 --> 00:59:42,781
It's beautifully done. Almost looks
as if you sprayed it on.

1372
00:59:42,782 --> 00:59:43,542
Thank you.

1373
00:59:45,622 --> 00:59:47,541
I'm not convinced on the flavour.

1374
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,341
It's all quite bitter, isn't it?

1375
00:59:49,342 --> 00:59:51,622
See, it's got to taste good
as well as look good.

1376
00:59:55,142 --> 00:59:58,821
Underneath this is a stand, which
you've just put this on the top of.

1377
00:59:58,822 --> 01:00:02,102
I'm not convinced that that's had a
lot of work in it.

1378
01:00:04,342 --> 01:00:05,741
That's a lovely flavour.

1379
01:00:05,742 --> 01:00:07,341
The flavour of the biscuit's
quite nice -

1380
01:00:07,342 --> 01:00:09,861
it's got a nice kick to
it as well from the spices -

1381
01:00:09,862 --> 01:00:13,782
but in four hours, we wanted
something a little bit neater.

1382
01:00:16,182 --> 01:00:18,501
You've certainly made it
very pretty.

1383
01:00:18,502 --> 01:00:20,742
It really is extremely well done.

1384
01:00:22,622 --> 01:00:25,741
The biscuit itself has been worked
a little bit too much

1385
01:00:25,742 --> 01:00:27,381
so the texture's not quite there.

1386
01:00:27,382 --> 01:00:29,941
It was always going to be an issue
if you go with a shortbread,

1387
01:00:29,942 --> 01:00:32,222
but I think the design is
very, very pretty.

1388
01:00:33,782 --> 01:00:35,501
It certainly looks very African.

1389
01:00:35,502 --> 01:00:37,382
Scruffy, but it looks the part.

1390
01:00:41,822 --> 01:00:43,341
SHE COUGHS

1391
01:00:43,342 --> 01:00:44,661
LAUGHTER

1392
01:00:44,662 --> 01:00:45,981
Strong, innit?

1393
01:00:45,982 --> 01:00:48,341
It's lovely.
Very strong coffee flavour.

1394
01:00:48,342 --> 01:00:50,661
I really like that flavour,
don't you? Hmm.

1395
01:00:50,662 --> 01:00:51,901
You didn't like it before.

1396
01:00:51,902 --> 01:00:53,502
You'll be awake all night, Paul.

1397
01:00:55,262 --> 01:00:56,501
I love the colours.

1398
01:00:56,502 --> 01:00:58,181
It's so Mexican, isn't it?

1399
01:00:58,182 --> 01:00:59,421
Yeah. It's beautiful.

1400
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:01,341
That is remarkable.

1401
01:01:01,342 --> 01:01:04,101
We were looking for form
and shaping and moulding,

1402
01:01:04,102 --> 01:01:05,941
and I think you've done an amazing
job. Thank you.

1403
01:01:05,942 --> 01:01:07,422
It's very believable.

1404
01:01:10,862 --> 01:01:11,941
That is lovely.

1405
01:01:11,942 --> 01:01:14,221
Thank you. Mm. Mm.

1406
01:01:14,222 --> 01:01:15,941
That's actually delicious, yeah.

1407
01:01:15,942 --> 01:01:18,261
So, overall, I think you've done
a really good job there.

1408
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:19,142
Thank you.

1409
01:01:23,582 --> 01:01:25,061
We were looking for moulding.

1410
01:01:25,062 --> 01:01:27,501
You've gone flat.

1411
01:01:27,502 --> 01:01:30,101
I know that the teapot's not
moulded,

1412
01:01:30,102 --> 01:01:31,862
but I quite like the look of it.

1413
01:01:32,902 --> 01:01:34,342
That looks a bit bendy.

1414
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,501
I like the flavour.

1415
01:01:40,502 --> 01:01:41,821
Not much ginger.

1416
01:01:41,822 --> 01:01:43,861
It's not a bad flavour, though.

1417
01:01:43,862 --> 01:01:46,381
I just think the whole thing's just
a little bit clumsy, that's all.

1418
01:01:46,382 --> 01:01:48,861
You needed more care,
to be more precise.

1419
01:01:48,862 --> 01:01:51,142
Thank you, Mak. Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1420
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:57,581
It looks rushed to me.

1421
01:01:57,582 --> 01:01:59,901
You're normally very neat.
That's not neat.

1422
01:01:59,902 --> 01:02:01,861
It's just the icing that is rushed.

1423
01:02:01,862 --> 01:02:03,901
I agree. Great flavour, though.

1424
01:02:03,902 --> 01:02:06,821
Great snap. Thank you.
Really crispy. Tastes delicious.

1425
01:02:06,822 --> 01:02:08,701
Hmm. Really nice. Very good.

1426
01:02:08,702 --> 01:02:09,982
Thank you. Thank you.

1427
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,461
I like that. I think it looks very
neat, doesn't it?

1428
01:02:14,462 --> 01:02:15,501
Hmm. It's quite effective.

1429
01:02:15,502 --> 01:02:17,541
So that's the cranachan. Mm-hm.

1430
01:02:17,542 --> 01:02:20,461
The mixture of oatmeal, whisky,
raspberries.

1431
01:02:20,462 --> 01:02:21,582
Honey and cream.

1432
01:02:24,062 --> 01:02:25,101
Mm.

1433
01:02:25,102 --> 01:02:26,221
It's delicious.

1434
01:02:26,222 --> 01:02:28,621
You couldn't even finish the word
"delicious",

1435
01:02:28,622 --> 01:02:31,061
it was so delicious. Mmm.
Prue's in ecstasy.

1436
01:02:31,062 --> 01:02:32,421
I mean, it's very witty.

1437
01:02:32,422 --> 01:02:34,341
And, actually, the biscuit's
beautiful.

1438
01:02:34,342 --> 01:02:36,301
It's well baked, it's tasty.

1439
01:02:36,302 --> 01:02:38,822
Overall I think you've done a
great job. Thank you very much.

1440
01:02:42,862 --> 01:02:44,142
It's very impressive.

1441
01:02:45,422 --> 01:02:47,141
I think the boat's there.

1442
01:02:47,142 --> 01:02:49,501
It's a shame you ran out of time cos
it's gone a little bit

1443
01:02:49,502 --> 01:02:51,381
all over the place, but you've
moulded it quite nicely.

1444
01:02:51,382 --> 01:02:54,141
Erm... The plate looks a bit rough.

1445
01:02:54,142 --> 01:02:57,261
It is Viking. It's been under
the ground for the last 500 years

1446
01:02:57,262 --> 01:02:58,862
or something. Thanks, Prue.

1447
01:03:03,582 --> 01:03:07,221
It's good gingerbread. Very crisp,
lovely flavour, lots of ginger.

1448
01:03:07,222 --> 01:03:09,141
It has got a nice flavour to it.

1449
01:03:09,142 --> 01:03:11,422
Overall, I think you've
done a decent job. Very good.

1450
01:03:12,422 --> 01:03:15,541
I think they could see the vision,
which is really reassuring.

1451
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:16,741
SHE EXHALES

1452
01:03:16,742 --> 01:03:18,541
Yeah, I reckon I got away with that.

1453
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:20,861
Flavours I think might pull me
through.

1454
01:03:20,862 --> 01:03:22,581
Biscuit week wasn't my strongest.

1455
01:03:22,582 --> 01:03:25,661
If I do make it through this round,
it would be some kind of miracle.

1456
01:03:25,662 --> 01:03:29,421
Hopefully, you know, the judges will
look favourably upon me.

1457
01:03:29,422 --> 01:03:32,701
I think my position is more than
precarious, really.

1458
01:03:32,702 --> 01:03:34,461
I think it's completely tipped over

1459
01:03:34,462 --> 01:03:37,142
onto the slidey slope to, er,
oblivion.

1460
01:03:42,702 --> 01:03:45,621
It's decision time for Prue and
Paul.

1461
01:03:45,622 --> 01:03:49,421
Who'll be named star baker
and who will leave the tent?

1462
01:03:49,422 --> 01:03:52,341
So who do you think did the best
in that last challenge there?

1463
01:03:52,342 --> 01:03:54,661
David's table setting was very good.

1464
01:03:54,662 --> 01:03:57,341
Absolutely lovely. I adored it
and then I liked...

1465
01:03:57,342 --> 01:03:59,741
Mark, yeah... Mark.
His Ethiopian tea set.

1466
01:03:59,742 --> 01:04:02,821
I think Marc E had a really good
week. I really loved that.

1467
01:04:02,822 --> 01:04:05,901
Very clever. The texture, the look,
it's very neat.

1468
01:04:05,902 --> 01:04:07,141
So the Marks...

1469
01:04:07,142 --> 01:04:08,741
Top marks for the Marks!

1470
01:04:08,742 --> 01:04:10,061
LAUGHTER

1471
01:04:10,062 --> 01:04:13,501
We've got a few people in the mix
for star baker, but when it

1472
01:04:13,502 --> 01:04:17,901
comes to who's going home, it's
difficult between Mak and Rowan.

1473
01:04:17,902 --> 01:04:20,421
Which of those two do you think is
the most likely to improve

1474
01:04:20,422 --> 01:04:21,701
if they stay?

1475
01:04:21,702 --> 01:04:25,181
Well, I have to say Rowan
doesn't seem to take any advice.

1476
01:04:25,182 --> 01:04:27,501
I mean, Paul has been saying to him,

1477
01:04:27,502 --> 01:04:31,341
"Try not to promise too much
and, for goodness' sake, finish,"

1478
01:04:31,342 --> 01:04:32,941
and he hasn't done it once yet.

1479
01:04:32,942 --> 01:04:36,461
You just want his execution to be
better because he has great ideas.

1480
01:04:36,462 --> 01:04:39,541
I know. On the other hand, Mak
is steady, good.

1481
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,261
But he's not blowing your mind,
is he?

1482
01:04:41,262 --> 01:04:42,581
Yeah, he's not blowing my mind.

1483
01:04:42,582 --> 01:04:44,301
I sense that you're torn.

1484
01:04:44,302 --> 01:04:46,782
We'd better leave you to go
and make your decision.

1485
01:04:51,862 --> 01:04:53,181
Fortunately for me,

1486
01:04:53,182 --> 01:04:56,742
I've got the great job of
announcing who is star baker.

1487
01:04:58,182 --> 01:05:01,542
And star baker this week is...

1488
01:05:05,382 --> 01:05:06,382
..Dave.

1489
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:10,181
Thank you. Well done, you.

1490
01:05:10,182 --> 01:05:11,182
Thank you.

1491
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:17,221
So it falls to me to announce
who will be going home this week.

1492
01:05:17,222 --> 01:05:20,661
I've never done it before and
I've been dreading this moment.

1493
01:05:20,662 --> 01:05:24,261
I will say that it was very close
and it involved a lot of

1494
01:05:24,262 --> 01:05:29,502
discussion, but I'm afraid to say
the baker going home this week is...

1495
01:05:35,382 --> 01:05:36,781
..Mak.

1496
01:05:36,782 --> 01:05:37,941
Thank you.

1497
01:05:37,942 --> 01:05:38,942
Oh. Sorry, man.

1498
01:05:40,662 --> 01:05:42,621
I'm expecting that. Thank you very
much. Unlucky, Mak.

1499
01:05:42,622 --> 01:05:44,141
OK, no, no, it's OK.

1500
01:05:44,142 --> 01:05:46,541
I just felt it in my bones that it
was me.

1501
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:48,901
I know that I gave everything.

1502
01:05:48,902 --> 01:05:50,301
Thank you very much.

1503
01:05:50,302 --> 01:05:51,501
I'm going to miss you.

1504
01:05:51,502 --> 01:05:54,101
It was a privilege to be here,
meeting new people,

1505
01:05:54,102 --> 01:05:55,261
making new friends.

1506
01:05:55,262 --> 01:05:56,581
It's just been amazing.

1507
01:05:56,582 --> 01:05:58,861
Oh, Mak, honestly, I'm astonished.

1508
01:05:58,862 --> 01:06:01,501
My ideas saved me this week.

1509
01:06:01,502 --> 01:06:04,021
Last, last chance saloon.

1510
01:06:04,022 --> 01:06:05,941
I did my... I tried my hardest.

1511
01:06:05,942 --> 01:06:07,621
Just rein it in a little bit.

1512
01:06:07,622 --> 01:06:11,181
Going into next week, I'll hope to
manage the technical side

1513
01:06:11,182 --> 01:06:12,501
of things rather better.

1514
01:06:12,502 --> 01:06:16,021
I'm happy that I'm through, but I'm
really gutted that Mak's gone.

1515
01:06:16,022 --> 01:06:17,501
He's such a lovely guy.

1516
01:06:17,502 --> 01:06:19,781
It hurts. I'm going to miss him.

1517
01:06:19,782 --> 01:06:21,781
Can't believe it, I'm through!

1518
01:06:21,782 --> 01:06:25,741
The coffee was really strong
and they got a real kick from it.

1519
01:06:25,742 --> 01:06:29,182
It's quite nice to hear that I'll be
keeping Paul and Prue up all night.

1520
01:06:31,982 --> 01:06:33,381
It's been a good week for me.

1521
01:06:33,382 --> 01:06:35,101
I'm ecstatic. That was amazing.

1522
01:06:35,102 --> 01:06:37,101
Super happy.

1523
01:06:37,102 --> 01:06:38,541
Yeah!

1524
01:06:38,542 --> 01:06:40,181
I'm star baker this week.

1525
01:06:40,182 --> 01:06:41,661
Oh, my God!

1526
01:06:41,662 --> 01:06:43,221
I know, I can't... No way.

1527
01:06:43,222 --> 01:06:44,501
Yeah, I can't believe it.

1528
01:06:44,502 --> 01:06:46,381
I'm so proud of you.

1529
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:47,821
What an end to the week.

1530
01:06:47,822 --> 01:06:50,461
Ooh! Well done!

1531
01:06:50,462 --> 01:06:51,861
Next time...

1532
01:06:51,862 --> 01:06:53,541
Whack it... it's bread week.

1533
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:55,341
Listen to me, Paul Hollywood.

1534
01:06:55,342 --> 01:06:58,021
No-one under the age of 40 eats
bread any more.

1535
01:06:58,022 --> 01:07:00,661
As the bakers face a soda bread
signature...

1536
01:07:00,662 --> 01:07:02,941
You invented a bread!

1537
01:07:02,942 --> 01:07:04,781
..the tent reaches boiling point...

1538
01:07:04,782 --> 01:07:05,861
And breathe.

1539
01:07:05,862 --> 01:07:07,661
..in a nerve-twisting technical...

1540
01:07:07,662 --> 01:07:08,821
Woo-oo!

1541
01:07:08,822 --> 01:07:10,181
I really don't know what
I'm looking for.

1542
01:07:10,182 --> 01:07:11,581
..and it's all about growth...

1543
01:07:11,582 --> 01:07:12,661
Arise, sir dough.

1544
01:07:12,662 --> 01:07:13,741
..in the loaf...

1545
01:07:13,742 --> 01:07:15,341
No time for faffery.

1546
01:07:15,342 --> 01:07:17,381
..in a sensational show stopper.

1547
01:07:17,382 --> 01:07:18,621
Very, very good.

1548
01:07:18,622 --> 01:07:20,941
Who will dance their way to
success...

1549
01:07:20,942 --> 01:07:22,501
..and who'll be left crying...

1550
01:07:22,502 --> 01:07:23,941
BLEEP

1551
01:07:23,942 --> 01:07:25,141
..over spilt milk?

1552
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:26,142
LAUGHTER

1553
01:07:27,582 --> 01:07:28,981
It's not funny!

1554
01:07:28,982 --> 01:07:29,982
Yuck.

1555
01:07:54,382 --> 01:07:57,382
