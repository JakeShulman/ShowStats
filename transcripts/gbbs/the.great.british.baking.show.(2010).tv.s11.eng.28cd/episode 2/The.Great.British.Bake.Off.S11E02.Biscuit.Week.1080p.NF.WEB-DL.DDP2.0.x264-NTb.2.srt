00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,160
Hello, and welcome to Biscuit Week.

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,800
- Oh, Uncle Noel.
- Yes?

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,560
I've got a couple of facts about biscuits.
May I share them?

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,439
- Let's hear them.
- Okay. Did you know

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,320
that biscuits were invented
by Sir Morris Biscuits in 1950-12?

6
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:28,520
And also, did you know

7
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,000
that over 40 biscuits a year
are sold in Europe alone?

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,160
Did you know that in America,
they're not called biscuits?

9
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,239
- Oh?
- They are called the sidewalk.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,519
Noel!

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,440
Welcome to the <i>Great British Baking Show!</i>

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,519
[Matt] <i>This time, it's Biscuit Week.</i>

13
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:48,440
Whoa.

14
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:50,160
[Matt] <i>With a sticky signature...</i>

15
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,519
- [exclaims]
- [Matt] <i>...that's tight on time.</i>

16
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:54,040
What a disaster.

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,760
[Matt] <i>A tropical technical</i>
<i>that has the bakers bemused...</i>

18
00:00:57,839 --> 00:00:59,080
I've got no idea, mate.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,360
- [Matt] <i>...and a brittle showstopper...</i>
- [Lottie groans]

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,119
[Rowan] I might cry if this breaks.

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,320
[Matt] <i>...that leaves</i>
<i>the whole tent anxious.</i>

22
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,360
I remember worrying a bit
about your very large nuts.

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
[all laughing]

24
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:14,759
[Paul sighs]

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,080
[opening theme music playing]

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,000
[indistinct chatter]

27
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,119
Morning! Another day. Ah! [laughs]

28
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:43,240
I'm so happy to be back for week two.
I don't wanna flap today.

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,920
I'm gonna try and be cool,
controlled and calm. [chuckling]

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,399
We'll see how that goes.

31
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,679
Hopefully, this week,
there'll be no more tears.

32
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,080
My mum did say to me, "Stop crying.
Don't know why you're crying."

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,960
[chuckling] She's so harsh.

34
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,720
I'm excited about Biscuit Week.
I'm not shaking, I'm all right.

35
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,960
Terrified. Absolutely terrified.

36
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,600
Biscuits are quite tricky. So, I think
it's gonna be a difficult week.

37
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:09,160
As long as I get through,
that's fine. [chuckles]

38
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,400
If I get Star Baker, that's my final.

39
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,799
Bakers, welcome back to the tent
for Biscuit Week.

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,760
And for your signature challenge,
the judges would like you each to make

41
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959
a batch of 36 chocolate Florentines.

42
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,760
Interesting fact, Florentines
were originally called Florentines.

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,480
Thank you, Noel.
I actually wrote that fact.

44
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,640
[all laughing]

45
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,239
Your Florentines should be uniform
in terms of shape, texture and flavour,

46
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,600
and the judges will be expecting
a perfect snap.

47
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:52,880
Your Florentines must be dipped,
decorated or coated in chocolate.

48
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,480
You have two hours.

49
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,480
It is time for you to leap
onto your marks, please.

50
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,120
And make sure at that point then
that you get set.

51
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,200
For it is now time to very much bake!

52
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,440
Chocolate Florentines
is all about the snap.

53
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,120
Gotta have a good snap on a Florentine.

54
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,519
Nervous.

55
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, not about eating them,
but about making them, yes, I'm nervous.

56
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,720
It's Biscuit Week,
and we're kicking off with Florentines.

57
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,720
A really good classic Florentine
consists of nuts and dried fruit

58
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,359
bound together in a caramelly,
buttery mixture.

59
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,679
I mean, they are fattening,
but they're gorgeous.

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,799
This challenge is tricky.
They have to get the caramel right,

61
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,359
they have to get the filling right,
choice of chocolate.

62
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,720
I personally think dark chocolate
is the way forward.

63
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,359
The sweetness with the bitterness
of the dark chocolate

64
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,840
is a beautiful blend.

65
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,799
It would help if I put that bit in.

66
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,000
The perfect Florentine is neat as a pin
and small and thin.

67
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,679
Timing is everything.

68
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,560
Half a minute too long,
and they'll be burnt.

69
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,839
Half a minute too short,
and they won't have that crisp crack.

70
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,200
- [Paul] Morning, Peter.
- [Peter] Hello, hello.

71
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,359
You did really well last week.
What have you got in store for us?

72
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,239
I'm making sticky toffee Florentines,

73
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,440
inspired by what is in my opinion
the best pudding in the world,

74
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,920
sticky toffee pudding. I've got dark
muscovado sugar in the caramel.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,079
I've got lots of dates. So, it should have
those lovely toffee flavours.

76
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,080
[Matt] <i>After pounding the trails</i>
<i>outside his hometown Edinburgh,</i>

00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:28,680
<i>proud Scot Peter likes to replace

78
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,159
<i>with some good hearty fare.</i>

79

- Stick in till you stick out.

80
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,599
[Matt] <i>Based on his favourite pudding</i>
<i>growing up,</i>

81
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,520
<i>Peter's sticky toffee Florentines</i>

82
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:40,320
<i>contain a gooey mix of dates,
sultanas, and chopped nuts,</i>

83
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,479
<i>topped with caramelized white chocolate.</i>

84
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,520
Will they be thin and have a snap to them,
or will they be sticky and squishy?

85
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:50,320
Both crunchy and chewy,
'cause when you bite into the dates,

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,560
that's gonna be chewy.

87
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,960
But also, I'm hoping
you'll be able to get a snap

88
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,599
from the caramel nut side
of the biscuit as well.

89
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,240
- Thank you. Good luck.
- Good luck, Star Baker.

90
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,880
Thank you very much. [chuckles]

[Noel] <i>Peter's not the only baker</i>
<i>inspired by a childhood favourite.</i>

92
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,000
Traditionally, in Iran,
there's this brittle called Sohan,

93
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,000
which is cardamom, saffron and rosewater.

94
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,039
They're flavours I grew up on.
They're part of my heritage.

What have you done on your days off?

110
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,440
Practice, practice, practice,
burnt myself out.

111
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,200
- Burnt yourself out?
- Yeah, I was really tired.

My Florentines are
one of my sister's favourite biscuits.

119
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,280
She had a really sweet tooth
when we were kids.

120
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:29,919
When my mum turned her back,
I used to quickly eat her dinner and...

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,719
[laughs] So she could
get to her pudding quick.

[Linda] I blend the nuts down
into quite small chunks.

129
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,120
That way, hopefully, when they spread,
you get a much more even surface.

[Noel] <i>But in terms of texture,</i>
<i>Linda's consistency is not for everyone.</i>

- Set up a kiosk.

I know there's a lot of people in the tent
using mango as well today,

155
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,560

May the best mango win.

160
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,200
This is dried mango.
I'm just gonna put this in boiling water,

161
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,200

Otherwise, it'll be too chewy.

- [girl] Ooh, juicy.
- Juicy ones.

174

so each scoop is about 25 or 26 grams,

182

- [Noel] <i>Whether the bakers use moulds...</i>

So, I've really gotta make sure
that I measure out the biscuit.

They want 36 identical Florentines.

About three quarters of a teaspoon
to a teaspoon in each one.

193

Some people measure.
I haven't got the patience.

194
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't want them too chunky
because they won't snap.

195
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,560
I'll be honest,
I haven't made Florentines before.

203
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:26,280
[Laura] Because it's quite salty,
dark chocolate was too rich,

204
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,439
so I chose milk chocolate as a base.

Those are going in
at 180 for seven minutes.

Eleven minutes on the top shelf
and eleven and a half on the bottom.

231

I have to be really careful
about the timing of these

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,040
You bake it in the oven,

298
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,360
then it takes on a really dark,
caramelly colour and flavour

299
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:51,800
and it tastes so, so good.

300
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,920
[Mak] I'm just melting some chocolate
and I'm tempering.

301
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,479
Tempering gives it that snap.

302
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,120
It's a frustrating process,
especially for white chocolate.

303
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,319
It's very precise.

304
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,520
Keep stirring this
'cause it's really hot, still.

305
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:05,400
Couple of degrees out, you have
to start the whole process again.

306
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:08,560
That looks delicious.
I'd sort of like to get in that.

307
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,479
I could stick my head in a bucket of that.

308
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,000
If I was an insect,
I'd get in that, like a sort of hot tub.

[Marc] It's, er, ruby chocolate,
and I only discovered it a few months ago.

314
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,536
And I was really surprised
about the flavour.

315
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,760
Almost like white chocolate,

316
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,280

coming through at the end.

What do you think of the shape?
Nice, isn't it?

325
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:54,679
[Noel] I like the square shape.

326
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:57,280
I've never, ever seen a square before,

327
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,599
so I'm very...
Very excited about these biscuits.

328
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,175

- Yeah.

- [Matt] I know rhombus.

- Cuboid?
- I don't know cuboid.

332

- [Noel] You know circle.
- But I don't know semi-circles.

- No.
- [Matt] I'm not onto them yet.

How marvellous.

Oh, I'm melting chocolate.
No time to think.

340
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,120
[clicks tongue]
I put some colour in this chocolate.

341
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,560
It's just gone a bit solid,
so I'm gonna reheat them.

342
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,160
I'm just slightly short of time.

343
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,719
[Rowan] Lots of little waistcoats.

344
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,040
There's a huge amount of work to do.
I'm always very ambitious.

345
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:48,280
[Lottie] I'm just going for
the standard dunk. Dunk and wipe.

346
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,959
[Peter] A dip, a swipe and trying
to make them as neat as possible.

347
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,000
[Marc] What I'm aiming to do is
just get a really thin layer on here,

348
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:02,040
sit the biscuits on, and then
the chocolate will set beautifully,

349
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,760
but they won't give me any stress.

Slightly tight, to be quite honest.

You can taste the nuts and mango.

Sesame seed, too, which I love.

you needed more texture in there.

The white chocolate is quite dominant.

409
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,159
It needed something else.
Maybe a bit more fruit in there.

[Prue] Snaps quite well.

- I love that for flavours.
- Yes!

415
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,240
I think the issue is
you want something bitter.

416

If you'd kept it to dark chocolate,
you would've been on a winner.

But otherwise, that's a great Florentine.

- So my question is why did you do it?

425
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,640
- Course I have.
- Because I like them.

426
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,320
[Prue] Anyway, it certainly does not snap.

427
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:59,720
- No.
- I love the flavours of it.

428
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,560
- It's not baked enough.
- The idea of the waistcoats, I love.

429
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:05,480
But, honestly, that modelling chocolate
ruins the biscuit.

You get a bit of saffron in there as well.

- Snap. Yeah.
- [Prue] Snap.

441
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,240
- And what's the tea?
- [Sura] Cardamom tea.

442
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,280
- [Paul] That's delicious.
- [Prue] Lovely.

- Can I take it with me?
- Thank you so much.

- Smells like one, too.

[Paul] Ooh, bit of a bend.

00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,960
The flavour's delicious.
I've never had anything like it.

Particularly like that white chocolate.

449
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,840
I love that caramel flavour.

450
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,600
You're clever with your ideas.

451
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,679
You've come up with something
that's truly unique. Thank you.

452
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:17,120
[softly] That was touching, mate.
That smells delicious.

453
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,080
But as we all know,
eating's cheating, so...

454
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:22,320
[chuckles softly]

455
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,560
[Paul] They're a bit scruffy.

456
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:28,320
Time wasn't on my side.

457
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:29,399
[Prue grunting]

458
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,399
- [laughs]
- You needed slightly longer in the oven.

459
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:37,960
There's something tough in there.
Is it the mango?

460
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,560
Probably, yes.

461
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:41,000
Hmm.

462
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,280
- It's like leather.
- Oh, God, this is agonising.

463
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,280
The mango needs to be soaked
'cause it's just too chewy.

464
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,240
- But love the flavour of it.
- Thank you.

465
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,439
[Prue] It's very pretty
and neat as anything.

466
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,200
Unique. Unusual to use the ruby chocolate.

467
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,120
- Yeah.
- I do like the uniformity.

468
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,639
- Thank you.
- [Prue] It isn't going to snap, though.

469
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,040
[Marc] Yeah.

470
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,879
[Paul] Ruby chocolate's quite tart
and blends well with ginger.

471
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,280
You've got a nice flavour.

472
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,720
I love the sour cherries. Very surprising,
very original and very delicious.

473
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,615
- Brilliant. I'll take that.
- [Prue] Well done.

474
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:17,800
- Well done.
- Thank you.

475
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:29,919
I think you've lost in the appearance
what a Florentine is.

476
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,480
You should be able
to see much more texture.

477
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,840
You're not getting that,
it's flat as a pancake.

478
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,360
[Prue] I bet it tastes nice.

479
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,760
And it has a snap.

480
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,560
[Paul] Ginger tastes strong, which I like.

481
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:43,000
It's like having, erm, ginger brandy snap.

482
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,960
It's a delicious biscuit,
but it is not a Florentine.

483
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,760
- Okay.
- [Paul] Thank you, Linda.

484
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,120
What's the decoration?

485
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,840
Supposed to be, er,
a sort of, of a peacock effect.

486
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,800
Peacock? Thought it was a tennis racquet
to celebrate Wimbledon.

487
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:02,960
Yes, it was.

488
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,080
[Paul laughs]

489
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,320
[Prue] They're gooey.

490
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:08,720
Could've stayed in there
another five minutes.

491
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,760
- You soaked your mango, didn't you?
- Yeah.

492
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,360
I imagine that contributed
to a sort of sogginess.

493
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:16,760
I like the flavours,
but it's not a Florentine.

494
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,920
Never mind. Thank you, Mak.

495
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

496
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,560
I have to say, I think they look good.

497
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:26,639
Thank you.

498
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,639
You've got a good tempered chocolate,
and I like the top, classic Florentine.

499
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,439
You've got a nice shine, it's busy,

500
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,600
and that's what a Florentine
should look like.

501
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,280
Bit of a snap.

502
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,800
It's chocolatey, it's nutty.
Love the sour cherry.

503
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:41,919
It's delicious.

504
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,639
The ginger and the cherry
with the dark chocolate is just fantastic.

505
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,919
And it does snap, it's nice and thin.

506
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,760
Can't find fault with them, really.

507
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
[Lottie gasps]

508
00:24:57,879 --> 00:25:00,080
- Well done.
- Thank you.

509
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:03,840
I'll take that one with me. Thank you.

510
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,760
[Noel laughs]

511
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,240
[exhales in relief]

512
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:10,120
[softly] What?

513
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,800
As if!

514
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:14,000
[in normal voice] Completely mad. [gasps]

515
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,800
Imagine, me?

516
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,000
Never gonna wash my hand again.

517
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,320
I like my fruit chunky,
but what can I say?

518
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:24,679
They're the experts.
If they're not right, they're not right.

519
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,199
I'm just disappointed.

520
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,560
[Dave] That went well. I did get a snap.

521
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:30,760
That's what I was going for, the snap.

522
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,439
[Rowan] The concept was good,
but too ambitious.

523
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,399
I shall endeavour to take the advice.

524
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,760
It could've gone better.
I've just gotta stay calm.

525
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,120
Just put this morning behind me

526
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,879
and look forward to this afternoon.

527
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,679
[Matt] <i>The bakers were able to</i>
<i>practise their signature bakes,</i>

528
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,560
<i>but have no idea
what technical mystery lies ahead.</i>

529
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Bakers, it's time
for your technical challenge,

530
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:03,320
which today has been set by Prue.

531
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:05,040
Prue, any words of advice?

532
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,280
This is a classic.

533
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,040
So read your recipe, no going off-piste.

534
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,600
[Noel] Your technical challenge
will be judged blind,

535
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:15,320
so we're gonna have to ask
the judges to leave the tent.

536
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:16,399
Off you pop.

537
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,736
Let's say things about them
while they're gone.

538
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,720
[Noel and Sura chuckle]

539
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,120
Prue would like you to make
12 hand-shaped coconut macaroons.

540
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:29,399
Six of them must be drizzled
and filled with chocolate

541
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,120
and six of them must be piped
with a delicious mango curd.

542
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,800
[Matt] Sounds quite involved.

543
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:37,800
If I were you, I'd just go out
and buy some, much easier.

544
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:39,199
- It doesn't work like that.
- Oh.

545
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,879
- [chuckles]
- [Noel] They must be crispy

546
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,000
and golden on the outside,
but chewy on the inside.

547
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,800
You've got an hour and 45 minutes.

548
00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:47,600
- On your marks.
- [in opera voice] Get set.

549
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,520
Go to the shops.

550
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,800
- Or bake.
- Or bake.

551
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:52,120
[cutlery clattering]

552
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,120
[Rowan] Oh, Jesus.

553
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:56,080
Macaroons? I've got no idea, mate.

554
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,240
I don't think I've eaten one,
let alone made one.

555
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,639
This is gonna be interesting.

556
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,240
I'm familiar with macaroons

557
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,840
and I've made them once
a very long time ago, but not filled.

558
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,360
I've made these, er,
with my mum before, but donkeys ago.

559
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:11,360
[Rowan] Haven't had macaroons for years.

560
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:13,279
They're okay, but they
get stuck in your teeth.

561
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,800
Prue, macaroons as
a technical challenge, good choice.

562
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:19,199
- A favourite of mine.
- I know. I love them, too.

563
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,480
They look so simple
and if you read the recipe,

564
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,240
it's, "Oh, no problem with that."

565
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,120
But I think they're trickier
than they sound.

566
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:28,360
It's important to get the mixture right.

567
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,199
We've given them coconut flakes

568
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,600
which they need to put
in a processor, briefly.

569
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,000
If they overdo it, they won't get
this nice, rough edge,

570
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,960
they'll get a smooth paste
which will stick together

571
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,399
and won't be nearly so pleasant.

572
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,760
I think these look beautiful.

573
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,600
They're all the same size, regardless
whether they're mango or chocolate.

574
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:48,480
I think I'll try the mango first.

575
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:51,320
As soon as you bite into it,
there's coconut.

576
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:54,879
The mango is beautiful as well.
It's just the right consistency.

577
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,240
Smooth as anything,
but it's set. It's not running.

578
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,280
You have to pipe a wall around the edge.

579
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,560
If you don't get high enough walls,
you don't get enough mango curd.

580
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:06,159
Moving on to the chocolate.

581
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,320
- Very neat lines on the top.
- [Prue] Hmm.

582
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,919
And a good decent lump

583
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,560
- of chocolate in there.
- [Paul] Mmm.

584
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:13,600
It's gorgeous blended with the coconut.

585
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,000
We've squeezed them a bit on time to get
this done. It is a challenge.

586
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,439
The most important thing
is timing in the oven,

587
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,760
because they need to be just golden brown,

588
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,639
crunchy on the outside, slightly chewy
and sticky in the middle.

589
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,040
The test is the colour.
Take it out when it looks like that.

590
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,360
[Paul] There's nothing better.

591
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:35,120
It takes me back to when I was a kid.

592
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,959
Perfect with a great cup of tea.

593
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:41,199
First instruction, make the mango curd.

594
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:43,800
[Laura] It's a little mean.

595
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,120
Trying to refresh my memory
of how to make a curd.

596
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,639
So you've got mango puree
in there, caster sugar,

597
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,840
you've got one egg and two yolks,

598
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,360
bit of lime juice
and a bit of unsalted butter.

599
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:58,480
And then very carefully cook it
over gentle heat.

600
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,639
What I don't want is scrambled egg.

601
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,159
Mango-flavoured scrambled egg.

602
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,159
[Linda] Curd can take
a little while to thicken up.

603
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:07,560
[Lottie] Smells nice.

604
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,399
[Matt] Have you made macaroons before?

605
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,600
No, I've made macarons before,
but not macaroons.

606
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:14,175
- [Matt] They're a different food.
- Yes.

607
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,919
They've added an extra letter
and called it "macaroons".

608
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,919
They have.

609
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,600
Next year, people will have
to make macarooons

610
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:23,399
- 'cause they'll add another letter to it.
- [chuckles]

611
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,240
My curd is starting to thicken.

612
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,720
It should be quite drippy,
but quite thick.

613
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,840
It's important that
I do well in this challenge,

614
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:34,000
so that's why I'm
gonna be... extra careful.

615
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,120
[Laura] I think that looks okay.

616
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:37,080
Let's add the butter.

617
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:40,280
If you add the cold butter
and then just keep whisking it in,

618
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,199
it should go really nice
and silky and smooth... I think.

619
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,399
Either that or I'm talking out my arse.

620
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,720
[Rowan] It's thickening nicely now.
That doesn't look too bad.

621
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,159
Mango curd has to chill. Keep it chill.

622
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,480
[Laura] I'm trying to cool it quickly
by putting it in the freezer.

623
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,240
My mango curd is in the fridge.

624
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,639
"Using the round cutter as a guide,

625
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,439
draw 12 circles on the rice paper
and then cut out the circles."

626
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,840
[Lottie] Is this rice paper?

627
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:09,800
- [Matt] Rice paper does look delicious.
- I never tried that.

628
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:12,240
- You can... Yes, it's edibubble.
- [Hermine chuckles]

629
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,760
[Mak] So far, so good.
I'm good at drawing circles.

630
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,679
I'm just waiting for my curd
to thicken a bit more.

631
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,959
Still a bit runny,

632
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,959
and so I really need to crack on
with everything else.

633
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,399
[sing-song] Glasses on.

634
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,639
Mean business.

635
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,320
Why is that? Hand shake?

636
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,760
Come on, spill the dirt.

637
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,080
- How did it feel when Hollywood...
- [Lottie] I...

638
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,320
...his big, sausage-y fingers
gripped your pale...

639
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,560
- Yeah. Thanks, yeah.
- ...ET-like fingers?

640
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:37,520
How did it feel?

641
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,679
- I felt nothing.
- Angry?

642
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,560
- I just felt shocked...
- You felt nothing?

643
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:42,199
- And like...
- Cold, dead inside.

644
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,199
No, I'm not dead inside, I just went numb.

645
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,360
- I didn't know what was happening.
- [laughs]

646
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:49,600
That's it, that's the pivotal moment
in your baking career.

647
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,879
Yeah, that's it. I've peaked for sure.

648
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:56,480
"For the macaroons, tip the shredded
coconut into the food processor

649
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,800
and blitz until the flakes
are small enough to pipe."

650
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,560
It's been very clear in the recipe
to not over-blitz the coconut,

651
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:05,000
so trying to listen to that.

652
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,320
I think that'll do.

653
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,080
It's hard not to lose your nerve
when you look around

654
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,840
and everyone else is miles ahead.

655
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:18,199
But I was really worried
about leaving this curd for too long.

656
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,159
I'm gonna go with that.

657
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,199
"Add the almond extract, rice flour,
condensed milk and pulse."

658
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,480
This is condensed milk, nice and sticky.
I love this.

659
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,360
- [Matt] Could you drink that?
- [Mak] I have.

660
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:30,399
- You've drunk condensed milk?
- I have.

661
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,639
- [Matt] Really?
- I love it.

662
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,120
I leave you in disgust.

663
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,439
[chuckles]

664
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,959
"Carefully fold whisked egg whites
into the coconut mixture."

665
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,199
It's just gonna help raise
and keep them light.

666
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,600
So, I guess it'll be kind of
like a meringue-y, chewy texture.

667
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,159
[Mak] Now, I think that is done.

668
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,719
[Matt] Bakers, you are halfway through.

669
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
So basically, you have
52 and a half minutes left.

670
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,240
[Mark] I'm running behind.

671
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,560
So at the minute, I'm adding the coconut.

672
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:01,199
I think there was time in the recipe
to make the curd properly,

673
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,760
so I hope that I haven't just wasted that.

674
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,840
[inhales sharply]

675
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:11,240
"Spoon half of the mixture into a piping
bag fitted with a large star nozzle."

676
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:15,959
The mixture looks yummy.
I kinda want to just eat the batter as is.

677
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,439
Mmm, I'd quite like
a bit of rum in there, I think.

678
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,679
Overall, mmm, nice.

679
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,240
"Pipe a ring of coconut
around the edge of the rice paper."

680
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,199
"Pipe a small amount
of mixture into the hole."

681
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,360
[Rowan] So, you're making a little dish,
really, for the curd.

682
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:32,560
I'm worried about how deep the hole
has to be in order to fit a filling in.

683
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:35,080
It's quite pipeable,
so it's holding its shape.

684
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,919
Come on, Laura, you know how to pipe.
I feel like mine's too thick.

685
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,520
I wonder whether
I haven't made it fine enough.

686
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,879
"For the remaining six macaroons,

687
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:50,959
place a spoonful of coconut mixture
on the remaining discs and flatten."

688
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,879
"Place a square of chocolate
into the centre of each coconut circle."

689
00:32:55,959 --> 00:33:00,560
Then I'm going to place
a spoon of the mixture over the top

690
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:01,760
and create a dome.

691
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,439
[Linda] If you don't get
the chocolate covered up,

692
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,080
it's gonna start
running out of it as it's cooking.

693
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:10,560
I'm just trying to make sure
that it's all covered in now.

694
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,360
[Mark] I'm just trying to get them
as even as I possibly can.

695
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:15,480
Save some time now.

696
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,080
On the recipe, it tells us to "bake".

697
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:21,879
Er... so, useful.

698
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,480
[Marc] Gonna pop those
in the oven now. [sighs]

699
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,840
[Lottie] I genuinely have
no idea on timing.

700
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:28,520
It's on 130.

701
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,080
- Gonna start with ten minutes.
- [timer beeping]

702
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,159
Starting with ten minutes,
then I'll check them, see how they go.

703
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,760
With how much time's left,

704
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,120
it's an indication that it's probably
a longer bake than what everyone reckons.

705
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:40,760
I reckon 25 minutes in the end.

706
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,560
[Mak] They're in. Thirty minutes.

707
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:44,600
It's a low and slow cook.

708
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,760
I do feel a little up against it.

709
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,520
They'll probably take 20 minutes to bake,
so it doesn't give me a lot of time.

710
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,800
My curd better be good.

711
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
[chuckles]

712
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,159
[softly] Bakers,
you've got half an hour left.

713
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
Don't wanna wake Matt up.

714
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,800
Half an hour.

715
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:05,280
[annoyed] Come on.

716
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,159
It's taking so long.

717
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,520
[Laura] They're not even toasty.

718
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,639
They did say that they wanted
a nice golden top.

719
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,799
Mine aren't golden.

720
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:16,000
I don't know, man.
What is golden, know what I mean?

721
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,960
Golden can mean anything, really.

722
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,400
[straining] I just don't know.

723
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,199
These are not gonna get
golden brown, I don't think.

724
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,120
Lordy, lordy, lordy.

725
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,600
[Laura] It's really intense.

726
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,000
- [Noel] I find it strangely relaxing.
- Do you?

727
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,600
Watching everyone else stress?

728
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,799
[Noel] Seeing their dreams slide away.

729
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,440
[both laugh]

730
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,120
[sighing] Oh, God.

731
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,719
[Lottie] I don't have any patience.

732
00:34:40,799 --> 00:34:42,679
[Peter] Certainly not looking golden,

733
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:45,159
but I think it'll take
a really long time to get golden.

734
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,319
What do you reckon?

735
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,639
Least another five minutes, I think.

736
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,159
[Mark] They're taking ages.

737
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,336
[Linda] They are, aren't they?

738
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,560
- [Marc] A lot longer than I expected.
- [Linda] Mmm.

739
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,239
I think I shouldn't have come down here.

740
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:56,839
I don't know if I can get back up.

741
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,720
- [Laura laughs]
- That's what I think.

742
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,240
[groaning] Oh, my Lord!

743
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:02,200
[in normal voice] I'm all right.

744
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:04,319
Might go in with those. Let's have a look.

745
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
I think maybe one minute longer.

746
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,480
[Rowan] These are looking rustic,
but not too bad.

747
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,000
I've gotta get them cool.

748
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,520
I might pull mine, you know.

749
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,040
I'm gonna get them out now.

750
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,480
[Laura] They're nice and golden.

751
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,160
Think I'm happy.

752
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,120
[Hermine] Don't know what
they should look like,

753
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,000
but I think they look all right.

754
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,440
[Matt] Ooh, they look good.

755
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,240
Now, these ones are
quite a lot larger than those ones.

756
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:30,160
- [Sura] Yes.
- [Matt] Is that intentional?

757
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,680
Well... no.

758
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:35,080
Right. You should've said yes.
Oh, we'll do it again.

759
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,680
So these ones are a bit larger
than those ones. Is that intentional?

760
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:40,856
- Yes, they've got chocolate inside.
- That's... Right.

761
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,400
That's a good... approach.

762
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,799
[laughs]

763
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:48,560
I think the colour's looking good,
but I just don't think they're ready yet.

764
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,319
I think I'm at 28 minutes now.
I reckon a couple more minutes.

765
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,600
[Mak] Just need
five more minutes, I'll be done.

766
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,080
[Mark] Maybe they are ready.

767
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:58,400
How long have we got?

768
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,759
Bakers, you have five minutes

769
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,960
until we tell you that
you have ten minutes!

770
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,080
Matt.

771
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
You have 15 minutes.

772
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,200
- [both laughing]
- [Laura] That was mean.

773
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:09,120
I'm bad.

774
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,920
Gonna give them a bit longer.

775
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,496
[Lottie] What am I
supposed to put in this?

776
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,456
"Spoon a small amount of set curd
into each ring."

777
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,120
Okay, set curd.

778
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,000
[Hermine] That's the consistency
I would have

779
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,120
if I was making a lemon curd.

780
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,920
They're finally coming out.

781
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
Ow, ow, ow.

782
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,279
Dave's look rather sophisticated.

783
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,360
[Dave] I like them.

784
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,240
Does look as if the cat's had an accident.

785
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:33,960
"To decorate the chocolate macaroons,

786
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,240
pipe fine lines across them
with melted chocolate."

787
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,440
That's what I'm going for, nice and neat.

788
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:42,799
[Rowan] That's more like it.
Bit more freestyle.

789
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,839
Putting the mango curd in the middle.

790
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,200
[Mark] Ideally, I'd want them to be cool,
'cause I'm conscious I'm quite behind.

791
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:52,960
Bakers, it's basically too late now,
you've got one minute left.

792
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
[Marc] Chocolate season.

793
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,536
- [Mark] It's seized on me.
- [Lottie] Have mine.

794
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,359
[Mark] Cheers, you've totally saved me.

795
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,799
[Sura] There's not enough space
for all six.

796
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,000
[timer beeping]

797
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,920
Bakers, your time is up.

798
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,920
I think they're beautiful.

799
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,520
You can see the influence
of fine French patisserie.

800
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,920
[laughs]

801
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,960
Please bring your trays
forward to the front

802
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,120
and put them behind your photograph.

803
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,799
Sura, hang back a little bit.

804
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,520
[laughing] I'm joking.

805
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:28,400
[Noel] <i>Prue and Paul are looking</i>
<i>for 12 uniform coconut macaroons,</i>

806
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,759
<i>six filled with mango curd
and six filled with chocolate,</i>

807
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,520
<i>crispy on the outside
and chewy in the middle.</i>

808
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,799
So, let's have a look at the first one.

809
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,680
- [Paul] I like them to be the same sizes.
- [Prue] Yeah.

810
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,960
[Paul] They look very similar.

811
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,000
They could've done
with a little bit longer.

812
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,560
It's delicious, but not quite
crisp enough on the outside

813
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,920
- and a bit too squashy.
- [Paul] Hmm.

814
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,560
Let's have a check of that mango.

815
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:55,160
It's not bad.

816
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,560
Like to see more of a ridge
there to create a...

817
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,839
- A well.
- A pond in the middle, yeah.

818
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,400
Let's move on to the second one.

819
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,440
The chocolate ones look a bit untidy.

820
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,656
[Prue] They're different sizes.

821
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,440
- That one's much smaller than that one.
- Yeah.

822
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,400
- Needed a bit longer those, actually.
- [Prue] Hmm.

823
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,839
[Paul] I like this decoration, the lines.

824
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,640
[Prue] They're very different sizes.
These ones are tiny and these are big.

825
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:22,839
But does taste very good.

826
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,400
[Paul] Slightly underbaked.

827
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,920
The piping's a little peculiar.

828
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,799
- [Paul laughing] It is.
- [Prue laughs]

829
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,640
That one's a sort of squirt.

830
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,880
Mmm.

831
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,839
It's too soft.

832
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,960
The coconut that's underneath the mango
is almost like it went into the oven.

833
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,480
[Paul] Yeah, but moving on.

834
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,960
I like this one 'cause you've got

835
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,600
- a nice caramelisation...
- Yeah.

836
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,600
...from the coconut. There you go.

837
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,839
[Prue] Delicious.

838
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,120
Crispy on the outside, soft in the middle.
Mango's tasty as well.

839
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,216
- Moving on.
- [Prue] Right.

840
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,680
[Paul] I like these as well.

841
00:38:52,759 --> 00:38:54,880
They're uniform,
they're all the same size.

842
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,240
Nice browning effect.

843
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:58,359
- [Prue] Decent amount of curd.
- [Paul] Yeah.

844
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,200
- Good flavour.
- [Prue] Curd's nice, too.

845
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:01,560
It's a little liquid.

846
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:04,000
[Paul] And moving on.

847
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,120
They're equal, bit small,
a bit undercooked as well.

848
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,920
[Prue] Definitely underbaked.

849
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,720
Lovely mango,
just needed longer in the oven.

850
00:39:12,799 --> 00:39:15,359
These are very neat.
I love these lines like that.

851
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,080
It's well baked as well.

852
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:20,680
That's got lovely flavour.

853
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:23,720
The curd is perfect,
it cuts, it doesn't just flow.

854
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:24,799
It's a good one.

855
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,799
[Paul] This again, quite a decent one.

856
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,359
However, they over-blitzed the mixture.

857
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,560
[Paul] Quite smooth.

858
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,520
- And it's good.
- [Prue] Hmm.

859
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,279
[Paul] And this one's well baked.

860
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,120
Could do more of a wall.

861
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,319
It's a bit hard.

862
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,120
- And they're quite chewy.
- [Paul] Yeah.

863
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,080
Last one, neat, tidy, but underbaked.

864
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,640
But it's the colour,
you can see how pale that is.

865
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,600
[Prue] It's going to be really squashy.

866
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,040
- Shame, 'cause that's neat.
- [Prue] Hmm.

867
00:39:58,759 --> 00:40:02,960
[Matt] <i>Prue and Paul will now rank</i>
<i>the coconut macaroons from worst to best.</i>

868
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,520
In eleventh place is this one.

869
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,120
Rowan. Bit underbaked,

870
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,720
not very good piping, a little uneven.

871
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:15,759
And in tenth position,
we have this one. Whose is this?

872
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,359
Down to colour only, Peter.

873
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,520
In ninth place is this one.

874
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,279
This is a really common problem
of not baking it quite long enough.

875
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,600
In eighth, we have this one.
Whose is this?

876
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,319
They were very small and
needed a little bit longer in the oven.

877
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,880
[Noel] <i>Laura is seventh.</i>

878
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,839
<i>Sura, sixth.</i>

879
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,080
<i>Hermine, fifth, and Linda's fourth.</i>

880
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,640
And in third place is this one.
Who's that?

881
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,480
- Mak, these were absolutely excellent.
- Thank you.

882
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,799
In second, we have this one.

883
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:51,160
Loads of texture,
nice chocolate on the top.

884
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,240
Spot on.

885
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,839
Which leaves...

886
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,759
this one. Dave.

887
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,960
Really excellent macaroons.

888
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,000
Curd nice, even perfect.

889
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,080
Thank you.

890
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,960
[all clapping]

891
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,560
[imperceptible]

892
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,759
Came first in technical.
What an improvement from ninth last week.

893
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:13,400
Makes me feel
more confident going into tomorrow.

894
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,000
Spring in the step for the morning.

895
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,279
It's a bit of a fall from grace
after this morning.

896
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,799
And now I'm just terrified for tomorrow.

897
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
I can't believe
what just happened, second.

898
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,680
I was chaotic,
I was running behind everyone else.

899
00:41:25,759 --> 00:41:26,839
So, I'm delighted.

900
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,200
[Rowan] It wasn't my best moment.

901
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,359
They did slightly look
like the cat's lavatory.

902
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,160
[Mak] I'm feeling much better after that.

903
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,720
I think I've clawed
a bit back from this morning.

904
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:38,680
Er, so, it just
gives me hope for tomorrow.

905
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:47,319
[Noel] <i>There's just</i>
<i>the showstopper challenge left</i>

906
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,520
<i>before Prue and Paul
decide who'll be leaving the tent</i>

907
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,160
<i>and who's destined for Star Baker.</i>

908
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,359
Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your showstopper challenge.

909
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,200
Today, the judges would like you
to make a 3D biscuit table setting

910
00:42:06,279 --> 00:42:08,600
from a memorable meal you once had.

911
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,920
They want you to sculpt your biscuit dough

912
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,799
to make highly decorative
and realistic looking biscuits

913
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,520
that deceive the eye

914
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:20,120
into thinking they're teapots
or cups or knives, etc. You get my drift.

915
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,799
You can use any type
of biscuits, any flavours,

916
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,600
but remember this is a showstopper,

917
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,120
so it can't just look good,
it has to taste fantastic.

918
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,880
You have 100,000 hours.

919
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,160
- Four.
- 400,000 hours.

920
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,016
- Just four hours.
- Just four, you'll never make it.

921
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,200
- On your marks... Bake!
- Get set...

922
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,920
I'm feeling really good.
Gotta keep my cool. I'm pumping.

923
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,799
Yeah, I'm feeling relaxed.
I'm just gonna enjoy it.

924
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,440
I have so much to do,
and I am absolutely... bricking it.

925
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,920
It's the showstopper, we're asking
the bakers to complete a dinner set,

926
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,640
but it must be moulded.

927
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,920
Rather than having straight biscuits,

928
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,440
I'd like to see something that
shows they're utilising their biscuit

929
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,319
to shape 'round something,
to mould, to sculpt.

930
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,000
We want the bakers
to use their dough as clay

931
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,319
to get this balance between
beautiful objects and delicious biscuits.

932
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,960
The big issue the bakers are gonna have

933
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,279
is almost the volume
of biscuit needed to create the set.

934
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,720
It's bulk, batch-baking.

935
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:22,200
It's not going to be easy.

936
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:26,880
- Rowan, how you doing?
- Hello. So far, so good.

937
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,839
[all laughing]

938
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,920
- Right, table setting, what are you doing?
- Table setting.

939
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,240
I am doing a 90th birthday
breakfast tray for my great aunt.

940
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:39,120
So, the chocolate pot
is in the form of a lighthouse.

941
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,160
- Right.
- Hopefully with a flashing light.

942
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,040
- And then there are a couple of shell...
- [laughing]

943
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,319
...er, little plates.

944
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,359
[Matt] <i>Rowan's aiming high again,</i>

945
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,240
<i>with a maritime masterpiece he's hoping
will keep him clear of disaster.</i>

946
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:53,759
<i>His lemon biscuit
lighthouse hot chocolate pot</i>

947
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,480
<i>will be adorned with
Viennese biscuit sea creatures.</i>

948
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,440
- You've practised this?
- I have.

949
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,815
- [Paul] You've done it in the time?
- No.

950
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:00,720
Brilliant.

951
00:44:00,799 --> 00:44:01,680
[laughs]

952
00:44:01,759 --> 00:44:04,440
You <i>will</i> finish
this challenge, okay, in four hours.

953
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,120
I wanna see what you can do.

954
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,000
- That's what's frustrating.
- I know.

955
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,640
- Do you understand?
- I know. I'll do my very best.

956
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,600
[Laura] I'm just adding my spices.

957
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,720
I'm gonna put an extra
little bit in for good luck. [laughs]

958
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:18,560
[Noel] <i>To create a showstopper</i>
<i>that will wow the judges...</i>

959
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,680
[Dave] This is extra brute cocoa powder.

960
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:22,560
Gives it a richer chocolate taste.

961
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,480
[Noel] <i>...not only must</i>
<i>their biscuits be packed with flavour...</i>

962
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,560
There's 20 tablespoons of coffee.
Keep me going till lunchtime.

963
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,520
[Noel] <i>...it's vital they're</i>
<i>strong enough to hold their shape.</i>

964
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,839
Whenever someone says a moulded biscuit
or a structure with biscuit,

965
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,560
everyone jumps to gingerbread,

966
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,120
so it's gonna be tough to stand out today.

967
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,960
[Matt] <i>Peter's aiming</i>
<i>to grab the judges' attention</i>

968
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,520
<i>with a gingerbread haggis,</i>

969
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,319
<i>filled with Scottish raspberry
and oat cranachan cream.</i>

970
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,000
It is Scotland on a plate.
Scotland <i>as</i> a plate. [chuckles]

971
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,080
[Noel] <i>Mark's taken</i>
<i>his inspiration from much further afield.</i>

972
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,160
[Mark] My table setting
is an Ethiopian coffee ceremony.

973
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,520
I love it. Erm,
every time I'm in Ethiopia,

974
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,720
I have quite a lot of coffee.
I love coffee, yeah. Yeah.

975
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:05,000
[Noel] <i>Decorated with</i>
<i>striking geometric icing,</i>

976
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,799
<i>Mark's ceremonial coffee set will be
made of a cinnamon and coffee dough,</i>

977
00:45:08,879 --> 00:45:10,879
<i>darkened with edible charcoal powder.</i>

978
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,720
This is where it gets messy. [chuckles]

979
00:45:13,799 --> 00:45:15,400
This recipe suits me quite well

980
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,040
because I'm a messy baker, so it feels
nice to get stuck into something.

981
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,960
[Matt] <i>But he's not the only baker</i>
<i>opting for a dark dough.</i>

982
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,000
I am making a Viking table setting.

983
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,600
Vikings are just so cool,
they're just so badass.

984
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:33,359
[Matt] <i>Lottie's creating a charcoal and</i>
<i>gingerbread dining set fit for Valhalla,</i>

985
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,440
<i>the great hall in Norse mythology,</i>

986
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,759
<i>where heroes slain in battle
are welcomed into the afterlife.</i>

987
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:41,560
- Are you a Viking? Are you from...
- Secretly.

988
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,680
- No. I'm really not.
- No?

989
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,879
I'm 98% British.

990
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,815
- It's upsetting and boring.
- [Prue and Noel laugh]

991
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,120
If you mess this up, you won't
get into Valhalla, you know that?

992
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,160
And that's what worries me the most.

993
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,216
Let's see if we can open
the gates of Valhalla later.

994
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,240
[laughing]

995
00:45:54,279 --> 00:45:55,640
[Laura] The shaping is important.

996
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,279
It needs to look realistic,
not like a five-year-old's done it, which,

997
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,640
I'm not gonna lie,
is a challenge. [chuckles]

998
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,839
[Noel] <i>Sculpting biscuit dough will
not only test the bakers' creativity...</i>

999
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,000
[Lottie] This is what
stresses me out the most.

1000
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,600
[Noel] <i>...but will push</i>
<i>their technical know-how to the limit.</i>

1001
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,240
These are gonna stay in its mould,

1002
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,960
and when it's baked,
it should release straight away.

1003
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,720
[Noel] <i>Not only is it tricky to shape,</i>
<i>but can easily become tough if overworked.</i>

1004
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:21,640
[Rowan] This is the lighthouse,

1005
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,440
so I have found, if you foil it first,
it'll hopefully hold it all together.

1006
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,560
[Mark] This goes beyond baking knowledge

1007
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,000
and takes you into
the realms of how to be a potter.

1008
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,759
[Matt] <i>While most bakers</i>
<i>are shaping then baking,</i>

1009
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:37,279
<i>Mak is taking a unique approach.</i>

1010
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,160
[Mak] I'm not gonna be using moulds.

1011
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,839
So, that's interesting.
So, instead of moulding your biscuit,

1012
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,240
you are making all the pieces flat.

1013
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:47,879
- So they'll be like hexagonal.
- Well, square-shaped.

1014
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,879
[Matt] <i>Mak's using flat pack</i>

1015
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,879
<i>to create an art-deco style chai tea set</i>

1016
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,160
<i>with oblong teapot and cuboid cups.</i>

1017
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,600
How've you got on in practice?

1018
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,120
To be quite honest
with you, I have struggled.

1019
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,720
That's why I've actually
pared it down somewhat in the final bake.

1020
00:47:03,799 --> 00:47:06,040
It's better to do something
which you can achieve.

1021
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,200
That's right, yes.

1022
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:11,799
[Noel] <i>In contrast, Dave's aiming</i>
<i>to conjure up some magical curves.</i>

1023
00:47:11,879 --> 00:47:13,160
An Aladdin's saucer.

1024
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,560
So, they're gonna
look very similar to that.

1025
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,920
If I rub them, I'd wish for Star Baker.

1026
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,799
[Noel] <i>Taking his inspiration</i>
<i>from a trip to Mexico,</i>

1027
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:25,200
<i>Dave's coffee jugs will be part of a
chocolate and coffee flavour table setting</i>

1028
00:47:25,279 --> 00:47:27,600
<i>decorated with the colours
of the Mexican flag.</i>

1029
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,000
[Dave] Gotta have the flavour,

1030
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,720
but high detail, I think,
what they're after as well,

1031
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:33,680
so if I keep my cool, should be good.

1032
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,839
Are actually going in.

1033
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,879
[Matt] <i>Getting the larger pieces into</i>
<i>the oven as quickly as possible is vital...</i>

[Matt] <i>...to give the

<i>the multitude of smaller biscuit bakes.</i>

1037
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,680
[Lottie] This is the brandy snap.
Looks super healthy, doesn't it?

1038
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:53,920
I've got this embossing mat. It gives
a lovely lacy detail to the biscuit.

1039
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,160
[Linda] Just lift it up
and gently place it in the middle.

1040
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,799
Try to keep it as neat as you can.

1041
00:47:58,879 --> 00:48:00,440
[Dave] This is the amoretti biscuit.

1042
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,040
Want it to look like
a woven sort of placemat.

1043
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,920
These are delicious biscuits.
They've got cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger,

1044
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,960
and black pepper, so they are amazing.

1045
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,120
[Noel] <i>Sura's Ramadan tea set will be</i>
<i>made from a Dutch-style speculaas biscuit,</i>

1046
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,560
<i>each piece elaborately
decorated with intricate patterns.</i>

1047
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,600
[Sura] During Ramadan,
we always have people over.

1048
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,839
You break your fast,
after that you sit down for tea,

1049
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,680
and that's what it's based around,
that social vibe.

1050
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,279
[Matt] <i>However, favouring a more</i>
<i>solitary dining experience is Marc.</i>

1051
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,400
[Marc] This is the mug,
knife and spoon, and plate.

1052
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,640
Just a basic breakfast tea set for one.

1053
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,600
[Matt] <i>Marc will use</i>
<i>his experience as a sculptor</i>

1054
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,240
<i>to fashion his spiced ginger biscuit set,</i>

1055
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:45,080
<i>complete with toast rack and toast.</i>

1056
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,319
I've worked with woods
and metals for most of my life.

1057
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,759
It's different making
something out of biscuit. [chuckles]

1058
00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:54,160
- [Rowan] Right. Press on.
- [Hermine] They're ready to come out.

1059
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,056
[Dave] They look good.
Gotta keep my eye on stuff,

1060
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,616
lots of different things going on at once.

1061
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,920
[Peter] This is my haggis biscuit.

1062
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,319
It's still a bit bumpy,
but it is a sheep's stomach after all.

1063
00:49:03,879 --> 00:49:06,000
[Rowan] How does it look?
Rustic. Rustic's all right.

1064
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,680
[Mak] Before it cools down,
I need to make my shapes.

1065
00:49:08,759 --> 00:49:10,319
[Marc] They're looking okay.

1066
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,480
As long as it keeps going okay,
I'll be all right.

1067
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,440
[Mark] I'm happy with it.
I'll be decorating it in colourful icing.

1068
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,160
[Matt] Colourful icing? That was vague.

1069
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,120
- [Mark] Yeah.
- [Matt] Which is good.

1070
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,560
If you don't get it all done, you say,
"I was only supposed to do one blob there,

1071
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,279
a nipple there and a nipple there."

1072
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,616
- Exactly.
- They are like breasts.

1073
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,560
They are. There's no denying that.

1074
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,160
Just gonna get the next things in now.

1075
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,520
[Matt] <i>To create all the elements</i>
<i>for their complex biscuit constructions...</i>

1076
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,759
Right. Going in.

1077
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:35,600
[Matt] <i>...the bakers</i>
<i>must manage numerous batches...</i>

1078
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,120
[Peter] That's the trencher
that my haggis will sit on.

1079
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,319
[Matt] <i>...if they're to stand</i>
<i>any chance of finishing on time.</i>

1080
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,496
[Linda] They've come out nice.

1081
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,640
You've gotta be so careful
because they split very, very easily.

1082
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,720
It's very, very delicate biscuit.

1083
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,120
[Noel] <i>Inspired by</i>
<i>a high tea she had in Amsterdam,</i>

1084
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,400
<i>Linda's one of the few bakers
swerving sturdy gingerbread,</i>

1085
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,640
<i>gambling instead
on a delicate rosewater shortbread.</i>

1086
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,759
Everything you make is going to be
out of this very fragile short biscuit.

1087
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:03,976
- [Paul] Okay.
- [Prue] That's brave.

1088
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,960
- [chuckling]
- It is very brave.

1089
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,759
- You've gotta be brave. Go for it.
- Absolutely.

1090
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,640
Oh, God, I've got to unmould this.

1091
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,359
[Mak] I just need to
ease it into the plate.

1092
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,279
I don't wanna be giving them
a flat disc. [chuckles]

1093
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,399
[Noel] <i>The bakers</i>
<i>now face the critical task</i>

1094
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,120
<i>of separating
the delicate biscuit from the mould.</i>

1095
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,200
[Lottie] If this does break, I can
stick it back together badly with caramel,

1096
00:50:26,279 --> 00:50:28,040
but I don't have time
to faff about with it.

1097
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,799
[Noel] <i>They only get one chance.</i>

1098
00:50:29,879 --> 00:50:31,680
[Lottie] I just wanna get this out.

1099
00:50:31,759 --> 00:50:33,319
[Noel] <i>If the biscuits shatter,</i>

1100
00:50:33,399 --> 00:50:35,399
<i>so will their showstopper dreams.</i>

1101
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,080
Collateral damage.
That's why I made extras.

1102
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,600
[Rowan] I might cry if this breaks.

1103
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,200
Oh, for goodness sake!

1104
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,720
[Mak gasps] No!

1105
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,960
Broken there slightly.

1106
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,640
[Rowan] This is very delicate.

1107
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,359
Hardly dare breathe. [chuckles]

1108
00:50:54,799 --> 00:50:55,960
[Lottie] Oh!

1109
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,240
[Mak] I may have just
overbaked it by a minute or so.

1110
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,440
[Lottie] No way this is happening.

1111
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,480
Bakers, you have 200,000 hours left.

1112
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,200
- Time is ticking.
- [Noel] Two hours, you're halfway through.

1113
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:14,080
200,000 hours.

1114
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,879
Can't believe it's been two hours already.

1115
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,960
I'm gonna let that cool.
It has a bit of a shape to it.

1116
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,120
Oh.

1117
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,960
- [Laura] Let's get this tuile out.
- [Rowan] That looks done.

1118
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,319
I want to put it somewhere safe,
now it's made.

1119
00:51:26,399 --> 00:51:28,279
[Dave] That's my amoretti placemat.

1120
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:30,759
As it cools,
that'll go really nice and crunchy.

1121
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:33,359
- [timer beeps]
- These are done. Perfection.

1122
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,815
See how they've cracked at the top?

1123
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:35,839
[Linda] Happy with that.

1124
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,880
[Marc] Almost good enough to eat.

1125
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,480
[Hermine] My last one going in.

1126
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,839
[Mark] I had hoped to be
finished all my baking by now,

1127
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,375
but I've still got some things to finish.

1128
00:51:44,399 --> 00:51:48,200
[Lottie] I'm terrified because I've
completely lost track of what I'm doing.

1129
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:50,399
All I know is I've got half a boat there.

1130
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,520
Yeah, I've got so much to do.

1131
00:51:53,399 --> 00:51:55,000
[Laura] I'm in a good place.

1132
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,720
I'm making a three-tier cake stand,

1133
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:00,000
and I'm trying
to replicate an afternoon tea

1134
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,960
that I had for my
lovely nan's 80th birthday.

1135
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,879
[Matt] <i>Keen to do justice</i>

1138

[Laura] I've probably practised 15 times
in total.

1139
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,759
I've changed the recipe,
I've changed the design.

1140
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:18,520
I just hope it tastes nice.

<i>when it comes to tea time.</i>

1142

Sugar lace, I'm gonna use
for my tea canister.

1143
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,960
It's a showstopper
so one needs to be ambitious.

or are you not sure who he is?

[laughing]

1150
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,399

- Oh.

1152
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,160
Well, I'm being honest.

1153
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,359
Noel is one of Britain's
most popular children's entertainers.

1154

- [Sura] This is my last bit.
- [Mark] That's my baking done.

1155
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,000
Turning the oven off,
that feels really great.

[Matt] <i>As their biscuits cool,</i>

1158
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,319
I'm prepping the egg glaze.
It'll give that terra-cotta look.

1159
00:53:08,399 --> 00:53:10,680
[Laura] I've made my own fondant
out of marshmallows.

1160
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,440
I think that is spot-on.

1161
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,440
In here I've got some oatmeal,
whipped cream, raspberries, honey, whisky,

1162
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,960
and that's gonna be
my cranachan cream filling.

1163
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,879
I'm making really soft-set jam.
I want it to look like blood.

1164

- Bit dark.
- How long have we got left?

1165

- Bakers.
- [mimics echo] Bakers, bakers...

all the way through... [chuckles]

1173

[Dave] This is what's
gonna glue everything together.

1174
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,279
[Paul] The bakers this year
are very talented.

1175
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:48,319
I think it's quite a tricky challenge.

1176
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:50,440
It is. What I like is the theme.

1177
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,600
We've got a Ramadan tea
and we've got a Valhalla, Viking.

1178
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,080
If it sticks, great. [grunts]

- [Prue] Ethiopian one.

they can't taste the coffee.

Viennese lighthouse.

1182
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,120
[Rowan] Slightly ragged
but I'll trim it afterwards.

1183
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,759
They are very imaginative. It's nice.

1184
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:09,879
I made a spoon.

1185
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,240
No spoons today.

1186
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,600
A lot rides on this for a few people.
I'd like to see them all finish on time.

1187
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,240
[Lottie] I'm currently running
six minutes over.

1188
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,759
Yeah, this is tight.
Like, every minute counts.

1189
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:25,879
[Rowan] I'm hoping
I haven't given myself too much to do.

1190
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,680
Go as fast as I can without panicking.

1191
00:54:28,759 --> 00:54:31,200
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

1192
00:54:31,759 --> 00:54:33,120
This is gonna be a tight finish.

1193
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,560
Just wanna curl up in a ball
and die quietly.

1194
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,600
I've got to decorate everything.

1195
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,279
It's not really on right. [grunts]

1196
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,760
[Mark] It's about getting the angle right.

1197
00:54:43,799 --> 00:54:46,120
[Mak] Caramel,
it's difficult to work with.

1198
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,560
It sticks really quick and
if you've not got it right, it ruins it.

1199
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,799
Argh, look at this.
I need to wash my hands.

1200
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:53,879
[exhales]

1201
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:58,080
Do you know what, it's not perfect,
but at this stage it's the best I can do.

1202
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,759
[Linda] I'm just airbrushing
a bit of silver on them

1203
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,759
to try and build colour bit by bit.

1204
00:55:02,839 --> 00:55:06,759
The colour's the most important bit,
'cause Mexico is vibrant and colourful.

1205
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:09,319
Putting some royal icing on my cups.

1206
00:55:09,399 --> 00:55:11,879
Green is the colour
of the tea set I was given.

1207
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,279
[Rowan] This is royal icing.
It dries very quickly.

1208
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,920
This is meant to be rough.

1209
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,040
[Mak] I'm not happy with this.
I've gone for a terra-cotta,

1210
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,920
but it's looking like a pinky-orange.

1211
00:55:22,399 --> 00:55:24,680
[Linda] Oh, this is my favourite part.

1212
00:55:24,759 --> 00:55:26,560
[Noel] This could be your challenge.

1213
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,920
I hope so. Depends what it tastes like,
Noel, doesn't it?

1214
00:55:30,759 --> 00:55:32,560
- [exhales]
- And breathe.

1215
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,160
[Lottie] Let's just decorate.

1216
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,799
[Mark] Rushing, hate this.

1217
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:38,520
[Laura] Can't stop my hand from shaking.

1218
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,680
[Sura] No, I'm not working to a design.

1219
00:55:40,759 --> 00:55:42,640
I don't know what I'm doing,
if I'm honest.

1220
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,879
Hopefully I can put
a bit of fondant rim on it once it dries.

1221
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,000
I'm doing a semi-flood on this biscuit.

1222
00:55:50,399 --> 00:55:51,799
[Rowan] Oh, it's cracked.

1223
00:55:51,879 --> 00:55:53,200
It's been in a storm, this pot.

1224
00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:55,200
It's getting more and more rustic.

1225
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,600
Good. Let's try and work quicker.

1226
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,120
[Marc] Just got the red dots to add.
Attention to detail.

1227
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,799
- [exhales]
- I enjoy the finishing touch,

1228
00:56:03,879 --> 00:56:04,879
make it look pretty.

1229
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,560
I've literally had to say in my head,
"Green, white, red. Green, white, red."

1230
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,720
The spout was always a risky part.
Oh, dear, dear, dear...

1231
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,960
[Lottie] This looks like
a child's done it.

1232
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,656
This is the most stressed
I've ever seen you.

1233
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,279
- Yeah, yeah...
- Shall I go?

1234
00:56:18,359 --> 00:56:20,640
- Could you?
- Is that what you're trying to say?

1235
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,879
Just be blunt with me,

1236
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,080
- I'm thick-skinned.
- I'm ready for you to leave now.

1237
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,200
- You're just in the way.
- [laughs]

1238
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,040
I'll get that on my CV,
"You're just in the way."

1239
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,560
The teapot is so gaudy,
they're gonna say, "This is disgusting."

1240
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,799
[Laura] Right, come on, last push.

1241
00:56:35,879 --> 00:56:38,720
- That's my structure.
- [Linda] This is my teapot,

1242
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:39,960
very delicate.

1243
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,799
[Matt] They look square.

1244
00:56:41,879 --> 00:56:43,720
- [Mak] They are square.
- Square teacups?

1245
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:45,960
- [Mak] Yes.
- [Matt] Is the tea square?

1246
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,799
It's sort of a loose leaf.

1247
00:56:47,879 --> 00:56:50,480
[Rowan] Okay, that feels fairly robust.

1248
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,496
- Fingers crossed.
- [Peter] I'm filling my haggis

1249
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,319
with some cranachan, and that's it.

1250
00:56:54,399 --> 00:56:55,799
[Dave] They're all done now.

1251
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,240
- [Mak] I know it's not brilliant.
- Bakers, you have one minute left.

1252
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:03,160
What can I do
in one minute with gold leaf?

1253
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,480
[Laura] Just shaking so much.

1254
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,919
[Mark] Is time about to be up?

1255
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,640
Bakers, your time is up.

1256
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,720
[exhales]

1257
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,480
[Lottie] I think that'll do.
[blows raspberry]

1258
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,000
[Mark] God, the pressure
in this tent doing that.

1259
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,520
Super happy. That went really well.

1260
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,120
I think Paul will be pleased.
It's largely finished.

1261
00:57:38,879 --> 00:57:42,640
[Noel] <i>It's judgement time</i>
<i>for the bakers' showstoppers.</i>

1262
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,240
Rowan, would you like
to bring up your showstopper?

1263
00:57:48,279 --> 00:57:50,799
I'm calling this
Worse Things Happen at Sea.

1264
00:57:50,879 --> 00:57:52,879
[all laughing]

1265
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,359
- We did get your flashing lighthouse.
- You get the flashing lighthouse.

1266
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,200
[Paul] It looks like a lighthouse.

1267
00:57:58,279 --> 00:58:00,200
It does look a bit smaller than
a lighthouse.

1268
00:58:00,279 --> 00:58:02,080
- [laughing]
- [Paul] Little bit.

1269
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,160
- [Matt] Yeah.
- [Prue] Is this gingerbread?

1270
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,799
It's all a lemon...

1271
00:58:05,879 --> 00:58:06,879
Biscuit.

1272
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,879
Lovely flavour.

1273
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,480
[Paul] That's been worked so much.

1274
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,576
- [Prue] Too thick.
- Tastes like rubber, it's a shame.

1275
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,120
'Cause the flavour's not bad.

1276
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,359
[Prue] I feel it's not your best, Rowan.

1277
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,799
I know you can do more.
It's a bit disappointing.

1278
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,919
It's got a bit of a Roger Hargreaves vibe.

1279
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,879
- [Matt] Hmm.
- [Paul] It looks brilliant.

1280
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,200
The toast, the rack, the knife,

1281
00:58:34,279 --> 00:58:37,359
the way that you've done the buttercream
and that, looks great.

1282
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,600
Thank you very much.

1283
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:45,160
Because it's thick, which it needed to be
for the middle of the toast,

1284
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,600
- it's squishy in the middle.
- Okay.

1285
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,319
- [Prue] But I like that.
- Overall,

1286
00:58:49,399 --> 00:58:51,560
- you've done an amazing job.
- Thank you.

1287
00:58:53,399 --> 00:58:56,120
[Paul] They're a bit clumsy,
but they're all uniform

1288
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,799
and I like the colour on the outside.

1289
00:58:57,879 --> 00:58:59,919
It's beautiful.
It looks as if you sprayed it on.

1290
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Thank you.

1291
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,240
I'm not convinced on the flavour.

1292
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:06,960
It's all quite bitter, isn't it?

1293
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,640
See, it's gotta taste good
as well as look good.

1294
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,399
Underneath this is a stand
which you've just put this on the top of.

1295
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,319
I'm not convinced
that that's had a lot of work in it.

1296
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,240
- Lovely flavour.
- [Paul] The flavour of the biscuit's nice.

1297
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:29,000
It's got a kick to it from the spices,
but in four hours,

1298
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,160
I'd wanted something a little bit neater.

1299
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,240
[Prue] You've certainly made it
very pretty.

1300
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,359
It really is extremely well done.

1301
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,040
The biscuit has been worked
a little bit too much.

1302
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,080
The texture's not quite there.

1303
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,416
It was always gonna be an issue
with shortbread,

1304
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,600
but I think the design is very pretty.

1305
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,000
- [Prue] It certainly looks very African.
- Scruffy, but it looks the part.

1306
00:59:59,759 --> 01:00:00,919
[coughs] Love it.

1307
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,799
[laughing]

1308
01:00:02,879 --> 01:00:04,560
- Strong, innit?
- [Prue] It's lovely.

1309
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,120
- Very strong coffee flavour.
- I like that flavour, don't you?

1310
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,799
- [Prue] Hmm.
- [Paul] Never had anything like it before.

1311
01:00:09,879 --> 01:00:11,600
You'll be awake all night, Paul.

1312
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,480
I love the colours.

1313
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,560
- It's so Mexican. It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

1314
01:00:17,399 --> 01:00:18,600
[Paul] That is remarkable.

1315
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,759
We were looking for form
and shaping and moulding,

1316
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,799
- I think you've done an amazing job.
- Thank you.

1317
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,480
It's very believable.

1318
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,480
That is lovely.

1319
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,680
Thank you.

1320
01:00:30,759 --> 01:00:33,000
- Mmm.
- That's actually delicious, yeah.

1321
01:00:33,879 --> 01:00:36,040
Overall, you've done a really good job.

1322
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,120
Thank you.

1323
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,160
We were looking for moulding,
you've gone flat.

1324
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,759
I know that the teapot's not moulded,

1325
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,359
but I like the look of it.

1326
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,200
That looks a bit bendy.

1327
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:57,799
I like the flavour.

1328
01:00:58,359 --> 01:00:59,359
[Paul] Not much ginger.

1329
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,200
It's not a bad flavour, though.

1330
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:03,919
I just think
the whole thing's a bit clumsy.

1331
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,600
You needed more care, to be more precise.

1332
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,080
- Thank you, Mak.
- [Mak] Thank you.

1333
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,640
[Paul] It looks rushed to me.
You're normally very neat.

1334
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,720
That's not neat.

1335
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:20,279
- It's just the icing that is rushed.
- I agree.

1336
01:01:20,359 --> 01:01:22,480
Great flavour, though. Great snap.

1337
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,440
- [Sura] Thank you.
- Really crispy. Delicious.

1338
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,240
- Hmm. Very good.
- Really nice.

1339
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:27,879
- [Prue] Thank you.
- Thank you.

1340
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,960
I like that. It looks very neat.
It's quite effective.

1341
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,480
- [Prue] So that's the cranachan.
- Mmm-hmm.

1342
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,319
The mixture of oatmeal,
whisky, raspberries...

1343
01:01:38,399 --> 01:01:39,440
Honey and cream.

1344
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,200
- Mmm. It's delic...
- [chuckles]

1345
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,399
You couldn't finish the word delicious,
it was so delicious.

1346
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,240
- [Noel] Prue's in ecstasy. [chuckles]
- [Prue] It's very witty.

1347
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,399
And actually, the biscuit's beautiful.

1348
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,000
It's well baked, it's tasty.

1349
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,680
- I think you've done a great job.
- Thank you very much.

1350
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:02,000
[Prue] It's very impressive.

1351
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:06,240
I think the boat's there,
it's a shame you ran out of time

1352
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:09,279
'cause it's gone all over the place,
but you've moulded it nicely.

1353
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,640
Erm, the plate looks a bit rough.

1354
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:15,640
It is Viking, it's been under the ground
for the last 500 years or something.

1355
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,720
Thanks, Prue.

1356
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,496
[Prue] It's good gingerbread.

1357
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,960
Very crisp, lovely flavour,
lots of ginger.

1358
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,399
It has got a nice flavour to it.

1359
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,160
- Overall, you've done a decent job.
- Very good.

1360
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,080
I think they could see the vision,
which is reassuring.

1361
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,600
[exhales]

1362
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,720
I reckon I got away with that.
Flavours might pull me through.

1363
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,440
[Mak] Biscuit Week wasn't my strongest.

1364
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,520
If I do make it through this round,
it'd be some kind of miracle.

1365
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,720
Hopefully, you know, the judges
will look favourably upon me.

1366
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,240
[Rowan] I think my position
is more than precarious, really.

1367
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,839
I think it's completely tipped over
onto the slidey slope to,

1368
01:02:53,919 --> 01:02:55,200
er, oblivion.

1369
01:02:59,279 --> 01:03:01,560
[Matt] <i>It's decision time</i>
<i>for Prue and Paul.</i>

1370
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,520
<i>Who'll be named Star Baker
and who will leave the tent?</i>

1371
01:03:06,279 --> 01:03:09,279
So who do you think did the best
in that last challenge?

1372
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:12,480
- [Paul] David's was very good.
- Absolutely lovely.

1373
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,200
I adored it and then I liked...

1374
01:03:14,279 --> 01:03:15,440
- [Noel] Mark R.
- ...Mark.

1375
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,839
- His Ethiopian tea set.
- [Matt] Marc E had a really good week.

1376
01:03:18,919 --> 01:03:20,480
- I really loved that.
- Very clever.

1377
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,720
The texture, the look, it's very neat.

1378
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,000
- [Matt] Hmm.
- So the Marks...

1379
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,560
Top marks for the Marks.

1380
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:26,720
[laughing]

1381
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,295
[Paul] We've got a few people in the mix

1382
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:29,759
- for Star Baker.
- [Matt] Hmm.

1383
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,399
But when it comes to who's going home,

1384
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,799
it's difficult between Mak and Rowan.

1385
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,480
Which of those two do you think is
the most likely to improve if they stay?

1386
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:42,240
Well, I have to say Rowan
doesn't seem to take any advice.

1387
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,919
Paul has been saying to him,

1388
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,399
"Try not to promise too much."

1389
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,080
"And, for goodness sake, finish."

1390
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,759
[chuckling] He hasn't done it once yet.

1391
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:51,759
You just want his execution to be better

1392
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,879
- because he has great ideas.
- I know.

1393
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,720
On the other hand, Mak is steady, good...

1394
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,879
- But he's not blowing your mind.
- Yeah.

1395
01:03:59,439 --> 01:04:01,120
I sense that you're torn.

1396
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,279
We'd better leave you
to make your decision.

1397
01:04:08,839 --> 01:04:12,160
Fortunately for me, I've got
the great job of announcing

1398
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,839
who is Star Baker.

1399
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,919
And Star Baker this week is...

1400
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,040
Dave.

1401
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,279
- [all clapping]
- Thank you.

1402
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:26,799
Well done, you.

1403
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:29,480
Thank you. Thank you.

1404
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,399
So it falls to me

1405
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,120
to announce
who will be going home this week.

1406
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,680
I've never done it before
and I've been dreading this moment.

1407
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:39,680
I will say that it was very close.

1408
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,080
And it involved a lot of discussion.

1409
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,680
But I'm afraid to say the baker
going home this week is...

1410
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,120
- Mak.
- Thank you.

1411
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,560
[Mark] Sorry, man.

1412
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,375
I was expecting that, thank you very much.

1413
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:01,439
- Unlucky, Mak.
- Okay, no, no, it's okay.

1414
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,759
I just felt in my bones that it was me.

1415
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:05,960
I know that I gave everything.

1416
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,720
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna miss you.

1417
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:09,919
It was a privilege to be here,

1418
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,200
meeting new people, making new friends.

1419
01:05:12,279 --> 01:05:13,319
It's just been amazing.

1420
01:05:13,399 --> 01:05:15,720
Oh, Mak, honestly, I'm astonished.

1421
01:05:15,799 --> 01:05:18,080
My ideas saved me this week.

1422
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,799
- The last, last chance saloon.
- I did my... I tried my hardest.

1423
01:05:22,879 --> 01:05:24,359
Just rein it in a little bit.

1424
01:05:24,439 --> 01:05:25,720
[Rowan] Going into next week,

1425
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:29,359
I'll hope to manage the technical side
of things rather better.

1426
01:05:29,439 --> 01:05:32,439
I'm happy that I'm through
but I'm really gutted that Mak's gone.

1427
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,520
He's such a lovely guy. It hurts.

1428
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,040
I'm gonna miss him.

1429
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,080
Can't believe it. I'm through! [laughs]

1430
01:05:39,919 --> 01:05:42,439
The coffee was strong
and they got a kick from it.

1431
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,960
It's nice to hear that I'm probably
keeping Paul and Prue up all night.

1432
01:05:46,919 --> 01:05:48,839
[laughs]

1433
01:05:48,919 --> 01:05:50,160
It's been a good week for me.

1434
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,000
I'm ecstatic. That was amazing.
Super happy.

1435
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,240
Yeah!

1436
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:56,759
I'm Star Baker this week.

1437
01:05:56,839 --> 01:05:59,160
- [woman over phone] <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- I know.

1438
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,319
<i>- No way!</i>
- Yeah, I can't believe it.

1439
01:06:01,399 --> 01:06:02,919
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

1440
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,640
[Dave] What an end to the week.

1441
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,319
[cheers] <i>Well done!</i>

1442
01:06:07,399 --> 01:06:09,279
