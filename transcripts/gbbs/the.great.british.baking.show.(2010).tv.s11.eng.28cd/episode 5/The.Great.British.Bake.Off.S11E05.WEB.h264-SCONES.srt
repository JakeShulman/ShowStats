1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,360
...Hello. Guess what? It's pastry week.
Are you excited for pastry week, Noel?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,800
...I am. Prue's made us all these
fabulous pastries

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,880
to get us in the mood.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,560
Try one of these. They're
delish delosh.... I certainly will.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,080
...PASTRY WHINES
...Don't eat me. I'm nice.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,400
...Did you hear something? No.... Oh!

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,640
...PASTRY SPEAKS... Murderer.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,680
...Welcome... to
The Great British Bake Off.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,960
Last time...... Ready, steady...

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
.....the bakers faced chocolate week...
...They're a bit raw.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,720
.....and collectively ballsed up the
basics.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,576
...This looks like they've been
dropped.... Yeah.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,400
...They fought back with stunning
celebration cakes...

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,960
...The overall appearance, I think, is
spectacular.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,800
.....but Lottie still found herself in
the firing line.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,720
...It's overbaked.... Although in the end

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,800
it was Sura..... You have raw dough.

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,720
.....who bit the bullet.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,880
Now, midway through the
competition...

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,560
...Halfway to paradise.

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,720
.....the bakers face the perils of
pastry week.

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,280
...It's bonkers.

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,080
...Taking on some of the most intricate
challenges...

24
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,560
...There's so many steps in this.

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,720
.....ever set.... This is definitely the
hardest so far.

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,120
...Making architecture edible,

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,960
but the wrong kind of flaky...

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,680
...Just really baffled.

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,480
...This is a joke...can see the best
of plans...

30
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,800
...This is what this entire bake hinges
on.

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,480
...This is horrendous.

32
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,240
.....come crashing down.

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,240
...It's pastry week!

34
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,600
This is the week that I wanted to get to
because I know that I can make pastry.

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,840
You know, lots of us mums can make
pastry.

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,080
...I can finally say that I am looking
forward to pastry week.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,000
It is my week!

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,640
...Halfway has suddenly crept up on us,
hasn't it?

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,200
It feels bizarre that we're already
at this point, yeah.

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,360
We're so far through, um, exciting
though.

41
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,760
...I do like making pastry, but I
have to say this is definitely

42
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,080
one of the weeks where a lot could
go wrong.

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,960
Nobody wants a soggy bottom.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,640
Got a crisp bottom.

45
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,240
...I feel apprehensive, actually, about
pastry.

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,320
The judges are saying they want to
see a bit more refinement from me.

47
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,880
So, I want to show them that I can
do elegant. Yeah.

48
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,240
...Good morning, bakers. Welcome back
to the tent

49
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,000
for pastry week.

50
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,760
And it's time for your
Signature Challenge.

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,720
Today, Paul and Prue would like you
each to make your version

52
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,920
of the Cornish national dish -
the pasty.

53
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,000
...You need to make eight identical
pasties.

54
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,600
You can use any pastry or filling
you choose,

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,400
but feel free to personalise them
with a decorative finish.

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,160
...They need to be at least 15cm long,
but they can be any shape you like.

57
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,720
Noel, what shape would yours be?

58
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,000
...Mine would be in the shape of Paul
Hollywood's powerful buttocks.

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,560
Mmm, delish delosh.

60
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,000
You have two hours... On your marks..
...Get set... bake!

61
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,040
...Hello, hello, pasties.

62
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,920
...Puff pastry will make a good pasty.

63
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,320
...Nice and buttery.

64
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,040
...Packed with filling.

65
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,760
...Why did they have to say it's the
Cornish national dish?

66
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,760
Just to give me more pressure?

67
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,840
...It's pastry week. Most of our
challenges are pure baking
challenges.

68
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,920
This time, the bakers have to be
good cooks too

69
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,000
because what's going inside the
pasty takes real cooking.

70
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,240
...The trick is choosing your pastry
and your filling wisely.

71
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,600
You don't want it to be too dry.

72
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,240
As you bite into the pasty, the buttery layer
from the shell must be nice and thin, crisp y.

73
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,640
And then inside, as you hit that filling, you
want a bit of moisture in there as well.</c>

74
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,520
...It doesn't have to be
a Cornish pasty shape,

75
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,960
it can be any shape they like,
but we want crimping.

76
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,200
...Halfway through now, and I expect the
bakers really to start pushing themselves

77
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,680
and coming up with some ingenious
ways to really impress the judges.

78
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,280
...I want to eat the best
pasties I've ever had.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,320
...Hello, Laura... Morning... Hello,
Laura...Making a mess again, I see... Yep.

80
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,600
...Tell us about your pasty.

81
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,480
...So, I'm going quite traditional.
I'm doing a cheese and onion pasty.

82
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,000
...Paul just said to me, not 30 seconds ago, that he
likes a cheese and onion pasty.... Oh, reall ...y?

83
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,880
...Laura's pimping her
traditional cheese and onion filling

84
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,120
with leeks,
cream and fresh thyme,

85
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,000
and she's aiming to impress
with her choice of pastry too.

86
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,840
...I'm doing a cheats puff pastry learnt from a book
from a very famous baker called Paul Hol ...lywood.

87
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,560
I think you'll do well on this
challenge.... You reckon?

88
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,936
...Well, if it all falls to bits,
it's his fault, isn't it? Yeah.

89
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,920
...I'm not taking the blame. Good luck,
Laura.

90
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,680
...Thank you,
thanks.... Thank you.

91
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,760
...I just can't mess it up.

92
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,240
...But she's not the only baker
taking a risk making rough puff.

93
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,640
...Flaky pastry. It doesn't
matter how you get there, right?

94
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,080
...Lottie, Peter and Linda are all using
it to reimagine the traditional pasty.

95
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,560
...You're meant to see
streaks of butter in your pastry.

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,120
...I'm doing an envelope fold. An
envelope fold, letter fold. I don't know.

97
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,040
...Whilst rivals Marc, Mark,
and Dave are making a sturdy short crust.

98
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,880
...You could overwork it.
You don't want it to turn tough.

99
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,440
...But Hermine is creating a
pastry that is entirely her own.

100
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,080
...It's not quite a puff pastry,
but it's not a short pastry either.

101
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,400
I kind of wanted
best of both worlds.

102
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,280
...Hermine's hybrid
pastry will be packed with a

103
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,520
tangy Moroccan
spiced lamb tagine

104
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,920
and chickpea filling.

105
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,400
...I think it sounds absolutely delicious.
As long as the pastry doesn't fall to bits.

106
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,680
...Thank you.

107
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,240
...How much chilli have I
got? I haven't got too much.

108
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,600
...Planning to pack a punch
with his pasties is Mark.

109
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:14,640
...So, I am doing aloo gobi and paneer pasties, which
will be spiced with lots of turmeric, c ...umin,

110
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,080
...coriander,
lots of ginger and garlic.

111
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,600
So, a lot going on in this.

112
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,320
...Mark's Indian inspired
cauliflower and paneer pasties

113
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,560
will even come
with spiced pastry,

114
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,520
as he tries to CURRY favour
with Paul and Prue again.

115
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,520
...Last week - Star Baker.
How do you feel today?

116
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,040
...It feels great coming into this week,
but definitely the nerves don't go away.

117
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,960
...That's the sad thing. Star
Baker doesn't guarantee anything.

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,600
...No.... Look at them trying to take it away
from you already.... I know, already, yeah.

119
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,520
...You know you have to
prove yourself every time.

120
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,920
...Exactly, yeah. Absolutely.

121
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,000
...Really, really grateful for the smell of
fish this early in the morning. Is that you?

122
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,160
...That's going crazy.

123
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,320
...Getting the
pasty fillings right...

124
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,080
...Oh, that's gorgeous.

125
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,840
.....is just as crucial as
producing flawless pastry...

126
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,160
...You can never have too
much cheese. A bit more?

127
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,760
Just work it all in.

128
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,440
.....incredible flavours..

129
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,160
...Not sure I can fit any
more spices in these.

130
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,720
.....must be complimented
with a perfectly balanced texture.

131
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,080
...I'm happy with that.

132
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,440
...I am making toad
in the hole pasties.

133
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,520
I'm actually calling it
toad-in-the-hole-less pasty

134
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,000
cos I wasn't really sure what was
the toad and what was the hole.

135
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,240
...Lottie's take on this old
favourite will see mashed potato,

136
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,800
onion, sage and fennel gravy,
and Lincolnshire sausage

137
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,560
packed into her pasty.

138
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,680
...Oh,
Lottie. I am not totally convinced by this.

139
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,440
One,
I think it could be really stodgy

140
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,280
or soggy - mash and gravy and...

141
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,600
...I think it sounds delicious. ...It does,
yeah.

142
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,336
...Lottie...... Love toad-in-the-hole.
.....you're always original.... Thank you.

143
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,040
I'll take that.... I have hope,
if not faith.

144
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,040
...Thanks, Prue,
that's all I need.

145
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,600
Do you know what? I'm going to take that with me -
home probably - but still I am going to t ...ake it.

146
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,680
Bakers,
weirdly we are already halfway through.

147
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,960
...Wow! Where does the time go?

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,280
...Into a small bum bag
that Paul Hollywood wears.

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,160
That's where time goes, kids.

150
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,680
...I'm just worried about time now,
to be honest. It really is disappearing.

151
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,680
...I think this is my third
turn. Can't go too many.

152
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,240
More turns, more lamination.

153
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,280
...If making perfect pastry
isn't time consuming enough,

154
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,200
Pete is planning on sculpting
a whole school of fish pasties.

155
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,200
...I'm saying these pasties are in the shape of
a haddock cos I've got smoked haddock in ...it.

156
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,960
...But it's more shaped
like just generic fish.

157
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,640
...His carefully crafted
pasties will be filled with

158
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,200
the haddock and kedgeree rice

159
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,080
and have a boiled egg centre.

160
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,960
And come complete
with puff pastry scales.

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,280
Do you even slightly think
about getting to the final? Yeah.

162
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,960
You want to do the best you can.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,480
...So much. It's
burning you up inside.

164
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,120
It's why I love you because
you're really competitive.

165
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,600
I'd be like that.

166
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,880
Peter's not the only baker hoping to secure
victory by giving pasties a whole new look.</c>

167
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,000
...They're going to be in
the shape of a samosa.

168
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,760
We've been to Goa
a couple of times.

169
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,520
I used to walk quite
a way in the morning

170
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,080
just to get these samosas
that were absolutely beautiful.

171
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,200
...Linda's Goan inspired pasties
will be filled with spiced chicken,

172
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,760
coriander and potato,

173
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,200
with a design flourish that is
not leaving anything to fate.

174
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,880
...I'm going to attempt to
put a little karma symbol...

175
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,120
...Oh, OK,
nice...in Nigella seeds.

176
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,400
Also,
I am hoping that it does stay there.

177
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,440
...If you don't mark this highly,
it's gonna come back at you.... Yeah.

178
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,720
Dave's also taking
inspiration from his travels.

179
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,720
...My filling's based on a
meal that I had out in Thailand.

180
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,120
So,
this is a Thai chilli basil chicken pasty.

181
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,640
...Dave's chicken
and jasmine rice filling

182
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,280
will come with a sweet chilli
dipping sauce on the side.

183
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,640
And his pasties will be
decorated with chilli motifs.

184
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,160
...They're not too hot.
They're bird's eye chillies.

185
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,560
It gives the pasty a kick rather
than an over-powering chilli taste.

186
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,320
...So, now I am on to rolling out my pastry
and cutting out the shapes for my pasties.

187
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,760
...Hopefully that's rested.

188
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,760
...With 45 minutes
of the bake left...

189
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,600
...I'm not being
too precise about it.

190
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,840
.....the bakers must carefully
manage every remaining second.

191
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,960
...I want to get them nice and thin, but
taking me absolute ages to get these right.

192
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,680
...The more time spent
on building their pasties...

193
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,280
...I've got to make sure the filling is completely
cold before I add it into the pastry ...,

194
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,256
...else it's just going to
melt the pastry completely.

195
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,960
.....the less time
they'll get in the oven.

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,200
...A fairly generous amount
of filling goes in there.

197
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,560
That is quite tasty,
actually, I must admit.

198
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,920
...I've got to be mindful
not to put too much on,

199
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,000
which is what I normally do,
and then struggle to crimp it.

200
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,760
...Having set up
home in the south-west,

201
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,440
Marc's got a lot riding on his
reinterpretation of the iconic pasty.

202
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,136
...You are from Cornwall, aren't you?
I know. No pressure there, is there?

203
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,680
Technically, though, I'm from up north. So,
that's my get-out clause if they go wrong ....

204
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,360
...No, you are representing Cornwall. ...You won't be
able to go back. ...No, they won't let me bac ...k in.

205
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Marc's paying homage to the Cornish coast with
a monkfish, samphire creamy lemon sauce fill ing

206
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,960
encased in a shortcrust shell,
sealed with traditional pleated crimps.

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,080
How many pleats are you doing?

208
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,880
...I don't know.
As many as I can.

209
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,280
...OK.... Should there be a set...? ...There is
a set number, yeah.... Is there really? Yeah.

210
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,200
I'm not going to tell you now.

211
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,960
It's down to the bakers how many
crimps they use to seal their pasties.

212
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,840
...Apparently,
the perfect Cornish pastry's got 20 crimps.

213
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,080
...We don't want none of that on it,
really.

214
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,200
...It's just typically
samosa style.

215
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,960
...My technique is press the
pastry over itself using your fingers,

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,400
and hope it looks like a crimp.

217
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,120
...Yeah, it's a bit messy.

218
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,760
This is now melting because it's
been out of the freezer too long.

219
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,280
...That's the last one.

220
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,680
...I'm just giving it an eggwash. It gives a really
nice sort of glaze and shine on the pasti ...es.

221
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,920
I like to imagine that when Paul
has a bath, he has a bath of eggwash.

222
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,200
That's how he gets
that nice bronze look.

223
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,400
...I am adding on some
wee scales quite slapdash.

224
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,440
...I know that they're supposed to be really
nicely neat, but I'd rather they were cooked ....

225
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,440
...Right, going in.

226
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,040
...I'm going to put them in for
35 minutes and check them.

227
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,400
...How long do we have left?

228
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,480
...Bakers,
you've got minutes left. Don't make a bet.

229
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,320
...I won't have time
for highly decorated.

230
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,160
...This is for the
chillies on the top.

231
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,680
...Don't have time so they're
going to go in as they are.

232
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,200
...I was going to put a little... Karma sign on
them...yeah, but I can just get the seeds o ...n.

233
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,280
...At least get some in the oven,
you know?

234
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,760
...Let's not have that speak.... No, that's
true.... You're going to get them all out.

235
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,680
Do you know why?
Because you're Linda -

236
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,200
the inventor of the karma pasty.

237
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,120
...What will be,
will be on that lot.

238
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,216
...I'm going to give them 20 minutes at
200 and then I'll reduce the temperature.

239
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,640
Let's hope they cook.

240
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,320
...Bakers,
you've got 15 minutes.

241
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,960
...Well, 15 minutes left and I
need another 20 minutes, so...

242
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,320
..that doesn't really add up,
does it?

243
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,840
...It is cooked inside,
but you also need the nice brown colour.

244
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,480
...Oh,
God. I'm going to need a miracle.

245
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,080
...I just put another eggwash on
because they aren't very golden.

246
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,040
...I don't know whether to turn them off, or
if that's a bad idea. ...I've got it on 250!

247
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,560
It's like a pizza oven in there.

248
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,320
...How's it going? All right.... Any
leakage? Yeah, all the leakage.

249
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,960
The butter is literally melting out and they're not
crimped properly.... Good sign? No, not ...great.

250
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,880
...This is a Thai sweet
chilli dipping sauce.

251
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,760
Bring that to a boil, come on.

252
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,000
...Still a little bit pale. I
want them to be a bit darker.

253
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,320
...Bakers,
you have five minutes left!

254
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,600
...All right. I'm coming out.

255
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,640
...I think these
bad boys are done.

256
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,720
...Crispy underneath. They
look like fish and they're pasties.

257
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,120
...I'm going to
swap them around.

258
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,840
...Oh, God.

259
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,280
...Bakers, you have one minute.

260
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,160
...OK, I'm coming out.

261
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,120
...Please tell me when
there's 30 seconds.

262
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,720
...I'll take them out at
the very last second.

263
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,520
...My cousin made these
toads for toad-in-the-hole.

264
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,280
...Right, here we come.

265
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,240
...Ugh.... Bakers,
your time is up.

266
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,840
Stop what you're doing, place your
pasties at the end of your work stations.

267
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,680
...Ooh!

268
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,320
...Rustic is good for pasties,
right?

269
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,640
...That's as fine as
you can be with a pasty.

270
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,080
...I'm thinking it's a
shame there's no crimp.

271
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,880
...The bakers' signature
pasties are about to face

272
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,720
Pastry Week's first judging.

273
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,616
...Hey, Prue, Paul.... Hello,
Marc. ...Hey, Marc.... Hello.

274
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,176
...You have the weight of the
whole of Cornwall on your shoulders.

275
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,520
...I certainly have,
which is making me a bit nervous.

276
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,600
...You are lacking on
the number of pleats.

277
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,800
...How many should there be?

278
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,720
...I think it's 20 or 21.
...I was getting close.

279
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,176
...I think you are about seven
or eight short.... Yeah.... Yeah.

280
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,240
The biggest one for me is the colour,
cos they look a bit pale.

281
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,360
Especially this one here,
you haven't brushed it properly.

282
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,920
Flavour is good,
but it's bone dry.

283
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,496
You had cream in
that as well.... Yeah.

284
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,936
...Probably a little
bit more cream.

285
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,520
That would have really given
you more moisture in the mouthful.

286
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,120
It is a little bit too dry for
me. ...OK.... Lovely pastry.

287
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,720
I think if you'd done
it faster and hotter,

288
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,000
you might have kept a
little more of the colour.

289
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,680
...OK.

290
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,560
...The overall look of this one
is fantastic. It is like a flatfish.

291
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,280
It looks great.

292
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,160
...I was a bit worried
it would be stodgy,

293
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,920
but, in fact,
it's certainly not.

294
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,880
If anything, it's a bit dry.

295
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,720
...There's a nice
kick of flavour there,

296
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,320
but, unfortunately,
you've got rice sitting on a pastry,

297
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,880
which is very good, but,
essentially, quite dry.

298
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,040
I think they are
a little bit messy.

299
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,400
You've lost the definition
in the pleats across the top.

300
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,240
But I like the colour of
them. ...I think it's very witty.

301
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,800
...Very flaky, which is good.

302
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,880
WHISPERS:... Nice.

303
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,320
...They taste amazing.
The mash works really well.

304
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,200
...Do you remember
I said it won't work?

305
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,960
I was wrong. ...It is very,
very good.

306
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,840
It doesn't look good,
but the textures,

307
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,920
the flavours are all spot
on. They taste amazing.

308
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,816
...Yeah, can you book me one for lunch?
...Yeah, I'll book you one, no worries.

309
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,520
...I'm serious.... Yeah,
yeah. ...I want one. That one.... Yeah.

310
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,456
...They are very nice indeed.

311
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,720
They're nicely glazed,
they are well baked,

312
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,840
they are the right colour

313
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,800
and there are the little
chillies on top.... Yes.

314
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,080
...They are very
impressive.... Thank you.

315
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,600
...I think your flavour is OK.

316
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,320
I think it's a little bit dry,
though,

317
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,200
I think you put too
much rice in there.... OK.

318
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,016
...Because the rice is going to dry
everything out, soak everything in.

319
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,360
You have lost the flavour of the chicken,
but, otherwise,

320
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,720
I mean, the pastry is good.

321
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,000
It's all right to eat, it just doesn't,
you know, wow me.

322
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,040
...OK, that's fair enough.... Can I
just taste it with your sauce? Yes, yes.

323
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,776
...Do you know,
that would have made a huge difference?

324
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,000
Because it has that sweetness
and the chilli and a little bit of kick.

325
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,680
Thank you.

326
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,520
Do you know, that is really
what a pasty should look like.

327
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,960
It is full, the pastry looks beautiful,
soft and tender,

328
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,640
but firm enough to,
if not hurl over a hedge,

329
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,240
at least hold in your
hand. ...It tastes beautiful.

330
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,520
The spices in there, the chilli in
there was just the right amount.

331
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,800
It's got a nice kick of heat in
there. The textures are spot on.

332
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,440
It's gorgeous. Very good.

333
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,800
...Heaven.... You do realise a
handshake from me is valueless?

334
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,840
...It's a lot of value
to me.... Yeah.

335
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,800
There you are, Mark.... Phew!

336
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,176
It was all right.... You were a
bit worried, weren't you? I was.

337
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,400
...Well done.

338
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,680
...Another couple of minutes, perhaps,
in the oven? I was running behind.

339
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,160
...So you were rushing...? Yeah.

340
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,800
...Nice and full.... That's beautiful.
The lamb is cooked beautifully.

341
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,960
...Thank you.... The flavours,
the spices...

342
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,440
...Just the right
amount of veg to meat.

343
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,640
It's beautiful.

344
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,000
...That is a lovely pasty.

345
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,800
Because you've got a good
pastry on the outside, quite buttery.

346
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,880
...It's really delicious.... Thank
you. ...Thank you very much indeed.

347
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
...Well done,
Hermine.... Thank you.

348
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,360
...Sorry they didn't like it.

349
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,240
...Well, you did read the stuff about
we were going to want them crimped?

350
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,040
...Oh.... Did you miss that? ...I
missed that on the brief. Sorry.

351
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,040
...OK, so we have a samosa,
essentially.... Yes.

352
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,520
...I'd like the
colour of them...

353
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,640
They are a little bit white in
places and broken up slightly,

354
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,360
a bit longer in the oven,
perhaps? ...Yes, absolutely.

355
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,000
...Your stencilling didn't work.... No.
...You know what? It looks very nice.

356
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,320
...The flavours are fantastic.

357
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,800
I think you've got the idea
of the samosa right in there.

358
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,480
I'd like to have seen the
crimping which you didn't do,

359
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,720
but what I do like is the
combination of the butteriness

360
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,480
with the samosa filling.

361
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,000
...A delicious lunch.
...Well done.... Thank you.

362
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,200
...Nice colour. You've got a
beautiful sort of golden brown colour.

363
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
You have got a little bit
of crimping on the edge.

364
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,760
A little bit irregular in size.

365
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,720
...I like the fact
they're nice and fat.

366
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,536
There is going to be a good lot of
filling in there.... Nice flaky pastry.

367
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,840
The filling in there, as well,
going right to the sides.

368
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,760
...Heaven. I love that.

369
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,200
It's flaky,
the pastry is holding together,

370
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,760
its moist in the middle but
not wet. I could gobble it up.

371
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,616
...Thank you.... I think you've got
the perfect blend there of ingredients.

372
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,440
The texture and flavour are spot on... Oh,
thank you... Well done... Well done.

373
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,000
...Thank you. Thanks.

374
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,400
...Well done,
Laura.... I'll take that.

375
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,120
Oh, my God, that was amazing.

376
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,600
To impress Paul with the
pastry and Prue with the filling,

377
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,040
like, double whammy.

378
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,920
...They liked it. What more?

379
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,080
...I knew the flavours were going
to be good. I could smell them.

380
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,600
...I am worried about the
Technical because, with pastry,

381
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,520
they can do literally anything.

382
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,520
If I could just not be
bottom in Technical again,

383
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
that would be great.

384
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,640
...As usual,
the bakers can practise their signatures.

385
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,840
But what they will
bake in the Technical

386
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,520
is only now about
to be revealed.

387
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,760
...Bakers,
it's now time for your Technical Challenge,

388
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,240
which, today,
has been set by Prue.

389
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,240
Prue,
thanks for joining us in the tent.

390
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,960
Do you have any words of advice?

391
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,080
...This is all about refinement,

392
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,040
so the inside must be
as perfect as the outside.

393
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,440
...As ever, this technical
challenge will be judged blind,

394
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,880
so could you two
please leave the tent?

395
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,160
We will see you later on.

396
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,720
Prue would like you
to make three raspberry

397
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,000
and three salted
caramel eclairs.

398
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,200
...Prue is looking for precision,
perfect piping,

399
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,600
baked until golden brown. You
have two hours and 15 minutes.

400
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,960
...On your marks......
Get set.... Bake.

401
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,160
...There is a lot of
steps in this recipe.

402
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,000
I just grabbed out
all the saucepans.

403
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,560
...I've not made eclairs before.

404
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,680
I have made choux before,
but not eclairs.

405
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,360
...Eclairs themselves will be easy,
but it's not just eclairs,

406
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,560
there's a lot going on.

407
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,160
...I'm not sure about this one.

408
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,280
...Prue,
eclairs is the Technical Challenge.

409
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,920
Personally,
I think it's a good one.

410
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,840
...Most people think
eclairs are very easy.

411
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,200
But if you want really high-end,
elegant, special ones,

412
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,080
then you have to
do a lot of work.

413
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,080
...There is one choux
pastry for all of these.

414
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,280
...Well, I should think
they've all made choux pastry,

415
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,000
they should all be
able to make it well.

416
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,440
Then you have to make
creme pat to fill them all with.

417
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,400
Half of that creme pat needs to
be flavoured with salted caramel,

418
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,000
and the other half,
seedless raspberry puree.

419
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,800
...The little kick from the salted
caramel blended with the sweetness

420
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,240
of the raspberry,
you've got a nice balance between the two.

421
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,840
You have set them a very
difficult Technical Challenge.

422
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,120
...We are halfway through.

423
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,400
The bakers that are
left are really good.

424
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,280
...You can talk,
I'm eating, go on...

425
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,720
...So it says......
Make the choux.

426
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,120
...So just make the choux.

427
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,760
...Put the sugar, the milk,
the water and the butter into a pan

428
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,400
and heat it over a low heat.

429
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,640
...Chuck the flour in.

430
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,440
...Mix, mix, mix, mix,
mix, so it forms a paste.

431
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,400
...It's just not thick enough.

432
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,760
It's just not what
I expected at all.

433
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,080
Oh,
it's a long time since I made it,

434
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,160
so I'm not 100% sure about this.

435
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,600
...Do all right on the eclairs.

436
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,056
...I'm all right on eclairs,
but there's so many steps in this.

437
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,600
...It's a lot of reading, that,
isn't it? She writes books.

438
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,840
There's quite a racy scene
between two farm hands there.

439
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,520
...Yes, bit by bit until you
get the right consistency.

440
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,400
...I think it's meant to,
like, stick to the spoon,

441
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,800
like,
not want to come off from it very well.

442
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
...It has to be
dropping consistency.

443
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,360
You are looking for a
V-shape off a spatula or spoon.

444
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,640
Reluctant to drop.... That's what you
want. There you go, there is your V.

445
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,800
...I'm going to pipe the
choux out onto the baking tray.

446
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,160
...I need to pipe carefully.

447
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,720
...I'm happy with them.

448
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,880
Yeah, they'll do,
they'll do. ...These are going in the oven.

449
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,320
...It does not give us any instructions
on how long to bake these for.

450
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,400
I'm going to start off with 15,
see how they're going,

451
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,600
and then just
take it from there.

452
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,720
...No, I'm not certain that's right.
I'm not certain that's right at all.

453
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,600
I'm making my creme pat.
Creme patissiere is just custard.

454
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,280
It's just a posh
word for custard.

455
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,640
...Don't want it to be lumpy,

456
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,240
so I'll make sure that I keep
stirring it whilst it's heating up.

457
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,320
...Absolutely no
idea what I'm doing.

458
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,040
Just finding new ways
to make scrambled egg.

459
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,120
...It's a bit grainier
than I'd like it to be.

460
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,760
...It's too wet. There's too many
elements that can go wrong on this.

461
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,280
...Are you left-handed?
...I am left-handed.

462
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,360
...You know a left-handed
person has never won the Bake Off.

463
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,160
...Good boost of confidence.

464
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,640
...You know someone who
has ever worn a yellow T-shirt

465
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,720
has never won the Bake Off.

466
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,400
...Oh, no!

467
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,160
...They are not rising at all.

468
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,720
I would have expected to
see some movement in it.

469
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,400
They are looking a bit oily.

470
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,440
...I think they are cooked,
you know.

471
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,200
...Oh, dear, they have, like,
risen quite a lot, haven't they?

472
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,480
...They are looking nice
and crisp on the outside.

473
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,880
...They could
be slightly fatter.

474
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,760
I don't know how
I'm going to fill them.

475
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,480
...They're not lovely golden
brown. They'll have to do.

476
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,600
...They've kind of
already deflated a little bit.

477
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,360
...No, that's not happening.

478
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,080
Right, let's have another think.

479
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,680
Bakers, you have roughly one hour,
seven minutes and 30 seconds left.

480
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,336
...You are halfway through....
You can put it like that if you want.

481
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,240
...I'm going to do the choux again.
Hopefully, I've got time to bake it.

482
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,360
...Make the caramel
with 100g of sugar.

483
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
...In we go.

484
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,576
...Every time I make caramel in this tent,
it goes wrong.

485
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,480
I'm going to keep
it on a low heat

486
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,200
and then I'm just not
going to touch it ever.

487
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,960
...Got to keep my
eye on that caramel.

488
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,760
This is taking forever.
...Doesn't look right, does it?

489
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,160
Is it harder to cook
on television? ...Yeah.

490
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,280
...Would you go on any other shows?
Would you go on Naked Attraction?

491
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,720
I wouldn't go on
Naked Attraction

492
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,480
because my body
is my own business.

493
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,560
...I'm really not sure what
to do if that doesn't work.

494
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,680
I'm just going to try and give her
the elements as much as I can.

495
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,320
I'm going to mash them up a bit.

496
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,680
...Make a seedless
raspberry puree.

497
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,360
I'm leaving the seeds in there
and once it's pureed down,

498
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,480
I'll sieve it,
get rid of the seeds.

499
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,080
...Just a little bit thin. I
don't know if that will set.

500
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,200
...So now,
I'm making the salted caramel sauce.

501
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,920
This is going to be
mixed with the creme pat

502
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,960
to make a nice salted
caramel custard.

503
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
...It says one teaspoon
of salt. ...It's quite dark.

504
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
But I just need to
get it chilled now

505
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,640
so I can fold it
into the creme pat.

506
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,200
...I'm just really baffled.

507
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,760
Mine don't look like they're
going to do anything different.

508
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,880
I don't know why I'm
making all the additional bits

509
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,800
if I've got nothing
to put them in.

510
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,680
...Do you want me to...

511
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,920
..go to the supermarket
and buy some eclairs?

512
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,320
...I think you'd better.

513
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,640
Just split my creme pat into two

514
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,480
and now I'm folding it
through the raspberry

515
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,840
and the salted caramel.

516
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,600
I think I am kind of feeling in my
comfort zone right now. It's good.

517
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,960
...It looks beautiful indeed.

518
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,280
...Yeah,
it's a little bit lumpy.

519
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,800
I think it'll be OK.

520
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,720
...I know I'm going to
be really out of time,

521
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,160
but I'm going to
have one more go.

522
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,880
I'm going to re-make the choux.

523
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,560
...Bakers,
you have half an hour left.

524
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,280
...Now what? Fill three of the
eclairs with raspberry filling.

525
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,800
...I'm doing this
so cack-handedly.

526
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,040
...I thought,
rather than doing creme patissiere,

527
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,080
I'll make a raspberry yoghurt
to go inside. So here it goes.

528
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,840
...It's just all totally
dripping out of it.

529
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,520
I'm not really sure
why that's happened.

530
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,200
I just think my puree
wasn't thick enough

531
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,800
when I added it
to the creme pat.

532
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,920
...The choux are collapsed,

533
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,040
so it's really difficult
to get the stuff in.

534
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,280
...We'll just have to go with it,
I think, today.

535
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,840
...It tastes all right. It looks split,
though.

536
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,160
Oh, my God!

537
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,800
...The creme pat is too wet.

538
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,760
...Terrible. My
creme pat is just flat.

539
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,400
...The salted caramel icing is
going to be piped over the top.

540
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,120
...That's not my finest work.

541
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,720
...Ooh!

542
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,800
Nearly didn't have those, then.

543
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,800
Third time lucky.

544
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,440
...Bakers,
you have five minutes left.

545
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,880
...Crikey!

546
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,600
...I'm really not sure
what to do with them.

547
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,840
...Winging it!

548
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,640
...This is not my usual
highly decorated standard.

549
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,440
...Yes,
there's a lot going on at once.

550
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,080
...Just going to...

551
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,200
...I'm so stressed.

552
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,320
...They can have a dip of the
creme patissiere and the coulis.

553
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,040
You know? I've done what I can.

554
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,720
...This is horrendous!

555
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,760
...Bakers, your time is up.

556
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,600
...Disappointed.

557
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,160
...Please, bring your eclairs
down to the front and place them

558
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,480
behind your photographs.

559
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,800
...Look at this, at least it gets mine
out of the way first.... Well done.

560
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,600
...Prue and Paul are
looking for six elegant eclairs.

561
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,680
Three filled with a
salted caramel creme pat

562
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,280
and three with a
raspberry creme pat.

563
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,480
OK,
shall we start with this one?

564
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,880
The toppings are sort
of there or thereabouts.

565
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,920
...And they are more
or less the right colour.

566
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,040
...Yeah.... OK,
let's see what the creme pat's like.

567
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,000
Oh, this one is empty.

568
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,240
And that one is runny.

569
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,200
It's completely liquid.
Mm. Nice flavour.

570
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,600
...The flavours are right,

571
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,720
but it's too thick and the
consistency on the eclair

572
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,240
and the creme pat is not right.

573
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,840
Moving on to number
two. These look quite neat.

574
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,760
All the same size. ...This
icing has set all right.

575
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,120
...Look at that. It's split.

576
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,800
The raspberry flavour is there,
but the consistency is all wrong inside.

577
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,440
What? Those weren't finished.

578
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,440
...Oh,
it's a dip one. Oh, I see.

579
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,280
I get it. I see.

580
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
There is no rise in that.

581
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,680
It obviously hasn't
got any flour in it.

582
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,000
...I can't understand that.

583
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,960
...That's terrible.

584
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,440
All right. Moving on.

585
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
...These are rather fat.

586
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,120
...But having said that,
they look like eclairs.

587
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,080
The raspberry one actually tastes
OK. And the eclair is baked well.

588
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,560
...Yes, not bad effort.

589
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,080
...Moving on.... A bit skinny....
Yeah. I mean, they look neat enough.

590
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,240
...The pastry is just not baked
enough. ...The flavours of both are OK.

591
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,040
It's the textures
that are wrong.

592
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,840
...This is an original
take on the icing.

593
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,680
Looks like a giant caterpillar.

594
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,120
...Needed longer in the oven.

595
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,120
...There's a lot
wrong with this eclair.

596
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,520
The creme pat is scrambled,
the pastry is really soft

597
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,160
and under baked.

598
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,080
OK, I'm cheering up a little here
because these are more or less OK.

599
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,400
That's empty. That's
empty. This one's got some...

600
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,000
...The caramel in there is OK.

601
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,376
...Oh, it is, but there's very
little creme pat in the middle.

602
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,800
...There's nothing in there.

603
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,120
Moving on to the last one. Now,
these are all the same. Quite neat.

604
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,080
The right consistency
with the creme pat.

605
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,000
Good flavour as well.... Mm.
...Not bad at all.... No.... Very good.

606
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:34,120
The judges will now rank
the eclairs from worst to best.

607
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,840
In eighth spot, comes as no surprise,
this one, whose is this?

608
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,920
Linda?

609
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,320
A few issues with the choux,

610
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,000
your caramel
should go on the top

611
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,480
and there's no creme pat inside.

612
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,520
...In seventh place,
we have this one.

613
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,000
...Mine.... They're a bit long and
thin and a bit under-baked.... Yeah.

614
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,880
...Laura takes sixth. Dave
is fifth. And Lottie gets fourth.

615
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,160
...In third place,
we had this one. Mark.

616
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,520
You were redeemed by the fact
that the pastry was well-cooked

617
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,720
and that they tasted delicious,
but they were really messy.

618
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,320
...In second spot,
we have this one.

619
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,640
These are pretty good. They could
just have been a little bit thinner.

620
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,000
They're just a
little bit too fat.

621
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,320
...Which means,
the winner is this one.

622
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,440
Peter, they were delicious.

623
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,080
My only quarrel was they
were probably a little bit fat,

624
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,000
but I thought they were lovely.

625
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,840
We both thought they
were lovely. Well done.

626
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,440
...APPLAUSE

627
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,600
...That is the first time
I've won the Technical,

628
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,040
so tick it off the bucket list,
the Bake Off bucket list.

629
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,280
...Really happy. Earned it well.

630
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,880
...It wasn't my finest hour,
that one.

631
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,800
...Two hours trying to make choux pastry,
disgusting.

632
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,840
But tomorrow is another day.

633
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,560
...There's just
one challenge left

634
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,960
before Paul and Prue
decide who will be Star Baker

635
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,040
and who will be
leaving the tent today.

636
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,960
...Bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

637
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,080
It's time for your
Showstopper challenge.

638
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,640
Paul and Prue would
like you each to make

639
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,480
a caged tart.

640
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,600
...An exquisite, sweet tart

641
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,920
contained within an
intricately-latticed pastry cage.

642
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,360
...You can work with
any type of pastry you like,

643
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,760
but it must be self-supporting
and highly decorative.

644
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,960
And remember,
this is your Showstopper,

645
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,400
so it needs to look
and taste superb!

646
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,440
...Matthew,
did you know the caged tart

647
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,440
was actually invented
by actor Nicolas Cage?

648
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,000
...Yes, Noel. I did know that.

649
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,840
Did you know that Nicolas Cage
is a big fan of this show? Really?

650
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,320
...Yes,
he watches this and Homes Under The Hammer.

651
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,240
...You have three hours,
45 minutes to complete your caged tarts.

652
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,600
...On your
marks...... Get set...

653
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,920
...Bake!

654
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,640
...HE SIGHS

655
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,040
...The sun is shining, yeah.

656
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,400
And I'm smiling.
...LINDA CHUCKLES

657
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,280
...I am at the moment.

658
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,480
Till we're dishing up.

659
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,160
...This is a really
tough challenge.

660
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,240
You know,
anyone can bake a tart,

661
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,920
but making a caged tart...

662
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,920
...The biggest issue is the cage,
no doubt.

663
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,720
I've never managed to make
this caged tart in its entirety.

664
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,600
...Why would you make a
caged tart? ...It's bonkers.

665
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,840
It looks beautiful.

666
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,760
You're supposed to showcase it,
not cage it.

667
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,320
...PRUE:... We've
gone all out here.

668
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,840
We want the most
elegant latticed cage

669
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,000
made of pastry.

670
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,160
...The cage can't be too solid

671
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,800
that you can't see the tart

672
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,400
and it's gotta be
structurally sound,

673
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,360
so it's actually quite
a difficult challenge.

674
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,880
...This has to be a
really special tart.

675
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,320
It has to be luscious.

676
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,720
The kind of tart that you really
want to eat a huge amount of,

677
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,400
but you shouldn't,
because it's very rich.

678
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,920
...What I'm looking for is a very thin,
crispy base.

679
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,440
Lots of filling,
punching with flavour

680
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,440
and a beautifully-decorated top.

681
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,880
...They're good bakers.

682
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,560
I have every confidence.

683
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,040
...First hour really is all about
me getting my doughs ready.

684
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,280
...The bakers are free to use
whatever pastry they choose...

685
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,640
...I'm making a sweet
pastry for the tart itself

686
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,120
and then I'm doing a
different pastry for the cage.

687
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,680
.....but must keep in mind each
dough has a different job to do.

688
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,520
...This is the sweet crust
pastry for the tart case.

689
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,680
...The tart must be
crisp and delicious...

690
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,280
...I'm just making my
hazelnut pastry now.

691
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,960
.....while the cage must
be strong and sturdy.

692
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,440
...I'm gonna have to say
it's a French sweet pastry,

693
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,080
because I can't pronounce...

694
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,640
...This is my pate
sucree tart base.

695
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,840
It's a crumbly pastry,

696
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,600
but it's not so crumbly
that I can't work with it.

697
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,680
...I'm making three
different types of pastry.

698
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,200
It is, after all, Pastry Week.

699
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,120
...Lottie's bake will be housed in an
ambitious choux pastry pyramid cage.

700
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,600
Unusually for a tart,

701
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,080
it will have pastry layers with pureed,
caramelised and raw apple

702
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,680
sandwiched in between.

703
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,040
...I question whether it
would be a tart without sides.

704
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,440
...I did look up the
definition of the word tart.

705
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,880
It's from an old French
word that means flat pastry.

706
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,960
...PRUE:... Right.

707
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
...Are you confident?

708
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,680
...I'm confident
in all but the cage.

709
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,120
...But there's more than one
pyramid under construction today.

710
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,800
...The cage is
inspired by the Louvre.

711
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,880
I don't know if it's
Showstopper incredible,

712
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,280
but we'll wait and see.

713
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,920
...Dave's aiming to serve a
set mango and lime filling,

714
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,080
on a cocoa and
sweet pastry base,

715
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,760
presented in a Parisian
museum-inspired cage.

716
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,120
...Interesting flavours. I like
the idea of mango and lime.

717
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,040
...You're gonna stick it
together with caramel?

718
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,696
...Yeah, it's stuck together with
caramel.... That's very difficult.

719
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,320
...Very difficult to glue it together
with caramel.... Well, good luck.

720
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,920
...This is my tart case.

721
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,400
I'm just trying to not
overstretch it. ...SHE CHUCKLES

722
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,080
...I'm pricking the
base of the tart.

723
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,800
Erm...... HE LAUGHS

724
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,880
...That's gonna allow
any steam to escape

725
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,640
and stop it from getting
all bumpy and uneven,

726
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,000
and then this pastry's
gonna blind bake.... In it goes.

727
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,160
...That's going in.

728
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,960
...That's going in now,
this one.

729
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,760
...This is the cage pastry.

730
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,000
...Can I just say,
I love it when you beat the butter up.

731
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,920
Are you thinking it's Paul?

732
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,080
...I couldn't possibly say.

733
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,320
...Hi, Laura.... Hello! ...Hi,
Laura.... Hello!

734
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,040
...Laura,
tell us all about your caged tart.

735
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,840
...I'm doing a Key lime
pie inspired tart.... Ooh!

736
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,200
...I'm going with a bit
of a botanical theme,

737
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,160
so I'll hopefully show you I
can do delicate and fine today.

738
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,920
...Laura's limey filling will
sit on a crunchy ginger pastry,

739
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,120
accented with Italian meringue.

740
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,240
It'll be caged in a
domed puff pastry lattice,

741
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,440
adorned with pastry snails
and elegant butterflies.

742
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,640
...This one's for my dad.
He absolutely loves this.

743
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,200
He devours it every time I
make it for family gatherings.

744
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,360
...Key lime pie's one of my
favourite things.... Is it? I love it.

745
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,000
...You know,
you're on a winner there.

746
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,400
...Now,
I'm gonna make the pastry for my cage.

747
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,120
I certainly did not make a
pastry cage before this challenge.

748
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,320
...A true test of
pastry prowess,

749
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,240
the bakers must
hit the sweet spot

750
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,880
with dough strong
enough not to collapse,

751
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,880
but tender enough for eating.

752
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,760
...I'm literally doing
the exact same again.

753
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,520
My cage sable. Pate sable.

754
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,080
Yeah, cocoa pate sable.

755
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,040
...This choux isn't very robust. Yeah,
it's a hell of a risk.

756
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,200
I've gone for that,
because if I can nail it, it looks good.

757
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,520
...It's the same pastry
recipe as the pastry case.

758
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,960
I've adapted the recipe
so that it doesn't fall apart

759
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,080
when it's moulded.

760
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,200
...Rough puff isn't probably something
you would use to build a cage in.

761
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,880
It's quite a risky one.

762
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,520
I just really hope it works.

763
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,400
...What's the cage
about? ...The cage is weird.

764
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,440
I'd never seen a caged tart
before. ...I don't know if I have.

765
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,680
...No, but they do look quite cool when they
turn out well. ...I'll take your word for it.

766
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,240
...Peter's tart will have
a hazelnut pastry base,

767
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,000
a baked lemon filling
and blackberry curd

768
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,240
and it will shelter under
a domed shortcrust cage,

769
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,920
decorated with edible flowers.

770
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,280
...I love a lemon tart.

771
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,040
It's... I think it's
my favourite.

772
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,440
I like this one a lot.

773
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,400
...But he's not the only baker
tweaking the classic tarte au citron.

774
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,960
...I'm making a lemon tart,

775
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,040
so hopefully I will manage that.

776
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,840
...Hermine's tangy
lemon and lime filling

777
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,200
will be topped with
sweet Italian meringue.

778
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,600
She'll box her bake in
with an ornate pastry cage.

779
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,240
...You had such a great day
yesterday. Can you do it again?

780
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,000
...I am hoping, cos I kept saying,
"Bread Week wasn't mine.

781
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,600
"Biscuit Week wasn't mine."

782
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,400
And I feel Pastry Week
is the area where I excel.

783
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
...Good.... More of the same,
please.

784
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,440
...I'm gonna start making
the panels to make the cage.

785
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,040
...These are my stencils that
I'm gonna pipe my choux onto

786
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,600
and then cook it
and then assemble it.

787
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,480
Sounds easy, doesn't it?

788
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,720
No.

789
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,080
...I've rolled out my rough puff

790
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,240
and I'm just using
some circle cutters

791
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,120
and then I'll pull
that over the mould.

792
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,960
...This is just
a lattice cutter.

793
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,920
...It cuts out all
the lattices for you.

794
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,440
...These are my strands
to make the cage.

795
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,040
Put them in the oven and then they
come off the bowl. That's the plan.

796
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,800
...There's no particular
pattern that I'm going for here.

797
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,040
It's just kind of make some nice,
wavy lines, hope it looks good

798
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,120
and make sure that enough of them cross
over, so it gives it a bit of structure.

799
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,520
...When it goes in the oven,

800
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,400
hopefully it will gel together.

801
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,640
...I'm cutting out rhomboid shapes
in it now, inspired by the Louvre.

802
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,840
...It is a pyramid. This is me
trying to be creative, all right?

803
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,640
...Is that a cage
or is that a helmet?

804
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,840
Who in this room would you
put in your cage, if you could?

805
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,880
...Oh, I think, like, a really little
mini Peter would be quite cute.

806
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,040
...Yeah.

807
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,520
Oi, Peter!

808
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,440
Laura wants to
put you in a cage.

809
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
...Poor kid. He looks terrified.

810
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,040
...What would you do with him if
he was in a cage? Feed him cheese.

811
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,440
...Noel, after this time call,
would you like to play table tennis?

812
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,960
...Yeah! Bakers,
you're halfway through.

813
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,760
...Hm, halfway to paradise.

814
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,040
I'm gonna get my
tart case out now.

815
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,720
...Ooh.

816
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,080
Naughty.

817
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,920
...Yeah,
I'm happy with the way they look.

818
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,040
...It's cracked a little bit,
but it's gonna have a filling in it,

819
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,120
so that'll be hidden.... A little
bit darker than I wanted in parts,

820
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,280
but I'll be trimming all that off.
...It's fine, but it's not phenomenal.

821
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,480
...With their cages moulded,
cut out or piped,

822
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,400
it's now the bakers can
get them in the oven.

823
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,280
...I'll give it 25 minutes,
then check it.

824
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,440
...This is going
in for 20 minutes.

825
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,880
Two at a time.

826
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,640
...Fingers crossed.

827
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,120
...Good luck,
my beautiful little helmet!

828
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,240
...Please! Pray that this works.

829
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,440
Fingers crossed.

830
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,400
...How's it going?
...It's going all right.

831
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,320
It's a tough one,
this one.... Why?

832
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,960
...It's just a lot to do.
A lot to think about.

833
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,720
A lot can go wrong. ...What
has gone wrong so far?

834
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,120
...Nothing's gone wrong so far.

835
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,360
...Well, then,
you just lied to me.

836
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,400
...All being well,
Mark will put together a pear and sage tart

837
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,440
with layers of pear jam,
a pear and sage mousse

838
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,880
that will sit inside a rough
puff pastry bottle cage,

839
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,480
resting on shortbread
biscuit sand.

840
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,600
...Goodness,
this is an ambitious business.

841
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,720
...I love the idea of the sage.
...I'm confident that it's gonna work.

842
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,176
I have to be positive. ...Thank you,
Mark.... Fingers crossed.

843
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,200
Thank you very much.... You've
got them excited about the flavours.

844
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,800
...It just has to look good now as
well.... It will. Good luck.... Thank you.

845
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,880
...OK, what now?

846
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,560
...While the pastry cage
demonstrates design,

847
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,840
the filling for their tart is a
chance for the bakers to showcase

848
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,080
a flair for flavour.

849
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,920
...This is the
chocolate cremeux.

850
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,600
It's just like a really
thick chocolate cream.

851
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,040
...It's toffee popcorn
creme diplomate.

852
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,840
It tastes like
popcorn at a push.

853
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,720
...Yesterday was yesterday and
yesterday was a different creme pat.

854
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,560
...I'm just making
the gypsy tart.

855
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,640
It's actually just sugar
and evaporated milk.

856
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,360
It's been a favourite of
mine when I was at school.

857
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,720
That's why I'm making it.

858
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,840
...Linda's gypsy tart
has a sweet pastry base,

859
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,600
topped with a coffee and
brandy-soaked sponge.

860
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,360
It will nestle in a colourful
rosewater-flavoured pastry dome.

861
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,840
...Word on the street is
you're doing a gypsy tart.

862
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,840
...I'm doing a gypsy tart,
yes.... What?

863
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,880
Cos when I was at primary school,
we used to have gypsy tart

864
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,440
and it was my
favourite...... Yeah.

865
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,400
.....and I've never
seen it since.... Yeah.

866
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,936
...And you're making
it today? Yeah.

867
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,400
I mean,
very simple ingredients. ...Come on.

868
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,440
I don't care how simple it
is. Come on! Come on, yes.

869
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,960
Come on! Good
luck.... Thank you.

870
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,800
...After a tough
time in the technical,

871
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,480
Marc's also banking
on a much-loved bake.

872
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,120
...My favourite pudding
in the whole wide world

873
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,920
is a blackberry and apple pie.

874
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,760
So, this is kind of like a
posh apple and blackberry pie.

875
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,680
...Marc's upmarket tart will
have a sable Breton base,

876
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,040
blackberry jam,
caramelised apples

877
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,120
and a chocolate cremeux.

878
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:45,040
His full puff pastry cage will be
decorated with shortcrust flowers

879
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,280
and vine leaves.

880
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,120
...If it turns out how I want it,
I'll be really pleased.

881
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,400
...I am sweating today.

882
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,560
There's just a lot to do. I
feel... I'm feeling behind already.

883
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,960
How long do we have left?

884
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,840
...Bakers...... You
have one hour left.

885
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,440
...I thought we were good in that. ...Yeah,
I think it worked very well.

886
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,000
...I'm gonna get
my cage out now.

887
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,560
...It is very fragile.

888
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,320
...It's a nice
golden-brown colour.

889
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,280
...All going well.

890
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,120
...Looks quite good.

891
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,040
...I was hoping they'd
glue together a bit more.

892
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,680
...Let these cool down,

893
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,920
cos they're too
delicate at the moment.

894
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,160
...I'm gonna shove it
straight in the freezer

895
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,600
to try and cool it down.

896
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,040
...As cages cool,

897
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,920
the blind-baked tarts can be
moved on to the next stage.

898
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,160
...Put it in the oven for 15 minutes.
Then we'll have a lemon tart.

899
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,040
...While some fillings are baked,
others must be cooled to firm up.

900
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,920
...I'm putting the jam in and then
build up the cremeux from that

901
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,200
and chill for 15 minutes.

902
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,000
...With tarts left to set,

903
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,560
the bakers can crack on,
preparing finishing touches.

904
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,400
...At last, some pear action,
hey? I'm using conference pears.

905
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,160
You need to stop making
me say that word in my accent.

906
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,496
...NORTHERN IRISH
ACCENT:... Pear.

907
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,120
...I'm gonna put
my macaroons in.

908
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,960
...This is a little
lacy template

909
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,520
that I'm gonna slide
onto the top of the tart.

910
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,160
You know like you get a
doily and it's all da-de-da!

911
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,520
...This is my caramel and then
we're gonna add the apples.

912
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,400
And that'll be one of my
layers. Let's just hope that works.

913
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,440
...Look at this little fruit selection.
...A cute lunch for a rabbit.

914
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,400
...# I'm preparing
lunch for a rabbit. #

915
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,000
You look quite calm today.

916
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,120
# Star Baker is looming
in the distance. #

917
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,920
And you're making
lunch for a rabbit.

918
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,920
...Come on, man.

919
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,400
...Hello, lattice head.

920
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,960
Are you ready for
a time call? ...Yeah.

921
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,920
...Bakers,
you have half an hour left.

922
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,800
...What? Is that real? Half
an hour? It's gonna be tight.

923
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,920
...Is this is the lockdown
look? That's right, kids.

924
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,120
If you can't get out
there on the high street,

925
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,520
then pastry is your answer.

926
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,160
...Yeah, it's done.

927
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,680
...Oh, look at that,
though. Yeah.

928
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,240
It's a good set.

929
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,960
...Wonderful...SHE CHUCKLES

930
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,120
...Very happy.

931
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,600
...This is the cage.

932
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,360
Oh, God. This is terrifying.

933
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,800
...The cage is pretty delicate,

934
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,440
so it's all about
getting it off.

935
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,560
This is what this entire
bake hinges on right now.

936
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,360
It's a little scary.

937
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,480
...Oh,
I'm panicking now. I'm rushing.

938
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,960
...If it works, I'm laughing.

939
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,080
...This is the tricky bit,
cos I need to glue all the sides.

940
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,760
I would say they're brittle.

941
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,400
...Oh!

942
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,080
...Let's see if this comes off,
shall we?

943
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,000
...I've never felt so stressed.

944
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,400
...This is isomalt.

945
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,080
It's like sugar,
but more predictable.

946
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,400
...Glue the hell
out of that lot.

947
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,880
...I'm trying to stay nice and
calm. ...I don't know what to do.

948
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,880
It's just breaking as
I'm trying to get it off.

949
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,960
...I don't think I'm going
to get it off in one piece.

950
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,600
...It will look messy.

951
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,120
...Is that stuck?

952
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,200
...MARK SIGHS

953
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,520
...Damn it.

954
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,840
...Oh, I'm so pleased.

955
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,600
...Oh! Oh!

956
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,760
...Eurgh!

957
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,280
...It's still too hot.

958
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,360
...Bakers, you have 15 minutes.

959
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,520
...This is now assembly, yeah.

960
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,680
Here we go.

961
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,880
...It's gonna be like a flower
piece on the top of the tart.

962
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,920
...That is the Italian meringue.

963
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,440
...The meringue's gonna go
around the outside of the tart.

964
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,720
Then the fruits just
sit pretty in the middle.

965
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,000
...This is my
blackberry curd on top.

966
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,520
Tastes good. Perfect.

967
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,680
...It's just a case of
laying the apples on,

968
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,480
arranging the
blackberries and then run.

969
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,080
...This is not the way
I want to finish this off,

970
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,560
but it's gonna have to do.

971
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,000
...Not quite what it should be.

972
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,120
...It might be a bit sticky.

973
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,640
...I'm happy with the tart.

974
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,080
Hopefully I can cage it.

975
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,040
...Just feel the
tension in the room!

976
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,080
...It's broken now.

977
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,240
...Bakers,
you have one minute left.

978
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,240
...I don't know what to
do. It just all collapsed.

979
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,240
...I'll see if I can get it off.
I've got about five seconds.

980
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,560
...Eurgh!

981
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,120
...OK, bakers. Your time is up.

982
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,520
I just wanted to get a
little bit of colour on it.

983
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,240
...It better taste good.

984
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,120
...HE SIGHS... I will take that.

985
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,480
...Oh, that was touch and go,
I'll be honest.

986
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,480
...I don't think I've been as
proud of anything in my entire life

987
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,680
as I am of that.

988
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,920
...Hey-ho.

989
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,640
It's a shame, isn't it?

990
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,520
...NOEL:... It's judgment time for
the bakers' cage tart Showstoppers.

991
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,160
Dave, would you like to bring
up your Showstopper, please?

992
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,880
...I think it looks great.

993
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,680
I do like the look you've managed
to achieve with the mango.

994
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,760
...I think it's wonderful.

995
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,840
All it has to do now is taste
great. ...Fingers crossed.

996
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,040
...It's nice and neat.

997
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,280
...The flavour is absolutely
lovely. Love the mango.

998
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,160
...The base is just
about the right thickness.

999
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,800
It marries up beautifully
with the mango.

1000
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,480
I think you've done a great job,

1001
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,520
because you've given an impact
to the top of the tart, as well.

1002
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,040
...The overall look
is so harmonious.

1003
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,480
...Very good job.... Well done.

1004
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,320
...Cheers,
thank you.... Really good.

1005
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,416
...It looks highly effective.

1006
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,800
The colour looks very,
very good.

1007
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,440
I like the way the tart looks.

1008
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,680
...Yeah.... Looks great.

1009
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,000
...Lovely and rich,
the chocolate.

1010
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,080
I do have a problem
with the base.

1011
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,160
It's a bit big for the
chocolate. ...Yeah.

1012
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,056
...But I think your
decoration is very beautiful.

1013
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,800
...I'd liked to have
seen this chocolate

1014
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,360
to the edge of a very
rich chocolate pastry

1015
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,680
which was really thin.

1016
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,200
That would've
been spot-on.... OK.

1017
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,656
...Cos that base looks
awkward.... Yeah.

1018
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,896
...So it doesn't
belong...... Yeah.

1019
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,320
.....with that delicate chocolate
in the middle.... OK, sure.

1020
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,240
...I think it looks beautiful.

1021
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,840
I think it's a really
clever design,

1022
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,280
and I think you've
managed to get it to work...

1023
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,360
..until Paul
Hollywood wrecked it.

1024
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,440
...NOEL GROANS, LAUGHTER

1025
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,760
NOEL:... Thunder fingers.

1026
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,560
...However, that shows that
the pastry will be delicious.

1027
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,040
...The flavour's lovely.

1028
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,360
...Mm.... But you could have gone a
little bit thinner with that base.... OK.

1029
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,640
...But I have to say,
the pastry is beautiful.

1030
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,960
...It is, really good.

1031
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,120
...However,
this is a really big, hefty,

1032
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,480
Paul Hollywood...... SHE GRUNTS

1033
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:03,240
.....cage, with a delicate,
tiny, feminine middle.

1034
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,880
...It's a Prue Leith tart...

1035
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,440
...And a Paul Hollywood cage. .....with
a Paul Hollywood base. LAUGHTER

1036
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,600
Overall, though, I think all your
flavours are absolutely spot-on.

1037
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,400
...I'm very impressed
with your cage.

1038
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,016
...Thank you.... I
think it looks lovely.

1039
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,040
...I think it's
highly impressive.

1040
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,080
The tart underneath looks very,
very nice.

1041
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,840
...Mm.

1042
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,920
I love...

1043
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,280
..the Key lime flavour.

1044
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,960
...The lime,
you can feel it at the back of your...

1045
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,480
...Mm...cheeks. It's like, oof.

1046
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,840
And I like that from lime.

1047
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,040
That's how a lime should taste. You know,
give you a nice kick.

1048
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,456
I think your
decoration's beautiful.

1049
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,040
Overall, I think your taste's amazing,
looks good.

1050
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,080
...Excellent.

1051
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,840
...I think you've
excelled yourself. ...Mm.

1052
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,880
You really have.

1053
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,560
...Wow, thank you. That
means a lot to me. Thank you.

1054
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,720
...What happened to the cage?

1055
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,120
...It usually lifts up,
but today it stayed on the bowl.

1056
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,040
...Yeah, I love the gypsy colours.
...That's right, yeah.... Are great.

1057
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,520
OK, let's taste it.

1058
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,240
Mm.

1059
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,400
I love the flavour.

1060
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,640
...It's a bit thick,
that gypsy tart, actually.

1061
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,640
It could have been
a little bit thinner.

1062
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,840
Um... I quite like the flavour,
it's very traditional.

1063
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,480
It's quite frustrating that
you don't see the full impact.

1064
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,120
The way it looks
doesn't look good.

1065
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,800
...Well, I have to say,

1066
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,720
your cage is sensational.

1067
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,160
Really beautiful.

1068
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,080
...The artistry in
there is exceptional.

1069
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,040
The tart itself...

1070
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,400
..I question whether it
would be a tart without sides.

1071
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,760
...Very squidgy.

1072
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,800
...Very.

1073
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,640
...Mm.

1074
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,480
That tastes
absolutely beautiful.

1075
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,160
But it does look a right mess.

1076
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,920
...All the independent flavours are very,
very good.

1077
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,200
All the textures are good.

1078
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,600
What you've made is very good,

1079
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,240
but "Is it the brief?" is my
question. PRUE CHUCKLES

1080
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,800
...I like the rather random
way you've done the cage.

1081
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,680
I think it's really beautiful.

1082
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,440
...It's quite solid, it almost looks
like it's made of bread.

1083
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,080
...I'm just happy it's held up.
...LAUGHTER

1084
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,880
Lovely and tart.

1085
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,760
...Mm.... Mm.

1086
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,600
That's delicious. Puts a smile on
your face, doesn't it? Very nice.

1087
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,320
...I think partly because the back
of your cheeks are going...

1088
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,440
LAUGHTER
..and so it sort of forces a smile.

1089
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,000
It's called a happy tart, that one.
That's lovely.

1090
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,240
...So, the cage didn't work.

1091
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,880
...It's not a good one.

1092
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,800
Not compared with what
you were achieving recently.

1093
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,000
That's not...... Yeah.

1094
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,560
.....Mark.... Mm.

1095
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,640
...Your piping's all irregular,
as well.

1096
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,520
The poached pears
don't look appetising.

1097
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,840
...It's delicious. It's unusual,

1098
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,080
but I really like it.

1099
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,760
...The pastry's far too thick.

1100
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,840
I think you missed something
on this one.... Mm.

1101
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,400
...At a core level, not just at the
fact that you never got a chance

1102
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,080
to finish it with a cage.

1103
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,280
...Didn't go well, did it?

1104
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,480
I'm obviously in a very
precarious position now.

1105
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,840
...Pastry Week!

1106
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,520
It was supposed to be my week.

1107
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,400
Hey-ho. Fair comments.

1108
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,200
...I think that's probably the nicest
bit of feedback that I've got,

1109
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,080
that line of it being a happy tart.

1110
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,440
...Paul said my pastry was amazing.

1111
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,600
"Amazing."

1112
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,160
I mean, what more...

1113
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,840
...That's definitely the best
feedback that I've had yet.

1114
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,120
I got a bit choked, actually.

1115
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,560
I've... I'm absolutely made up.

1116
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,440
...I thought they did quite well
after the eclairs.

1117
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,280
...The cages were astonishing,

1118
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,480
except for Mark L.

1119
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,080
...And Linda's.... And Linda's.

1120
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,200
I think,
in spite of her exploding cage,

1121
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,720
Hermine must be in line
for Star Baker.

1122
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,920
...I thought the flavours of her lemon
tarte au citron was fantastic.

1123
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,680
...You did quite like Dave's.

1124
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,760
...I thought his cage was incredible.

1125
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,200
...What about Peter?
Cos you liked his, as well.

1126
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,640
...I did like his.
...And he came first in Technical.

1127
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,560
Is he not in line for Star Baker?

1128
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,040
...He struggled in his Signature
quite badly.... Right.

1129
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,640
...But I think Laura's Showstopper
was amazing.

1130
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,280
...Laura's had a good week, hasn't she?

1131
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,440
...She's really come up.
...So, who is in danger of going home?

1132
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,360
...Mark L. His cage fell apart.

1133
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,520
He could be in a little bit
of trouble. And Marc E.

1134
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,520
He struggled in the Technical
and he struggled in the Signature.

1135
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,920
I think Linda's in trouble.

1136
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,280
She struggled across
the first two challenges.

1137
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,840
She didn't finish her cage.

1138
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,520
...Close, then.... It is.

1139
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,800
It's painfully close.

1140
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,160
...Well done, bakers.
You must be exhausted.

1141
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,440
I'm sure you want to know
who Star Baker is,

1142
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,760
so I'll tell you.

1143
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,440
Star Baker this week is...

1144
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,160
..Laura.

1145
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,840
...APPLAUSE... Well done!

1146
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,080
...Congratulations, Laura.... Bloody hell.

1147
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,520
...That leaves me with the rotten job

1148
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,920
of announcing the person
that is leaving us this week.

1149
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,640
It does get harder every week,
cos there's less of you

1150
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,320
and we get to know you more.

1151
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,280
The person who's leaving us
this week is...

1152
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,320
..Linda. I'm sorry.

1153
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,000
...No, that's good.

1154
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,080
I can't really be sad.

1155
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,520
I've been like a child
at Disneyland, really.

1156
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,680
Well done, you.... I'm so sorry.

1157
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,760
...It's been amazing.
One of the highlights of my life.

1158
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,840
...How dare they! Thank you so much.
...You've been brilliant.

1159
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,760
...She is a very good baker,

1160
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,600
but she had a terrible week.

1161
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,240
...I know I can bake.
I just haven't done enough.

1162
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,360
I am so proud of myself, yeah.

1163
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,400
I am.

1164
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,400
...Well done, Laura.... Oh, thank you.
...You did well there.... Thank you.

1165
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,840
I'm still a bit in shock.

1166
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,800
I think I'm a bit, like,
did that actually just happen?

1167
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,240
...When it came to the Showstopper,

1168
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,040
I thought Laura
smashed it out the park.

1169
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,840
A well-deserved Star Baker.

1170
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,960
...I'm just gonna try and get through

1171
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,480
for as long as I can.
Hashtag winging it.

1172
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,520
...I'm looking forward to next week.
Japanese Week.

1173
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,840
...Yeah, one more.
Let's do one more week.

1174
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,416
...It's getting tougher and tougher now

1175
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,320
and I cannot mess up
like that again.

1176
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,040
Yeah, I'm gonna be better
next week.

1177
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,560
...Next time...
...The adrenaline has kicked in.

1178
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,920
.....it's a Bake Off first,
with Japanese Week.

1179
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,800
...I just like it being a bit
different.... Yeah.... Cakes are boring.

1180
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:22,560
...Who will run out of steam
in the Signature? Whoa.... Good God.

1181
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,000
...The bakers are spread thin and
turned over in a tense technical...

1182
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,360
...Flip, go on! Yes!

1183
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,640
...The winner right here.

1184
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,880
..and a spectacularly sweet
Showstopper...

1185
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,160
...Cute...that will leave one
of the bakers with a sour taste.

1186
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,680
...It's tearing a bit, isn't it?

1187
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,280
Oh, God.... BLEEP... mess.
...I don't know why you're so upset.

1188
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,880
I think that looks pretty neat.

1189
