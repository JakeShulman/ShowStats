00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,279
Hello. Guess what? It's pastry week.
Are you excited for pastry week,
Noel?

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,599
I am. Prue's made us all these
fabulous pastries

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,480
to get us in the mood.

4
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:13,159
Try one of these. They're
delish delosh. I certainly will.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,600
Don't eat me. I'm nice.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,079
Did you hear something? No. Oh!

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,439
Murderer.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,200
Welcome... to
The Great British Bake Off.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,559
Last time... Ready, steady...

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,399
..the bakers faced chocolate week...
They're a bit raw.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,319
..and collectively ballsed up the
basics.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,159
This looks like they've been
dropped. Yeah.

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,999
They fought back with stunning
celebration cakes...

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,559
The overall appearance, I think, is
spectacular.

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,359
..but Lottie still found herself in
the firing line.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,279
It's overbaked. Although in the end

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,359
it was Sura.. You have raw dough.

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,319
..who bit the bullet.

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,639
Now, midway through the
competition...

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,159
Halfway to paradise.

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,279
..the bakers face the perils of
pastry week.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,879
It's bonkers.

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,639
Taking on some of the most intricate
challenges...

24
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,159
There's so many steps in this.

25
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,279
..ever set. This is definitely the
hardest so far.

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,640
Making architecture edible,

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,519
but the wrong kind of flaky...

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,279
Just really baffled.

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,079
This is a joke... can see the best
of plans...

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,399
This is what this entire bake hinges
on.

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,039
This is horrendous.

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,760
..come crashing down.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,760
It's pastry week!

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,199
This is the week that I wanted to
get to because I know that I can
make pastry.

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,360
You know, lots of us mums can make
pastry.

36
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,639
I can finally say that I am looking
forward to pastry week.

37
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,520
It is my week!

38
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,319
Halfway has suddenly crept up on us,
hasn't it?

39
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,799
It feels bizarre that we're already
at this point, yeah.

40
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,959
We're so far through, um, exciting
though.

41
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,359
I do like making pastry, but I
have to say this is definitely

42
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,679
one of the weeks where a lot could
go wrong.

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,519
Nobody wants a soggy bottom.

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,239
Got a crisp bottom.

45
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,839
I feel apprehensive, actually, about
pastry.

46
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,919
The judges are saying they want to
see a bit more refinement from me.

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,400
So, I want to show them that I can
do elegant. Yeah.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,799
Good morning, bakers. Welcome back
to the tent

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,599
for pastry week.

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,359
And it's time for your
Signature Challenge.

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,319
Today, Paul and Prue would like you
each to make your version

52
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,519
of the Cornish national dish -
the pasty.

53
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,599
You need to make eight identical
pasties.

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,199
You can use any pastry or filling
you choose,

55
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,999
but feel free to personalise them
with a decorative finish.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,719
They need to be at least 15cm long,
but they can be any shape you like.

57
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,319
Noel, what shape would yours be?

58
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,679
Mine would be in the shape of Paul
Hollywood's powerful buttocks.

59
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,159
Mmm, delish delosh.

60
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,520
You have two hours. On your marks..
Get set... bake!

61
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,560
Hello, hello, pasties.

62
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,479
Puff pastry will make a good pasty.

63
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,879
Nice and buttery.

64
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,639
Packed with filling.

65
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,319
Why did they have to say it's the
Cornish national dish?

66
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,280
Just to give me more pressure?

67
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,439
It's pastry week. Most of our
challenges are pure baking
challenges.

68
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,519
This time, the bakers have to be
good cooks too

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,599
because what's going inside the
pasty takes real cooking.

70
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,959
The trick is choosing your pastry
and your filling wisely.

71
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,319
You don't want it to be too dry.

72
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,879
As you bite into the pasty, the
buttery layer from the shell must be
nice and thin, crispy.

73
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,319
And then inside, as you hit that
filling, you want a bit of moisture
in there as well.

74
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,119
It doesn't have to be a Cornish
pasty shape,

75
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,480
it can be any shape they like, but
we want crimping.

76
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,799
Halfway through now, and I expect
the bakers really to start
pushing themselves

77
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,279
and coming up with some ingenious
ways to really impress the judges.

78
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,800
I want to eat the best pasties I've
ever had.

79
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,360
Hello, Laura. Morning. Hello, Laura.
Making a mess again, I see. Yep.

80
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,199
Tell us about your pasty.

81
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,119
So, I'm going quite traditional.
I'm doing a cheese and onion pasty.

82
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,520
Paul just said to me, not 30 seconds
ago, that he likes a cheese and onion
pasty. Oh, really?

83
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,439
Laura's pimping her traditional
cheese and onion filling

84
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,759
with leeks, cream and fresh thyme,

85
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,639
and she's aiming to impress with her
choice of pastry too.

86
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,439
I'm doing a cheats puff pastry
learnt from a book from a very
famous baker called Paul Hollywood.

87
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,080
I think you'll do well on this
challenge. You reckon?

88
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,519
Well, if it all falls to bits, it's
his fault, isn't it? Yeah.

89
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,479
I'm not taking the blame. Good luck,
Laura.

90
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,200
Thank you, thanks. Thank you.

91
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,359
I just can't mess it up.

92
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,839
But she's not the only baker taking
a risk making rough puff.

93
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,279
Flaky pastry. It doesn't matter how
you get there, right?

94
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,759
Lottie, Peter and Linda are all
using it to reimagine the
traditional pasty.

95
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,199
You're meant to see streaks of
butter in your pastry.

96
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,640
I'm doing an envelope fold. An
envelope fold, letter fold.
I don't know.

97
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,639
Whilst rivals Marc, Mark, and Dave
are making a sturdy short crust.

98
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,479
You could overwork it. You don't
want it to turn tough.

99
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,039
But Hermine is creating a pastry
that is entirely her own.

100
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,679
It's not quite a puff pastry, but
it's not a short pastry either.

101
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,039
I kind of wanted best of both
worlds.

102
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,879
Hermine's hybrid pastry will be
packed with a

103
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,199
tangy Moroccan
spiced lamb tagine

104
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,559
and chickpea filling.

105
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,920
I think it sounds absolutely
delicious. As long as the pastry
doesn't fall to bits.

106
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,279
Thank you.

107
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,760
How much chilli have I got?
I haven't got too much.

108
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,239
Planning to pack a punch with his
pasties is Mark.

109
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:14,239
So, I am doing aloo gobi and paneer
pasties, which will be spiced with
lots of turmeric, cumin,

110
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,639
coriander, lots of ginger and
garlic.

111
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,120
So, a lot going on in this.

112
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,879
Mark's Indian inspired cauliflower
and paneer pasties

113
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,199
will even come with spiced pastry,

114
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,119
as he tries to CURRY favour with
Paul and Prue again.

115
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,159
Last week - Star Baker. How do you
feel today?

116
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,639
It feels great coming into this
week, but definitely the nerves
don't go away.

117
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,599
That's the sad thing. Star Baker
doesn't guarantee anything.

118
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,199
No. Look at them trying to take it
away from you already. I know,
already, yeah.

119
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,079
You know you have to prove yourself
every time.

120
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,440
Exactly, yeah. Absolutely.

121
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,360
Really, really grateful for the
smell of fish this early in the
morning. Is that you?

122
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,719
That's going crazy.

123
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,999
Getting the pasty fillings right...

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,679
Oh, that's gorgeous.

125
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,439
..is just as crucial as producing
flawless pastry...

126
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,759
You can never have too much cheese.
A bit more?

127
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,319
Just work it all in.

128
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,039
..incredible flavours..

129
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,759
Not sure I can fit any more spices
in these.

130
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,279
..must be complimented with a
perfectly balanced texture.

131
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,679
I'm happy with that.

132
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,039
I am making toad in the hole
pasties.

133
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,119
I'm actually calling it
toad-in-the-hole-less pasty

134
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,599
cos I wasn't really sure what was
the toad and what was the hole.

135
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,839
Lottie's take on this old favourite
will see mashed potato,

136
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,359
onion, sage and fennel gravy, and
Lincolnshire sausage

137
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,159
packed into her pasty.

138
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,279
Oh, Lottie. I am not totally
convinced by this.

139
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,999
One, I think it could be
really stodgy

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,879
or soggy - mash and gravy and...

141
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,239
I think it sounds delicious.
It does, yeah.

142
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,919
Lottie... Love toad-in-the-hole.
..you're always original. Thank you.

143
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,599
I'll take that. I have hope, if not
faith.

144
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,679
Thanks, Prue, that's all I need.

145
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,120
Do you know what? I'm going to take
that with me - home probably - but
still I am going to take it.

146
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,239
Bakers, weirdly we are already
halfway through.

147
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,559
Wow! Where does the time go?

148
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,800
Into a small bum bag that
Paul Hollywood wears.

149
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,680
That's where time goes, kids.

150
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,279
I'm just worried about time now, to
be honest. It really is
disappearing.

151
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,239
I think this is my third turn.
Can't go too many.

152
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,839
More turns, more lamination.

153
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,879
If making perfect pastry isn't time
consuming enough,

154
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,839
Pete is planning on sculpting a
whole school of fish pasties.

155
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,799
I'm saying these pasties are in the
shape of a haddock cos I've got
smoked haddock in it.

156
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,480
But it's more shaped like
just generic fish.

157
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,199
His carefully crafted
pasties will be filled with

158
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,759
the haddock and kedgeree rice

159
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,679
and have a boiled egg centre.

160
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,559
And come complete with puff pastry
scales.

161
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,839
Do you even slightly think about
getting to the final? Yeah.

162
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,519
You want to do the best you can.

163
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,079
So much. It's burning you up inside.

164
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,679
It's why I love you because you're
really competitive.

165
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,239
I'd be like that.

166
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,479
Peter's not the only baker hoping to
secure victory by giving pasties a
whole new look.

167
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,799
They're going to be in the shape of
a samosa.

168
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,359
We've been to Goa a couple of times.

169
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,119
I used to walk quite a way
in the morning

170
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,679
just to get these samosas that were
absolutely beautiful.

171
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,039
Linda's Goan inspired pasties will
be filled with spiced chicken,

172
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,359
coriander and potato,

173
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,799
with a design flourish that is not
leaving anything to fate.

174
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,439
I'm going to attempt to put a little
karma symbol...

175
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,759
Oh, OK, nice ..in Nigella seeds.

176
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,119
Also, I am hoping that it does stay
there.

177
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,960
If you don't mark this highly, it's
gonna come back at you. Yeah.

178
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,319
Dave's also taking inspiration from
his travels.

179
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,319
My filling's based on a meal that I
had out in Thailand.

180
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,640
So, this is a Thai chilli basil
chicken pasty.

181
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,319
Dave's chicken and jasmine
rice filling

182
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,879
will come with a sweet
chilli dipping sauce on the side.

183
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,239
And his pasties will be decorated
with chilli motifs.

184
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,759
They're not too hot. They're bird's
eye chillies.

185
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,080
It gives the pasty a kick rather
than an over-powering chilli taste.

186
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,959
So, now I am on to rolling out my
pastry and cutting out the shapes
for my pasties.

187
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,280
Hopefully that's rested.

188
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,319
With 45 minutes of the bake left...

189
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,199
I'm not being too precise about it.

190
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,479
..the bakers must carefully manage
every remaining second.

191
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,919
I want to get them nice and thin,
but taking me absolute ages to get
these right.

192
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,319
The more time spent on building
their pasties...

193
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,879
I've got to make sure the filling is
completely cold before I add it
into the pastry,

194
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,839
else it's just going to melt
the pastry completely.

195
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,559
..the less time they'll get in the
oven.

196
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,919
A fairly generous amount of filling
goes in there.

197
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,279
That is quite tasty, actually,
I must admit.

198
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,639
I've got to be mindful not to put
too much on,

199
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,599
which is what I normally do,
and then struggle to crimp it.

200
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,359
Having set up home in the
south-west,

201
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,039
Marc's got a lot riding on his
reinterpretation of the iconic pasty.

202
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,759
You are from Cornwall, aren't you? I
know. No pressure there, is there?

203
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,319
Technically, though, I'm from up
north. So, that's my get-out clause
if they go wrong.

204
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,999
No, you are representing Cornwall.
You won't be able to go back.
No, they won't let me back in.

205
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,999
Marc's paying homage to the Cornish
coast with a monkfish, samphire
creamy lemon sauce filling

206
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,519
encased in a shortcrust shell, sealed
with traditional pleated crimps.

207
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,760
How many pleats are you doing?

208
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,519
I don't know. As many as I can.

209
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,919
OK. Should there be a set...? There
is a set number, yeah. Is there
really? Yeah.

210
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,720
I'm not going to tell you now.

211
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,559
It's down to the bakers how many
crimps they use to seal their
pasties.

212
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,439
Apparently, the perfect Cornish
pastry's got 20 crimps.

213
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,759
We don't want none of that on it,
really.

214
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,799
It's just typically samosa style.

215
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,519
My technique is press the pastry
over itself using your fingers,

216
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,959
and hope it looks like a crimp.

217
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,719
Yeah, it's a bit messy.

218
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,280
This is now melting because it's
been out of the freezer too long.

219
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,919
That's the last one.

220
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,359
I'm just giving it an eggwash. It
gives a really nice sort of glaze
and shine on the pasties.

221
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,440
I like to imagine that when Paul has
a bath, he has a bath of eggwash.

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,720
That's how he gets that nice bronze
look.

223
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,239
I am adding on some wee scales quite
slapdash.

224
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,999
I know that they're supposed to be
really nicely neat, but I'd
rather they were cooked.

225
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,039
Right, going in.

226
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,599
I'm going to put them in for 35
minutes and check them.

227
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,999
How long do we have left?

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,079
Bakers, you've got minutes left.
Don't make a bet.

229
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,879
I won't have time for highly
decorated.

230
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,759
This is for the chillies on the top.

231
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,200
Don't have time so they're going to
go in as they are.

232
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,799
I was going to put a little... Karma
sign on them... yeah, but I can just
get the seeds on.

233
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,199
At least get some in the oven, you
know?

234
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,359
Let's not have that speak. No,
that's true. You're going to get
them all out.

235
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,239
Do you know why? Because you're
Linda -

236
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,720
the inventor of the karma pasty.

237
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,759
What will be, will be on that lot.

238
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,759
I'm going to give them 20 minutes at
200 and then I'll reduce the
temperature.

239
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,160
Let's hope they cook.

240
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,919
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes.

241
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,480
Well, 15 minutes left and I need
another 20 minutes, so...

242
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,919
..that doesn't really add up, does
it?

243
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,439
It is cooked inside, but you also
need the nice brown colour.

244
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,079
Oh, God. I'm going to need a
miracle.

245
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,719
I just put another eggwash on
because they aren't very golden.

246
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,599
I don't know whether to turn them
off, or if that's a bad idea.
I've got it on 250!

247
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,159
It's like a pizza oven in there.

248
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,959
How's it going? All right. Any
leakage? Yeah, all the leakage.

249
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,559
The butter is literally melting out
and they're not crimped
properly. Good sign? No, not great.

250
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,439
This is a Thai sweet chilli dipping
sauce.

251
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,359
Bring that to a boil, come on.

252
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,559
Still a little bit pale. I want them
to be a bit darker.

253
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,879
Bakers, you have five minutes left!

254
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,159
All right. I'm coming out.

255
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,239
I think these bad boys are done.

256
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,279
Crispy underneath. They look like
fish and they're pasties.

257
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,640
I'm going to swap them around.

258
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,399
Oh, God.

259
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,839
Bakers, you have one minute.

260
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,759
OK, I'm coming out.

261
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,640
Please tell me when there's 30
seconds.

262
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,520
I'll take them out at the very last
second.

263
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,040
My cousin made these toads for
toad-in-the-hole.

264
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,800
Right, here we come.

265
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,760
Ugh. Bakers, your time is up.

266
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,519
Stop what you're doing, place your
pasties at the end of your work
stations.

267
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,239
Ooh!

268
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,840
Rustic is good for pasties, right?

269
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,440
That's as fine as you can be with a
pasty.

270
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,600
I'm thinking it's a shame there's
no crimp.

271
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:29,523
The bakers' signature pasties are
about to face

272
00:14:29,524 --> 00:14:31,324
Pastry Week's first judging.

273
00:14:33,284 --> 00:14:35,283
Hey, Prue, Paul. Hello, Marc.
Hey, Marc. Hello.

274
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:37,843
You have the weight of the whole
of Cornwall on your shoulders.

275
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,124
I certainly have,
which is making me a bit nervous.

276
00:14:47,164 --> 00:14:49,483
You are lacking
on the number of pleats.

277
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:50,484
How many should there be?

278
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:53,403
I think it's 20 or 21.
I was getting close.

279
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:55,843
I think you are about seven or
eight short. Yeah. Yeah.

280
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:58,923
The biggest one for me is the
colour, cos they look a bit pale.

281
00:14:58,924 --> 00:15:02,003
Especially this one here,
you haven't brushed it properly.

282
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:03,563
Flavour is good, but it's bone dry.

283
00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:05,123
You had cream in that as well. Yeah.

284
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:06,603
Probably a little bit more cream.

285
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:09,203
That would have really given you
more moisture in the mouthful.

286
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:11,803
It is a little bit too dry for me.
OK. Lovely pastry.

287
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:14,403
I think if you'd done it faster
and hotter,

288
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:16,723
you might have kept
a little more of the colour.

289
00:15:16,724 --> 00:15:18,284
OK.

290
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:26,203
The overall look of this one is
fantastic. It is like a flatfish.

291
00:15:26,204 --> 00:15:27,963
It looks great.

292
00:15:27,964 --> 00:15:29,803
I was a bit worried it would be
stodgy,

293
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,563
but, in fact, it's certainly not.

294
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,563
If anything, it's a bit dry.

295
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:35,403
There's a nice kick
of flavour there,

296
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:38,003
but, unfortunately, you've got rice
sitting on a pastry,

297
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,484
which is very good,
but, essentially, quite dry.

298
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:47,723
I think they are a little bit messy.

299
00:15:47,724 --> 00:15:50,083
You've lost the definition
in the pleats across the top.

300
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:52,883
But I like the colour of them.
I think it's very witty.

301
00:15:52,884 --> 00:15:55,443
Very flaky, which is good.

302
00:15:55,444 --> 00:15:56,484
Nice.

303
00:15:57,804 --> 00:16:00,163
They taste amazing.
The mash works really well.

304
00:16:00,164 --> 00:16:01,883
Do you remember I said
it won't work?

305
00:16:01,884 --> 00:16:03,643
I was wrong.
It is very, very good.

306
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:05,523
It doesn't look good,
but the textures,

307
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:07,883
the flavours are all spot on.
They taste amazing.

308
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,483
Yeah, can you book me one for lunch?
Yeah, I'll book you one, no worries.

309
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:13,124
I'm serious. Yeah, yeah.
I want one. That one. Yeah.

310
00:16:19,924 --> 00:16:21,123
They are very nice indeed.

311
00:16:21,124 --> 00:16:23,443
They're nicely glazed,
they are well baked,

312
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:24,523
they are the right colour

313
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:26,443
and there are the little chillies
on top. Yes.

314
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,723
They are very impressive. Thank you.

315
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:30,283
I think your flavour is OK.

316
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:32,003
I think it's a little bit dry,
though,

317
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:33,883
I think you put too much rice in
there. OK.

318
00:16:33,884 --> 00:16:36,683
Because the rice is going to dry
everything out, soak everything in.

319
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:39,003
You have lost the flavour
of the chicken, but, otherwise,

320
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:40,403
I mean, the pastry is good.

321
00:16:40,404 --> 00:16:42,763
It's all right to eat, it just
doesn't, you know, wow me.

322
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:46,644
OK, that's fair enough. Can I just
taste it with your sauce? Yes, yes.

323
00:16:48,284 --> 00:16:50,643
Do you know, that would have
made a huge difference?

324
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:53,643
Because it has that sweetness and
the chilli and a little bit of kick.

325
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:55,284
Thank you.

326
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:06,203
Do you know, that is really what
a pasty should look like.

327
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:10,643
It is full, the pastry looks
beautiful, soft and tender,

328
00:17:10,644 --> 00:17:13,323
but firm enough to, if not hurl
over a hedge,

329
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,923
at least hold in your hand.
It tastes beautiful.

330
00:17:15,924 --> 00:17:19,203
The spices in there, the chilli
in there was just the right amount.

331
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,443
It's got a nice kick of heat in
there. The textures are spot on.

332
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:25,123
It's gorgeous. Very good.

333
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:28,443
Heaven. You do realise
a handshake from me is valueless?

334
00:17:28,444 --> 00:17:31,483
It's a lot of value to me. Yeah.

335
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,483
There you are, Mark. Phew!

336
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:35,803
It was all right. You were a bit
worried, weren't you? I was.

337
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,004
Well done.

338
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:47,323
Another couple of minutes, perhaps,
in the oven? I was running behind.

339
00:17:47,324 --> 00:17:48,764
So you were rushing...? Yeah.

340
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:56,483
Nice and full. That's beautiful.
The lamb is cooked beautifully.

341
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:58,843
Thank you. The flavours,
the spices...

342
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,163
Just the right amount of veg to
meat.

343
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,283
It's beautiful.

344
00:18:02,284 --> 00:18:03,683
That is a lovely pasty.

345
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:06,483
Because you've got a good pastry
on the outside, quite buttery.

346
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:09,523
It's really delicious. Thank you.
Thank you very much indeed.

347
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:11,563
Well done, Hermine. Thank you.

348
00:18:11,564 --> 00:18:12,964
Sorry they didn't like it.

349
00:18:21,604 --> 00:18:26,003
Well, you did read the stuff about
we were going to want them crimped?

350
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,723
Oh. Did you miss that?
I missed that on the brief. Sorry.

351
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:31,683
OK, so we have a samosa,
essentially. Yes.

352
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:33,203
I'd like the colour of them...

353
00:18:33,204 --> 00:18:36,323
They are a little bit white
in places and broken up slightly,

354
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:39,043
a bit longer in the oven, perhaps?
Yes, absolutely.

355
00:18:39,044 --> 00:18:42,643
Your stencilling didn't work. No.
You know what? It looks very nice.

356
00:18:42,644 --> 00:18:44,003
The flavours are fantastic.

357
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:46,483
I think you've got the idea
of the samosa right in there.

358
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:49,163
I'd like to have seen the crimping
which you didn't do,

359
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:51,483
but what I do like is
the combination of the butteriness

360
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:53,163
with the samosa filling.

361
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:55,604
A delicious lunch.
Well done. Thank you.

362
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:05,883
Nice colour. You've got a beautiful
sort of golden brown colour.

363
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:07,883
You have got a little
bit of crimping on the edge.

364
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:09,443
A little bit irregular in size.

365
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:11,403
I like the fact
they're nice and fat.

366
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:14,203
There is going to be a good lot of
filling in there. Nice flaky pastry.

367
00:19:14,204 --> 00:19:16,484
The filling in there, as well,
going right to the sides.

368
00:19:18,844 --> 00:19:20,443
Heaven. I love that.

369
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:22,883
It's flaky,
the pastry is holding together,

370
00:19:22,884 --> 00:19:25,443
its moist in the middle but not wet.
I could gobble it up.

371
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:28,283
Thank you. I think you've got the
perfect blend there of ingredients.

372
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:32,083
The texture and flavour are spot on.
Oh, thank you. Well done. Well done.

373
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:33,643
Thank you. Thanks.

374
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:36,043
Well done, Laura. I'll take that.

375
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:37,803
Oh, my God, that was amazing.

376
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:40,243
To impress Paul with the pastry
and Prue with the filling,

377
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:41,683
like, double whammy.

378
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:43,524
They liked it. What more?

379
00:19:45,004 --> 00:19:47,763
I knew the flavours were going to be
good. I could smell them.

380
00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:50,243
I am worried about the Technical
because, with pastry,

381
00:19:50,244 --> 00:19:52,203
they can do literally anything.

382
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:54,163
If I could just not be
bottom in Technical again,

383
00:19:54,164 --> 00:19:55,164
that would be great.

384
00:19:58,004 --> 00:20:01,323
As usual, the bakers can
practise their signatures.

385
00:20:01,324 --> 00:20:03,643
But what they will bake in
the Technical

386
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:06,124
is only now about to be revealed.

387
00:20:07,924 --> 00:20:11,403
Bakers, it's now time
for your Technical Challenge,

388
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:13,923
which, today, has been set by Prue.

389
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:15,883
Prue, thanks for joining us in
the tent.

390
00:20:15,884 --> 00:20:17,603
Do you have any words of advice?

391
00:20:17,604 --> 00:20:19,923
This is all about refinement,

392
00:20:19,924 --> 00:20:23,723
so the inside must be as perfect
as the outside.

393
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:26,123
As ever, this technical
challenge will be judged blind,

394
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,523
so could you two please
leave the tent?

395
00:20:28,524 --> 00:20:29,764
We will see you later on.

396
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:34,363
Prue would like you to make
three raspberry

397
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:37,683
and three salted caramel eclairs.

398
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:42,083
Prue is looking for precision,
perfect piping,

399
00:20:42,084 --> 00:20:46,443
baked until golden brown.
You have two hours and 15 minutes.

400
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:48,684
On your marks... Get set. Bake.

401
00:20:53,004 --> 00:20:54,843
There is a lot of steps in this
recipe.

402
00:20:54,844 --> 00:20:56,643
I just grabbed out all
the saucepans.

403
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:58,243
I've not made eclairs before.

404
00:20:58,244 --> 00:21:00,603
I have made choux before,
but not eclairs.

405
00:21:00,604 --> 00:21:03,003
Eclairs themselves will be easy,
but it's not just eclairs,

406
00:21:03,004 --> 00:21:04,203
there's a lot going on.

407
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:05,764
I'm not sure about this one.

408
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:10,923
Prue, eclairs is
the Technical Challenge.

409
00:21:10,924 --> 00:21:12,603
Personally, I think it's a good one.

410
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,523
Most people think eclairs
are very easy.

411
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:18,883
But if you want really high-end,
elegant, special ones,

412
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:21,763
then you have to do a lot of work.

413
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:23,763
There is one choux pastry
for all of these.

414
00:21:23,764 --> 00:21:26,123
Well, I should think
they've all made choux pastry,

415
00:21:26,124 --> 00:21:27,683
they should all be able
to make it well.

416
00:21:27,684 --> 00:21:30,123
Then you have to make creme pat
to fill them all with.

417
00:21:30,124 --> 00:21:33,083
Half of that creme pat needs
to be flavoured with salted caramel,

418
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:36,683
and the other half,
seedless raspberry puree.

419
00:21:36,684 --> 00:21:39,483
The little kick from the salted
caramel blended with the sweetness

420
00:21:39,484 --> 00:21:41,923
of the raspberry, you've got
a nice balance between the two.

421
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:44,483
You have set them a very
difficult Technical Challenge.

422
00:21:44,484 --> 00:21:45,803
We are halfway through.

423
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,123
The bakers that are left
are really good.

424
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:49,884
You can talk, I'm eating, go on...

425
00:21:54,164 --> 00:21:56,404
So it says... Make the choux.

426
00:21:58,324 --> 00:21:59,724
So just make the choux.

427
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:04,403
Put the sugar, the milk,
the water and the butter into a pan

428
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:06,043
and heat it over a low heat.

429
00:22:06,044 --> 00:22:07,323
Chuck the flour in.

430
00:22:07,324 --> 00:22:10,083
Mix, mix, mix, mix, mix,
so it forms a paste.

431
00:22:10,084 --> 00:22:12,083
It's just not thick enough.

432
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:14,364
It's just not
what I expected at all.

433
00:22:15,524 --> 00:22:17,843
Oh, it's a long time
since I made it,

434
00:22:17,844 --> 00:22:19,764
so I'm not 100% sure about this.

435
00:22:20,844 --> 00:22:22,283
Do all right on the eclairs.

436
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:24,723
I'm all right on eclairs,
but there's so many steps in this.

437
00:22:24,724 --> 00:22:27,283
It's a lot of reading, that,
isn't it? She writes books.

438
00:22:27,284 --> 00:22:31,683
There's quite a racy scene
between two farm hands there.

439
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,124
Yes, bit by bit
until you get the right consistency.

440
00:22:35,964 --> 00:22:38,323
I think it's meant to,
like, stick to the spoon,

441
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:40,643
like, not want to come off from it
very well.

442
00:22:40,644 --> 00:22:42,523
It has to be dropping consistency.

443
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:45,043
You are looking for a V-shape
off a spatula or spoon.

444
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:48,323
Reluctant to drop. That's what you
want. There you go, there is your V.

445
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:51,443
I'm going to pipe the choux out onto
the baking tray.

446
00:22:51,444 --> 00:22:52,764
I need to pipe carefully.

447
00:22:56,764 --> 00:22:58,324
I'm happy with them.

448
00:22:59,684 --> 00:23:03,563
Yeah, they'll do, they'll do.
These are going in the oven.

449
00:23:03,564 --> 00:23:07,003
It does not give us any instructions
on how long to bake these for.

450
00:23:07,004 --> 00:23:10,043
I'm going to start off with 15,
see how they're going,

451
00:23:10,044 --> 00:23:12,363
and then just take it from there.

452
00:23:12,364 --> 00:23:16,324
No, I'm not certain that's right.
I'm not certain that's right at all.

453
00:23:17,684 --> 00:23:22,243
I'm making my creme pat.
Creme patissiere is just custard.

454
00:23:22,244 --> 00:23:23,923
It's just a posh word for custard.

455
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:25,323
Don't want it to be lumpy,

456
00:23:25,324 --> 00:23:27,883
so I'll make sure that I keep
stirring it whilst it's heating up.

457
00:23:27,884 --> 00:23:30,203
Absolutely no idea what I'm doing.

458
00:23:30,204 --> 00:23:32,723
Just finding new ways to make
scrambled egg.

459
00:23:32,724 --> 00:23:35,004
It's a bit grainier
than I'd like it to be.

460
00:23:35,884 --> 00:23:39,443
It's too wet. There's too many
elements that can go wrong on this.

461
00:23:39,444 --> 00:23:41,963
Are you left-handed?
I am left-handed.

462
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:45,003
You know a left-handed person has
never won the Bake Off.

463
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:46,843
Good boost of confidence.

464
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:49,283
You know someone who has ever worn
a yellow T-shirt

465
00:23:49,284 --> 00:23:51,563
has never won the Bake Off.

466
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:53,043
Oh, no!

467
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:54,843
They are not rising at all.

468
00:23:54,844 --> 00:23:57,363
I would have expected to see
some movement in it.

469
00:23:57,364 --> 00:24:00,043
They are looking a bit oily.

470
00:24:00,044 --> 00:24:02,123
I think they are cooked, you know.

471
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:04,883
Oh, dear, they have, like, risen
quite a lot, haven't they?

472
00:24:04,884 --> 00:24:07,203
They are looking nice
and crisp on the outside.

473
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:08,563
They could be slightly fatter.

474
00:24:08,564 --> 00:24:10,443
I don't know how I'm going
to fill them.

475
00:24:10,444 --> 00:24:13,163
They're not lovely golden brown.
They'll have to do.

476
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:15,444
They've kind of already deflated
a little bit.

477
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:19,003
No, that's not happening.

478
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:20,684
Right, let's have another think.

479
00:24:22,724 --> 00:24:26,363
Bakers, you have roughly one hour,
seven minutes and 30 seconds left.

480
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,003
You are halfway through. You can put
it like that if you want.

481
00:24:29,004 --> 00:24:32,923
I'm going to do the choux again.
Hopefully, I've got time to bake it.

482
00:24:32,924 --> 00:24:36,003
Make the caramel
with 100g of sugar.

483
00:24:36,004 --> 00:24:37,083
In we go.

484
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:39,403
Every time I make caramel in this
tent, it goes wrong.

485
00:24:39,404 --> 00:24:41,163
I'm going to keep it on a low heat

486
00:24:41,164 --> 00:24:43,843
and then I'm just not going
to touch it ever.

487
00:24:43,844 --> 00:24:45,564
Got to keep my eye on that caramel.

488
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:50,443
This is taking forever.
Doesn't look right, does it?

489
00:24:50,444 --> 00:24:52,843
Is it harder to cook on television?
Yeah.

490
00:24:52,844 --> 00:24:55,963
Would you go on any other shows?
Would you go on Naked Attraction?

491
00:24:55,964 --> 00:24:58,363
I wouldn't go on
Naked Attraction

492
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:00,084
because my body is my own business.

493
00:25:02,964 --> 00:25:06,243
I'm really not sure what to do
if that doesn't work.

494
00:25:06,244 --> 00:25:09,323
I'm just going to try and give her
the elements as much as I can.

495
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:10,924
I'm going to mash them up a bit.

496
00:25:12,484 --> 00:25:14,363
Make a seedless raspberry puree.

497
00:25:14,364 --> 00:25:17,043
I'm leaving the seeds in there
and once it's pureed down,

498
00:25:17,044 --> 00:25:19,403
I'll sieve it,
get rid of the seeds.

499
00:25:19,404 --> 00:25:22,763
Just a little bit thin.
I don't know if that will set.

500
00:25:22,764 --> 00:25:25,883
So now,
I'm making the salted caramel sauce.

501
00:25:25,884 --> 00:25:28,603
This is going to be mixed
with the creme pat

502
00:25:28,604 --> 00:25:31,643
to make a nice salted
caramel custard.

503
00:25:31,644 --> 00:25:35,683
It says one teaspoon of salt.
It's quite dark.

504
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:37,683
But I just need to get it
chilled now

505
00:25:37,684 --> 00:25:40,244
so I can fold it into the creme pat.

506
00:25:41,204 --> 00:25:42,883
I'm just really baffled.

507
00:25:42,884 --> 00:25:45,443
Mine don't look like they're going
to do anything different.

508
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,803
I don't know why I'm making all
the additional bits

509
00:25:47,804 --> 00:25:49,404
if I've got nothing
to put them in.

510
00:25:51,004 --> 00:25:53,284
Do you want me to...

511
00:25:54,364 --> 00:25:56,683
..go to the supermarket
and buy some eclairs?

512
00:25:56,684 --> 00:25:57,963
I think you'd better.

513
00:25:57,964 --> 00:25:59,323
Just split my creme pat into two

514
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,123
and now I'm folding it through
the raspberry

515
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:02,523
and the salted caramel.

516
00:26:02,524 --> 00:26:05,243
I think I am kind of feeling in my
comfort zone right now. It's good.

517
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:07,603
It looks beautiful indeed.

518
00:26:07,604 --> 00:26:09,923
Yeah, it's a little bit lumpy.

519
00:26:09,924 --> 00:26:11,483
I think it'll be OK.

520
00:26:11,484 --> 00:26:13,363
I know I'm going to be
really out of time,

521
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:14,803
but I'm going to have one more go.

522
00:26:14,804 --> 00:26:16,484
I'm going to re-make the choux.

523
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:21,403
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

524
00:26:21,404 --> 00:26:24,884
Now what? Fill three of the eclairs
with raspberry filling.

525
00:26:26,004 --> 00:26:28,483
I'm doing this so cack-handedly.

526
00:26:28,484 --> 00:26:30,843
I thought, rather than doing creme
patissiere,

527
00:26:30,844 --> 00:26:33,763
I'll make a raspberry yoghurt to go
inside. So here it goes.

528
00:26:33,764 --> 00:26:35,523
It's just all totally dripping out
of it.

529
00:26:35,524 --> 00:26:37,203
I'm not really sure why that's
happened.

530
00:26:37,204 --> 00:26:38,843
I just think my puree wasn't
thick enough

531
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:40,443
when I added it to the creme pat.

532
00:26:40,444 --> 00:26:41,603
The choux are collapsed,

533
00:26:41,604 --> 00:26:43,963
so it's really difficult to
get the stuff in.

534
00:26:43,964 --> 00:26:45,884
We'll just have to go with it,
I think, today.

535
00:26:50,524 --> 00:26:52,483
It tastes all right. It looks split,
though.

536
00:26:52,484 --> 00:26:53,803
Oh, my God!

537
00:26:53,804 --> 00:26:55,443
The creme pat is too wet.

538
00:26:55,444 --> 00:26:59,364
Terrible. My creme pat is just flat.

539
00:27:01,164 --> 00:27:04,004
The salted caramel icing is going to
be piped over the top.

540
00:27:15,164 --> 00:27:16,724
That's not my finest work.

541
00:27:18,284 --> 00:27:20,563
Ooh!

542
00:27:20,564 --> 00:27:22,404
Nearly didn't have those, then.

543
00:27:23,524 --> 00:27:25,443
Third time lucky.

544
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:28,083
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

545
00:27:28,084 --> 00:27:29,563
Crikey!

546
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,243
I'm really not sure what to
do with them.

547
00:27:32,244 --> 00:27:33,523
Winging it!

548
00:27:33,524 --> 00:27:36,283
This is not my usual
highly decorated standard.

549
00:27:36,284 --> 00:27:38,083
Yes, there's a lot going on at once.

550
00:27:38,084 --> 00:27:39,723
Just going to...

551
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:40,883
I'm so stressed.

552
00:27:40,884 --> 00:27:43,963
They can have a dip of the
creme patissiere and the coulis.

553
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:45,644
You know? I've done what I can.

554
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:49,324
This is horrendous!

555
00:27:59,964 --> 00:28:03,403
Bakers, your time is up.

556
00:28:03,404 --> 00:28:05,204
Disappointed.

557
00:28:06,444 --> 00:28:09,803
Please, bring your eclairs down
to the front and place them

558
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:12,163
behind your photographs.

559
00:28:12,164 --> 00:28:15,404
Look at this, at least it gets mine
out of the way first. Well done.

560
00:28:16,724 --> 00:28:20,283
Prue and Paul are looking for six
elegant eclairs.

561
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:23,363
Three filled with a salted caramel
creme pat

562
00:28:23,364 --> 00:28:25,923
and three with
a raspberry creme pat.

563
00:28:25,924 --> 00:28:28,243
OK, shall we start with this one?

564
00:28:28,244 --> 00:28:30,603
The toppings are sort of there
or thereabouts.

565
00:28:30,604 --> 00:28:32,603
And they are more or less the right
colour.

566
00:28:32,604 --> 00:28:35,683
Yeah. OK, let's see what the creme
pat's like.

567
00:28:35,684 --> 00:28:37,643
Oh, this one is empty.

568
00:28:37,644 --> 00:28:39,963
And that one is runny.

569
00:28:39,964 --> 00:28:42,843
It's completely liquid.
Mm. Nice flavour.

570
00:28:42,844 --> 00:28:44,283
The flavours are right,

571
00:28:44,284 --> 00:28:46,603
but it's too thick and the
consistency on the eclair

572
00:28:46,604 --> 00:28:47,923
and the creme pat is not right.

573
00:28:47,924 --> 00:28:50,523
Moving on to number two.
These look quite neat.

574
00:28:50,524 --> 00:28:54,364
All the same size.
This icing has set all right.

575
00:28:55,404 --> 00:28:57,803
Look at that. It's split.

576
00:28:57,804 --> 00:29:01,404
The raspberry flavour is there, but
the consistency is all wrong inside.

577
00:29:02,524 --> 00:29:05,083
What? Those weren't finished.

578
00:29:05,084 --> 00:29:07,083
Oh, it's a dip one. Oh, I see.

579
00:29:07,084 --> 00:29:08,884
I get it. I see.

580
00:29:10,644 --> 00:29:11,723
There is no rise in that.

581
00:29:11,724 --> 00:29:13,323
It obviously hasn't got any flour
in it.

582
00:29:13,324 --> 00:29:14,604
I can't understand that.

583
00:29:16,044 --> 00:29:18,603
That's terrible.

584
00:29:18,604 --> 00:29:20,083
All right. Moving on.

585
00:29:20,084 --> 00:29:22,163
These are rather fat.

586
00:29:22,164 --> 00:29:24,724
But having said that,
they look like eclairs.

587
00:29:26,644 --> 00:29:31,003
The raspberry one actually tastes
OK. And the eclair is baked well.

588
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:32,164
Yes, not bad effort.

589
00:29:33,244 --> 00:29:36,684
Moving on. A bit skinny. Yeah.
I mean, they look neat enough.

590
00:29:40,124 --> 00:29:43,883
The pastry is just not baked enough.
The flavours of both are OK.

591
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:45,644
It's the textures that are wrong.

592
00:29:46,724 --> 00:29:49,483
This is an original take
on the icing.

593
00:29:49,484 --> 00:29:51,323
Looks like a giant caterpillar.

594
00:29:51,324 --> 00:29:52,724
Needed longer in the oven.

595
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:56,803
There's a lot wrong
with this eclair.

596
00:29:56,804 --> 00:30:01,163
The creme pat is scrambled,
the pastry is really soft

597
00:30:01,164 --> 00:30:02,843
and under baked.

598
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:06,684
OK, I'm cheering up a little here
because these are more or less OK.

599
00:30:08,124 --> 00:30:11,043
That's empty. That's empty.
This one's got some...

600
00:30:11,044 --> 00:30:12,683
The caramel in there is OK.

601
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:15,003
Oh, it is, but there's very little
creme pat in the middle.

602
00:30:15,004 --> 00:30:16,483
There's nothing in there.

603
00:30:16,484 --> 00:30:19,803
Moving on to the last one. Now,
these are all the same. Quite neat.

604
00:30:19,804 --> 00:30:21,684
The right consistency
with the creme pat.

605
00:30:24,164 --> 00:30:27,604
Good flavour as well.
Mm. Not bad at all. No. Very good.

606
00:30:28,684 --> 00:30:33,803
The judges will now rank
the eclairs from worst to best.

607
00:30:33,804 --> 00:30:37,483
In eighth spot, comes as no
surprise, this one, whose is this?

608
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:38,563
Linda?

609
00:30:38,564 --> 00:30:39,963
A few issues with the choux,

610
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:41,643
your caramel should go on the top

611
00:30:41,644 --> 00:30:44,123
and there's no creme pat inside.

612
00:30:44,124 --> 00:30:46,203
In seventh place, we have this one.

613
00:30:46,204 --> 00:30:50,683
Mine. They're a bit long and thin
and a bit under-baked. Yeah.

614
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:55,563
Laura takes sixth. Dave is fifth.
And Lottie gets fourth.

615
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:58,843
In third place,
we had this one. Mark.

616
00:30:58,844 --> 00:31:02,203
You were redeemed by the fact
that the pastry was well-cooked

617
00:31:02,204 --> 00:31:05,324
and that they tasted delicious,
but they were really messy.

618
00:31:11,644 --> 00:31:14,003
In second spot, we have this one.

619
00:31:14,004 --> 00:31:17,283
These are pretty good. They could
just have been a little bit thinner.

620
00:31:17,284 --> 00:31:19,683
They're just a little bit too fat.

621
00:31:19,684 --> 00:31:22,924
Which means, the winner
is this one.

622
00:31:24,204 --> 00:31:26,123
Peter, they were delicious.

623
00:31:26,124 --> 00:31:28,723
My only quarrel was
they were probably a little bit fat,

624
00:31:28,724 --> 00:31:30,683
but I thought they were lovely.

625
00:31:30,684 --> 00:31:32,484
We both thought they were lovely.
Well done.

626
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:36,483
That is the first time
I've won the Technical,

627
00:31:36,484 --> 00:31:39,683
so tick it off the bucket list,
the Bake Off bucket list.

628
00:31:39,684 --> 00:31:41,963
Really happy. Earned it well.

629
00:31:41,964 --> 00:31:44,563
It wasn't my finest hour, that one.

630
00:31:44,564 --> 00:31:47,404
Two hours trying to make choux
pastry, disgusting.

631
00:31:49,364 --> 00:31:51,604
But tomorrow is another day.

632
00:31:59,904 --> 00:32:00,184
There's just one challenge left

633
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:03,543
before Paul and Prue
decide who will be Star Baker

634
00:32:03,544 --> 00:32:06,544
and who will be leaving
the tent today.

635
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:11,543
Bakers, welcome back to the tent.

636
00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:14,663
It's time
for your Showstopper challenge.

637
00:32:14,664 --> 00:32:17,183
Paul and Prue
would like you each to make

638
00:32:17,184 --> 00:32:19,023
a caged tart.

639
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:22,183
An exquisite, sweet tart

640
00:32:22,184 --> 00:32:26,583
contained within
an intricately-latticed pastry cage.

641
00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:28,943
You can work with any type of pastry
you like,

642
00:32:28,944 --> 00:32:32,343
but it must be self-supporting
and highly decorative.

643
00:32:32,344 --> 00:32:34,703
And remember,
this is your Showstopper,

644
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:37,943
so it needs to look
and taste superb!

645
00:32:37,944 --> 00:32:40,023
Matthew, did you know the caged tart

646
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,983
was actually invented
by actor Nicolas Cage?

647
00:32:42,984 --> 00:32:44,583
Yes, Noel. I did know that.

648
00:32:44,584 --> 00:32:48,423
Did you know that Nicolas Cage
is a big fan of this show? Really?

649
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,903
Yes, he watches this and
Homes Under The Hammer.

650
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:56,783
You have three hours, 45 minutes
to complete your caged tarts.

651
00:32:56,784 --> 00:32:59,143
On your marks... Get set...

652
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,424
Bake!

653
00:33:04,184 --> 00:33:05,623
The sun is shining, yeah.

654
00:33:05,624 --> 00:33:07,943
And I'm smiling.

655
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,823
I am at the moment.

656
00:33:09,824 --> 00:33:11,023
Till we're dishing up.

657
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:12,703
This is a really tough challenge.

658
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,983
You know, anyone can bake a tart,

659
00:33:14,984 --> 00:33:16,503
but making a caged tart...

660
00:33:16,504 --> 00:33:18,503
The biggest issue is the cage,
no doubt.

661
00:33:18,504 --> 00:33:22,303
I've never managed to make this
caged tart in its entirety.

662
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:25,143
Why would you make a caged tart?
It's bonkers.

663
00:33:25,144 --> 00:33:26,423
It looks beautiful.

664
00:33:26,424 --> 00:33:29,303
You're supposed
to showcase it, not cage it.

665
00:33:29,304 --> 00:33:30,903
We've gone all out here.

666
00:33:30,904 --> 00:33:34,383
We want the most
elegant latticed cage

667
00:33:34,384 --> 00:33:36,663
made of pastry.

668
00:33:36,664 --> 00:33:38,703
The cage can't be too solid

669
00:33:38,704 --> 00:33:40,383
that you can't see the tart

670
00:33:40,384 --> 00:33:41,983
and it's gotta be structurally
sound,

671
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:43,943
so it's actually
quite a difficult challenge.

672
00:33:43,944 --> 00:33:46,423
This has to be
a really special tart.

673
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,903
It has to be luscious.

674
00:33:47,904 --> 00:33:51,303
The kind of tart that you really
want to eat a huge amount of,

675
00:33:51,304 --> 00:33:53,983
but you shouldn't,
because it's very rich.

676
00:33:53,984 --> 00:33:57,503
What I'm looking for is a very thin,
crispy base.

677
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,983
Lots of filling,
punching with flavour

678
00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:01,983
and a beautifully-decorated top.

679
00:34:01,984 --> 00:34:03,423
They're good bakers.

680
00:34:03,424 --> 00:34:05,064
I have every confidence.

681
00:34:08,544 --> 00:34:11,623
First hour really is all about me
getting my doughs ready.

682
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:14,863
The bakers are free to use
whatever pastry they choose...

683
00:34:14,864 --> 00:34:18,223
I'm making a sweet pastry
for the tart itself

684
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:20,703
and then I'm doing a different
pastry for the cage.

685
00:34:20,704 --> 00:34:24,263
..but must keep in mind each dough
has a different job to do.

686
00:34:24,264 --> 00:34:28,103
This is the sweet crust pastry
for the tart case.

687
00:34:28,104 --> 00:34:30,463
The tart must be crisp
and delicious...

688
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:32,863
I'm just making
my hazelnut pastry now.

689
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:35,543
..while the cage must be strong
and sturdy.

690
00:34:35,544 --> 00:34:37,983
I'm gonna have to say
it's a French sweet pastry,

691
00:34:37,984 --> 00:34:39,623
because I can't pronounce...

692
00:34:39,624 --> 00:34:42,183
This is my pate sucree tart base.

693
00:34:42,184 --> 00:34:43,423
It's a crumbly pastry,

694
00:34:43,424 --> 00:34:46,183
but it's not so crumbly that
I can't work with it.

695
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,503
I'm making three different types
of pastry.

696
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:50,823
It is, after all, Pastry Week.

697
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:55,663
Lottie's bake will be housed in an
ambitious choux pastry pyramid cage.

698
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:57,183
Unusually for a tart,

699
00:34:57,184 --> 00:35:01,623
it will have pastry layers with
pureed, caramelised and raw apple

700
00:35:01,624 --> 00:35:03,263
sandwiched in between.

701
00:35:03,264 --> 00:35:05,623
I question whether
it would be a tart without sides.

702
00:35:05,624 --> 00:35:08,023
I did look up the definition
of the word tart.

703
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:10,423
It's from an old French word
that means flat pastry.

704
00:35:10,424 --> 00:35:11,503
Right.

705
00:35:11,504 --> 00:35:12,543
Are you confident?

706
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,263
I'm confident in all but the cage.

707
00:35:15,264 --> 00:35:18,663
But there's more than one pyramid
under construction today.

708
00:35:18,664 --> 00:35:21,383
The cage is inspired by the Louvre.

709
00:35:21,384 --> 00:35:23,703
I don't know if it's Showstopper
incredible,

710
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:24,863
but we'll wait and see.

711
00:35:24,864 --> 00:35:28,463
Dave's aiming to serve
a set mango and lime filling,

712
00:35:28,464 --> 00:35:30,783
on a cocoa and sweet pastry base,

713
00:35:30,784 --> 00:35:34,343
presented in
a Parisian museum-inspired cage.

714
00:35:34,344 --> 00:35:36,703
Interesting flavours.
I like the idea of mango and lime.

715
00:35:36,704 --> 00:35:38,623
You're gonna stick it together
with caramel?

716
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,263
Yeah, it's stuck together with
caramel. That's very difficult.

717
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,863
Very difficult to glue it together
with caramel. Well, good luck.

718
00:35:44,864 --> 00:35:46,543
This is my tart case.

719
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:49,943
I'm just trying to
not overstretch it.

720
00:35:49,944 --> 00:35:51,663
I'm pricking the base of the tart.

721
00:35:51,664 --> 00:35:53,383
Erm...

722
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,743
That's gonna allow any steam
to escape

723
00:35:55,744 --> 00:35:58,223
and stop it from getting all bumpy
and uneven,

724
00:35:58,224 --> 00:36:01,543
and then this pastry's gonna
blind bake. In it goes.

725
00:36:01,544 --> 00:36:02,703
That's going in.

726
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:04,464
That's going in now, this one.

727
00:36:05,544 --> 00:36:08,343
This is the cage pastry.

728
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:11,543
Can I just say, I love it
when you beat the butter up.

729
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,463
Are you thinking it's Paul?

730
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:15,783
I couldn't possibly say.

731
00:36:15,784 --> 00:36:18,143
Hi, Laura. Hello!
Hi, Laura. Hello!

732
00:36:18,144 --> 00:36:20,623
Laura, tell us all about
your caged tart.

733
00:36:20,624 --> 00:36:23,423
I'm doing a Key lime pie
inspired tart. Ooh!

734
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,783
I'm going with
a bit of a botanical theme,

735
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:28,743
so I'll hopefully show you I can do
delicate and fine today.

736
00:36:28,744 --> 00:36:32,463
Laura's limey filling will sit
on a crunchy ginger pastry,

737
00:36:32,464 --> 00:36:34,783
accented with Italian meringue.

738
00:36:34,784 --> 00:36:37,823
It'll be caged in a domed puff
pastry lattice,

739
00:36:37,824 --> 00:36:41,023
adorned with pastry snails
and elegant butterflies.

740
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:43,383
This one's for my dad.
He absolutely loves this.

741
00:36:43,384 --> 00:36:45,783
He devours it every time I make it
for family gatherings.

742
00:36:45,784 --> 00:36:48,903
Key lime pie's one of my favourite
things. Is it? I love it.

743
00:36:48,904 --> 00:36:50,583
You know, you're on a winner there.

744
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,983
Now, I'm gonna make the pastry
for my cage.

745
00:36:52,984 --> 00:36:56,663
I certainly did not make a pastry
cage before this challenge.

746
00:36:56,664 --> 00:36:58,943
A true test of pastry prowess,

747
00:36:58,944 --> 00:37:00,823
the bakers must hit the sweet spot

748
00:37:00,824 --> 00:37:03,423
with dough strong enough not
to collapse,

749
00:37:03,424 --> 00:37:05,463
but tender enough for eating.

750
00:37:05,464 --> 00:37:07,303
I'm literally doing the exact same
again.

751
00:37:07,304 --> 00:37:10,063
My cage sable. Pate sable.

752
00:37:10,064 --> 00:37:11,663
Yeah, cocoa pate sable.

753
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:14,623
This choux isn't very robust.
Yeah, it's a hell of a risk.

754
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,783
I've gone for that, because if I can
nail it, it looks good.

755
00:37:17,784 --> 00:37:21,103
It's the same pastry recipe
as the pastry case.

756
00:37:21,104 --> 00:37:24,503
I've adapted the recipe so that it
doesn't fall apart

757
00:37:24,504 --> 00:37:25,663
when it's moulded.

758
00:37:25,664 --> 00:37:28,743
Rough puff isn't probably something
you would use to build a cage in.

759
00:37:28,744 --> 00:37:30,423
It's quite a risky one.

760
00:37:30,424 --> 00:37:32,103
I just really hope it works.

761
00:37:32,104 --> 00:37:33,983
What's the cage about?
The cage is weird.

762
00:37:33,984 --> 00:37:37,063
I'd never seen a caged tart before.
I don't know if I have.

763
00:37:37,064 --> 00:37:41,503
No, but they do look quite cool
when they turn out well.
I'll take your word for it.

764
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,863
Peter's tart will have a hazelnut
pastry base,

765
00:37:43,864 --> 00:37:46,583
a baked lemon filling
and blackberry curd

766
00:37:46,584 --> 00:37:49,783
and it will shelter under
a domed shortcrust cage,

767
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:51,463
decorated with edible flowers.

768
00:37:51,464 --> 00:37:52,823
I love a lemon tart.

769
00:37:52,824 --> 00:37:54,583
It's... I think it's my favourite.

770
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:56,023
I like this one a lot.

771
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:59,943
But he's not the only baker tweaking
the classic tarte au citron.

772
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,503
I'm making a lemon tart,

773
00:38:02,504 --> 00:38:05,623
so hopefully I will manage that.

774
00:38:05,624 --> 00:38:08,423
Hermine's tangy lemon
and lime filling

775
00:38:08,424 --> 00:38:10,783
will be topped with
sweet Italian meringue.

776
00:38:10,784 --> 00:38:14,183
She'll box her bake in with
an ornate pastry cage.

777
00:38:14,184 --> 00:38:17,823
You had such a great day yesterday.
Can you do it again?

778
00:38:17,824 --> 00:38:21,543
I am hoping, cos I kept saying,
"Bread Week wasn't mine.

779
00:38:21,544 --> 00:38:23,183
"Biscuit Week wasn't mine."

780
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:26,943
And I feel Pastry Week is the area
where I excel.

781
00:38:26,944 --> 00:38:29,023
Good. More of the same, please.

782
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:32,023
I'm gonna start making the panels
to make the cage.

783
00:38:32,024 --> 00:38:36,623
These are my stencils that I'm gonna
pipe my choux onto

784
00:38:36,624 --> 00:38:39,104
and then cook it
and then assemble it.

785
00:38:40,224 --> 00:38:43,023
Sounds easy, doesn't it?

786
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:44,263
No.

787
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:46,663
I've rolled out my rough puff

788
00:38:46,664 --> 00:38:49,023
and I'm just using
some circle cutters

789
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:50,663
and then I'll pull that
over the mould.

790
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:52,543
This is just a lattice cutter.

791
00:38:52,544 --> 00:38:54,503
It cuts out all the lattices
for you.

792
00:38:54,504 --> 00:38:58,063
These are my strands
to make the cage.

793
00:38:58,064 --> 00:39:01,623
Put them in the oven
and then they come off the bowl.
That's the plan.

794
00:39:01,624 --> 00:39:04,383
There's no particular pattern that
I'm going for here.

795
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:07,663
It's just kind of make some nice,
wavy lines, hope it looks good

796
00:39:07,664 --> 00:39:11,663
and make sure that enough
of them cross over,
so it gives it a bit of structure.

797
00:39:11,664 --> 00:39:14,063
When it goes in the oven,

798
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:16,983
hopefully it will gel together.

799
00:39:16,984 --> 00:39:20,223
I'm cutting out rhomboid shapes
in it now, inspired by the Louvre.

800
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:23,383
It is a pyramid. This is me
trying to be creative, all right?

801
00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:26,223
Is that a cage or is that a helmet?

802
00:39:26,224 --> 00:39:29,423
Who in this room would you put in
your cage, if you could?

803
00:39:29,424 --> 00:39:32,423
Oh, I think, like, a really little
mini Peter would be quite cute.

804
00:39:32,424 --> 00:39:33,583
Yeah.

805
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:35,063
Oi, Peter!

806
00:39:35,064 --> 00:39:36,983
Laura wants to put you in a cage.

807
00:39:36,984 --> 00:39:39,063
Poor kid. He looks terrified.

808
00:39:39,064 --> 00:39:42,544
What would you do with him if he
was in a cage? Feed him cheese.

809
00:39:47,064 --> 00:39:50,023
Noel, after this time call,
would you like to play table tennis?

810
00:39:50,024 --> 00:39:52,503
Yeah!
Bakers, you're halfway through.

811
00:39:52,504 --> 00:39:55,303
Hm, halfway to paradise.

812
00:39:55,304 --> 00:39:57,544
I'm gonna get my tart case out now.

813
00:40:01,144 --> 00:40:03,423
Ooh.

814
00:40:03,424 --> 00:40:04,584
Naughty.

815
00:40:06,544 --> 00:40:08,503
Yeah, I'm happy with the way
they look.

816
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:11,623
It's cracked a little bit,
but it's gonna have a filling in it,

817
00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:14,703
so that'll be hidden. A little bit
darker than I wanted in parts,

818
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:19,103
but I'll be trimming all that off.
It's fine, but it's not phenomenal.

819
00:40:19,104 --> 00:40:22,063
With their cages moulded,
cut out or piped,

820
00:40:22,064 --> 00:40:24,983
it's now the bakers can get them in
the oven.

821
00:40:24,984 --> 00:40:26,823
I'll give it 25 minutes,
then check it.

822
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,103
This is going in for 20 minutes.

823
00:40:29,104 --> 00:40:30,423
Two at a time.

824
00:40:30,424 --> 00:40:32,223
Fingers crossed.

825
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:34,663
Good luck,
my beautiful little helmet!

826
00:40:34,664 --> 00:40:37,783
Please! Pray that this works.

827
00:40:37,784 --> 00:40:39,023
Fingers crossed.

828
00:40:39,024 --> 00:40:40,943
How's it going?
It's going all right.

829
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:42,903
It's a tough one, this one. Why?

830
00:40:42,904 --> 00:40:45,543
It's just a lot to do.
A lot to think about.

831
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:48,263
A lot can go wrong.
What has gone wrong so far?

832
00:40:48,264 --> 00:40:49,663
Nothing's gone wrong so far.

833
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,983
Well, then, you just lied to me.

834
00:40:51,984 --> 00:40:55,983
All being well, Mark will put
together a pear and sage tart

835
00:40:55,984 --> 00:40:59,023
with layers of pear jam,
a pear and sage mousse

836
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:02,423
that will sit inside
a rough puff pastry bottle cage,

837
00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:05,063
resting on shortbread biscuit sand.

838
00:41:05,064 --> 00:41:07,423
Goodness, this is an ambitious
business.

839
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:10,303
I love the idea of the sage.
I'm confident that it's gonna work.

840
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,743
I have to be positive.
Thank you, Mark. Fingers crossed.

841
00:41:12,744 --> 00:41:15,783
Thank you very much. You've got
them excited about the flavours.

842
00:41:15,784 --> 00:41:19,343
It just has to look good now as
well. It will. Good luck. Thank you.

843
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:21,663
OK, what now?

844
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,143
While the pastry cage
demonstrates design,

845
00:41:24,144 --> 00:41:27,383
the filling for their tart is
a chance for the bakers to showcase

846
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,663
a flair for flavour.

847
00:41:29,664 --> 00:41:31,503
This is the chocolate cremeux.

848
00:41:31,504 --> 00:41:34,143
It's just like a really thick
chocolate cream.

849
00:41:34,144 --> 00:41:36,583
It's toffee popcorn creme diplomate.

850
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:38,423
It tastes like popcorn at a push.

851
00:41:38,424 --> 00:41:41,263
Yesterday was yesterday and
yesterday was a different creme pat.

852
00:41:41,264 --> 00:41:43,143
I'm just making the gypsy tart.

853
00:41:43,144 --> 00:41:46,223
It's actually just sugar
and evaporated milk.

854
00:41:46,224 --> 00:41:48,903
It's been a favourite of mine
when I was at school.

855
00:41:48,904 --> 00:41:50,303
That's why I'm making it.

856
00:41:50,304 --> 00:41:53,423
Linda's gypsy tart has a sweet
pastry base,

857
00:41:53,424 --> 00:41:56,183
topped with a coffee and
brandy-soaked sponge.

858
00:41:56,184 --> 00:41:59,943
It will nestle in a colourful
rosewater-flavoured pastry dome.

859
00:41:59,944 --> 00:42:02,383
Word on the street is you're doing
a gypsy tart.

860
00:42:02,384 --> 00:42:04,423
I'm doing a gypsy tart, yes. What?

861
00:42:04,424 --> 00:42:07,423
Cos when I was at primary
school, we used to have gypsy tart

862
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:08,983
and it was my favourite... Yeah.

863
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,943
..and I've never seen it since. Yeah.

864
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:12,503
And you're making it today? Yeah.

865
00:42:12,504 --> 00:42:14,983
I mean, very simple ingredients.
Come on.

866
00:42:14,984 --> 00:42:17,983
I don't care how simple it is.
Come on! Come on, yes.

867
00:42:17,984 --> 00:42:19,503
Come on! Good luck. Thank you.

868
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:21,383
After a tough time in the technical,

869
00:42:21,384 --> 00:42:24,063
Marc's also banking
on a much-loved bake.

870
00:42:24,064 --> 00:42:26,663
My favourite pudding in the whole
wide world

871
00:42:26,664 --> 00:42:28,503
is a blackberry and apple pie.

872
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:32,343
So, this is kind of like a posh
apple and blackberry pie.

873
00:42:32,344 --> 00:42:36,223
Marc's upmarket tart will have
a sable Breton base,

874
00:42:36,224 --> 00:42:38,583
blackberry jam, caramelised apples

875
00:42:38,584 --> 00:42:40,903
and a chocolate cremeux.

876
00:42:40,904 --> 00:42:44,583
His full puff pastry cage will be
decorated with shortcrust flowers

877
00:42:44,584 --> 00:42:45,863
and vine leaves.

878
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:48,663
If it turns out how I want it,
I'll be really pleased.

879
00:42:48,664 --> 00:42:49,983
I am sweating today.

880
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:53,103
There's just a lot to do. I feel...
I'm feeling behind already.

881
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:54,503
How long do we have left?

882
00:42:54,504 --> 00:42:56,423
Bakers... You have one hour left.

883
00:42:56,424 --> 00:42:59,983
I thought we were good in that.
Yeah, I think it worked very well.

884
00:42:59,984 --> 00:43:02,543
I'm gonna get my cage out now.

885
00:43:02,544 --> 00:43:04,064
It is very fragile.

886
00:43:07,584 --> 00:43:09,863
It's a nice golden-brown colour.

887
00:43:09,864 --> 00:43:11,823
All going well.

888
00:43:11,824 --> 00:43:13,703
Looks quite good.

889
00:43:13,704 --> 00:43:16,583
I was hoping they'd glue together
a bit more.

890
00:43:16,584 --> 00:43:18,263
Let these cool down,

891
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:20,623
cos they're too delicate
at the moment.

892
00:43:20,624 --> 00:43:22,943
I'm gonna shove it straight
in the freezer

893
00:43:22,944 --> 00:43:24,143
to try and cool it down.

894
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:25,623
As cages cool,

895
00:43:25,624 --> 00:43:28,503
the blind-baked tarts can be moved
on to the next stage.

896
00:43:28,504 --> 00:43:31,743
Put it in the oven for 15 minutes.
Then we'll have a lemon tart.

897
00:43:31,744 --> 00:43:35,623
While some fillings are baked,
others must be cooled to firm up.

898
00:43:35,624 --> 00:43:38,463
I'm putting the jam in and
then build up the cremeux from that

899
00:43:38,464 --> 00:43:39,743
and chill for 15 minutes.

900
00:43:39,744 --> 00:43:41,583
With tarts left to set,

901
00:43:41,584 --> 00:43:45,143
the bakers can crack on,
preparing finishing touches.

902
00:43:45,144 --> 00:43:47,983
At last, some pear action, hey?
I'm using conference pears.

903
00:43:47,984 --> 00:43:50,703
You need to stop making me say that
word in my accent.

904
00:43:50,704 --> 00:43:52,023
Pear.

905
00:43:52,024 --> 00:43:53,624
I'm gonna put my macaroons in.

906
00:43:54,824 --> 00:43:56,543
This is a little lacy template

907
00:43:56,544 --> 00:43:59,103
that I'm gonna slide onto the top
of the tart.

908
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:01,743
You know like you get a doily
and it's all da-de-da!

909
00:44:01,744 --> 00:44:05,103
This is my caramel and then
we're gonna add the apples.

910
00:44:05,104 --> 00:44:07,983
And that'll be one of my layers.
Let's just hope that works.

911
00:44:07,984 --> 00:44:11,023
Look at this little fruit selection.
A cute lunch for a rabbit.

912
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:12,943
# I'm preparing lunch for
a rabbit. #

913
00:44:12,944 --> 00:44:14,583
You look quite calm today.

914
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:17,703
# Star Baker is looming in
the distance. #

915
00:44:17,704 --> 00:44:19,424
And you're making lunch
for a rabbit.

916
00:44:23,344 --> 00:44:24,463
Come on, man.

917
00:44:24,464 --> 00:44:25,904
Hello, lattice head.

918
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,583
Are you ready for a time call?
Yeah.

919
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,503
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

920
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:35,383
What? Is that real? Half an hour?
It's gonna be tight.

921
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:37,743
Is this is the lockdown look?
That's right, kids.

922
00:44:37,744 --> 00:44:39,663
If you can't get out there
on the high street,

923
00:44:39,664 --> 00:44:41,024
then pastry is your answer.

924
00:44:41,984 --> 00:44:43,703
Yeah, it's done.

925
00:44:43,704 --> 00:44:45,223
Oh, look at that, though. Yeah.

926
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,823
It's a good set.

927
00:44:46,824 --> 00:44:48,503
Wonderful.

928
00:44:48,504 --> 00:44:49,663
Very happy.

929
00:44:49,664 --> 00:44:51,143
This is the cage.

930
00:44:51,144 --> 00:44:53,903
Oh, God. This is terrifying.

931
00:44:53,904 --> 00:44:55,343
The cage is pretty delicate,

932
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:57,023
so it's all about getting it off.

933
00:44:57,024 --> 00:45:00,103
This is what this entire bake
hinges on right now.

934
00:45:00,104 --> 00:45:01,903
It's a little scary.

935
00:45:01,904 --> 00:45:04,183
Oh, I'm panicking now. I'm rushing.

936
00:45:04,184 --> 00:45:05,464
If it works, I'm laughing.

937
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:09,623
This is the tricky bit,
cos I need to glue all the sides.

938
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,303
I would say they're brittle.

939
00:45:11,304 --> 00:45:12,904
Oh!

940
00:45:15,664 --> 00:45:17,584
Let's see if this comes off,
shall we?

941
00:45:18,704 --> 00:45:20,504
I've never felt so stressed.

942
00:45:21,704 --> 00:45:22,983
This is isomalt.

943
00:45:22,984 --> 00:45:25,584
It's like sugar,
but more predictable.

944
00:45:26,664 --> 00:45:28,983
Glue the hell out of that lot.

945
00:45:28,984 --> 00:45:32,463
I'm trying to stay nice and calm.
I don't know what to do.

946
00:45:32,464 --> 00:45:35,463
It's just breaking
as I'm trying to get it off.

947
00:45:35,464 --> 00:45:38,503
I don't think I'm going to get it
off in one piece.

948
00:45:38,504 --> 00:45:40,143
It will look messy.

949
00:45:40,144 --> 00:45:41,624
Is that stuck?

950
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,024
Damn it.

951
00:45:57,064 --> 00:45:59,383
Oh, I'm so pleased.

952
00:45:59,384 --> 00:46:03,143
Oh! Oh!

953
00:46:03,144 --> 00:46:05,423
Eurgh!

954
00:46:05,424 --> 00:46:06,784
It's still too hot.

955
00:46:09,024 --> 00:46:10,903
Bakers, you have 15 minutes.

956
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:13,183
This is now assembly, yeah.

957
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:14,263
Here we go.

958
00:46:14,264 --> 00:46:17,423
It's gonna be like a flower piece on
the top of the tart.

959
00:46:17,424 --> 00:46:19,503
That is the Italian meringue.

960
00:46:19,504 --> 00:46:22,023
The meringue's gonna go around
the outside of the tart.

961
00:46:22,024 --> 00:46:24,343
Then the fruits just sit
pretty in the middle.

962
00:46:24,344 --> 00:46:26,623
This is my blackberry curd on top.

963
00:46:26,624 --> 00:46:28,103
Tastes good. Perfect.

964
00:46:28,104 --> 00:46:30,463
It's just a case of laying
the apples on,

965
00:46:30,464 --> 00:46:33,063
arranging the blackberries
and then run.

966
00:46:33,064 --> 00:46:35,623
This is not the way I want to finish
this off,

967
00:46:35,624 --> 00:46:37,064
but it's gonna have to do.

968
00:46:38,584 --> 00:46:40,543
Not quite what it should be.

969
00:46:40,544 --> 00:46:42,823
It might be a bit sticky.

970
00:46:42,824 --> 00:46:44,183
I'm happy with the tart.

971
00:46:44,184 --> 00:46:45,623
Hopefully I can cage it.

972
00:46:45,624 --> 00:46:47,544
Just feel the tension in the room!

973
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:57,623
It's broken now.

974
00:46:57,624 --> 00:46:59,864
Bakers, you have one minute left.

975
00:47:08,024 --> 00:47:10,823
I don't know what to do.
It just all collapsed.

976
00:47:10,824 --> 00:47:13,744
I'll see if I can get it off.
I've got about five seconds.

977
00:47:17,024 --> 00:47:18,064
Eurgh!

978
00:47:20,144 --> 00:47:22,703
OK, bakers. Your time is up.

979
00:47:22,704 --> 00:47:26,063
I just wanted to get a little bit of
colour on it.

980
00:47:26,064 --> 00:47:27,823
It better taste good.

981
00:47:27,824 --> 00:47:29,703
I will take that.

982
00:47:29,704 --> 00:47:32,063
Oh, that was touch and go,
I'll be honest.

983
00:47:32,064 --> 00:47:35,023
I don't think I've been as proud of
anything in my entire life

984
00:47:35,024 --> 00:47:37,521
as I am of that.

985
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:45,000
It's judgment time for the
bakers' cage tart Showstoppers.

986
00:47:45,001 --> 00:47:47,281
Dave, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

987
00:47:54,841 --> 00:47:56,080
I think it looks great.

988
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,840
I do like the look you've managed
to achieve with the mango.

989
00:47:58,841 --> 00:47:59,960
I think it's wonderful.

990
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:03,000
All it has to do now is taste great.
Fingers crossed.

991
00:48:03,001 --> 00:48:04,161
It's nice and neat.

992
00:48:12,561 --> 00:48:15,480
The flavour is absolutely lovely.
Love the mango.

993
00:48:15,481 --> 00:48:17,360
The base is just about
the right thickness.

994
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:18,960
It marries up beautifully
with the mango.

995
00:48:18,961 --> 00:48:20,680
I think you've done a great job,

996
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:23,680
because you've given an impact
to the top of the tart, as well.

997
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:25,200
The overall look is so harmonious.

998
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:26,640
Very good job. Well done.

999
00:48:26,641 --> 00:48:28,441
Cheers, thank you. Really good.

1000
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:40,560
It looks highly effective.

1001
00:48:40,561 --> 00:48:41,960
The colour looks very, very good.

1002
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:43,600
I like the way the tart looks.

1003
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:44,801
Yeah. Looks great.

1004
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:54,121
Lovely and rich, the chocolate.

1005
00:48:55,361 --> 00:48:57,280
I do have a problem with the base.

1006
00:48:57,281 --> 00:48:59,640
It's a bit big for the chocolate.
Yeah.

1007
00:48:59,641 --> 00:49:01,240
But I think your decoration
is very beautiful.

1008
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:03,000
I'd liked to have seen
this chocolate

1009
00:49:03,001 --> 00:49:05,520
to the edge of
a very rich chocolate pastry

1010
00:49:05,521 --> 00:49:06,840
which was really thin.

1011
00:49:06,841 --> 00:49:08,360
That would've been spot-on. OK.

1012
00:49:08,361 --> 00:49:09,800
Cos that base looks awkward. Yeah.

1013
00:49:09,801 --> 00:49:11,080
So it doesn't belong... Yeah.

1014
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,361
..with that delicate chocolate
in the middle. OK, sure.

1015
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:21,400
I think it looks beautiful.

1016
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:23,040
I think it's a really clever design,

1017
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:25,401
and I think you've managed
to get it to work...

1018
00:49:27,641 --> 00:49:29,521
..until Paul Hollywood wrecked it.

1019
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:34,120
Thunder fingers.

1020
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:36,681
However, that shows that
the pastry will be delicious.

1021
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:43,240
The flavour's lovely.

1022
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:46,560
Mm. But you could have gone a little
bit thinner with that base. OK.

1023
00:49:46,561 --> 00:49:48,880
But I have to say,
the pastry is beautiful.

1024
00:49:48,881 --> 00:49:50,160
It is, really good.

1025
00:49:50,161 --> 00:49:53,320
However, this is a really
big, hefty,

1026
00:49:53,321 --> 00:49:54,680
Paul Hollywood...

1027
00:49:54,681 --> 00:49:59,400
..cage, with a delicate,
tiny, feminine middle.

1028
00:49:59,401 --> 00:50:01,120
It's a Prue Leith tart...

1029
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:04,640
And a Paul Hollywood cage.
..with a Paul Hollywood base.

1030
00:50:04,641 --> 00:50:07,721
Overall, though, I think all your
flavours are absolutely spot-on.

1031
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:21,560
I'm very impressed with your cage.

1032
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:23,160
Thank you. I think it looks lovely.

1033
00:50:23,161 --> 00:50:25,240
I think it's highly impressive.

1034
00:50:25,241 --> 00:50:27,201
The tart underneath looks
very, very nice.

1035
00:50:34,961 --> 00:50:36,000
Mm.

1036
00:50:36,001 --> 00:50:37,080
I love...

1037
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:38,480
..the Key lime flavour.

1038
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:41,120
The lime, you can feel it
at the back of your...

1039
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,640
Mm... cheeks. It's like, oof.

1040
00:50:42,641 --> 00:50:44,040
And I like that from lime.

1041
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:47,200
That's how a lime should taste.
You know, give you a nice kick.

1042
00:50:47,201 --> 00:50:48,640
I think your decoration's beautiful.

1043
00:50:48,641 --> 00:50:51,200
Overall, I think your taste's
amazing, looks good.

1044
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:52,280
Excellent.

1045
00:50:52,281 --> 00:50:54,000
I think you've excelled yourself.
Mm.

1046
00:50:54,001 --> 00:50:55,080
You really have.

1047
00:50:55,081 --> 00:50:57,681
Wow, thank you. That means
a lot to me. Thank you.

1048
00:51:05,401 --> 00:51:06,920
What happened to the cage?

1049
00:51:06,921 --> 00:51:10,320
It usually lifts up, but today
it stayed on the bowl.

1050
00:51:10,321 --> 00:51:14,200
Yeah, I love the gypsy colours.
That's right, yeah. Are great.

1051
00:51:14,201 --> 00:51:15,641
OK, let's taste it.

1052
00:51:22,361 --> 00:51:23,400
Mm.

1053
00:51:23,401 --> 00:51:24,521
I love the flavour.

1054
00:51:25,761 --> 00:51:28,120
It's a bit thick,
that gypsy tart, actually.

1055
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:29,840
It could have been
a little bit thinner.

1056
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:32,200
Um... I quite like the flavour,
it's very traditional.

1057
00:51:32,201 --> 00:51:34,640
It's quite frustrating that
you don't see the full impact.

1058
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:37,241
The way it looks doesn't look good.

1059
00:51:47,801 --> 00:51:48,960
Well, I have to say,

1060
00:51:48,961 --> 00:51:50,880
your cage is sensational.

1061
00:51:50,881 --> 00:51:52,360
Really beautiful.

1062
00:51:52,361 --> 00:51:54,240
The artistry in there
is exceptional.

1063
00:51:54,241 --> 00:51:56,240
The tart itself...

1064
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:58,521
..I question whether it would be
a tart without sides.

1065
00:52:02,361 --> 00:52:03,920
Very squidgy.

1066
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:04,921
Very.

1067
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:08,761
Mm.

1068
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:12,640
That tastes absolutely beautiful.

1069
00:52:12,641 --> 00:52:14,281
But it does look a right mess.

1070
00:52:15,681 --> 00:52:18,080
All the independent flavours
are very, very good.

1071
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:19,360
All the textures are good.

1072
00:52:19,361 --> 00:52:20,840
What you've made is very good,

1073
00:52:20,841 --> 00:52:23,361
but "Is it the brief?"
is my question.

1074
00:52:33,121 --> 00:52:35,960
I like the rather random way
you've done the cage.

1075
00:52:35,961 --> 00:52:37,880
I think it's really beautiful.

1076
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:40,640
It's quite solid, it almost looks
like it's made of bread.

1077
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:43,201
I'm just happy it's held up.

1078
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:54,040
Lovely and tart.

1079
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:55,960
Mm. Mm.

1080
00:52:55,961 --> 00:52:58,800
That's delicious. Puts a smile on
your face, doesn't it? Very nice.

1081
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:01,520
I think partly because the back
of your cheeks are going...

1082
00:53:01,521 --> 00:53:03,880
..and so it sort of forces a smile.

1083
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:06,161
It's called a happy tart, that one.
That's lovely.

1084
00:53:17,601 --> 00:53:19,400
So, the cage didn't work.

1085
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:21,080
It's not a good one.

1086
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:23,960
Not compared with what
you were achieving recently.

1087
00:53:23,961 --> 00:53:25,160
That's not... Yeah.

1088
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:26,760
..Mark. Mm.

1089
00:53:26,761 --> 00:53:29,120
Your piping's all irregular,
as well.

1090
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:30,641
The poached pears
don't look appetising.

1091
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:38,000
It's delicious. It's unusual,

1092
00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:39,240
but I really like it.

1093
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:40,960
The pastry's far too thick.

1094
00:53:40,961 --> 00:53:43,320
I think you missed something
on this one. Mm.

1095
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:46,560
At a core level, not just at the
fact that you never got a chance

1096
00:53:46,561 --> 00:53:48,240
to finish it with a cage.

1097
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:49,480
Didn't go well, did it?

1098
00:53:49,481 --> 00:53:51,800
I'm obviously in a very
precarious position now.

1099
00:53:51,801 --> 00:53:53,000
Pastry Week!

1100
00:53:53,001 --> 00:53:54,680
It was supposed to be my week.

1101
00:53:54,681 --> 00:53:56,600
Hey-ho. Fair comments.

1102
00:53:56,601 --> 00:53:59,360
I think that's probably the nicest
bit of feedback that I've got,

1103
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,240
that line of it being a happy tart.

1104
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:04,600
Paul said my pastry was amazing.

1105
00:54:04,601 --> 00:54:05,760
"Amazing."

1106
00:54:05,761 --> 00:54:07,360
I mean, what more...

1107
00:54:07,361 --> 00:54:11,000
That's definitely the best
feedback that I've had yet.

1108
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:12,280
I got a bit choked, actually.

1109
00:54:12,281 --> 00:54:13,681
I've... I'm absolutely made up.

1110
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:21,481
I thought they did quite well
after the eclairs.

1111
00:54:21,482 --> 00:54:23,321
The cages were astonishing,

1112
00:54:23,322 --> 00:54:24,521
except for Mark L.

1113
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:26,161
And Linda's. And Linda's.

1114
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:29,281
I think,
in spite of her exploding cage,

1115
00:54:29,282 --> 00:54:31,801
Hermine must be in line
for Star Baker.

1116
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:34,961
I thought the flavours of her lemon
tarte au citron was fantastic.

1117
00:54:34,962 --> 00:54:36,721
You did quite like Dave's.

1118
00:54:36,722 --> 00:54:39,041
I thought his cage was incredible.

1119
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,401
What about Peter?
Cos you liked his, as well.

1120
00:54:41,402 --> 00:54:43,721
I did like his.
And he came first in Technical.

1121
00:54:43,722 --> 00:54:45,641
Is he not in line for Star Baker?

1122
00:54:45,642 --> 00:54:48,121
He struggled in his Signature
quite badly. Right.

1123
00:54:48,122 --> 00:54:50,681
But I think Laura's Showstopper
was amazing.

1124
00:54:50,682 --> 00:54:52,361
Laura's had a good week, hasn't she?

1125
00:54:52,362 --> 00:54:55,481
She's really come up.
So, who is in danger of going home?

1126
00:54:55,482 --> 00:54:57,441
Mark L. His cage fell apart.

1127
00:54:57,442 --> 00:55:00,601
He could be in a little bit
of trouble. And Marc E.

1128
00:55:00,602 --> 00:55:03,561
He struggled in the Technical
and he struggled in the Signature.

1129
00:55:03,562 --> 00:55:05,001
I think Linda's in trouble.

1130
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:07,321
She struggled across
the first two challenges.

1131
00:55:07,322 --> 00:55:08,881
She didn't finish her cage.

1132
00:55:08,882 --> 00:55:10,561
Close, then. It is.

1133
00:55:10,562 --> 00:55:11,802
It's painfully close.

1134
00:55:24,002 --> 00:55:26,361
Well done, bakers.
You must be exhausted.

1135
00:55:26,362 --> 00:55:29,481
I'm sure you want to know
who Star Baker is,

1136
00:55:29,482 --> 00:55:30,801
so I'll tell you.

1137
00:55:30,802 --> 00:55:33,442
Star Baker this week is...

1138
00:55:38,962 --> 00:55:40,241
..Laura.

1139
00:55:40,242 --> 00:55:41,842
Well done!

1140
00:55:43,322 --> 00:55:46,121
Congratulations, Laura. Bloody hell.

1141
00:55:46,122 --> 00:55:48,601
That leaves me with the rotten job

1142
00:55:48,602 --> 00:55:52,001
of announcing the person
that is leaving us this week.

1143
00:55:52,002 --> 00:55:54,681
It does get harder every week,
cos there's less of you

1144
00:55:54,682 --> 00:55:56,322
and we get to know you more.

1145
00:55:57,602 --> 00:56:01,282
The person who's leaving us
this week is...

1146
00:56:07,082 --> 00:56:09,361
..Linda. I'm sorry.

1147
00:56:09,362 --> 00:56:11,002
No, that's good.

1148
00:56:14,722 --> 00:56:16,161
I can't really be sad.

1149
00:56:16,162 --> 00:56:19,561
I've been like a child
at Disneyland, really.

1150
00:56:19,562 --> 00:56:21,881
Well done, you. I'm so sorry.

1151
00:56:21,882 --> 00:56:25,841
It's been amazing.
One of the highlights of my life.

1152
00:56:25,842 --> 00:56:28,881
How dare they! Thank you so much.
You've been brilliant.

1153
00:56:28,882 --> 00:56:30,801
She is a very good baker,

1154
00:56:30,802 --> 00:56:32,681
but she had a terrible week.

1155
00:56:32,682 --> 00:56:35,281
I know I can bake.
I just haven't done enough.

1156
00:56:35,282 --> 00:56:37,561
I am so proud of myself, yeah.

1157
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:38,482
I am.

1158
00:56:38,483 --> 00:56:41,441
Well done, Laura. Oh, thank you.
You did well there. Thank you.

1159
00:56:41,442 --> 00:56:42,921
I'm still a bit in shock.

1160
00:56:42,922 --> 00:56:45,841
I think I'm a bit, like,
did that actually just happen?

1161
00:56:45,842 --> 00:56:47,321
When it came to the Showstopper,

1162
00:56:47,322 --> 00:56:49,081
I thought Laura
smashed it out the park.

1163
00:56:49,082 --> 00:56:50,881
A well-deserved Star Baker.

1164
00:56:50,882 --> 00:56:53,201
I'm just gonna try and get through

1165
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:55,561
for as long as I can.
Hashtag winging it.

1166
00:56:55,562 --> 00:56:57,601
I'm looking forward to next week.
Japanese Week.

1167
00:56:57,602 --> 00:56:59,921
Yeah, one more.
Let's do one more week.

1168
00:56:59,922 --> 00:57:01,481
It's getting tougher and tougher now

1169
00:57:01,482 --> 00:57:04,401
and I cannot mess up
like that again.

1170
00:57:04,402 --> 00:57:06,042
Yeah, I'm gonna be better
next week.

1171
00:57:07,082 --> 00:57:09,641
Next time...
The adrenaline has kicked in.

1172
00:57:09,642 --> 00:57:12,001
..it's a Bake Off first,
with Japanese Week.

1173
00:57:12,002 --> 00:57:14,881
I just like it being a bit
different. Yeah. Cakes are boring.

1174
00:57:14,882 --> 00:57:18,641
Who will run out of steam
in the Signature? Whoa. Good God.

1175
00:57:18,642 --> 00:57:22,041
The bakers are spread thin and
turned over in a tense technical...

1176
00:57:22,042 --> 00:57:24,401
Flip, go on! Yes!

1177
00:57:24,402 --> 00:57:25,721
The winner right here.

1178
00:57:25,722 --> 00:57:28,081
..and a spectacularly sweet
Showstopper...

1179
00:57:28,082 --> 00:57:31,201
Cute ..that will leave one
of the bakers with a sour taste.

1180
00:57:31,202 --> 00:57:32,761
It's tearing a bit, isn't it?

1181
00:57:32,762 --> 00:57:35,321
Oh, God. BLEEP mess.
I don't know why you're so upset.

1182
00:57:35,322 --> 00:57:36,882
I think that looks pretty neat.

1183
00:57:58,362 --> 00:58:01,362
