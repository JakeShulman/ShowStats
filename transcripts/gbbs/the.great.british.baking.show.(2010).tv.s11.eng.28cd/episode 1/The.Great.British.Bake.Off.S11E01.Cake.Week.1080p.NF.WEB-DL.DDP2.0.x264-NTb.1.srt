Ah, yes, well, that works.

Good evening.
Erm, let’s get straight to it.

We are now approaching phase 46.

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,640
Erm, which means that, er,
from Tuesday morning

11

We are saying with regards to baking,

12

erm, if... If you must bake
in a tent, bake in a tent.

But please don’t bake in a tent.

[Sura] My husband said to me,
"Why don't you apply?"

28

I was like, "I'm not gonna get in.
I'm not gonna get in".

29
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:49,360
I didn't give it a lot of thought,
I'll be honest with you. [chuckles]

[Rowan] Something about the year 2020
felt as if it was kind of momentous,

[Laura] Harder than I thought
leaving home,

43
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,840
so, the night before,
my husband cooked us fajitas,

44
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,079
or "fajeetas"
as he calls them, it just hit me,

00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,359
"I could not see you for seven weeks",
and then I was crying into my dinner.

The judges would like you to make
that fan favourite, the Battenberg,

rectangular in shape
and wrapped in marzipan.

85
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,440
It can be any sponge you want,
any flavour, but when you cut inside it,

86
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,520
it needs to reveal a pattern or a design.

What I'm looking for is a beautiful,
smooth marzipan.

110
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,039
Inside, stark differences
in colour of sponge.

111
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,159
I would keep it basic if I was them,
but make sure I'm punching with flavours

112
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,599
and punching with colours.

113
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,280
It's a real treat.
It's very rich 'cause of the marzipan.

114
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,880
And it should be wonderful.
I'm looking forward to it.

00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,160
What's life without taking
a little bit of risk, so...

296
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,800
[Lottie] They look overcooked,
but feel relatively soft,

297
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,599
so I can work with that.

a dark green marzipan.

304
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,360
I'm doing
a Turkish bazaar-inspired Battenberg.

315
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,079
- No. Really? Playing it cool?
- Yeah...

- Yeah... [laughs]
- [Noel chuckles]

- Can't play it cool once you're married.

318

- It's a done deal.
- You can't... No, no...

319
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,000

It's quite a busy day for you, to be fair.

320
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,199
- First day, and your anniversary.
- Exactly.

321

- This sounds genius.
- [Prue] So... No...

How are you going to represent
a temple inside a Battenberg?

[Mak] If you get the measurements wrong,
when you put them together,

401
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,280
they might be oddly out of shape
and the Battenberg wouldn't sit right.

Try and cook the centre that way.
Is this just gonna be a disaster?

424
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,000
You've got to roll out the meringue,

425
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,200
That goes to show how much I like that.

00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,600
[Matt] <i>As Rowan's plans</i>
<i>get less ambitious...</i>

443
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,159
[Lottie] Okay, what am I doing?

444
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,000
[Matt] <i>...despite being behind,</i>
<i>Lottie's rhubarb and custard Battenberg</i>

445
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,520
<i>seems to be getting
more and more complicated.</i>

446
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,159
[Lottie] Everything
that is so easy at home

447
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,120
suddenly becomes an absolute nightmare
when you're in the tent.

448
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,280
[Rowan] How many minutes? Seven. Seven.

449
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,440
Gosh.

450
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,320
Right, here goes nothing.

451
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,399
[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue are expecting</i>
<i>a flawless wrapping of marzipan.</i>

452
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,080
[Peter] The marzipan
is gonna join at the bottom

453
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,000
so the seam of the marzipan
shouldn't be visible.

454
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,639
Maybe just a... A more blocky shape.

455
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,440
[inhales sharply] Ooh. I'm really sticky.

456
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,520
[Loriea] It's cracking in some areas.

457
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
[Sura] How long?

458
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,600
[Rowan] What are we, three minutes now?
Come on, come on.

459
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:47,919
Can't complain.

460
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,800
Hey, Lottie, is this a critical moment?

461
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,439
- Yeah, it is. Thanks for coming round.
- [chuckling]

462
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,280
[Lottie] Why did I put an intricate design

463
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,880
- with minutes to spare?
- [Noel] Yeah.

464
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,200
- "Yeah"?
- Looks good, though.

465
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,000
You're gonna wrap this
around that when that's done?

466
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,240
You're nailing this.

467
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,159
One minute remaining.

468
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,440
Maybe take the cling film off.

469
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,240
Bit of stardust on there.

470
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,760
Bakers, your time is up!

471
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,919
[Rowan] I'm not displeased
with that, actually.

472
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,439
[Lottie] We don't have to wash up.

473
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,879
- Oh, yes!
- Yes!

474
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,520
[Noel] <i>The bakers will now face</i>
<i>Prue and Paul for the very first time.</i>

475
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:49,399
[Paul] I like the overall look of it,
it's neat.

476
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,919
[Prue] I love the polka dots.

477
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,399
Love the texture of the chocolate one.

478
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,200
It's both crumbly and moist
which is quite difficult to get.

479
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,320
Nice thin marzipan.

480
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:05,000
The chocolate's got
a lovely flavour to it. Decadent.

481
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,560
It's the same with the orange.

482
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:09,560
Gluten-free flour
for sponges really does work.

483
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,040
- It's great.
- [Prue] Delicious.

484
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,480
- Well done.
- Thank you.

485
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,560
Well done.

486
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:16,200
[all laughing]

487
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:20,320
[Prue] It's very neat, isn't it?

488
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,240
Good orange flavour.

489
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,280
I just question the ginger with the orange
and then on the outside, the pistachio.

490
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,520
It's too complicated.

491
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,679
The almond marzipan
would have been better than the pistachio.

492
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:37,360
- [Prue] That looks striking.
- [Paul] The decoration's neat.

493
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:40,000
The marmalade brings bitterness
to the marzipan.

494
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,120
It blends the orange
and the chocolate together,

495
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,399
- so it's never gonna be too sweet.
- It really is a pleasure to eat it.

496
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,919
- Aw, that means a lot. Thank you.
- [Paul] Good job.

497
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,879
The one thing you expect
from a Battenberg is incredible neatness.

498
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,720
You've got no distinction
in the colours of the sponge.

499
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,399
But your flowers look sweet.

500
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,760
I'm getting a plain sponge
and the raspberry.

501
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,639
- Okay.
- And that's pretty much it.

502
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:11,480
[Prue] Really nice square edges.

503
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,120
The coffee overpowers the chocolate.

504
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,159
- It's delicious.
- [Paul] You can't really get the booze.

505
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,840
It's a beautiful coffee
and vanilla Battenberg.

506
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,240
I think you explained it wrong.

507
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,399
It's lacking identity.

508
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,840
- [chuckles] Yeah.
- [Paul] He's just unfinished.

509
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:33,520
- [Linda] Yes.
- [Paul] Oh, we have the St George flag.

510
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,200
- It's over-baked. It's bone dry.
- Yeah.

511
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,840
[Prue] I wish we could give you marks

512
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,879
- for your handsome cousin.
- [Linda] He's lovely.

513
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,120
- [Prue] Very striking.
- [Paul] I can smell the bubble gum.

514
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,480
- [Matt] About to say...
- So can I. [chuckles]

515
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,840
That's a good thing.

516
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,879
I'm rolling it round
to try and blow a bubble.

517
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,560
I reckon if I did it long enough,
I probably could. That's bone dry.

518
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,080
The flavours are intense.
I love bubble gum, I like cream soda,

519
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:05,960
it just needed to be
a little bit less heavy.

520
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,960
And it's really thick, the marzipan.

521
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,040
I do rather like it, I have to say.

522
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,919
When I have my ninth birthday party,
can you cook for me?

523
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,080
I will try not to over bake the sponges.
So, we've got a deal. [laughs]

524
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:22,280
[Prue] It's a nice light sponge.

525
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,800
It's a little thick,
but I like the marzipan.

526
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:27,040
Pomegranates don't do anything
flavour-wise.

527
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,040
There's pistachio in the green sponge,

528
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,639
- that brings a lovely texture to it.
- Thank you.

529
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,639
[Paul] If Fanny Cradock
was gonna do a Battenberg...

530
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,520
- [both] That would be it.
- Is that a compliment?

531
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,520
- [Marc] I know...
- [Prue] I think it's a bit too busy.

532
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:46,439
- Good strong sour cherry. Lovely.
- [Paul] Fantastic.

533
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,480
- There's too much rose water.
- Okay.

534
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,576
- Shall I open it for you?
- [Paul] Please.

535
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,760
[Prue] I like it wrapped up.
Oh, I love your stripes.

536
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,439
- [Paul] The starburst.
- Yeah.

537
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,480
It's a little bit messy.
Was it warm when you were doing it?

538
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,800
Yeah.

539
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:06,439
The colours are really wonderful.

540
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
I like the cake.

541
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,399
They both taste the same,
is that meant to...

542
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,679
- Er, yes?
- [Prue and Lottie laughing]

543
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,560
The yellow is supposed be a custard.

544
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:19,000
[Prue] They both taste delicious,
and the same.

545
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,120
The rhubarb jam
that you've made is nice and strong.

546
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:24,760
And there's enough acidity in it
to cut the sweetness.

547
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,960
It's a good effort.

548
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,159
- I'm struggling not to eat more.
- [Matt] Mmm.

549
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,879
- Do you want to finish?
- I'll stay here

550
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,040
- and eat.
- Please do.

551
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,280
They'll judge everyone else.

552
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,560
I had to change the design
at the very last minute.

553
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:44,320
- So no temple, then?
- It's a deconstructed temple.

554
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:47,000
[Paul] I think the night sky
looks quite effective.

555
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,199
[Prue] Yes. And actually, it's quite neat.

556
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,919
I can tell by the way
the knife goes through

557
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,800
that that's quite a heavy sponge.

558
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:56,000
- It's a bit hard work for cake.
- [Rowan] Okay.

559
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,000
[chuckles]

560
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,520
There's moisture in there
that still needs to get out.

561
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Okay.

562
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,560
- That looks really pretty.
- Thank you.

563
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:11,560
[Paul] I like the decoration.
I like that you've glazed it, too,

564
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:13,000
'cause that, again, sets it off.

565
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,360
[Prue] The flavours are there.

566
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:18,760
The texture is very good. It's very neat.

567
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,120
I like the marzipan.
Individual elements are good,

568
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:23,560
- including the buttercream.
- It's a lovely piece of cake.

569
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:24,800
Thank you so much.

570
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:26,840
What's the stalk made from?

571
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:29,056
- [Sura] You're not meant to eat it.
- I know that now.

572
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,560
[all laughing]

573
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:33,280
It's a clove.
So your mouth's gonna be numb now.

574
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,480
It tastes of Christmas.

575
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,560
- Yeah, yeah.
- Sorry.

576
00:27:36,639 --> 00:27:38,439
It's fine 'cause the cake was delicious.

577
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,920
- I don't mind.
- Thank you so much.

578
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,240
- Thank you.
- [Paul] Thank you.

579
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:46,600
Half of the Battenberg is on the...
the bottom of the oven.

580
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,280
Not great.
Erm, it's like toast. It's horrible.

581
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,520
But it turned out okay.

582
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,280
Yay!

583
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,280
That couldn't have gone much better.
I'm really pretty amped about that, yeah.

584
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,520
[exhales]

585
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,840
Breathe.

586
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,159
I was aiming for the middle
of the road and got it.

587
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,520
Don't want to make a name
for myself first... first bake.

588
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,000
It wasn't a resounding success.
But I thought it was useful.

589
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:17,560
[Noel] <i>Each week,</i>

which comes courtesy of Paul Hollywood.

593
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,399
Paul, any words of wisdom?

594
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,760
This is a classic.

595
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,480
We're testing you on your timings
and your consistency.

596
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,199
So read your recipes carefully.

597
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,480
[Noel] Very helpful.

598
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,280
Basically, read your recipes.

599
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,480
This challenge will be judged blind

600
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,360
so we're gonna have to ask
these two lovelies to beat it.

601
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:44,439
Off you pop.

602
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:51,399
Paul Hollywood would like you to make
six miniature pineapple upside-down cakes.

603
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,760
Each should be topped
with a fresh pineapple ring

604
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,879
and soaked in caramel syrup.

605
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:58,040
[Noel] You have 90 minutes.

606
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,879
- On your marks...
- Get set...

607
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:00,959
Bake!

608
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,520
[Laura] I love pineapple upside-down cake.

609
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,639
My dad and my husband love it.
So, I've made it a few times.

610
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,840
[Peter] I've made
pineapple upside-down cake in school.

611
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,560
[Matt] <i>In each technical challenge,</i>
<i>the bakers are given identical ingredients</i>

612
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:16,840
<i>and the same pared-down recipe.</i>

613
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,600
I've actually never made this before.
Funny enough.

614
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,919
Never even tried one.

615
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,360
I've heard of it.
I've not eaten one, I don't think.

616
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,040
This is a classic bake.
Pineapple upside-down cake is something

617
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,760
I used to have at school dinners.

618
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,040
[Prue] It does look lovely.
Shall we taste it?

619
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,159
It's light, buttery, but also,
you have the perfect caramel.

620
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,679
If it goes too dark, it's too bitter.
But if you can't see the caramel,

621
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,840
you're not gonna be able
to get that caramel flavour.

622
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,520
The worst thing is ripping the sponge
when they're trying to get it out.

623
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,320
Getting it out of the tin
is where most people come unstuck

624
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,280
because the caramel
sticks to the edge and it's difficult.

625
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,480
[Paul] Gonna be interesting.

626
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,800
I don't want to eat this
'cause I've got 12 to come.

627
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:59,600
- I can't resist it.
- Ah, ditto.

628
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,480
[Sura] The first step is for the syrup.

629
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,840
"Tip 30g of caster sugar into a pan."

630
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,240
[Peter] "Two tablespoons water."

631
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,360
"Place over low heat,
stir until sugar dissolves."

632
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,399
"Increase the heat
and cook to a golden caramel."

633
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,840
The caramel can crystallise very quickly.

634
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,560
I'm trying not to stir it,
but I need it to hurry up

635
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:18,159
because I don't have all day.

636
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,280
I've not made many caramels, so...

637
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Slightly nervous.

638
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:23,439
So, how's it going?

639
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,040
[Loriea] It's a case of multi-tasking
and keeping my eyes on the syrup.

640
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,399
- [Noel] You pull this off, maybe...
- I might just make it to next week.

641
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,080
...the dry blue cake
might become a distant memory.

642
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:35,520
No, I think that'll be
haunting me for a while.

643
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,760
[Linda] "Remove from heat
and pour in boiling water,

644
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,240
stand back
as the caramel will spit a bit."

645
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,120
And then, I'll reduce it and simmer
until it is in syrup consistency.

646
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:48,000
You need to hurry up.

647
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:50,679
[Loriea] I'm fairly happy.

648
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,399
It's looking a bit blond
so I need to take the syrup

649
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,679
that little bit further.

650
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,840
That's getting close.
I'll turn it down a bit.

651
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:58,840
Looks like it could burn on me.

652
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,919
Might be a bit too dark, not sure.

653
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,199
It did smell
like it was about to burn. But, erm...

654
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:06,399
Happy with it.

655
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:11,800
Now I'm on to the very instructional stage
of making the sponge.

656
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,840
So that's butter and sugar.
You beat it until it's light.

657
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:17,399
Next...

658
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:19,760
Add a little bit of flour as you go,

659
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,679
because it can just curdle a little bit.

660
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,320
I'm gonna try and not have a dry sponge.

661
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,399
Prepare the moulds. Prepare the moulds.

662
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,879
I've lined them with butter
to make sure they'll get out.

663
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:33,520
"Divide the syrup
and place a pineapple ring

664
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,480
and a maraschino cherry into each mould."

665
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,080
So syrup in first.

666
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,439
And then the pineapple.

667
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,679
I'm not quite sure what quantity
I'm supposed to put in, though.

668
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,480
[Noel] <i>The level of syrup</i>
<i>has to be precise.</i>

669
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,399
[Dave] I don't know
if that can go on there.

670
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,480
That can't go on there.

671
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,000
[Noel] <i>Too little, and the cake won't have</i>
<i>a decadent caramel flavour</i>

672
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,439
<i>that Paul has demanded.</i>

673
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,959
[Rowan] Try and get more even.

674
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,879
[Noel] <i>But too much, and the liquid</i>
<i>will prevent the sponge from rising.</i>

675
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:04,800
[Linda] Oh! Possibly too much caramel.

676
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,439
Haven't read things very well, have I?

677
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,040
[Marc] Gone over a little bit.

678
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,399
Yikes. [chuckles]

679
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,280
[Rowan] I'll need to weigh to make sure
I've got equal amounts of batter.

680
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,960
[Lottie] Can't be doing with the fiddly.

681
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,600
- You'd rather make one big massive one?
- Like a traybake

682
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:20,800
- to feed...
- A huge one we could all sit around?

683
00:32:20,879 --> 00:32:23,080
- Yeah, like a table.
- And just tear chunks off.

684
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:25,320
- Exactly.
- Like wild...

685
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:26,840
- Animals. Yeah.
- ...animals.

686
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:30,240
[Peter] I'm using a piping bag
'cause it's just faster and cleaner.

687
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:34,120
- Get ready to go into the oven.
- So, in it goes.

688
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:37,600
- [Noel] <i>Forty-five minutes remaining.</i>
- How long do they go into the oven for?

689
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,159
You just watch it.
This is what I'm guessing. I don't know.

690
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,959
No. Well, don't look at me.
I ain't got a clue.

691
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,120
- Okay.
- Okay.

692
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:48,639
I'm gonna start with ten,
give 'em a wee check.

693
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,240
About 15 minutes.

694
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,320
I made the rookie error.
Didn't butter the moulds.

695
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,639
More than likely gonna stick.

696
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,439
[Noel] Bakers, you've got 15 minutes left.

697
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:04,639
They smell cooked.

698
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:08,399
[Linda] I think they're cooked
but they're not up where they should be.

699
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,760
Yep, as far as I can tell, that's good.

700
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,679
They sound about right.

701
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,919
[Noel] They look good. Look at those!

702
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,120
- You got skills.
- I hope so.

703
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:18,439
I wasn't sure earlier.

704
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,840
- [Sura laughs]
- I'm joking.

705
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,199
What should I do with that?

706
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,879
- I'm gonna take...
- Take it away?

707
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,480
- You can't, it's hot.
- Maybe just throw it behind you.

708
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,080
Throw it, someone will deal with it.

709
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:28,760
- You don't have to deal with that.
- No.

710
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,120
You're a baking superstar.

711
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,040
[Linda] Well, they've just sunk.
So they've not worked.

712
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:39,919
Oh, gosh. They're like toffee. There's
too much syrup. That's what it was.

713
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,280
[Lottie] Shall I do that thing
that people do on <i>Bake Off?</i>

714
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,840
Just do this for a little while.

715
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:47,280
Does this work? You think this works?

716
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,280
Everybody wafts.

717
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:51,000
Bit of waftage.

718
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,800
[blowing] How long left?

719
00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:53,719
Bakers.

720
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,439
- [Noel] You... Five... Left!
- [Matt] Have... Minutes...

721
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,760
[Marc] Still quite warm.

722
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Oh, dear.

723
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,159
I think I should turn them out.

724
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,760
[Laura] Moment of truth.

725
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,040
That's one that's good,
but the pineapple didn't come out,

726
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,279
- so we're on a rescue mission.
- Er, ooh, er. [laughs]

727
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,759
[Sura] Spot on.

728
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,279
[laughing] They're not gonna come out,
I don't think.

729
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,279
[Rowan] Better than it might have been.
Put it that way.

730
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,360
[Marc] It would've been nice
to have nice, clean sides,

731
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,319
but I didn't grease my moulds.

732
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,520
They would've been even
if I managed to carve it out nicer.

733
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,839
[Linda] I could just shape that like that.
Oh, they are a disaster, aren't they?

734
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,480
Bakers, you do be have one minute now.

735
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,960
[Laura] Gonna pipe the rosettes on,
and I'll be good.

736
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,400
Put some cream, a cherry on top.

737
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,600
I don't think they'll be cool enough.

738
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:11,880
- [Mark] It's too hot.
- [Loriea] Ooh, that one was not ready.

739
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,279
The cream's starting to fall off.

740
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,319
Bakers, your time is up.

741
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,720
[Loriea] Oh, my cream fell off.

742
00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:26,680
Please place
your pineapple upside-down cakes

743
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:29,880
on the gingham cloth
in front of your pictures.

744
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,960
- [laughs]
- [Loriea] What a hideous cake.

745
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,920
[sighs] Oh, I think I deserve a cherry.

746
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,120
- Look at this.
- [Mark] Oh, no.

747
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,839
[Sura] Oh! Go away. Ugh!

748
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,839
- Ooh. [gasps]
- [Rowan] No!

749
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,240
I'm so sorry.

750
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,279
Oh, my God.

751
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,480
I'm so sorry. There was a fly.
I went to shoo it away,

752
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,160
- and knocked... Look.
- Don't worry about it. It's fine.

753
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,600
I'm... I'm sure they can go by

754
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,759
what they looked like
before I brought them over.

755
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:10,759
- [Sura] Let's tidy it up.
- [Matt] The good news

756
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:15,600
is the front two are absolutely fine.
And we'll tell Paul what happened.

757
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
[whispers] Oh, don't cry. It's all right.

758
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,799
- It's okay.
- [Sura] Such a horrible thing...

759
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,799
Yeah, I know.
You know what? He's okay.

760
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,960
[Mark] Total accident.

761
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,560
It happens. Accidents happen.

762
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,520
- I blame Matt, really.
- [Matt] It was actually my fault,

763
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,080
because I was looking at you
at the time it happened.

764
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,759
And you were probably
hypnotised by my beauty.

765
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,480
[laughing]

766
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,200
- [Matt] That's what happened.
- Maybe.

767
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,160
[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue are expecting</i>
<i>six identical pineapple upside-down cakes</i>

768
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,040
<i>topped with caramel, cream
and crowned with a cherry.</i>

769
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,600
<i>And they'll have no idea whose is whose.</i>

770
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,160
[Sura sighs]

771
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:54,040
Shall we start over here?

772
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,319
- It's got a nice height to it.
- [Prue] It's about the right colour.

773
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,359
The cream went on
when they were still hot.

774
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,960
[Paul] Let's have a look.

775
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,799
- Nice and light, it's well-balanced.
- Very light.

776
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,080
[Paul] Again, it's the heat.

777
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,120
You can see where the cream melted
and it slid off the top.

778
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,839
Good flavour, that cake.
It just doesn't look great.

779
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,200
[Paul] These do look neat.
Colour looks good.

780
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,960
And it's pretty uniform as well,
across all six.

781
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,040
The balance between the sponge,
the cream...

782
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,640
- It's good.
- ...and syrup together,

783
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,216
- the balance is good.
- [Prue] Lovely.

784
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,319
[Paul] Moving on to number four.
Again, problems with the heat.

785
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,359
Coming out the tins,
just needs to be higher,

786
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,000
- just a little bit more open.
- [Prue] It's a bit doughy.

787
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,640
[Paul] These look quite neat.
Cherry sits well on the top.

788
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,080
- [Prue] Nice colour.
- [Paul] They're pretty uniform.

789
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,520
- [Prue] Lovely cake.
- [Paul] It is a nice cake.

790
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,680
Moving on.
Now, looks quite dark in places.

791
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,319
That caramel is a bit dominant
because it's a little darker.

792
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,839
This, on the other hand,
is a bit too pale.

793
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,240
[Paul] It's pale. They were rushing,
brought it out early.

794
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:59,080
Put the cream when it was piping hot,
and it just poured off side.

795
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,400
- Yeah. It does not look a pretty thing.
- [chuckling] It doesn't.

796
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,480
[Prue] If you get it a little browner,
it takes away from some of the sweetness

797
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,319
because the caramel has that
just tiny little bit of bitterness.

798
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,759
- Anyway...
- We're going from pale to very dark.

799
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:16,839
This one got stuck in the tin.

800
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,000
- But also, that's too dark.
- [Prue] Yeah.

801
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,560
It's a bit too dark.

802
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:25,279
- It's quite bitter.
- Mmm. And there's a lot of caramel.

803
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,240
[Paul] It's burnt.

804
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:28,560
We move on to one
that's just in the middle.

805
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,560
[Prue] And looks really nice.
I mean, the piping's good,

806
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,600
caramel colour is good.
They're even, they're all risen.

807
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,359
[Paul] The caramel's just the right level,
so it brings in the colour, the flavour.

808
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,960
- No problem with that at all.
- Mmm.

809
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,839
Moving on to this one. Piping's good.

810
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,759
[Prue] Excellent.

811
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,200
[Paul] It's been put on
when it's relatively cool.

812
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:49,720
It's well-balanced. You have caramel...

813
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,279
- It's lovely.
- Almost toffee-like.

814
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,520
And it balances beautifully
with the sponge.

815
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,920
Now, we move
from the sublime to number 11.

816
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,440
Issues bringing it out,
issues with the sponge.

817
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,080
[Prue] Didn't rise enough.

818
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,280
- [Paul] Getting it out.
- Hot when the cream went on.

819
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:05,680
Too hot when the cream went on.
What has happened to this?

820
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:07,880
[Prue] I don't think
it's properly cooked, is it?

821
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,440
[Paul] Looks like it's been
pushed together into the tin.

822
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,680
Moving on to the last one.

823
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:15,040
We heard there was an issue
where it was dropped,

824
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,839
so this one being the neatest one,
we'll take that as a template.

825
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,400
- [Noel] Yeah.
- [Paul] They look dark

826
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,359
down the side there, almost burnt.

827
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,120
That's not because it was dropped.

828
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,359
- [Prue laughs]
- [Paul] It's been over-caramelised.

829
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,400
But they've got a nice height to them.

830
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,600
Mmm. Delicious.

831
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,520
[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue will now</i>
<i>rank the cakes from worst to best.</i>

832
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,600
In 12th place is this one.

833
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,720
Oh, Linda.

834
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:41,960
Well, you know what,
there's only one way now.

835
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,759
It's up from here, isn't it?

836
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,920
Eleventh spot is this one.

837
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,640
Very bitter. That caramel
had gone way over the top.

838
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,160
- You had a problem with it sticking.
- Then, number ten is this one.

839
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,080
Loriea. This is the opposite of that one.
It's just a little too pale.

840
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,400
[Matt] <i>Dave is ninth, Mak eighth,</i>
<i>Mark is seventh, Laura six,</i>

841
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,240
<i>Hermine is fifth and Lottie is fourth.</i>

842
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,680
In third spot, we have this one.

843
00:40:08,759 --> 00:40:12,200
Good consistency across the board
and the sponge was very, very good.

844
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:14,240
And then, in second place...

845
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,600
we have this one. Who is that?

846
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:21,920
Peter. It is pretty well faultless.

847
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,160
But a smidgen below the winner.

848
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:26,440
Which leaves first place.

849
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,680
Well done, Sura. They're very, very good.

850
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:34,480
The pipe work was beautiful and smooth,
the sponge, the caramel. Well done.

851
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,359
It was bittersweet
because I feel so sad for Dave.

852
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,960
I know you hate that
but you did really well.

853
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,960
I wish it...
I wish it didn't happen, to be honest.

854
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:54,000
It is a bit of a crackerjack of a day.
I'm, er... I'm pretty pleased.

855
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,160
Don't like making big mistakes.
That was a big mistake.

856
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,600
They asked for
a pineapple upside-down cake

857
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,319
and I gave them a pineapple fritter,
didn't I, really?

858
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,520
[Matt] <i>There's one</i>
<i>cake challenge remaining</i>

859
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,640
<i>before we crown
this year's first Star Baker,</i>

860
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,200
<i>and reveal who will be leaving the tent.</i>

861
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:18,759
We're filming in a bubble.

862
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,359
I tell you what,
I'm quite anxious about being locked up

863
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,040
- for weeks on end with you three guys.
- [laughs]

864
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,600
There's not a grown-up among you.

865
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,359
I was looking forward
to spending time with you, Prue.

866
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,120
- You really were?
- Yeah.

867
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,279
I love how you two pretend
we don't all live together in real life.

868
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:35,839
[laughing]

869
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,000
[Paul] We've got
some real talent in the tent.

870
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,880
Sura was a deserving winner
in the technical.

871
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,720
You got Pete, Hermine. I think
she's in line for Star Baker as well.

872
00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:45,480
So who do you think is in the bottom?

873
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,160
[Paul] I think Loriea.
She had that bubble gum idea.

874
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,040
I think Marc E and certainly, Linda.

875
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,240
There's a lot in the middle
that could go either way.

876
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:55,680
It's very tough, isn't it?
Somebody's gone through lockdown,

877
00:41:55,759 --> 00:41:58,520
and they've come here,
and they've quarantined,

878
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,920
and they're just in the competition
for two days.

879
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,759
I think that's always the worst,
is to go home right at the beginning.

880
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:07,880
We'll have one big camera,
they'll just walk off into the distance,

881
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,040
socially distancing,
with that music from <i>The Hulk </i>at the end.

882
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,160
- [Paul] Yeah.
- [both vocalising]

883
00:42:20,759 --> 00:42:22,319
Bakers, welcome back.

884
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,040
And I hope you're ready for
your very first showstopper challenge.

885
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,520
Paul and Prue would like you
to make a cake bust

886
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,279
depicting your personal celebrity hero.

887
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:35,279
Your 3D cake bust must have a head.

888
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,600
And it must be made... [laughs]

889
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,400
[Matt laughing]

890
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,200
And it must be made mainly from cake.

891
00:42:42,279 --> 00:42:44,880
Although you can use
some other edible details.

892
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,520
Okay, you've got four hours.
On your marks.

893
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,560
- Get set...
- [in deep voice] Bake.

894
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,600
- Right, let's go.
- [exhales] Okay.

895
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,279
Roll my sleeves up.
I am petrified, but this showstopper,

896
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,560
it's just got so many things happening.

897
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,920
It's given me quite a few
sleepless nights, this one.

898
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,480
To make a cake bust,
head and shoulders of a person,

899
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,560
we're asking them to be engineers,
decorators and bakers.

900
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,759
The big risk with a challenge like this

901
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,640
is ending up with too much icing,
too much buttercream,

902
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,279
which will be too heavy,
make it too sweet,

903
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,120
even if it makes it look fantastic.

904
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,720
For me, the secret with this challenge is

905
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:26,839
the structure they're gonna use
to put the cake onto.

906
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,200
If there's no proper structure,

907
00:43:28,279 --> 00:43:30,240
or if they don't bake
the sponges correctly,

908
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,400
it will collapse.

909
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,800
- [Paul] Hello.
- [Marc] Hi, Prue.

910
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:34,680
- Hello.
- Hi, Matt.

911
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:36,960
Tell us about your bust.
What are you gonna be doing?

912
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,920
I'm doing David Bowie as Ziggy Stardust.

913
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,879
Perfect.

914
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,799
Ziggy Stardust is going to be
instantly recognisable

915
00:43:42,879 --> 00:43:44,879
- just because of the colours.
- Yeah.

916
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,799
[Matt] <i>A fondant lightning strike</i>
<i>will decorate Marc's chocolate sponge</i>

917

<i>and vanilla buttercream reimagining
of the Thin White Duke.</i>

918
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,440
[Prue] One of the wonderful things
about David Bowie

919
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,759
- is the shape of his face.
- Well, this is it.

920
00:43:56,839 --> 00:43:59,839
- It's so beautiful and so slim.
- His face is quite slender.

921
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,440
First time I made it, it looked
more like Desperate Dan.

922
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,960
[Noel] <i>And Bowie will be joined on stage</i>
<i>by another musical legend.</i>

923
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,839
My hero is Bob Marley.

924
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,440
I just love his ethos,
not to worry about stuff.

925
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,680
Been singing it all morning.

926
00:44:13,759 --> 00:44:15,520

930
00:44:24,279 --> 00:44:26,240
Is the alcohol there for Prue?

931
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,520
Well, I thought it might cheer Paul up.

932
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,839
[laughing] Nothing cheers Paul up.

933
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,759
How much booze you got in there?
A couple bottles?

934
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,560
- A bottle and a half.
- Really? No.

935
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:41,600
<i>And if that doesn't get

939
00:44:48,879 --> 00:44:49,720

[Matt] You've practised this?

944
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,400
Last time I did it, the head exploded
and it went in the bin.

945
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,400
Right.

946
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,680
- Yeah.
- Cut.

947
00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:07,040

Too much chilli.

949
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,839
[Prue] Hello, Loriea.

950
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,720
Right, Loriea, who you gonna be doing
for your bust?

951
00:45:12,799 --> 00:45:15,680
I will be doing
Miss Louise Bennett-Coverley.

952
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:17,759
She's a Jamaican poet.

953
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,799
And she's got a poem about identity,
and I've got a mismatch of accents,

954
00:45:22,879 --> 00:45:24,520
which I think works well for this.

955
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,000
[Matt] <i>Loriea will celebrate</i>
<i>her Durham and Jamaican roots</i>

<i>with Scotch bonnet chilli

958
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,120
I have practised this multiple times.

959
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,240
- [Prue chuckles]
- And my first attempt,

960
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,200
it looked like I created Dobby.

961
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,960
- [laughs]
- [Loriea] So you will get

962
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,480
hopefully a better version
of something like that.

963
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,560
- Hi.
- Hello. I hear you're doing David.

964
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,720
- Yeah.
- 'Cause you pushed his cakes over?

965
00:45:48,799 --> 00:45:50,879
- [Sura] No!
- [Noel] Sorry, I got mixed up.

966
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,600
- Who are you doing?
- Sir David Attenborough.

967
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,759
- What a ledge.
- He is a ledge.

968
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,160
- [Noel] Love him?
- So much.

969
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,720
- [Noel] Ever met him?
- No.

970
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:00,839
- Of course I've not...
- He's coming today.

971
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,000
- Of course he's not.
- I texted him.

972
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,960
- Oh, sure.
- Said, "Sura needs you".

973
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,120
I do need him. I need a life model.

974

[Matt] <i>Sir David will be</i>

but the animal kingdom will be furious.

977

- Well, we can't have that.
- There'll be voles, gerbils...

- [laughing] Coming for me?
- ...marmosets coming for you. [laughs]

- [Mark] Studied zoology at university.

00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,319
[Matt] <i>But Peter is taking</i>
<i>a more subtle approach.</i>

1038
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,440
[Peter] Between the cakes, I'm just
gonna have a nice simple strawberry jam

1039
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,879
and some whipped double cream.
Er, it's a family favourite.

1040
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,920
[Noel] <i>The simple theme will continue</i>

1041
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,480
<i>between Peter's
Victoria sandwich rendition</i>

1042
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:30,120
<i>of his cycling hero, Sir Chris Hoy,
sporting fondant goggles and helmet.</i>

1043
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,160
Clever way of getting around doing hair.

1044
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,640
- Precisely why I wanted to do it.
- [Prue] And goggles.

1045
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,720
- [Peter] Yes.
- So, no eyes.

1046
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:40,640
I'm not great at sculpture
and art, erm, so I thought I'd go

1047
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,520
more simple and try
and get something that presents well.

1048
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,520
- Good luck, Peter.
- Thanks very much.

1049
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,160
Right, are you ready?

1050
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,440
I think that is, like, just cooked.

1051
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,160
[Linda] Yeah. Sorted.

1052
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,799
- He's got a lot of sponge.
- [Lottie] Hmm?

1053
00:49:56,879 --> 00:49:58,520
- Got a lot of sponge.
- [Lottie] I know.

1054
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,879
[Matt] <i>The sponges</i>
<i>might be out of the oven...</i>

1055
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,480
[Mak] This bit is so stressful.
It's so hot.

1056
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,960
These are hot cakes.

1057
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,640
[Matt] <i>...but until</i>
<i>they're cool enough to carve...</i>

1058
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,759
Pop them in the fridge
'cause I can't do anything

1059
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,279
because they are still very warm.

1060
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,400
[Matt] <i>...assembly will have to wait.</i>

1061
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,080
[Mark] Oh, no! Just lost a sponge.
[clicks tongue]

1062
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,520
[groans softly] Damn it!
Just dropped a sponge.

1063
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,759
It's fixable, I think.

1064
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,000
I can use it for the top,
so it's all right.

1065
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,640
Think I'm doing okay for time.

1066
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,080
I'm trying to roll out
as much fondant as I can

1067
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,759
before the cakes come out the freezer.

1068
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:35,120
[Matt] <i>Using fondant</i>
<i>will allow the bakers to craft the skin,</i>

1069
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,120
<i>hair, and clothing that will
hopefully bring their heroes to life.</i>

1070
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,200
So, I'm making beads for her necklace.

1071
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,120
- [Noel] Is this Prince Charles?
- [Dave] No.

1072
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,560
Shall I just keep guessing?

1073
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,335
- Meant to be Tom DeLonge.
- Farrah Fawcett?

1074
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:50,520
- Who?
- Tom DeLonge.

1075
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,160
- Blink-182.
- [Noel] I know who they are, yeah.

1076
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,799
Are you a fan of that type of music, Noel?

1077
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,759
Er... yeah.

1078

1083
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,160
Do you know what music Matt likes?

1084
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,040
When I first met Matt,
he was listening to Roger Whittaker.

1085
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,480
Mmm-hmm. Actually true.

1086
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,920
- [Dave] I don't...
- [Noel laughs]

1087
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,200
I love Roger Whittaker. Do you like him?

1088
00:51:19,279 --> 00:51:20,480
- No, weirdly.
- Why not?

1089

[both laughing]

1090
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,279
- I like Black Sabbath.
- Oh...

1091
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:28,319
[Hermine] I'm just using
the pasta roller to roll my dress.

1092
00:51:28,399 --> 00:51:30,799
- Wow.
- I'm doing Lupita Nyong'o.

1093
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,720
- She's a Hollywood actress.
- Yes.

1094

<i>- Black Panther.</i>
- [Hermine] Yes!

1095
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,240
- Yes.
- [Prue] Very beautiful girl.

1096
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:40,440
She is.
I hope, er, I could replicate that.

1097
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,440
[Noel] <i>Hermine is aiming</i>

ice-mould eyes to give it a real eye look.

I hope it will look impressive. [chuckles]

1102

[Matt] <i>Also keen to do his hero justice...</i>

1103
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,480
Two eyeballs.

1104
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,560
Some cheeky things.

[Mak] My hero is Bill Bryson.
He's an author I've admired for decades.

1107
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,720
Been studying his face so much.

1108
00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:13,720
[chuckles] Honestly, I just know
every wrinkle, every nook and cranny.

[Matt] <i>His lemon Madeira sponges</i>

1111

<i>and to recreate Bill's flowing locks,
he has a special tool to hand.</i>

1112
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,879
[Mak] It's a press for making Bombay mix,

1113
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,560
and what I'm trying to do
is create strands of hair.

1114

Very nice. Can you make me some, please?

1115

- Just come over here and I'll just...
- Yeah. Yes, please. Yes, thank you.

[Rowan] Oh, come on, choux buns. Why?

1118
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,920
Hoping that it'll rise. We'll see.

1119
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,920

[Matt] <i>With their sponges cooled,</i>

of anything slipping off the mat.

1127

'cause these need to be really frozen,

1128

some awful medieval torture,

and I'm sure Louis would understand.

Well, I've got some choux,
very flat choux.

1135
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:31,319
Only a matter
of whether it's worth using or not.

1136
00:53:31,399 --> 00:53:33,839
Don't wanna be criticised
for it when it's not necessary,

1137
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,279
so I'll just, I'll wing it as usual.

[Matt] <i>As the busts get taller...</i>

What the hell is that?

1166

[Noel] It's like a death mask.
Is it a grim reaper?

1167
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,160
Erm, it's supposed to be Louis Theroux.

1168

[Peter] I have faith he's gonna stand up.

1171
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,960
[Laura] He's got
the shortest head in the world.

[sighs]

1173
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,399
Embarrassing. Making boobs on national TV.

1174
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,839
I don't know
if I've ever fancied a cake before,

1175
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,600

erm, this seems like the best option.

1179

Bakers, ten minutes left.

1180
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,000
[sighs] It's not enough.

1181
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,319
It's all gone wrong.

1182
00:55:22,359 --> 00:55:26,040
[Loriea] Kind of a lot like
a bandana I'm trying to put on there,

1183
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,560
but it never seems to
work as well as I need it to.

1184
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,480
[Lottie] Gonna quickly paint his eyes in.

1185
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,120
[Sura] Oh, man,
he looks absolutely knackered. Poor David.

1186
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,799
I like detail, it's calming.

1187
00:55:38,879 --> 00:55:42,960
Time factor-wise, I think it's just gonna
have to be kind of silhouette-y, really.

1188
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,960
- [Laura] I can't do it.
- [Sura] You can.

1189
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,600
- [Laura] I can't put the head on.
- [Sura] I'll help.

1190
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,560
[Laura] I'm too scared to put the head on.

1191
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,120
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1192
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,279
- Do it.
- Oh!

1193
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:57,080
- Just put it on.
- Jesus Christ.

1194
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,520
[Laura] Come on, Freddie,
please stay together.

1195
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,359
[Lottie] Louis, please don't hate me
when you see this.

1196
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,080
Rowan, can I be of any assistance
for the last bit?

1197
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,839
I'm kind of there, thank you.

1198
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,480
I'll just do a bit more
pinning of these things.

1199
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,680
- [Laura] This needs to sit on top.
- [Sura] It's not going on top.

1200
00:56:12,759 --> 00:56:14,359
- Oh!
- You've put the wrong bit in.

1201
00:56:14,879 --> 00:56:18,319
- [Mak] Just need glasses on him.
- Long as that holds up for a little bit.

1202
00:56:18,399 --> 00:56:21,600
[Laura] Oh, no, Freddie. [chuckling]

1203
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,000
[Lottie] Gotta laugh,
he's got a bloody hunchback.

1204
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,279
[Laura] Quick.

1205
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,120
- No...
- [Laura] It's too big.

1206
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,080
This bit, this bit. Go, go, go.

1207
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,960
- It's gonna pierce through his head...
- I don't care.

1208
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,640
Bakers, your time is up.

1209
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:39,120
Thank you so much for your help.

1210
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,080
Step away from your cake busts.

1211
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,160
It wasn't quite what I had planned.
But you know, what is?

1212
00:56:45,799 --> 00:56:46,799
[Laura] I'm going home.

1213
00:56:46,879 --> 00:56:49,319
- [Sura] No, you're not.
- [Laura] I am.

1214
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,160
- That was hard.
- [chuckles] Tell me about it.

1215
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:56,279
- [Laura] Oh, God, yours is about to fall.
- [Rowan] No!

1216
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,960
[Sura] I never run.

1217
00:57:03,759 --> 00:57:05,200
[indistinct chatter]

1218
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:11,120
Sura, get something flat.
It's not in balance. It'll fall again.

1219
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,000
[Linda] That's it. Something heavy.

1220
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,480
Stand it up the back.

1221
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,759
That's it.

1222
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,680
I had to put, like, a...
The piping bags behind him.

1223
00:57:18,759 --> 00:57:20,680
So, it looks like a travel cushion.

1224
00:57:21,399 --> 00:57:24,120
[Matt] It's okay. They said
you can use inedible supports.

1225
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,240
[laughs]

1226
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,040
[Noel] <i>It's judgement time</i>
<i>for the 12 cake busts.</i>

1227
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,960
Rowan, would you like
to bring up your showstopper?

1228
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,640
The choux buns were a bit
of a disaster, so I had to improvise.

1229
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,960
[Paul] There's a pattern here.

1230
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,640
'Cause you promised us almost
a Parthenon yesterday, we didn't get.

1231
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,240
- Promised us choux buns, we haven't got.
- No.

1232
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:52,919
Say less and then do more.

1233
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,319
- Yes.
- [Paul] Having said that,

1234
00:57:54,399 --> 00:57:55,919
you instantly recognise who it is.

1235
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,200
I think it's absolutely brilliant.

1236
00:57:58,279 --> 00:58:00,056
- [Rowan] Thank you.
- I hope she tastes nice.

1237
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,240
Well, so do I.

1238
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:03,160
- Gonna go through her cheek.
- Yeah.

1239
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,560
No.

1240
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:06,200
Oh, you brute.

1241
00:58:06,279 --> 00:58:07,319
[chuckles]

1242
00:58:07,399 --> 00:58:12,399
[Rowan] It's a chocolate cake
with kirsch-soaked cherries.

1243
00:58:13,879 --> 00:58:16,919
Mmm! Cherry flavour's lovely.

1244
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,440
Would've been nice to have the choux buns,
but overall I think you made a tasty cake.

1245
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,319
- Thank you.
- [Prue] Well done, Rowan.

1246
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,040
[Prue] Well, I have to say,
he is recognisable.

1247
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,399
- Definitely.
- Thank you.

1248
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,759
That sort of slightly
anxious look is very Louis Theroux.

1249
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:35,960
It is a coconut and lime sponge
with a chocolate orange buttercream.

1250
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,000
[Paul] You get all the flavours,
the orange, lime, coconut.

1251
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,759
But it's over-baked, bone dry.

1252
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,799
[Prue] It's obviously Bill Bryson.

1253
00:58:46,879 --> 00:58:48,640
It's good. I love the detail on it.

1254
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,080
- Thank you.
- [Prue] And what's inside it?

1255
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,560
It's a lemon Madeira with red currant jam.

1256
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,960
- Lovely flavour, but it's very dry.
- [Paul] And that's a real shame.

1257
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,480
I'd like to have seen a mouth on it.

1258
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,799
'Cause Marley was known for his voice
and he hasn't got a mouth.

1259
00:59:07,879 --> 00:59:09,879
- [all laugh]
- I know.

1260
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,200
- I think it's delicious.
- [Prue] It is.

1261
00:59:15,279 --> 00:59:17,520
[Paul] It's got all elements
of a good sponge.

1262
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,080
You can't go wrong
with citrus flavours and a lemon curd.

1263
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,359
It's very dramatic.
He's got wonderful athlete's shoulders.

1264
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,279
He really looks as if he's puffing.
And I love the helmet.

1265
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,040
[Paul] It's clever, and a good get out,

1266
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:39,200
because, wearing a helmet
and a mask, you know who it is.

1267
00:59:39,279 --> 00:59:42,200
I mean, Sir Chris has got
many, many Olympic medals.

1268
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:43,759
That's what he wore when he did it.

1269
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:45,136
- It's excellent.
- Let me just...

1270
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,000
Sorry, Chris.

1271
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,919
[Prue] I was worried about this.
I thought Victoria sandwich

1272
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,799
and fresh cream is all
quite light and easily squashed,

1273
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,680
and you'd end up with a pudding inside.

1274
00:59:53,759 --> 00:59:56,040
But you haven't. It looks lovely.

1275
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,640
The Italian meringue
buttercream is delicious.

1276
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,200
The strawberries,
the cream, the sponge is spot on.

1277
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,120
It feels really fresh. Light.

1278
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,200
It's delicious. The concept is great.

1279
01:00:09,279 --> 01:00:10,520
And it's witty.

1280
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,359
- [Prue and Paul] Well done, Peter.
- Thank you so much.

1281
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,440
[Prue] I think it's like a caricature.
So it's really good.

1282
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,120
- [Dave] Thank you.
- [Prue] Would you tell us what's inside?

1283
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,359
Mint and strawberry
with a cocoa buttercream.

1284
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,319
Bit toothpaste-y.

1285
01:00:29,399 --> 01:00:31,040
The mint is so strong.

1286
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,640
And it has that very chemical taste.

1287
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,600
[Paul] It's a shame.

1288
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,600
Let yourself down
on the texture and flavour.

1289
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,680
Yeah, okay.

1290
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:46,080
Erm, that's about as far away
from David Bowie as you could get.

1291
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,960
- I'd agree with you.
- [Prue] Yes, he's lost his neck.

1292
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,399
Yeah, more Jabba the Hutt.

1293
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,160
[judges laugh]

1294
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,720
[Marc] It's a chocolate sponge
with vanilla buttercream.

1295
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,680
[Prue] It's quite dense.

1296
01:01:00,759 --> 01:01:02,000
[Paul] Slightly over-baked.

1297
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,120
Okay.

1298
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,040
- But it's a great flavour. Good effort.
- Thank you.

1299
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:12,080
The fact that you put "Guess who?" on this

1300
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,040
must mean
you don't think it looks like her.

1301
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,080
- That's right.
- [Prue chuckles]

1302
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,040
Your work with the fondant
is absolutely exquisite.

1303
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,600
[Paul] I thought it was real.

1304
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,240
[Prue] So let's hope
it's as good inside as it is outside.

1305
01:01:23,319 --> 01:01:24,399
I hope so.

1306
01:01:26,759 --> 01:01:27,839
It's really lovely.

1307
01:01:27,919 --> 01:01:30,919
It's such a rich chocolate cake.
It's delicious.

1308
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,520
I'll sit down
and have a slice of that anytime.

1309
01:01:35,919 --> 01:01:37,440
[Paul] You can see who it is.

1310
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,399
- [Prue] It looks great.
- [Mark] Thank you.

1311
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:43,240
It is a ginger spice sponge
with a coconut buttercream.

1312
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,839
Lovely, very good flavour.

1313
01:01:48,919 --> 01:01:51,399
[Paul] It's nice to see
you haven't overdone it with spices.

1314
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,040
You've got spices you can identify.

1315
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,279
But it marries beautifully
with the ginger.

1316
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:56,680
It's a well-baked cake.

1317
01:01:56,759 --> 01:01:58,240
- [Prue] Well done.
- Thank you.

1318
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,319
We've got a picture
of her in front of us now.

1319
01:02:03,399 --> 01:02:05,399
Head scarf, tick.

1320
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,399
[Prue and Paul] Necklace, tick.

1321
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:11,359
- Resemblance to her, doesn't exist.
- Resemblance, not so much.

1322
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,440
[Paul chuckles]

1323
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:17,600
Erm, it has got a chilli chocolate sponge
flavoured with Scotch bonnet chilli powder

1324
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,879
and ginger and mango jam.

1325
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,200
Chilli's a bit overwhelming.

1326
01:02:24,279 --> 01:02:26,879
[Prue] I agree
that you could lower chilli a little.

1327
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,240
- Wow.
- [Matt chuckles]

1328
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:29,440
It's coming in waves.

1329
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,560
But when you've got
a wave of ginger as well,

1330
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,279
it's really, really strong.

1331
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:37,680
Now, this is lining up
with what happened yesterday, as well.

1332
01:02:37,759 --> 01:02:39,399
Consistency is the word.

1333
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,600
You are consistent. Absolutely.

1334
01:02:47,879 --> 01:02:49,399
He's reclining.

1335
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,000
He's having a nap.

1336
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,080
[Matt chuckles]

1337
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,000
[Paul] Very neat on the shirt,
very neat on the face.

1338
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,080
Well, you can see who it is.
Let's have a look, shall we?

1339
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,359
Gosh, that looks really tender.

1340
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,720
[Sura] It is a coconut sponge

1341
01:03:03,799 --> 01:03:06,640
with a raspberry
Italian meringue buttercream.

1342
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,160
[Prue] I like the flavour.

1343
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,480
[Paul] It's not dry, which is good.
It's nice and moist.

1344
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,560
Overall, you've done
something that looks like him.

1345
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,960
It's quite smart, it's neat.
You've done a good job.

1346
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,080
Thank you.

1347
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,200
[chuckles] Sorry.

1348
01:03:26,279 --> 01:03:28,879
[chuckles] You're not supposed to laugh.

1349
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,720
It was all going really well.
His jacket looked great and everything.

1350
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,799
And then the head exploded.

1351
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:38,399
I think, erm, but, I'm hoping
that the flavours will redeem.

1352
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,799
- [Paul] What are they?
- [Laura] Lemon and elderflower.

1353
01:03:40,879 --> 01:03:43,120
I do think his jacket is lovely.

1354
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,080
- [Laura] Thank you.
- [Paul] Yeah.

1355
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,439
Mmm, that is delicious.

1356
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,000
Thank you!

1357
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:55,399
I think one of the reasons it squashed
so easily is it is very moist.

1358
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,279
- [Paul] Hmm.
- [Laura] Do you like it?

1359
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,759
- [Paul] Erm...
- Oh, go on, say you like it.

1360
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,199
- Actually, I love it, yeah.
- Yes!

1361
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,520
[Paul] The flavour's good.
The elderflower's there.

1362
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,080
It looks the way it does,
but it tastes really nice.

1363
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,919
And you can identify who it is.

1364
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:08,879
Thank you.

1365
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,240
- [Matt and Noel] Well done.
- What a relief.

1366
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:12,399
Come on, Fred.

1367
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,600
- Let's go.
- [all laugh]

1368
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,839
- Well done.
- Thank you.

1369
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,839
My biggest fear today
was that they'd say the cake was bland.

1370
01:04:26,919 --> 01:04:30,759
'Cause then I knew I was going home.
I think I've hopefully pulled it back.

1371
01:04:31,759 --> 01:04:34,439
[Loriea] I baked it how I like it,

1372
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,560
so it's too late
to cross fingers and toes now.

1373
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,319
Kind of thought before that
came together today that that was it.

1374
01:04:40,399 --> 01:04:43,720
But, if it is, I'm going out on a high.

1375
01:04:43,799 --> 01:04:45,240
Nobody wants to be the first.

1376
01:04:45,319 --> 01:04:48,439
Coming on this show, I said
that I don't want to be the first.

1377
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:52,600
But maybe that was my challenge,
to accept being the first to go.

1378
01:04:58,359 --> 01:05:01,319
[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue</i>
<i>have made their decision.</i>

1379
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,799
Well, congratulations, bakers.

1380
01:05:05,879 --> 01:05:11,319
I have the rather pleasant job
of announcing this week's Star Baker.

1381
01:05:12,919 --> 01:05:15,160
And this week's star baker is...

1382
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,120
Peter!

1383
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,560
[all applaud]

1384
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,399
Go, Peter.

1385
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:35,480
Which means I've got the horrible job
of announcing which baker is leaving us.

1386
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:39,600
And the baker who's going home is...

1387
01:05:48,919 --> 01:05:50,839
Loriea. I'm sorry.

1388
01:05:50,919 --> 01:05:52,799
[all] Aww.

1389
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,120
- Oh, darling, I'm so sorry.
- [Loriea] It's fine.

1390
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,960
- [Linda] Bless you.
- [Loriea] Thank you.

1391
01:05:59,799 --> 01:06:02,279
It might have been nice
to stay a bit longer,

1392
01:06:02,359 --> 01:06:04,160
but someone has to go, so...

1393
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,359
- You did amazing, remember that.
- Thank you.

1394
01:06:10,439 --> 01:06:13,560
Yes, I am proud.
I did quite well to get here.

1395
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,720
And I stayed true to myself.

1396
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:18,399
- [Paul] I'm so sorry.
- [Loriea] It's fine.

1397
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,560
It was really sad, 'cause
I could see a lot of talent in Loriea.

1398
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:25,080
And what was...
As a judge, I can't get involved.

1399
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,600
'Cause I wanted to tell her,
"Stop doing that".

1400
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,839
And it came down
to over-baking and over-flavouring.

1401
01:06:30,919 --> 01:06:33,040
[Marc] Can't believe
I'm through to next week.

1402
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:36,480
I was sat on that chair,
ready to stand up.

1403
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,160
Ah! [laughs]

1404
01:06:40,439 --> 01:06:42,160
Oh, my gosh.

1405
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,240
Aw, fantastic. I can't believe it,
I was like... [screams]

1406
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,799
- Thank you.
- [Rowan] Well deserved.

1407
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:52,279
I said I was putting
my money on you. [chuckles]

1408
01:06:52,359 --> 01:06:53,799
- [Peter] Hey.
- [woman] <i>Hi, Peter.</i>

1409
01:06:53,879 --> 01:06:55,839
Just wanted to give you a quick call.

1410
01:06:55,919 --> 01:06:59,640
Erm, so, week one
went pretty well. I got Star Baker.

1411
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,160
- [woman cheering over phone]
- [chuckles]

1412
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,480
[woman] <i>Hurray! Well done!</i>

1413
01:07:05,279 --> 01:07:08,640
Thank you, it was, erm, pretty insane.

1414
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,759
[chuckles]

1415
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,839
