1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,819
but... I don't know,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,179
You know, I've talked about this,
but... I don't know,

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,699
the printer is upside down again,
and I...

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,019
Oh, no. Maybe I... Ah, yes.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,459
Well, that works, actually. I can
read that fine. Um...

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,220
Right, let's... Yeah.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,419
Good evening, um, let's get
straight to it.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:26,139
We are now approaching Phase 46,
which means that from Tuesday

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,459
morning or Wednesday evening,
depending on your height, we are...

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,899
W-we are... W-we are...

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,779
We are saying, with regards to
baking - if you must bake in a tent,

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,659
bake in a tent, but please don't
bake in a tent. And... And...

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,899
And we are asking people to use
common sense with

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,299
regards to the distribution
of hundreds and thousands.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,299
Now, I believe... I believe we have
a-a-a question

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,619
from the lady in the funky dress.

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,059
Noel, yes.
Hello, Prime Minister. Yes?

18
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,059
Just one quick question, is
it "scone" or "scon"?

19
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,499
Right, well, I'm... I'm going to
hand over to the experts on this.

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,899
Uh, um, Prue Whitty.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,139
"Scone".

22
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,219
Right, Professor Paul Hollywood.

23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,379
"Scon".

24
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,419
Right, well, I hope that clears
things up for you.

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,579
All that remains is for me to say...

26
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,540
..welcome to
The Great British Bake Off!

27
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,459
My husband said to me, "Why don't
you apply?"

28
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,899
I was like, "I'm not going to get
in. I'm not going to get in."

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,859
I didn't give it a lot of thought,
I'll be honest with you.

30
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,219
I thought, "Oh, I'd love to go
on there."

31
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,540
This year's bakers will be part of
something very special.

32
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,499
Something about the year 2020 felt
as if it was kind of momentous,

33
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,139
possibly not in the way it's turned
out to be,

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,619
so I gave it a go.

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,979
Like everyone up
and down the country,

36
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,219
the Bake Off has had to make
some changes.

37
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,259
It's unbelievable that I'm living in
a wee Bake Off village,

38
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,059
a wee Bake Off town.

39
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,579
To save this year's competition,
the bakers have volunteered to

40
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,979
leave their loved ones and live
in our very own Bake Off bubble...

41
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,619
Actually harder than I thought
leaving home. So, the night before,

42
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,779
my husband cooked us fajitas,
or "fajeetas" as he calls them...

43
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,339
It just hit me. "I could not see you
for seven weeks."

44
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,459
And then I was like crying into
my dinner.

45
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,819
I come from a very loving family.

46
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,779
I miss them, but it has spurred
me on.

47
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,339
..and despite everything that this
year has thrown at all of us...

48
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,299
Once we all walk into the tent,
I think

49
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,979
it will get back to something very,
very familiar.

50
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,619
..we've made it.

51
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,940
Same old Bake Off - familiar,
comforting, lovely.

52
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,180
Would you like to dance with me?

53
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,619
12 new bakers...

54
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,619
Oh!
LAUGHTER

55
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,180
..30 brand-new spectacular
challenges...

56
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,660
Oh, go on, say you like it.

57
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,579
Actually, I love it, yeah. Yes!

58
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,539
..and in this unique year...

59
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,019
Have you done this before? Yes.

60
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,179
And did it work? Yes.

61
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,939
..we begin the competition
with a Cake Week...

62
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,819
It's given me quite a few sleepless
nights, this one.

63
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,219
..unlike anything The Bake Off has
ever seen.

64
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,539
I don't know
if I've ever fancied a cake before.

65
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,059
But I slightly do now!

66
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,419
Come on, Freddie.
Please stay together.

67
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,739
Some of Freddie Mercury's
head is not there.

68
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,219
GASPING

69
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,499
It's all gone wrong.

70
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,299
Oh, don't cry. It's all right!

71
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,739
It's so stressful, Paul.

72
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,139
Why on Earth did I get into this
competition? I don't know.

73
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,979
You chose to come here.
I know I did.

74
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,260
Urgh!
GASPING

75
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,260
Solid start.

76
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,739
We've taken a little detour,

77
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,539
and pitched our tent in
the beautiful grounds of Down Hall.

78
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,499
And our fresh batch of bakers are
about to tackle

79
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,459
three cake-based challenges,

80
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,859
after which we'll crown one of them
the first Star Baker of 2020,

81
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,659
and ask another to leave
The Bake Off tent.

82
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,019
Hello, bakers. Welcome to the tent,

83
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,259
and it's time for your first-ever
Signature Challenge.

84
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,699
The judges would like you to make
that fan favourite, the Battenberg.

85
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,059
Rectangular in shape
and wrapped in marzipan.

86
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,499
It can be any sponge you want,
any flavour,

87
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,019
but when you cut inside it, it needs
to reveal a pattern or a design.

88
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,819
You have just two hours.

89
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,539
You ready for those magic words?
Yes. Yes, I am.

90
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,939
OK, I'll set you up, yeah? OK.
You say it. All right, OK.

91
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,539
On your marks... BAKE!
LAUGHTER

92
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,219
That was a little bit early. Was it
a bit early? Leave a little bit...

93
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,099
A little bit of a gap. Bigger,
bigger gap. OK. All right.

94
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,539
Yep, yep, OK.

95
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,500
On your marks, get set...

96
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,899
..bake.

97
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,099
Maybe split the difference?

98
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,380
Split the difference? Split
the difference.

99
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,819
I've been so excited, I just
couldn't wait for it to begin.

100
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,419
Just raring to go.

101
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,980
# This is it! #

102
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,019
Very nice to get started,
I'm just...

103
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,819
Hopefully, I'm organised.

104
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,539
Stomach's kind of going like a bit
of a washing machine.

105
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,859
It's felt like I've sat around
waiting to get going all morning.

106
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,819
And I'm...

107
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,339
Do not know what has happened
to that.

108
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,019
I've broke something already.

109
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,339
Battenberg is a lovely signature
to kick off with.

110
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,819
Every marzipan lover's favourite
cake. Mine, too.

111
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,699
What I'm looking for is a beautiful,

112
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:00,019
smooth marzipan. Inside, stark
differences in colour of sponge.

113
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,019
I would keep it basic If I was them,

114
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,219
but make sure I'm punching with
flavours and punching with colours.

115
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,619
It's a real treat, it's very rich
cos of the marzipan.

116
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,099
And it should be wonderful.
I'm looking forward to it.

117
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,499
Good morning. Good morning, Loriea.
So, tell us about your Battenberg.

118
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,899
I'm making bubble gum and cream soda
flavoured Battenberg.

119
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,579
Bubble gum? Yeah.

120
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,580
How are you going to flavour it with
bubble gum? From a bottle.

121
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,659
And what's the other flavour?

122
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,539
It's a combination of cream soda
syrup and cream soda flavouring.

123
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,899
MATT: Loriea works as a radiographer
for the NHS,

124
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,219
and gets all her new recipes tested
by her neighbours in Durham.

125
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,899
Should have asked if you wanted
more, but... Thank you very much.

126
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,179
Her bubble gum and cream soda
sponges will be wrapped

127
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,179
in a bright blue marzipan.

128
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,819
What I love about this is you've
gone for everything that is

129
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,539
artificial. Yeah!

130
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,100
What I love about this is
absolutely everything.

131
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,939
Loriea's not the only baker
rediscovering her childhood.

132
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,019
Hello, Laura. Hello, how are you?
I'm all right, thanks.

133
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,579
How are you doing? I'm good, thanks.
What's happening?

134
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,939
I'm doing a raspberry ripple
Battenberg. One of the flavours

135
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,939
is raspberry ripple and the other
one is coconut.

136
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,219
Oh, lovely. And are you a big
Battenberg fan? Not really, mate.

137
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,299
No? No. I'm not a massive
fan of the marzipan.

138
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,339
Yeah, I don't think this will
go in the show,

139
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,859
but it's good to, you know, tell
people who you are, isn't it?

140
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,699
Laura is a Samaritans volunteer
from Halling, Kent, and takes huge

141
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,299
pride in the garden she's created
with her husband, Matt.

142
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,619
She plans to pipe buttercream
roses on her coconut

143
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,379
and raspberry ripple Battenberg.
You going to try some?

144
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,739
I will try some, but I'm not going
to judge it.

145
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,059
I have the eating age of
a nine-year-old.

146
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,339
Really? I'll just eat anything.

147
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,739
Oh, I just eat Super Noodles
and things like that.

148
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,019
There's nothing wrong with a good
Super Noodle. They're good,
aren't they? They are good.

149
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,339
You know they're called Batchelor's
Super Noodles? Yeah?

150
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,899
Cos I'm homosexual, I call them

151
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,499
"Confirmed Batchelor's
Super Noodles."

152
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,259
Are you a homosexual?
I never knew that.

153
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,860
Well, I help them out at weekends.

154
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,339
And there's one more baker who's
rolling back the years.

155
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,219
I am doing rhubarb and custard
Battenberg,

156
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,579
so there's a custard sponge,
and then the rhubarb jam

157
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,939
will go between, which I'm hoping
will be quite tart.

158
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,299
Are you doing a classic four square
design or...?

159
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,179
I don't want to show you what I'm
supposed to be doing

160
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,859
because I haven't got it right yet.

161
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,579
I'm trying to get a bit of a funky
star-shaped pattern.

162
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,659
Lottie lives in Littlehampton,

163
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,019
and unwinds from her job as
a pantomime producer by listening

164
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,019
to Viking metal whilst baking

165
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,379
and doing yoga with her
friend, Naomi.

166
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,739
Do you want to lift your arms
up? No.

167
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,699
For her take on
the old-fashioned sweet,

168
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,179
she'll attempt a striped marzipan to
surround her star-shaped

169
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,259
sponge, which there could already
be an issue with.

170
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,420
Why is it curdling?

171
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,019
The sponge has got lumps of
butter in.

172
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,339
I prefer it like that, to be honest.

173
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,699
It's because the butter was
too cold.

174
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,059
Do you think I should redo my
batter? Why?

175
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,499
Because it's got lumps of butter in
it. Show me.

176
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,379
You see? Yeah, redo it.

177
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,259
Redo it? I would. Oh, mate!

178
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,340
Solid start.

179
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,939
Just got to weigh out half of this.

180
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,459
The judges have demanded
Battenbergs featuring

181
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,019
at least two complimentary flavours.

182
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,899
Just adding cream soda into half of
the mixture.

183
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,739
I'm now running about
20 minutes behind.

184
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,659
And whilst Lottie has had to start
her trip to the sweet shop

185
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,539
all over again...
Nothing gradual about that.

186
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,059
..Dave's headed straight for
the off-licence.

187
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,699
The flavours today, I'm choosing to
do espresso martini.

188
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,259
Dave is an armoured security guard
from Hampshire, and he and his

189
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,019
partner Stacey are getting ready
for the arrival of their first baby.

190
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,659
One of his sponges will feature

191
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,339
chocolate and coffee liqueur,

192
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,179
and the other, in a Bake Off first,

193
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,939
will be flavoured with vodka.

194
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,299
Do you go off-piste
a lot, then? Yes.

195
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,059
Do you read a recipe and go,
"I'm not doing that"?

196
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,419
Just going to have to wing it.
Just see a recipe

197
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,779
as a loose sort of satchel...
It's a guide... of ideas.

198
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,459
It's a guide. Rules are meant to be
broken. Exactly.

199
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,980
They can't contain you.
You're a maverick.

200
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,099
But bold flavour combinations
aren't quite enough.

201
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,059
Need to get a good, deep red.

202
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,739
Key to Battenberg's success are
contrasting colours.

203
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,419
Some blue food colouring.
It just works.

204
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,899
But unlike Loriea...

205
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,859
I'm just making raspberry jam.

206
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,339
..some bakers are colouring their
cakes with something

207
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,019
a little less artificial.

208
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,779
I'm doing a sour cherry

209
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,859
and chocolate and walnut Battenberg.

210
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,219
These are the sour cherries.
It helps colour it

211
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,099
and give it flavour as well.

212
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,819
Marc lives in Cornwall.
He's a part-time carer

213
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,179
and full-time single dad to his
daughters Jasmine and Rosie.

214
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,379
Hey! Rose!

215
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,099
His sour cherry and chocolate
and walnut sponges will be

216
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,579
wrapped in a highly decorated
rose water marzipan.

217
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,939
Hello, Marc. Now, I've got
a question for you.

218
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,619
We have two "Marks" on the show.
Yeah. There's you and Mark.

219
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,979
Are you willing to surrender
your name?

220
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,419
I'll tell you what, I'll call myself
after my dog, Hamish.

221
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,580
Hamish? Yeah.

222
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,139
So, what would you normally be
doing? I work with a young lad.

223
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,059
Will he be watching this? He will
be. Yeah, yeah. What's his name?

224
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,859
His name is Josh. Josh? Hello, Josh.

225
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,619
How you doing? All right?

226
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,380
You should be very proud of Hamish.

227
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,299
Going into the oven.

228
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,619
The sooner the sponges begin
baking... One in each shelf.

229
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,699
..the sooner they can be cooled.

230
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,419
Stressful. A Battenberg requires
precise cutting and shaping.

231
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,179
Right, it's with the oven gods now.

232
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,059
Any attempt to trim a warm sponge
could see it fall apart.

233
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,499
Ah! Scary!

234
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,300
If I could stop shaking,
it would help.

235
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,099
Now, Matt, this is your first-ever
time calling out. I know.

236
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,659
You do it. I can't. You do it.

237
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,420
All right, I'll do it.
I'll do it. No, you do it.

238
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,980
You do it. BAKERS!

239
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,779
You have one hour left.

240
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,099
And then Paul Hollywood's coming.

241
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,380
Get it in the oven.
Please be good to me.

242
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,939
Deciding when to stop baking is
a crucial decision.

243
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,259
Yep, we're good to go.

244
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,459
The judges are expecting a sharp
geometric design...

245
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,819
Sponge is done.

246
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,179
..which demands sponges baked just
enough to hold their form when cut.

247
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,619
I'll give that another five minutes.

248
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,539
But baked a fraction too long

249
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,939
and the Battenberg's soft
texture will be lost...

250
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,779
Another two minutes... and Peter is
timing sponges unlike anyone else's.

251
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,179
It's a gluten-free sponge.

252
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,019
I'm actually more used to making
gluten-free than I am regular.

253
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,419
20-year-old Peter is a badminton mad
accountancy student from Edinburgh.

254
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,299
He began wheat-free baking for his
older brother Andrew who's

255
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,459
gluten intolerant.

256
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,979
High-quality back garden badminton.

257
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,739
His gluten-free dark chocolate

258
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,619
and orange sponges will be wrapped

259
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,299
in a polka-dot marzipan.

260
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,179
And he'll check them with
a trick he learnt

261
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,099
when he was just ten years old.

262
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,859
John Whaite on series three of
Bake Off,

263
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,659
he said that his mum taught him
to listen to it.

264
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,019
That if it's still wet, then it's
going to sound like

265
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,379
it's boiling away, but if it's just
a nice, moist cake,

266
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,779
it's just got a gentle, gentle
sound to it, so...

267
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,380
That was a good tip from Bake Off.

268
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,819
Sura probably won't need to
bake with her ears.

269
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,579
The cake is overflowing.

270
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,059
I didn't use this tin in practice,

271
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,980
cos it took three weeks to arrive.

272
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,419
Sura is a hospital pharmacist,

273
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,939
and lives in west London with her
husband Chad

274
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,259
and their cat Ghost.
What's that?

275
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,899
She'll have to transform her

276
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,179
overflowing sponges into a lemon

277
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,819
and orange Battenberg, complete

278
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,499
with mini marzipan fruits.

279
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,379
I feel sorry for whoever's going
to clean up after me.

280
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,019
Hello, Sura. You were a little bit
nervous earlier, weren't you?

281
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,819
You were thinking about starting
again. I wouldn't have had time.

282
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,700
Well, you wouldn't have the time.
Are you a Battenberg fan?

283
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,259
Will you be trying your own cake or
are you just like, "Nah,

284
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,819
"I'm not doing it."
I'm so over cake,

285
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,619
cos I've been tasting it
and trying it out.

286
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,459
Really? Yeah, I don't want to eat
any more cake ever again.

287
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,460
You might be on the wrong show,
Sura. Yeah, I know.

288
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,219
How long have we got left? Does
anyone know? About 40 minutes.

289
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,019
Now, the battle for Battenberg
gets even harder.

290
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,699
Very blue. What's life without
taking a little bit of risk? So...

291
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,059
These look overcooked,

292
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,419
but they feel relatively soft,
so I can work with that.

293
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,659
I can work with that.

294
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,099
This afternoon tea classic is famous

295
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,819
for its flawless
marzipan wrapping...

296
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,699
I'd never eaten marzipan, and they
were like, "You've got to try it."

297
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,739
I was like, "Mm-mm."

298
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,020
..and Paul and Prue have insisted
that the bakers make their own.

299
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,979
So, I've gone for a dark
green marzipan.

300
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,179
I'm doing a Turkish
bazaar-inspired Battenberg.

301
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,059
Me and my wife both love Istanbul.

302
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,099
It's actually my wedding
anniversary today,

303
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,459
so I thought it was quite a good...
It's actually worked out

304
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,819
quite a good time to do
the Battenberg. Yeah.

305
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,819
Mark is a project manager and lives
in Liverpool with his wife Laura.

306
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,499
BARKING AND LAUGHTER

307
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,299
Beneath his green marzipan will be

308
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,819
Turkish flavours of orange,

309
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,219
pistachio, cardamom and pomegranate.

310
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,259
So, have you spoke to your wife yet?
Anniversary?

311
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,619
I sent her a message earlier this
morning, but not since. Really?

312
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,299
Playing it cool.
Yeah, I'm playing it...

313
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,539
Not text her until she texts me.

314
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,059
Can't really play it cool once
you're married? You can't, no.

315
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,579
It's a done deal. It's done.
At least you didn't forget.

316
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,939
It's quite a busy day for you,
to be fair.

317
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,939
You're on Bake Off, first day,
and it's your anniversary. Exactly.

318
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,259
It's all stacked up against you.
It is.

319
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,540
You did really well! It is.

320
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,939
And Mark isn't alone in using
colour to elevate

321
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,259
the humble marzipan.

322
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,339
Well, I'm making my night
sky marzipan.

323
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,699
My great hero in music is Mozart.

324
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,499
His opera The Magic Flute - it's
all about the forces of darkness

325
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,259
and the forces of enlightenment,

326
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,979
so the outside of the cake is
the night sky which represents

327
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,859
the forces of darkness,
and then inside

328
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,819
is the temple of enlightenment.

329
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,779
This sounds genius.

330
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:47,179
How are you going to represent
a temple inside a Battenberg?

331
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,020
With a very complicated
lot of cutting.

332
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,659
Rowan is a music teacher, and lives
in Pershore, Worcestershire,

333
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,379
with his partner Paul.

334
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,699
Beneath his marzipan night sky,

335
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,739
his temple will be built from 13
separate sections of sponge.

336
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,099
And have you done this before,
Rowan? Yes.

337
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,979
And did it work? Yes.
NOEL LAUGHS

338
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,339
And if you thought a marzipan
night sky

339
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,819
and Battenberg temple
were unusual...

340
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,780
My Battenberg is going to be
shaped as an ambulance.

341
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,419
Linda works in supported housing

342
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,259
and lives in Bexhill-on-Sea with
her partner Richard.

343
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,979
Oh, that's lovely.

344
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,099
Her Battenberg ambulance will be
dedicated to a very special

345
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,739
family member.

346
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,659
It's going to be a tribute to
my cousin.

347
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,579
He was a paramedic.
He sadly passed away.

348
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,419
He was a fantastic guy, so this
is a really special one.

349
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,860
It's going to make me cry, this one.

350
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,419
A classic marzipan is a carefully
kneaded mix of eggs,

351
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,100
sugar and ground almonds.

352
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,979
A traditional recipe that Mak has
decided to ignore.

353
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,499
I think I'm the only baker
doing pistachio.

354
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,339
I've always felt... Urgh,
a yuckiness about almond marzipan.

355
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,859
Mak is a management accountant for
a housing association

356
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,459
and keeps bees with his eldest son
Zafar on their allotment in Bolton.

357
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,139
Oh, this looks a bit full.

358
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,659
His pistachio marzipan will
wrap orange

359
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,299
and spiced stem ginger sponges.

360
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,019
And my kids, they're the same as me.

361
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,860
They don't really like almond
marzipan, so I thought, "Hey...

362
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,939
"..pistachios."

363
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:28,059
I'm measuring some orange liqueur
to a part of my marzipan.

364
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,699
Good boy, well done!

365
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,539
Hermine is a trainee accountant

366
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,059
and lives in west London with
her son Stephen.

367
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,499
Watch what you're doing.

368
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,259
In the marzipan for her chocolate

369
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,739
orange Battenberg,

370
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,619
orange liqueur won't be the only

371
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,339
surprising ingredient.

372
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,379
I'm making it with some marmalade.
Marmalade in the marzipan?

373
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,379
Yes, instead of eggs. Interesting.

374
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,299
I've never made a Battenberg before.

375
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,619
That's handy. You've practised
it, though?

376
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,019
I did, it's not my area of...

377
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,939
Expertise. Expertise. What is your
area of expertise?

378
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,259
More French patisserie.

379
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,059
We look forward to great
decoration on this, then. Hopefully!

380
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,420
THEY LAUGH

381
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,339
Bakers, you've only got half
an hour left.

382
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,579
We don't mean half an hour to live,
we just mean half an hour

383
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,139
until the end of the challenge,
so don't panic too much.

384
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,940
One of you has got half an hour
to live.

385
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,099
A Battenberg must have a sharp
symmetrical design... Voila.

386
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,659
..which can only be achieved with
patient and precise cutting.

387
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,899
Lovely. A crispy cake. We'll cut
it off,

388
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,059
we'll cut it off. No-one saw.
Apart from the cameras.

389
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,699
Just measuring it with a ruler
and going with the flow.

390
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,059
MARK: It's all about precision,
this one.

391
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,539
If you get the measurements wrong,
when you put them together,

392
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,859
they might be oddly out of shape
and the Battenberg

393
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,899
wouldn't sit right.

394
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,099
OK. But to erect his temple...

395
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,059
3.3.

396
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,499
..Rowan has more cutting to do
than anyone else.

397
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,139
Here we go.

398
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,459
I've made this box out of...

399
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,859
..a CD storage thing with various
cuts, but slots in at different

400
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,419
levels to give me the right-sized
bits of cakes.

401
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,699
There are 13 different pieces,

402
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,539
so hopefully it will work.

403
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,379
So warm.

404
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,660
But Lottie isn't ready to
begin cutting...

405
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,219
Making the marzipan, it's not
a skill I need,

406
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,579
I don't think really,
moving forward.

407
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,579
..and now she's not
the only baker...

408
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,219
I'm praying that it cools down.

409
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,459
..fretting about time.
Oh, I'm really worried at this.

410
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,980
That's not cooked enough. How long
have we got left? 24 minutes.

411
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,299
Oh, for goodness' sake.

412
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,660
The largest sponges for Rowan's
temple are raw in the middle.

413
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,259
I think I'm going to put a cake in
the microwave.

414
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,819
Cos they're cooked in the middle.

415
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,859
Try and cook the centre that way.
Is this just going to be a disaster?

416
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,859
We've got to roll out
the meringue... Uh, the marzipan.

417
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,259
That goes to show how much
I like that.

418
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,059
Rolled too thick and the marzipan
will overwhelm

419
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,859
the flavours of the bakers' cakes
and fillings...

420
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,379
Oh, please taste nice!

421
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,899
..but too thin and it will crack as
they wrap

422
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,459
it around their Battenberg.

423
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,819
I've added a little bit of rose
water in there.

424
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,379
Rolling out balls of chocolate
marzipan, and that's going to make

425
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,939
a sort of polka-dot effect on
the outside of the cake.

426
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,379
Bakers, you have 15 minutes.

427
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,939
Moment of truth.

428
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,059
Just spreading on some buttercream.

429
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,819
Whilst the delicate process of
construction can begin for some...

430
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,499
The aim is to get the edges sharp.

431
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,060
I think they're going to be
looking for a clean cross section.

432
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,979
No pressure.

433
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,899
I don't think it's great. I might
have to simplify my design.

434
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,380
The temple might have to go!

435
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,659
..as Rowan's plans get less
ambitious... OK, what am I doing?

436
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,139
..despite being behind,
Lottie's rhubarb

437
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,539
and custard Battenberg seems to be
getting more and more complicated.

438
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,139
Everything that is so easy at home
suddenly becomes an absolute

439
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,099
nightmare when you're in the tent.

440
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,699
How many minutes?

441
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,139
Seven! Seven!

442
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,380
God! Right, here goes nothing.

443
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,979
Paul and Prue are expecting
a flawless wrapping of marzipan.

444
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,659
The marzipan is going to
join at the bottom,

445
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,140
so the seam of the marzipan
shouldn't be visible.

446
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,339
Maybe just a more blocky shape.

447
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,740
Ooh! I'm really sticky.

448
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,580
It's cracking in some areas.

449
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,539
How long?

450
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,980
Must be three minutes now.
Come on, come on!

451
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,140
Can't complain.

452
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,339
Hey, Lottie. Is this a critical
moment? Yeah, it is, yeah.

453
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,059
Thanks for coming round, Noel. Yes.

454
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,579
Why did I put a really intricate
design with minutes to spare? Yeah.

455
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,339
Looks good, though. Thank you.

456
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,699
You're going to wrap this around
that when that's done?

457
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,900
You're nailing this.

458
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,260
One minute remaining.

459
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,699
Maybe take the clingfilm off.
A bit of stardust on there.

460
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,180
Bakers, your time is up!

461
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,659
I'm not displeased with
that, actually.

462
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,100
We don't have to wash up. Oh, yeah!

463
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:26,619
Go on, your turn.

464
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,499
Go on, your turn.
The bakers will now face Prue
and Paul for the very first time.

465
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,740
Hi, Peter. Hello. Hi, Peter.

466
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,659
I like the overall look of it.

467
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,899
It's very neat.

468
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,340
I love the polka-dots.

469
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,779
Love the texture
of the chocolate one.

470
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,899
It's both crumbly and moist,
which is quite difficult to get.

471
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,499
Nice, thin marzipan.

472
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,099
The chocolate's got a lovely
flavour to it, decadent.

473
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,459
And, actually,
it's the same with the orange.

474
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,819
Gluten-free flour for sponges
really does work.

475
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,619
That's a great Battenberg.
It is delicious.

476
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,220
Well done, Peter. Thank you so much.
Well done.

477
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,420
It is very neat, isn't it?

478
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,379
Good orange flavour.

479
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,739
I just question the
ginger with the orange,

480
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,379
and then on the outside,
the pistachio.

481
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,939
It's too complicated.

482
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,060
The almond marzipan would have
been better than the pistachio.

483
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,779
That looks very striking.
The decoration's very neat.

484
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,459
The marmalade brings a real
bitterness to the marzipan.

485
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,819
It blends the orange
and the chocolate together

486
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,539
so it's never going to be too sweet.
It really is a pleasure to eat it.

487
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,740
Oh, that means a lot! Thank you.
You've done a good job.

488
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,499
The one thing I think you expect
from a Battenberg

489
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,139
is incredible neatness.

490
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,859
You've got no real distinction
in the colours of the sponge,

491
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,660
but your flowers look quite sweet.

492
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,539
I'm getting a plain sponge
and the raspberry. OK.

493
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,020
And that's pretty much it.

494
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,460
Really nice, square edges.

495
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,339
The coffee overpowers the chocolate.

496
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,699
It's delicious, actually.

497
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,259
You can't really get the booze.

498
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,699
It's a beautiful coffee
and vanilla Battenberg.

499
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,300
I think you explained it wrong.

500
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,379
It's lacking identity. Yeah.

501
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,379
It's just unfinished. Yes.

502
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,380
Oh, we have the St George flag.

503
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,579
It's over baked.
It's bone dry. Yeah.

504
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,899
I wish we could give you marks
for your handsome cousin.

505
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,100
Oh, he's lovely.

506
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,019
It's certainly striking.
I can smell the bubble gum!

507
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,619
I was about to say...
But that's a good thing. So can I!

508
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,059
That's a good thing!

509
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,859
I'm almost rolling it around my
mouth to try and blow a bubble!

510
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,099
I reckon if I did long enough,
I probably could. That's bone dry.

511
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,579
The flavours are intense.

512
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,499
You know, I love bubble gum,
I like cream soda,

513
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,819
it's just that you needed to be
a little bit less heavy.

514
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,779
And it's really thick, the marzipan.

515
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,099
I do rather like it, I have to say.

516
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,019
When I have my ninth birthday party,
can you cook for me, please?

517
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,140
I will try not to over bake
the sponges, so we've got a deal!

518
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,699
It's a nice, light sponge. It is
a little thick, but I like marzipan.

519
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,059
Pomegranates don't do anything,
flavour-wise.

520
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,019
There's pistachio in
the green sponge

521
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,020
and that brings a lovely
texture to it. Thank you.

522
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,739
If Fanny Cradock was going to do
a Battenberg,

523
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,299
that would be it!

524
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,620
Is that a compliment? Yeah, no...
I think it's a bit too busy.

525
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,539
Good, strong, sour cherry.
Fantastic, that's good. Lovely.

526
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,820
There's too much rose water.
Right, OK.

527
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,939
Shall I open it for you?
Yeah, please, yeah.

528
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,619
I like it wrapped up like a sweetie!

529
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,099
Oh, I love your stripes.
The starburst... Yeah.

530
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,739
..it's a little bit messy.

531
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,899
Was it warm when you were doing it
and it was melting? Yeah.

532
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,260
The colours are really wonderful.

533
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,579
I like the cake.

534
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,980
They both taste the same,
is that meant to? Yes...

535
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,579
The yellow is supposed to be
a custard.

536
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,099
They both taste delicious,
and the same.

537
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,019
The rhubarb jam that you've made
is nice and strong.

538
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,699
And there's enough acidity in it
to cut the sweetness.

539
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,739
It's a really good effort. I'm
struggling not to eat a bit more!

540
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,379
I might just... Do you want to...?
Yeah, I might just stay here and eat

541
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,220
while they... You're more than
welcome! ..they judge everyone else.

542
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,459
I had to change the design
at the very last minute.

543
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,859
So no temple, then.

544
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,699
It's a deconstructed temple.

545
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,379
I think the night sky
looks quite effective. Yes.

546
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,459
And actually, it's quite neat.

547
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,179
I can tell straight away,
by the way the knife goes through,

548
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,899
that that's quite a heavy sponge.

549
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,779
It's a bit hard work for cake. OK.

550
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,099
It feels like there's moisture
in there

551
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,580
that still needs to get out. OK.

552
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,379
That looks really pretty. Thank you.

553
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,699
I like the decoration.

554
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,099
I like the fact that you've glazed
it, as well... Thank you.

555
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,420
.cos that, again, sets it off.

556
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,419
All the flavours are there.

557
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,819
I think the texture is very good.
It's very neat, I like the marzipan.

558
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,299
Individual elements are good,
including the buttercream.

559
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,379
I think it's a lovely piece of cake.
Thank you so much.

560
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,819
What's the stalk made from?

561
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,139
You're not meant to eat that!
No, I know that now!

562
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,739
LAUGHTER

563
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,299
It's cloves. Cloves? So your
mouth's going to be numb, now.

564
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,739
Yeah, my mouth tastes of Christmas.
Yeah. Sorry.

565
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,099
No, it's fine, cos the cake was
delicious so I don't mind.

566
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,460
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thank you. Thanks.

567
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,859
Half of the Battenberg is on
the bottom of the oven.

568
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,339
Not great.

569
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,379
It's like toast, it's horrible.

570
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,099
But it turned out OK.

571
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,419
Yay!

572
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,939
That couldn't have gone much better,
I don't think.

573
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,339
I'm really pretty amped about that,
yeah.

574
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,739
Oh... Breathe.

575
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,859
I was aiming for middle-of-the-road,
and I think that's what I got.

576
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,619
Don't want to make a name
for myself, first bake.

577
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,940
It wasn't a resounding success,
but I thought it was useful.

578
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,619
NOEL: Each week, the Bakers'
second challenge

579
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,500
will be a gingham covered mystery.

580
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,739
It's time for your first
Technical Challenge,

581
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,579
which comes courtesy
of Paul Hollywood.

582
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,419
# Hurray, Paul Hollywood! #

583
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,499
So, Paul, any words of wisdom?

584
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,099
This is a classic.

585
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,699
We're testing you on your timings
and your consistency,

586
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,739
so read your recipes carefully.

587
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,459
Very helpful. Basically,
"Read your recipes."

588
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,979
As ever, this Technical Challenge
will be judged blind,

589
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,499
so we're going to have to ask these
two lovelies to beat it.

590
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,820
Off you pop.

591
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,379
Paul Hollywood would like you
to make

592
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,739
six miniature
pineapple upside down cakes.

593
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,659
Each should be topped with
a fresh pineapple ring

594
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,219
and soaked in caramel syrup.

595
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,539
You have 90 minutes.
On your marks...

596
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,140
Get set... Bake!

597
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,899
I absolutely love
pineapple upside down cake.

598
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,059
My dad and my husband love it.
So I've made it a few times.

599
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,179
I think I've made pineapple
upside down cake in school.

600
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,659
In each Technical Challenge,

601
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,979
the bakers are given
identical ingredients

602
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,299
and the same pared down recipe.

603
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,899
I've actually never made this
before, funnily enough.

604
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,219
I've never even tried one.

605
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,539
I've heard of pineapple
upside down cake.

606
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,060
I've not eaten one, I don't think.

607
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,619
This is a classic bake.

608
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,979
Pineapple upside down cake
is something I used to have

609
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,739
with school dinners,
many, many, moons ago.

610
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,099
It does look lovely.
Shall we taste it?

611
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,459
It's light, buttery, but also,
you have the perfect caramel.

612
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,099
If it goes too dark,
it's too bitter.

613
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,579
But if you can't see the caramel,

614
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,019
you're not going to be able to
get that caramel flavour.

615
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,339
And also, the worst thing
is ripping the sponge

616
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,859
when they're trying to get it out.

617
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,579
Getting it out of the tin is
where most people come unstuck,

618
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,259
because the caramel sticks to the
edge and it's really difficult.

619
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,859
Going to be interesting, then.

620
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,299
I don't want to eat all this,
cos then I've got 12 to come.

621
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,819
I can't resist it.

622
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,020
Ditto.

623
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,859
The first step is, for the syrup,

624
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,179
tip 30 g of caster sugar
into a pan...

625
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,459
And add two tablespoons of water.

626
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,819
Place over a low heat and stir
until the sugar dissolves.

627
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,779
Increase the heat
and cook to a golden caramel.

628
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,099
The caramel can crystallise very
quickly.

629
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,499
I'm trying not to stir it,

630
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,379
but equally, I need it to hurry up
because I don't have all day.

631
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,179
I've not made many caramels, so...

632
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,779
..slightly nervous.

633
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,259
So how's it going?

634
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,419
It's a case of multitasking
and keeping my eyes on the syrup.

635
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,619
If you pull this off...
I might just make it to next week!

636
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,419
The dry blue cake might
become a distant memory!

637
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,859
No, I think that one will
be haunting me for a while.

638
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,379
Remove from the heat and carefully
pour in the boiling water.

639
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,300
Stand back, as the caramel
will spit a bit.

640
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,019
And then I'll reduce that
and simmer it

641
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,619
until it is a syrup consistency.

642
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,020
You need to hurry up.

643
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,739
I'm fairly happy.

644
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,219
It's looking a bit blonde,

645
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,979
so I need to take the syrup
that little bit further.

646
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,579
It's kind of getting close. I'm
going to turn it down a little bit.

647
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,059
It looks like it could burn me.

648
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,419
It might be a bit too dark,
I'm not sure.

649
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,260
It did smell like it was
just about to burn, but...

650
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,859
..happy with it.

651
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,619
Now I'm on to the very instructional
stage of "Make the sponge."

652
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,499
So that's butter and sugar,

653
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,219
and you beat it until it's light.

654
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,699
And the eggs.

655
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,099
Add a little bit of flour as you go,

656
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,619
because it can just curdle
a little bit.

657
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,579
I'm going to try
and not have a dry sponge.

658
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,299
Prepare the moulds.
Prepare the moulds.

659
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,819
So I've just lined them with butter,

660
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,299
just make to sure
I can get them out.

661
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,739
Divide the syrup
and place the pineapple ring

662
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,859
and a maraschino cherry
into each mould.

663
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,779
So, syrup in first...
And then the pineapple.

664
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,019
I'm not quite sure what quantity
I'm supposed to put in, though.

665
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,499
The level of syrup has to be
precise.

666
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,780
I don't know
if that can go on there.

667
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,979
WHISPERS: That can't go on there.

668
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,379
Too little, and the cake won't
have the decadent caramel flavour

669
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,939
that Paul has demanded.

670
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,339
Try and get them all even.

671
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,579
But too much, and the liquid will
prevent the sponge from rising.

672
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,099
Whoa.

673
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,419
Possibly too much caramel.

674
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,739
Haven't read things very well,
have I?

675
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,339
Might have gone over a little bit.

676
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,859
Yikes.

677
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,379
So I'll need to weigh to make sure

678
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,099
that I've got equal amounts
of batter.

679
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,019
Can't be doing with the fiddling.

680
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,699
So you'd rather make one, big,
massive one? A massive tray bake,

681
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,339
to feed people. Like, a huge
one we could all sit round? Yeah.

682
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,899
Like a table. Just tear chunks off.
Exactly.

683
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,139
Like sort of wild... animals.
Animals. Yeah.

684
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,499
So I'm using a piping bag,

685
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,579
cos it's just a wee bit faster
and cleaner, hopefully.

686
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,059
Get ready to go into the oven.

687
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,579
So in it goes.

688
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,459
NOEL: 45 minutes remaining.

689
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,819
How long do they go into the oven
for? You just watch it.

690
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,619
This is where I'm guessing.
I don't know.

691
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,900
No. Well, don't look at me.
I haven't got a clue!

692
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,059
OK.

693
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,339
OK.

694
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,979
I'm going to start with ten,
give them a wee check.

695
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,620
Like, 15 minutes?

696
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,420
I made a rookie error.
Didn't butter the moulds.

697
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,139
They're more than likely
going to stick.

698
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,740
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes left.

699
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,019
They smell cooked.

700
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,459
Well, I think they're cooked,

701
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,139
but they're not up
where they should be.

702
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,499
Yeah, far as I can tell,
that's good.

703
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,099
They smell about right.

704
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,379
They look good. Look at those!

705
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,139
You've got skills! I hope so.

706
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,499
I wasn't sure, earlier.
SHE LAUGHS

707
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,379
I'm joking. What do you want me
to do with that?

708
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,099
No, I'm going to... No, I'm going
to take... You can't, it's hot.

709
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,619
Just throw it behind you, like that!

710
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,579
Just throw it,
someone will deal with it.

711
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,700
You don't have to deal with that.
No. You're a baking superstar.

712
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,739
Well, they just sunk,
so they've not worked.

713
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,219
Oh, gosh. They're like toffee.

714
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,659
It's too much syrup,
that's what it was.

715
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,259
Shall I do that thing
that people do on Bake Off?

716
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,099
Just do this for a little while.

717
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,179
Does this work?
Do you think this works?

718
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,979
Give it a waft.

719
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,819
A bit of waftage.

720
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,299
How long left?

721
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,939
Bakers... You... have... five...
Minutes... Left.

722
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,940
Still quite warm. Oh, dear.

723
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,620
Yeah, I think
I should turn them out.

724
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,940
Moment of truth.

725
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,499
That's one that's good,

726
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,579
but the pineapple didn't come out,
so we're on a rescue mission.

727
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,100
Oh... Oh!

728
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,580
That's better.

729
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,779
SHE LAUGHS

730
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,060
They're not even going to come out,
I don't think.

731
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,379
Better than it might have been,
put it that way.

732
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,699
It would have been nice to have
nice, clean sides,

733
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,659
but I didn't grease my moulds.

734
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:44,539
They would have been even if
I'd managed to carve it out nicer.

735
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,859
I could just shape that like that.

736
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,179
Oh, they are a disaster,
aren't they?

737
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,779
Bakers, you have one minute now.

738
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,219
Going to pipe the rosettes on,
and I think they're good.

739
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,179
Put a bit of cream
and a cherry on top.

740
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,820
I don't think they'll be
cool enough.

741
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,259
It's too hot.

742
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,060
Oh, that one was not ready.

743
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,020
The cream's starting to fall off.

744
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,140
Bakers, your time is up.

745
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,979
Oh, my cream just fell off.

746
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,979
Please place your pineapple
upside down cakes

747
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,219
on the gingham cloth
in front of your pictures.

748
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,499
What a hideous cake.

749
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,220
Oh, think I deserve a cherry.

750
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,500
Look at this. Oh, no!

751
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,139
Go away...!

752
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,019
Oh!

753
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,460
No!

754
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,740
I'm so sorry.

755
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,780
Oh, my God.

756
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:51,340
Whoa...

757
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,739
I'm so sorry. There was a fly.

758
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,059
I went to blow it away
and I knocked it. Look.

759
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,539
Don't worry about it. It's fine.
I'm so sorry.

760
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,379
I'm sure they can go by
what they looked like

761
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,739
before I brought them over.

762
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,059
Let's just tidy it up.

763
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,419
The good news is, the front two are
absolutely fine,

764
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,819
and we'll tell Paul what happened.

765
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,139
Oh, don't cry, it's all right.

766
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,699
It's OK. It's such a problem to
happen to someone.

767
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,059
Yeah, I know. You know what?
He's OK.

768
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,859
Total accident, isn't it?
It happened. Accidents happen.

769
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,499
I blame Matt, really.

770
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,579
It was actually my fault

771
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,499
because I was looking at you
at the time it happened.

772
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,059
And I think you were probably
hypnotised by my beauty.

773
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,379
THEY LAUGH

774
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,299
Maybe.
I think this is what happened.

775
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,259
Paul and Prue are expecting

776
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,299
six identical pineapple
upside down cakes,

777
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,579
topped with caramel,
cream and crowned with a cherry.

778
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,419
And they'll have no idea
whose is whose.

779
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,699
Oh.

780
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,099
Shall we start over here, Prue?

781
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,859
It's got a nice height to it,
hasn't it?

782
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,419
And it's about the right colour.

783
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,739
I think the cream was going on
when they were still hot.

784
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,060
Let's have a look.

785
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,379
Nice and light. Very light.
Well balanced.

786
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,699
Again, it's the heat, you can
see where the cream has melted

787
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,900
and it's slid off the top.

788
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,979
Good flavour, that cake.
It just doesn't look great.

789
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,379
These do look neat.

790
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,500
Colour's good and it's pretty
uniform as well across all six.

791
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,299
The balance between the sponge,
the cream... It's good, isn't it?

792
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,739
..and the syrup together,
the balance is good. It's lovely.

793
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,179
Moving on to number four.

794
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,539
Again, problems with the heat.

795
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,499
Coming out of the tin,
just needs to be higher,

796
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,899
just a little bit more open.

797
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,499
It's a bit doughy.

798
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,939
Now, these look quite neat,
the cherry sits well on the top.

799
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,220
Nice colour.
And they are pretty uniform.

800
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,019
Lovely cake. It is a nice cake.

801
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,580
Moving on, now,
looks quite dark in places.

802
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,979
That caramel is a bit dominant.

803
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,939
Because it's a little darker.

804
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,659
This, on the other hand,
is a bit too pale. It is pale.

805
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,019
They were rushing.
They brought it out too early.

806
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,299
Put the cream on
when it was piping hot

807
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,939
and then just poured off the side.

808
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,220
It does not look a pretty thing.
It doesn't.

809
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,019
I think, if you get it
a little browner,

810
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,979
it takes away from some
of the sweetness

811
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,339
because the caramel has that tiny
little bit of bitterness. Anyway...

812
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,659
We are going from pale to very dark.

813
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,019
Now, this one has got an issue with
the sticking in the tin,

814
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,980
but also, that's too dark, really.
Yeah, it's a bit too dark.

815
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,099
It's quite bitter. Mm. And there's
a lot of caramel. It's burnt.

816
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,539
And then we move on to one that's
probably just in the middle.

817
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,059
And looks really nice.

818
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,899
I mean, the piping is good,
the caramel colour is good,

819
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,499
they are even, they're all risen.

820
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,619
The caramel is just the right level
so it brings in the colour,

821
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,419
the flavour.
I've no problem with that at all.

822
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,179
Moving on to this one.

823
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,219
The piping is very good.
The piping is excellent.

824
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,500
It has been put on
when it is relatively cool.

825
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,299
It's well-balanced, that.
We have some caramel... It's lovely.

826
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,819
It's almost toffee-like. Mm.

827
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,179
And it balances beautifully
with the sponge.

828
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,099
Now, we move from the sublime
to number 11.

829
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,659
Issues bringing it out,
issues with the sponge...

830
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,259
Didn't rise enough in the first
place. Getting it out of the tin.

831
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,859
Too hot when the cream went on.
Too hot when the cream went on.

832
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,819
What has happened to this? I don't
think it's properly cooked, is it?

833
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,379
It looks like it's been pushed
together into the tin.

834
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,019
Now, moving onto the last one,

835
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,659
now, we heard there was an issue
with this one where it was dropped.

836
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,499
This one, being the neatest one,

837
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,859
we'll take that
as a template for the rest.

838
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,379
They look quite dark down the side
there. Almost burnt.

839
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,739
And that's not
because it was dropped on the floor.

840
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,739
That's because it's been over
caramelised. No.

841
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,419
They've got a nice height to them,
though.

842
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,019
Mm. Delicious.

843
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,779
Paul and Prue will now rank
the cakes from worst to best.

844
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,099
In 12th place is this one.

845
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,259
Oh, Linda. Well, you know what?

846
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,419
There is only one way now is
up from here, isn't it?

847
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,859
11th spot is this one. Very bitter.

848
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,779
The caramel had gone way
over the top.

849
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,139
You had a bit of a problem
with it sticking.

850
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,499
And then, number ten,
is this one. Loriea.

851
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,260
This is the opposite of that one.
It's just a little too pale.

852
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,419
Dave is ninth, Mak, eighth,
Marc is seventh,

853
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,779
Laura sixth, Hermine is fifth
and Lottie is fourth.

854
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,099
In third spot, we have this one.

855
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,379
Good consistency across the board
and the sponge was very, very good.

856
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,020
And then, in second place...

857
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:19,139
..we have this one. Who is that?
Peter. It is pretty well faultless.

858
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,859
But a smidgen below the winner.

859
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,859
Which leaves first place. Well done,
Sura. They are very, very good.

860
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,219
The pipework was beautiful
and smooth.

861
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,859
The sponge, the caramel,
well done.

862
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,740
APPLAUSE

863
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:40,259
It was bittersweet because I feel
so sad for Dave.

864
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,140
Pete did really well.

865
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,099
I wish it didn't happen,
to be honest.

866
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,819
It was a bit of a crackerjack
of a day, I think, yeah.

867
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,779
I'm pretty pleased.

868
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,819
Don't like making big mistakes.
And that was a big mistake.

869
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,619
They asked for a pineapple
upside down cake

870
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,780
and I give them a pineapple fritter,
didn't I, really?

871
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,020
There's just one
cake challenge remaining

872
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:10,939
before we crown
this year's first Star Baker

873
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,339
and reveal who will
be leaving the tent.

874
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,259
So, Bake Off's got a new home.

875
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,979
We're filming in a bubble.

876
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,699
I tell you what, I'm quite
anxious about being locked up

877
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,299
for weeks on end with you three guys

878
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,619
and there's not a grown-up
among you.

879
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,620
HE LAUGHS

880
00:41:25,621 --> 00:41:28,219
No. I was really looking forward
to spending time with you, Prue.

881
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,499
You really were? Yeah.

882
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,659
I love how you two pretend we don't
all live together in real life.

883
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,179
THEY LAUGH

884
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,539
You've got some real
talent in the tent.

885
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,459
Sura was a deserved winner
in the Technical. You've got Pete.

886
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,939
Hermine, I think she's in line for
Star Baker as well.

887
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,899
So, who do think is in the bottom?

888
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,499
I think Loriea,
she had that bubble gum idea.

889
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,979
I think Marc E and certainly Linda,

890
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,459
but there's a lot in the middle
that could go either way.

891
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,059
It's very tough, isn't it?

892
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,419
Somebody's on through lockdown,
and they've come here

893
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,379
and they've quarantined and they're

894
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,299
just in the competition
for two days.

895
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,819
I think that's always the worst

896
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,179
is to go home right at the
beginning. First.

897
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,779
We'll have one big camera
and they'll just walk off into the

898
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,419
distance, socially distancing with
that music from the Hulk at the end.

899
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,700
Yeah.
THEY HUM TUNE

900
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,659
Bakers, welcome back,

901
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,299
and I hope you're ready for your
very first Showstopper Challenge.

902
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,619
Paul and Prue would like you
to make a cake bust

903
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,579
depicting your personal celebrity
hero.

904
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,539
Your 3D cake bust must have a head
and it must be made...

905
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,699
THEY LAUGH

906
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,499
..and it must be made
mainly from cake.

907
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,819
Although you can use some other
edible details.

908
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,099
OK, you've got four hours.

909
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,540
On your marks. Get set. Bake.

910
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,539
Right, let's go.
SHE SIGHS

911
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,379
OK. Roll my sleeves up.

912
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,419
I am petrified
about this Showstopper.

913
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,979
It's just
got so many things happening.

914
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,939
It's given me quite a few
sleepless nights, this one.

915
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:05,739
To make a cake bust head
and shoulders of a person,

916
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,659
we're asking them to be engineers,
decorators, and bakers.

917
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,299
The big risk with a challenge
like this is ending up with too

918
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,139
much icing, too much buttercream,
which will be too heavy,

919
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,459
make it too sweet,

920
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,819
even if
it makes it look fantastic.

921
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,179
For me, the secret with this
challenge is

922
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,139
which structure they're going
to use to put the cake onto.

923
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,939
If they don't have a decent
structure or

924
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,780
they don't bake the sponges
correctly, it will collapse.

925
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,739
Hello. Hi, Prue. Hello. Hi, Matt.

926
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,259
Tell us all about your bust.
What you going to be doing?

927
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,459
OK, I'm doing David Bowie
as Ziggy stardust. Perfect.

928
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,979
Ziggy Stardust is going to be
instantly recognisable

929
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,779
just because of the colours. Yeah.

930
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,499
A fondant lightning strike
will decorate Marc's chocolate

931
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,939
sponge and vanilla
buttercream reimagining

932
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,699
of the Thin White Duke.

933
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,059
One of the most wonderful
things about David Bowie

934
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:56,459
is the shape of his face
is so beautiful and so...

935
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,899
It's quite slender.

936
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,619
The first time I made him,
he looked more like Desperate Dan.

937
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,619
NOEL: And Bowie will be joined
on stage by another musical legend.

938
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,979
My hero is Bob Marley.

939
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,579
I just love his ethos
not to worry about stuff.

940
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,019
I've been singing it all morning.

941
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,419
# Don't worry about a thing... #

942
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,459
SHE LAUGHS

943
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,059
MATT: After a difficult first day,

944
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,539
Linda's hoping her lemon
and orange sponge Bob

945
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,459
will be her redemption song,

946
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,219
filled with lemon and orange curds,

947
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,699
and a coconut rum mascarpone cream.

948
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,539
Is the alcohol there for Prue?
HE LAUGHS

949
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,899
Well, I thought it might
cheer Paul up.

950
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,859
HE LAUGHS
Nothing cheers Paul up.

951
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,539
How much booze you got in there?
A couple of bottles?

952
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,019
A bottle and a half. Have you?
SHE LAUGHS

953
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,499
No!

954
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,699
And if that doesn't get
the backstage party started.

955
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,979
Ay-oh!

956
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,979
Ay-oh!

957
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,259
I love Freddie Mercury.

958
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,139
You're a big Queen fan, yeah? Yeah.

959
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,579
NOEL: Laura's lemon and elderflower
Freddie Mercury

960
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:57,939
will take to the stage in a highly
detailed fondant icing replica

961
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,539
of his iconic yellow jacket.

962
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,259
So, you've practised this cake.

963
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,779
The last time I did it, they head
exploded and it went in the bin.

964
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,819
Right. Yeah. Cut.

965
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,339
SHE SNEEZES

966
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,379
Bless you. Too much chilli.

967
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,059
Hello, Loriea. Right, Loriea.

968
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,939
Who are you going to be
doing for your bust?

969
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,979
I will be doing
Miss Louise Bennett-Coverley.

970
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,339
She's a Jamaican poet and she's got
a poem about identity.

971
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,779
And I've got a mismatch of accents,

972
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,779
which I think works well for this.

973
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:29,299
Loriea will celebrate
her Durham and Jamaican roots

974
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,739
with a chocolate sponge
with scotch bonnet chilli

975
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,419
and spiced ginger and mango jam.

976
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:38,059
I have practised this multiple
times.

977
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,459
And I think my first attempt,
it looked like I created Dobby,

978
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:45,219
so you will get, hopefully, a better
version of something like that.

979
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,899
Hi. Hello.
I hear you're doing David. Yeah.

980
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,699
Is that because you pushed his cakes
over?

981
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,539
No! No! No. Sorry, I got mixed up.

982
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,859
Who are you doing?
Sir David Attenborough.

983
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,099
What a ledge. He is a ledge.

984
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,019
Do you love him? I love him so much.

985
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,179
Have you ever met him?
No. Of course I'm not met him.

986
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,539
He's coming today.
Of course he's not.

987
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,939
I texted him. Oh, sure.
I said, "Sura needs you."

988
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,339
I do need him. I need a life model.

989
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,699
MATT: Sir David will
be flavoured with coconut

990
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,139
and layered with raspberry
Italian meringue buttercream.

991
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,779
People won't mind
if you get it wrong,

992
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,739
but the animal kingdom
will be furious.

993
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,179
Well, we can't have that.

994
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,539
There'll be voles, gerbils...

995
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:25,539
Coming for me!
..marmosets coming for you.

996
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,499
The odd pigeon.
SHE LAUGHS

997
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,939
Good luck! Stop it.

998
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,819
MATT: But Sura's Sir David
will have a rival.

999
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,299
I'm doing a cake bust
of Charles Darwin.

1000
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,379
Uh-huh.

1001
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,019
I studied zoology at university
and I thought the Bake Off tent

1002
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,859
is a little bit like the survival
of the fittest, so... True!

1003
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,179
THEY LAUGH

1004
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,299
Mark will carve a spiced ginger
sponge with coconut buttercream

1005
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,579
into a simple stone-style bust

1006
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,419
of the pioneering naturalist.

1007
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,979
I'm not a really decorative baker.

1008
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,659
I also quite like the idea
of doing someone who is not alive

1009
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,099
so I can't offend them.
HE LAUGHS

1010
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,859
Whilst Lottie's chosen hero
is very much alive,

1011
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:04,219
it doesn't look like it
at the moment.

1012
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,539
I have a skull mould which I'm going
to just build on top of,

1013
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,019
because that's what's underneath
someone's head, right?

1014
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,339
Lottie's coconut and lime skull

1015
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,499
will be transformed into
a spectacled bust of Louis Theroux.

1016
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,259
You know he was on Bake Off last
year? I do, yeah.

1017
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,619
So, actually,
with Louis having been on the show,

1018
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,619
you two guys will know how
he tastes. Yeah, yeah.

1019
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,939
He tastes a little bit coconut-y,
doesn't he?

1020
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,339
I think it sounds delicious.

1021
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,299
Thank you. I hope so.

1022
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,899
# Please cook and be nice,
and don't BLEEP. #

1023
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,619
Building a bust out of cake
and several sponges...

1024
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,499
More sponges than a Turkish bath.

1025
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,819
..of varying sizes and shapes...

1026
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,179
They're in.

1027
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,939
..is creating a time management
nightmare for the bakers.

1028
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:46,699
I've got two timers on the go. One
for the oven and one for my task.

1029
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,619
It's very complicated, isn't it?

1030
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:51,819
But Rowan's hero demands something
even more elaborate

1031
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,339
than multiple sponges.

1032
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,179
I am making Queen Marie Antoinette.

1033
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,219
Oh. So there'll be a chocolate cake

1034
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,219
with kirsch-soaked cherries

1035
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:03,259
and then I'm making choux buns
to make Her Majesty's hairdo.

1036
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:06,419
Whilst her choux hairdo might
prove complicated,

1037
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,139
things should be simpler

1038
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,899
with Marie Antoinette's face.

1039
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,259
It's a good idea with the mask in
the silicon mould,

1040
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,859
because that'll give you an instant
image anyway... Yes, yes.

1041
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,539
so you've got something to work
from. I hope you do it justice.

1042
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:19,019
Absolutely. Thank you. Good luck.

1043
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,979
I'm just laughing to myself.
"You must be completely mad."

1044
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,659
HE CHUCKLES

1045
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,900
Massive dash against the clock.

1046
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,779
Completely bonkers.

1047
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,700
Who in their right mind...?

1048
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,499
Yeah, I don't know why.

1049
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,339
Bakers, you are halfway through.

1050
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,659
I just have so much to do

1051
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:45,619
and I'm just really aware of
so many different multiple elements.

1052
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:48,179
Next, I've got to make
coffee mascarpone cream

1053
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,819
to go between the slices.

1054
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,819
NOEL: As well as helping to
hold their busts together...

1055
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:56,499
So I'm going with raspberry
Italian meringue buttercream.

1056
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,099
..the bakers' fillings
are another chance to deliver

1057
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,539
show-stopping flavours.

1058
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:04,499
This is my lemon and elderflower
mascarpone cream filling.

1059
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,780
I'm not having him say that
my cake is bland today.

1060
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,299
This is ginger and mango jam.

1061
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:13,579
I'm using a lot of ginger.

1062
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,339
MATT: But Peter is taking
a more subtle approach.

1063
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,659
Between the cakes,

1064
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,019
I'm just going to have a nice,
simple strawberry jam,

1065
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,779
and some whipped double cream.

1066
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,259
It's a family favourite.

1067
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,659
The simple theme will continue
between Peter's Victoria sandwich

1068
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:29,779
rendition of his cycling hero,
Sir Chris Hoy,

1069
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,139
sporting fondant goggles and helmet.

1070
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,499
That's a clever way of
getting round doing hair.

1071
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,019
Precisely why I wanted to do it!
And also goggles.

1072
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,899
Yes, yes. So, no eyes.

1073
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:43,459
I'm not great at sculpture and art,
so I thought I'll go more simple,

1074
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,819
and try and get something that
presents well.

1075
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,139
Well, good luck, Peter.
Thanks very much.

1076
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,419
Right, are we ready?

1077
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,699
I think that is, like, just cooked.

1078
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,139
Yep.

1079
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,140
Sorted.

1080
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,939
Oh, he's got a lot of sponge. Mm?

1081
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,619
He's got a lot of sponge. I know.

1082
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,939
The sponges might be
out of the oven...

1083
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,179
This bit is so stressful.

1084
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,539
It's so hot.

1085
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,019
These are hot cakes.

1086
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,979
..but until they're
cool enough to carve...

1087
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,299
Pop them in the fridge, because
I can't do anything with that,

1088
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,579
because they are still very warm.

1089
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,499
..assembly will have to wait.

1090
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,819
Oh, no!

1091
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,099
I just lost a sponge.

1092
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,100
Ah, damn it.

1093
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,380
I just dropped a sponge.

1094
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,939
It's fixable, I think.

1095
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,939
I think I can use it for the top,
so it's all right.

1096
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,819
I think I'm doing OK for time.

1097
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,179
I'm just trying to roll out as much
fondant as I can

1098
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,739
before the cakes come out
of the freezer.

1099
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,819
Using fondant will allow the bakers
to craft the skin, hair

1100
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:41,219
and clothing that will hopefully
bring their heroes to life.

1101
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:44,780
So I'm making beads
for her necklace.

1102
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,419
Who's this? Prince Charles?

1103
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,779
No...
Shall I just keep guessing?

1104
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,539
It's meant to be Tom DeLonge.
Farrah Fawcett? Who? Tom DeLonge.

1105
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,819
Blink 182?

1106
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,179
Oh, I know who they are, yeah.

1107
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,179
Are you a fan of that type of music,
Noel?

1108
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,099
Er, yeah.

1109
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,100
No.

1110
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:06,099
Fondant ears and a highly
detailed fondant face and cap

1111
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,259
will cover a strawberry,
chocolate and mint homage

1112
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,219
to Dave's favourite punk icon.

1113
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,539
Do you know what music Matt likes?

1114
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:16,059
Well, when I first met Matt,
he was listening to Roger Whittaker.

1115
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,979
Mm-hm. Do you know him?
This is actually true.

1116
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,259
No, I don't know who he is.

1117
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,819
# I'm going to leave old Durham town

1118
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,099
NOEL LAUGHS

1119
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,539
# I'm going to leave old Durham town

1120
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:31,619
# And the leaving's
going to get me down. #

1121
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,219
You were trying to block that out
a bit, weren't you? Roger Whittaker.

1122
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,459
You were hoping that would end.

1123
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,739
# Back in 1944... #

1124
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,100
I don't really know who he is.

1125
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,659
I'm just using the pasta roller

1126
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,499
to roll my dress.

1127
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,979
Wow. I'm doing Lupita Nyong'o.

1128
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,259
She's a Hollywood actress. Yes.

1129
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,979
Black Panther. Yes.

1130
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,499
Very beautiful girl. She is.

1131
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,619
I hope, er, I could replicate that.

1132
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:59,099
Hermine is aiming to capture
Lupita's beauty by decorating

1133
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:02,379
her chocolate and coffee sponges
with fondant fabric

1134
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,779
and very lifelike facial features.

1135
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,659
I'm going to make ice mould eyes

1136
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,819
to give it real eye look.

1137
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,739
I hope it will look impressive.

1138
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:14,499
Also keen to do his hero justice...

1139
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,939
Two eyeballs.

1140
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,539
Some cheeky things.

1141
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,659
..is Mak.

1142
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,979
My hero is Bill Bryson.

1143
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,299
He's an author I've admired
for decades.

1144
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,619
I've been studying his face so much.

1145
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:29,059
Honestly, I just know every little
wrinkle, every nook and cranny.

1146
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,979
His lemon Madeira sponges
will form the base for his

1147
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:36,539
anatomically thought-out bust, and,
to recreate Bill's flowing locks,

1148
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,259
he has a special tool to hand.

1149
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,179
It's a press for making Bombay mix
and things like that,

1150
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,899
and basically what I'm trying to do
is just create strands of hair.

1151
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,259
Very nice.
Can you make me some, please?

1152
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,579
Well, just come over here,
and I'll just... Yeah.

1153
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,819
Yes, please. Yes. Thank you.

1154
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:53,459
But things aren't going quite so
well at Rowan's hair salon.

1155
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,419
No, come on, choux buns.

1156
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,939
Why?

1157
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,180
I'm hoping it will rise. We'll see.

1158
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,099
Bakers, you have one hour remaining.

1159
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,619
Oh!

1160
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,900
You haven't seen my rolling pin,
have you? No, not anywhere.

1161
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,299
I'm going for the assembly.

1162
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,619
I'm dreading this bit, actually,
because it's...

1163
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,219
..oh!

1164
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:18,499
With their sponges cooled,
the build can begin.

1165
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,059
I'm not running any risk of anything
slipping off the mat.

1166
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,419
I'm feeling a little bit nervous now
about time,

1167
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,779
cos these need to be, like,
really frozen,

1168
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,579
but I think they're cool enough
to carve.

1169
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,819
Here we go...

1170
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:33,179
Stacking layers of delicate sponge
and creamy fillings

1171
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,699
is a precarious task.

1172
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,019
It looks a bit like I'm performing
some awful medieval torture,

1173
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,819
but it is a necessity, and I'm sure
Louis would understand.

1174
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,459
Well, I've got some choux,
very flat choux,

1175
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,819
so it will be a matter of
whether it's worth using or not.

1176
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,459
I don't want to be criticised for
my choux when it's not necessary,

1177
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,779
so I'll just, I'll wing it,
as usual.

1178
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,779
As the busts get taller...

1179
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,699
The head's starting to droop
forward.

1180
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,779
..and heavier,

1181
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,659
the strain on the sponges...

1182
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,419
It's all kind of cracking.

1183
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,019
..starts to take its toll.

1184
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,299
This is going to collapse, I think.

1185
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,460
Oh, it's a wobble.

1186
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,819
No!

1187
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:10,900
Oh, this is stressful.

1188
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:16,179
Some of Freddie Mercury's head
is not there.

1189
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:19,259
That ain't meant to be happening,
is it?

1190
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,979
Oh, flipping heck!

1191
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:25,339
Bakers, you have 30 minutes left.

1192
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,259
It's surprising how the time
just flies, doesn't it?

1193
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,019
When you're having fun.

1194
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,499
Who just said they're having fun?

1195
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,219
OK, I'm just going to
have to go for it.

1196
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,579
God, have you ever been more
stressed in your life?

1197
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,219
Yeah, I've never been this stressed,
mate.

1198
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,939
As the fondant goes on...

1199
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,739
Speak to me, Mr Bryson.

1200
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:43,499
..engineering makes way
for artistry.

1201
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,859
To do this to your heroes
is fairly horrendous, isn't it?

1202
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:48,179
Mine doesn't look anything like him.
It's just scary.

1203
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,499
Just so stressful, Paul.

1204
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,459
Why on Earth did I get into this
competition, I don't know.

1205
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,899
You chose to come here.
I know I did!

1206
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,219
THEY LAUGH

1207
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,899
What the hell is that? This?
It's like a death mask!

1208
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,339
Who is it, the Grim Reaper?

1209
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:04,099
Erm, it's supposed to be
Louis Theroux.

1210
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,379
Rude!

1211
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:06,980
Rude. Have you ever seen
Louis Theroux?

1212
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,619
I have faith he's going to stand up.

1213
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:14,059
Oh, he's got the shortest
head in the world. Oh!

1214
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,539
Embarrassing.
Making boobs on national TV.

1215
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:21,100
I don't know if I've ever fancied a
cake before! But I slightly do now!

1216
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,859
We've decided to go for rice paper,

1217
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,219
given the disaster
with the choux buns,

1218
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,899
erm, this seems like
the best option.

1219
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,379
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

1220
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,619
It's just not enough.

1221
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,660
It's just all gone wrong.

1222
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,379
Kind of like a bandanna,
I'm trying to put on there,

1223
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,579
but it never seems to work
as well as I need it to.

1224
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,939
I'm just going to quickly
paint his little eyes in.

1225
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:51,299
Oh, man, he looks absolutely
knackered. Poor David.

1226
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,739
I like detail. It's calming.

1227
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,059
Time factor-wise,

1228
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:58,379
I think it's just going to have to
be kind of silhouette-y, really.

1229
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,979
I can't do it. You can.

1230
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,939
I can't do it. I can't put
the head on. What do you need?

1231
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,299
What do you need? I'll help you.

1232
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,979
I've got to put the head on
but I can't do it.

1233
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,259
I'm too scared.

1234
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,539
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1235
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,500
Do it! Oh...

1236
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:12,819
Oh, just put it on, put it on.

1237
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,859
Come on, Freddie,
please stay together.

1238
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,459
Oh, my God, Louis, please don't
hate me when you see this.

1239
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,179
Rowan, can I be of any assistance
for the last wee bit, or not?

1240
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,179
I think I'm kind of there,
actually, thank you.

1241
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,779
I'll just do a bit more
pinning of these things and then...

1242
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,619
Quick, quick, that just needs to
sit on top. It's not going on top.

1243
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,979
Oh! You've put the wrong bit in.

1244
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,979
I just need to get some glasses
on him.

1245
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,819
As long as that just holds up
for a little bit.

1246
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,380
Oh, no, Freddie!

1247
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,459
You've got to laugh,
he's got a bloody hunchback.

1248
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,819
Quick, quick, quick!
Quick, quick, quick! It's too big,

1249
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,100
it's too big, it's too big. This
bit, this bit, this bit. Go, go, go.

1250
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,099
OK, it's going to pierce through
his head a little bit. It's fine.

1251
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,219
I don't care.

1252
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,259
Bakers, your time is up.

1253
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,539
Thank you SO much for your help.

1254
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,299
Step away from your cake busts.

1255
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,740
Well, it wasn't quite what I had
planned, but you know, what is?

1256
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,220
I'm going home. No, you're not.
I am. I'm truly going home.

1257
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:08,019
That was hard. Tell me about it!

1258
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,339
Oh, my God, yours is about to
fall off! Oh!

1259
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,580
No! No!

1260
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,660
I've never run!

1261
00:57:16,385 --> 00:57:16,755
sponsors The Great British Bake Off.
CLATTERING

1262
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,179
Sura, get something flat.

1263
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,379
It's not in balance.

1264
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:26,899
It'll fall again.

1265
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,779
That's it. Something heavy.
Stand it up at the back.

1266
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,379
That's it.

1267
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,259
I had to put, like,
the piping bags behind them,

1268
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,619
so it looks like a travel cushion.

1269
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,379
It's all right. He said you can use
inedible supports.

1270
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,820
HE GIGGLES

1271
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,699
It's judgement time
for the 12 cake busts.

1272
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:49,820
Rowan, would you like to bring
up your Showstopper?

1273
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,059
The choux buns were a bit of
a disaster, so I had to improvise.

1274
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,579
There's a pattern forming here,

1275
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:03,099
because you promised us
almost the Parthenon yesterday

1276
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,219
we didn't get.

1277
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,539
You promised us choux buns
we haven't got. No.

1278
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,419
Say less and then do more. Yes.

1279
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,579
THEY LAUGH

1280
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,939
Having said that, you instantly
recognise who it is.

1281
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,299
I think it's absolutely brilliant.
Thank you.

1282
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,619
I just hope she tastes nice.
Well, so do I.

1283
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,899
Going to go through her cheek? Yeah.

1284
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,499
No!

1285
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,939
Oh, you brute.
HE LAUGHS

1286
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:27,500
It is a chocolate cake
with kirsch-soaked cherries.

1287
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,939
Mm. Cherry flavour's lovely.

1288
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,779
Would have been nice
to have the choux buns,

1289
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,099
but, overall, I think you've made
a very tasty cake.

1290
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,020
Thank you. Well done, Rowan.

1291
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:43,339
Well, I have to say, he is
recognisable. Definitely.

1292
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,659
Thank you.
That sort of slightly anxious look

1293
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,579
is very Louis Theroux.

1294
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:51,460
It is a coconut and lime sponge
with a chocolate orange buttercream.

1295
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,019
You get all the flavours.

1296
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:58,260
The orange, the lime, the coconut,
but it's over baked. It's bone dry.

1297
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,339
It's obviously Bill Bryson.

1298
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,979
I do think it's good,
I love the detail on it. Thank you.

1299
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,539
And what's inside it?

1300
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,100
It's a lemon madeira
with redcurrant jam.

1301
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,899
Lovely flavour. But it's very dry.

1302
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,340
And that's a real shame.

1303
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,019
I'd like to have seen a mouth on it,

1304
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,459
because obviously, you know,
Marley was known for his voice

1305
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,100
and he hasn't got a mouth.
THEY LAUGH

1306
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,819
I actually think it's delicious.
It is.

1307
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,419
Thank you. It's got all the elements
to a very, very good sponge.

1308
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,819
You can't go wrong with citrus
flavours with a lemon curd

1309
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:36,940
floating through it.

1310
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,339
It's very dramatic.

1311
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,859
He's got these wonderful
athlete's shoulders,

1312
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:47,699
he really looks as if he's puffing.

1313
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:48,979
And I love the helmet.

1314
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,939
It's clever and it's a good get out,

1315
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,579
because wearing a helmet and a mask,

1316
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,859
you know who it is.

1317
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:57,299
I mean, Sir Chris has got
many, many Olympic medals,

1318
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,059
and that's what he was wearing
when he did it. It's excellent.

1319
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,659
Let me just... Sorry, Chris.
I was quite worried about this,

1320
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:05,379
because I thought,
Victoria sandwich and fresh cream

1321
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:07,259
is all quite light and easily
squashed

1322
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,579
and you'd end up
with a sort of pudding inside.

1323
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,340
But you haven't. It looks lovely.

1324
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:15,259
The Italian meringue
buttercream is delicious.

1325
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:19,179
The strawberries, the cream,
the sponge is spot on.

1326
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:22,659
Mm. And it feels really fresh,
doesn't it? Light. It's delicious.

1327
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,459
The concept is great.
And it's witty.

1328
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,259
Well done, Peter. Well done, Peter.

1329
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:28,820
Thank you so much.

1330
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:33,139
Well, I think
it's like a caricature,

1331
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:34,899
so it's really good. Thank you.

1332
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,819
Would you like to tell us
what's inside it?

1333
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,900
Mint and strawberry
with a cocoa butter cream.

1334
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,859
A bit toothpaste-y.

1335
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:48,579
The mint is so strong
and it has that very chemical taste.

1336
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:50,139
It's a shame. Yeah.

1337
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:52,619
You let yourself down a little bit
on the texture and flavour.

1338
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,780
Yeah, OK.

1339
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,059
Erm...

1340
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:01,979
That's about as far away
from David Bowie as you could get.

1341
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,339
I'd agree with you, actually.
Yeah, he's lost his neck.

1342
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:07,259
Yeah, yeah. More Jabba the Hutt.
THEY LAUGH

1343
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,820
It's a chocolate sponge
with vanilla buttercream.

1344
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,179
It's quite dense.

1345
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,459
It's slightly overbaked. OK.

1346
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,739
But it's a great flavour.

1347
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,540
Good effort. All right, thank you.
Thank you.

1348
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:26,979
The fact that you've put "Guess who"

1349
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:29,939
on this makes me think that you
don't think that looks like her.

1350
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,099
That's right.

1351
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,259
Your work with the fondant
is absolutely exquisite.

1352
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,219
I actually thought it was real.
Thank you.

1353
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:38,739
So, let's hope it's as good
inside... I hope too.

1354
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,139
..as it is outside.

1355
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,059
Mm.

1356
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:43,339
It's really lovely.

1357
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,259
It's such a rich chocolate cake.

1358
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:46,499
It's delicious.

1359
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,380
Thank you. Yeah, I'd sit down,
have a slice of that any time.

1360
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,619
You can see who it is.
It looks great. Thank you.

1361
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:57,259
This is a ginger spiced sponge

1362
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:58,700
with a coconut buttercream.

1363
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,179
Lovely. Very good flavour.

1364
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:07,099
It's nice to see that you haven't
really overdone it with the spices.

1365
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,099
You've got spices in it,
you can identify them,

1366
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,019
but it marries up beautifully with
the ginger,

1367
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,380
and it's a well baked cake.
Well done. Thank you.

1368
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:20,659
We've got a picture of her in front
of us now. Headscarf, tick.

1369
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,979
Necklace, tick. Necklace, tick.

1370
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,299
Resemblance to her... Resemblance...
HE LAUGHS

1371
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,740
..does not exist. Not so much.

1372
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:30,699
It has got a chilli chocolate sponge

1373
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:33,059
flavoured with scotch bonnet
chilli powder

1374
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:35,300
and ginger and mango jam.

1375
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,859
The chilli's a little bit
overwhelming.

1376
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:42,379
I do agree that you could lower
the chilli a little.

1377
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:43,779
Wow.

1378
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,259
HE LAUGHS
It's coming in waves.

1379
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:49,659
But when you've got a wave of ginger
as well, it's really, really strong.

1380
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:53,179
Now, this is lining up with what
happened yesterday as well.

1381
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:54,899
Consistency is the word. There is...

1382
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,220
You are consistent, absolutely.

1383
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,419
He's a reclining...

1384
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,139
He's having a nap.

1385
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:08,859
HE LAUGHS

1386
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:11,459
Very neat on the shirt,
very neat on the face.

1387
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,899
And you can see who it is.

1388
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,459
Right, let's have a look, shall we?

1389
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,739
Gosh, that looks really tender.

1390
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:19,259
It is a coconut sponge

1391
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:22,020
with a raspberry Italian
meringue buttercream.

1392
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,979
I like the flavour.

1393
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:29,579
It's not too dry, which is good,
so it's nice and moist in there.

1394
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,019
I think, overall, you've done
something that looks like him.

1395
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,379
It's quite smart, it's neat.

1396
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,579
You've done a good job there.

1397
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:35,780
Thank you.

1398
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:42,019
SHE LAUGHS
Sorry.

1399
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:44,339
You're not supposed to laugh!

1400
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:45,979
It was all going really well.

1401
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,299
Like, his jacket looked great
and everything.

1402
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,059
And then the head exploded.

1403
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,219
HE LAUGHS

1404
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:53,939
I think... Yeah. But I'm hoping
that the flavours will redeem.

1405
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:56,259
And what are the flavours?
Lemon and elderflower.

1406
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,539
I do think his jacket is lovely.

1407
01:03:58,540 --> 01:03:59,700
Thank you. Yeah.

1408
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,459
Mm. That is delicious.

1409
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,579
Thank you.

1410
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:08,939
I think one of the reasons
it squashed so easily is

1411
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,339
it is very most, isn't it? Mm.

1412
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,539
Do you like it?

1413
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,859
Erm... Oh, go on, say you like it.

1414
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,819
I actually... I love it, yeah. Yes!

1415
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:19,219
The flavours are really good.
The elderflower's there.

1416
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:22,019
I mean, it looks the way it does,
but it actually tastes really nice.

1417
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,539
And you can identify who it is.

1418
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,899
Thank you. NOEL: Well done.

1419
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,779
Well done. Oh, what a relief.

1420
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,419
Come on, Fred.
THEY LAUGH

1421
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,700
Let's go.

1422
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,539
Well done. Thank you.

1423
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:41,579
My biggest fear today was that they
were going to say that

1424
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:44,219
the cake was bland, cos then
I knew I was going home.

1425
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:47,059
I think I've hopefully
pulled it back.

1426
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:50,779
I baked it how I like it,
so it's too late to cross fingers

1427
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,219
and toes now.

1428
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:54,899
Kind of thought before that came
together today

1429
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,179
that that was it.

1430
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,979
But if it is,
I'm going out on a high.

1431
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,979
Nobody wants to be the first.
And coming on the show,

1432
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,339
I said, "I don't want to be
the first."

1433
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:07,740
But maybe that was my challenge -
to accept being the first to go.

1434
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,380
Paul and Prue have
made their decision.

1435
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:21,259
Well, congratulations, bakers.

1436
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:24,979
I have the rather pleasant job
of announcing

1437
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,700
this week's Star Baker.

1438
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:30,540
And this week's Star Baker is...

1439
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,979
..Peter.

1440
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,420
THEY CHEER AND APPLAUD

1441
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,339
Which means I've got
the horrible job

1442
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:51,019
of announcing which baker
is leaving us.

1443
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:54,740
And the baker who's going home is...

1444
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,459
..Loriea. I'm sorry.

1445
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,140
Aw. Aw.

1446
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:11,619
Oh, darling, oh, I'm so sorry.

1447
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:14,100
It's fine. Bless you. Thank you.

1448
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:17,699
It might have been nice
to stay a little bit longer,

1449
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,700
but someone has to go, so...

1450
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,739
Well done, mate. Thank you.
You did amazing to get here.

1451
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:25,939
Remember that.

1452
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,219
Yes, I am proud.
I did quite well to get here.

1453
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:31,499
And I stayed true to myself.

1454
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,779
I'm so sorry. It's fine.

1455
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:35,539
It was really sad, actually,

1456
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:37,499
cos I can see a lot of talent
in Loriea,

1457
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,899
and what was...
HE SIGHS

1458
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,659
As a judge, I can't get involved,

1459
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:43,379
because I want to tell her,
"Stop doing that, stop doing this,"

1460
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:46,499
and it came down to overbaking
and over-flavouring.

1461
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,859
Can't believe I'm through
to next week.

1462
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:51,979
I was sat on that chair ready to
stand up.

1463
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:54,540
SHE LAUGHS

1464
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:57,619
Oh, my gosh.

1465
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:59,539
Oh, fantastic.

1466
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,859
I can't believe it.
I was like, "Argh!"

1467
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,099
Well done. Thank you.

1468
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,539
Well-deserved.

1469
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:07,019
I said I was
putting my money on you.

1470
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:08,179
THEY CHUCKLE

1471
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:11,779
Hey there. I just wanted
to give you a quick call.

1472
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:13,499
So, week one went pretty well.

1473
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,019
I got Star Baker.

1474
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:17,379
CHEERING, HE LAUGHS

1475
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:20,779
Hooray! Well done.

1476
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:25,139
Thank you. It was...
It's pretty insane.

1477
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:26,659
Next time...

1478
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,139
..it's biscuit week.

1479
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:31,019
The bakers start off with
a chocolaty fruity signature.

1480
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,579
May the best mango win.

1481
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:34,259
They go for gold in the Technical.

1482
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,059
What is golden,
do you know what I mean?

1483
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,379
And face a fragile...
SHE GASPS

1484
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:38,859
I might well cry if this breaks.

1485
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:40,699
..3D moulded Showstopper.

1486
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,299
Nipple on and a nipple there.

1487
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,619
Exactly. They are like breasts.
They are.

1488
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:46,259
Who will be gasping for breath?

1489
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:48,219
SHE GASPS
And breathe.

1490
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:49,899
And who will make the judges blush?

1491
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,899
I remember worrying a bit about your
very large nuts.

1492
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,299
THEY LAUGH
Because...

1493
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,300
