1
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,040
- Uncle Noel.
- Yeah.

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,400
You know what week it is? I'll tell you.
It's Bread Week, Paul's favourite.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,320
- Wanna see something amazing?
- Yes.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,959
I was messing about in Paul's
dressing room last night and I found this.

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,160
Check this out.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,560
- It's the Hollywood handshake.
- Wow!

7
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,760
- Shall we try it out?
- Yes, please, actually.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,160
- I'll be Paul.
- Thank you.

9
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,080
- Really like your baps.
- Thank you, actually.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,360
It's too powerful!

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,080
Too powerful.

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,520
Hi, guys. You all right?

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,480
- Good?
- All right.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,520
Have you been playing with my handshake?

15
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:53,120
- No.
- What handshake?

16
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,640
Because if you have, you get this!

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,640
All right?

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,680
Welcome
to <i>The Great British Baking Show.</i>

19
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,759
- <i>Now...</i>
- Whack it.

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,080
- <i>...the bakers face trial by bread.</i>
- It's a shame Paul's judging it.

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,840
<i>A soda-bread signature...</i>

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,240
Interesting flavours.

23
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,119
<i>...a technicolour technical...</i>

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,680
- You're a Smurf, aren't you?
- Yes.

25
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,800
<i>...and a showstopper challenge
where transforming dough...</i>

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,640
- I'm no good at plaiting.
<i>- ...into intricate bread plaits...</i>

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,040
- Might be ready in time to bake.
- I hope so.

28
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,360
- <i>...will push the bakers...</i>
- Don't drop it.

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,360
<i>...to their limits.</i>

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,080
It's not funny.

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,320
Yuck.

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,199
Bread's the one area
I've probably got more experience in.

33
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,960
But am I confident? I don't know.

34
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,320
Bread is something
that I've had to teach myself for this.

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,160
I wish I hadn't practised, to be honest.
I felt more confident before.

36
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,040
I like making bread at home,
in my kitchen, with music on,

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,040
but under the eyes of Paul Hollywood?

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,400
Bit scary.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You have to laugh about it,
because we all dreading it.

40
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,680
Hello. Welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your signature challenge.

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,519
Today, the judges would like you to make
two beautifully baked soda bread loaves.

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,640
Now, you may flavour your soda breads
any way you like,

43
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,640
but one should be sweet
and one should be savoury.

44
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,600
Also, your loaves should be baked
free-form,

45
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,760
- not in a tin.
- What do you mean, free-form?

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,799
- Just floatin' in the air?
- Yes.

47
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,480
And the judges would like you each
to make a butter to go with your breads.

48
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,640
Blimey! They don't want much, do they?

49
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,239
Oh!

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,160
You have one hours, 45 minute.

51
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,200
- On your marks...
- Get set...

52
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,320
Bake!

53
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:09,959
- Okay, let's go.
- Feeling good and ready to go.

54
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,239
I'm excited about soda breads.

55
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,600
Gran used to make us soda bread
every day. I hope I do a good job.

56
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:18,600
<i>As opposed to a slow prove
with yeasted breads,</i>

57
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:23,040
<i>the chemical raising agent in soda breads
starts work almost immediately.</i>

58
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,920
And bicarb into my mixture.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,560
<i>So they must get their loaves
into the oven as quickly as possible</i>

60
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,399
<i>in order to achieve the rise
the judges are after.</i>

61
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,519
Cream of tartar. I'm not sure
what it's doing in my recipe.

62
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,040
I'm sure it plays a role.

63
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,040
This challenge is only
an hour and three-quarters,

64
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:43,600
so they won't deal with yeast,
but they gotta deal with the reaction

65
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:47,720
between the rising agents and milk or
buttermilk to create growth in the loaf.

66
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,440
We've asked our bakers to make two
soda breads, one sweet and one savoury.

67
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,959
I'm expecting lots of cheese,
and lots of herbs, and lots of nuts.

68
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,600
It would be really nice to find somebody
using something really different.

69
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,720
Za'atar is more like an aromatic spice.

70
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,160
Traditionally, we have it in pastries,
on top of breads,

71
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,920
so it's perfect for this.

72
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,239
They'll be nervous 'cause it's
their first time on Bread Week with me,

73
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,519
but I think I've given them
an easy challenge. It's soda bread.

74
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,160
Listen to me, Paul Hollywood.
I wanna talk to you about bread.

75
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,720
You go on about bread,
and you go on about bread.

76
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,240
No one under the age of 40
eats bread anymore.

77
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay?

78
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,800
- Morning.
- Hello. Morning. Morning.

79
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,680
Mark, tell us about your soda bread.

80
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,120
My savoury soda bread is a sobrasada
and an Irish sheep's-milk cheese.

81
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,000
And then my sweet soda bread
is a Irish stout and chocolate.

82
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,440
- You're baking for Ireland today.
- I am, yes.

83
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,440
I have the weight of a nation
on my shoulders.

84
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,840
- Are you Irish?
- I am. Yeah.

85
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,919
I'm joking.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,960
- Hello, Mark speaking.
<i>- Mark loves to travel</i>

87
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,640
<i>in his job as a project manager
for public health research programs</i>

88
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,320
<i>in developing countries.</i>

89
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,520
<i>He's adding Spanish sausage, honey and
mature cheddar to his savoury soda bread,</i>

90
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:06,720
<i>but in a nod to his Northern Irish roots,</i>

91
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,200
<i>will blend the chocolate in his sweet loaf
with a classic stout.</i>

92
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,520
- What's the liquid you're putting in?
- Melted butter and honey.

93
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,919
- Interesting. No buttermilk?
- Sorry, and buttermilk. Sorry, yeah.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,080
- I was gonna say.
- Of course buttermilk.

95
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,280
This is a tip,
going through the competition,

96
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,200
when he says "interesting,"
that means you've done it wrong.

97
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,440
Done it wrong? Okay.

98
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,760
<i>Along with Mark, three others
are using a location as their inspiration.</i>

99
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,720
I lived in Chester for a little while,
and I used to love the Welsh <i>bara brith</i>.

100
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,840
So, I've based my sweet one
on that <i>bara brith</i> flavour,

101
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,400
which is just like a bread pud,
in a sense.

102
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,440
<i>East Sussex-based Linda
loves to head to Bexhill Beach</i>

103
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,880
<i>to fish for mackerel and mullet,
which she can throw on the barbie.</i>

104
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,720
Hey!

105
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,440
<i>Chilli, cheese, and coriander
will flavour Linda's savoury bread,</i>

106
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,599
<i>while her love for traditional Welsh
tea cakes has inspired her sweet loaf.</i>

107
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,160
- Lots of fruit in it.
- Mmm-hmm. Nice.

108
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,080
I've soaked my fruit in brandies.

109
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Oh!

110
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm like one of those
'80s game show hosts.

111
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,160
- Say something else.
- Pepped it up a bit.

112
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,479
I could do this all day.

113
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,160
<i>Rowan's creativity has been
sparked from a little further afield.</i>

114
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,080
This is the salsiccia,
the Italian sausage.

115
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,479
So, I'll just get it fried off
in a moment. Get a quick start.

116
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,599
<i>When he's not baking,</i>

117
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,400
<i>Rowan loves to spend time
in his Worcestershire garden.</i>

118
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,039
- That one's Rosa Mundi...
- Okay.

119
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,640
- ...which is Latin, "Rose of the World."
- Is that...

120
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,440
<i>Rowan's bakes include
southern Italian sausage,</i>

121
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,840
<i>fennel and olives for his savoury loaf,</i>

122
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,680
<i>and northern Italian polenta
with raisins and honey for his sweet loaf.</i>

123
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,960
- It's quite a lot.
- It is, isn't it? There's a shock.

124
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,320
I just hope they work in combination.
I think they do.

125
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,440
When you say polenta you've got in there,
what's the polenta to the flour mix?

126
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,440
370 grams of polenta and 130 flour.

127
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,160
So, it is quite gritty. It's a risky one.
Some don't like the grittiness. I like it.

128
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:08,799
Okay, thank you. Interesting.

129
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,080
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

130
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:13,840
<i>Marc's inspiration comes
from shores closer to home.</i>

131
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,960
So, I'm doing
a Cornish-themed soda bread,

132
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,960
so I'm using Cornish Kern.
It's based on the Cornish Yarg.

133
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,320
Quite strong actually,
but not overpowering.

134
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,479
I thought it might work well for this.

135
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Get a bit of flour.

136
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:30,039
<i>Born and raised in Leicester,
adopted Cornishman Marc loves baking</i>

137
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,280
<i>with his daughters.</i>

138
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:32,840
Great. Fist bumps.

139
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,919
<i>To cope with the pressure
of baking bread in the tent,</i>

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,960
<i>Marc is keen to keep things familiar</i>

141
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,760
<i>by including as many Cornish ingredients
as possible.</i>

142
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,520
So, I'm doing a Cornish kelp,
Cornish cheese,

143
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,280
Cornish sea salt and Cornish cream.

144
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,440
I'm covered in buttermilk.

145
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,200
It's not funny.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,039
No, I'm all right. I'm carrying on.

147
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,840
Yuck.

148
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:17,520
The bicarb will react
with the buttermilk

149
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,520
and causes your soda bread to rise.

150
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,679
<i>The bakers need to ensure
their chosen flavours</i>

151
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,039
<i>work alongside the soft, cakey dough.</i>

152
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,200
I'll try to get the black pudding as
well-distributed in the bread as possible.

153
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,400
<i>Any additional moisture or fat
could inhibit the rise of the soda bread</i>

154
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,199
<i>or prevent it
from baking through properly.</i>

155
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,320
A lot of chopping going on.

156
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,360
<i>When it comes to her ingredients,
Hermine isn't playing it safe.</i>

157
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,640
I was trying to be a bit adventurous.

158
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,079
I thought I'd try salmon and cheese.

159
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,720
I don't even know if that's a combination.

160
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,600
<i>When she's not combining her job

to son, Stephen...</i>

162
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,400
Oh, sorry.

163
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
<i>...Hermine
enjoys a spot of knitting.</i>

164
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,920
Another scarf for Stephen.

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,360
Hopefully, it will be ready
for winter.

166
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,079
<i>She'll be hoping

167
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,640
<i>knit together well,

168
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,199
<i>soaked in orange liqueur.</i>

169
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,720
- How much salmon have got going in?
- I've got 180 gram.

170
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,160
How have you gone with practice?

171
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,680
It's been all right.

172
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,440
There was a bit of dread in your face.

173
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,600
<i>Hermine's not the only baker
taking a risk with their ingredients.</i>

174
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,040
Za'atar is quite
an overpowering flavour

175
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,480
if you allow it to be.

176
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,079
When I was trying to make the recipes,
I asked my dad,

177
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,480
"What should I do?" He goes,

178
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,360
"You make a really good Turkish <i>pide</i>,"

179
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,959
and I always put za'atar
on top of it for him.

180
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
He's like, "Why don't you put that
in your bread?"

181
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
I was like, "This is for my dad."

182
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,680
<i>And it's not just Dad
giving out advice.</i>

183
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,600
<i>Hospital pharmacist Sura
grew up surrounded by a family of women</i>

184
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,000
<i>who loved to cook.</i>

185
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:58,440

flavours of za'atar,</i>

187
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,880
<i>olive and dried fruits will impress.</i>

188
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,720
- Are you confident?
- Er, quietly confident.

189
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
He's trying to break you, but he can't.

190
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,400
That's why I don't look in his eyes.

191
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,120
Too powerful.
No one can look into those eyes.

192
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:17,000
- They'll turn to stone.
- They turn to baking flour.

193
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,560
Bakers, you are halfway through.

194
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,440
- Are you sure about that?
- No.

195
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,600
- I don't have a watch, do you?
- No.

196
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
Just get that feeling

197
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,360
- that they're halfway through.
- Yes.

198
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,760
Interesting flavours.

199
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,040
Hopefully they'll like it.

200
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,480
<i>Once their ingredients
have been introduced to the dough...</i>

201
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,680
Texture's all right.

202
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,880
<i>...the bakers can begin
delicately shaping their breads.</i>

203
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,760
Just trying to bring it together
without overworking it.

204
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,959
<i>Too much kneading will result
in dense, unrisen loaves.</i>

205
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,920
Want to make it smooth, but make sure
that I'm not handling it too much.

206
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,280
I'm just cutting the bread,
kind of lets it all puff up nicely.

207
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,640
It lets it cook through better.

208
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:03,240
Plus it's just a nice bit
of decoration.

209
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,839
It's in the oven
at 200 degrees for 30 minutes.

210
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,320
One down.

211
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,240
I'm using a pizza stone,
which I've brought from home.

212
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,320
If you use a pizza stone,
you get more even heat distribution,

213
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,680
and it also gives it
a nice, crusty bottom.

214
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,160
<i>Laura likes
to put her pizza stone to good use</i>

215
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,560
<i>at home with her husband, Matt.</i>

216
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,000
- You're pizza king. I'll stick to baking.
- I'm pizza king.

217
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,400
<i>Laura's aiming for bold flavours</i>

218
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,280
<i>for both of her soda breads,
tweaked from family recipes.</i>

219
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,199
The sweet bread, it's sort of based
on my Nana Peg's scones that she does.

220
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,680
Soda bread's kinda like a scone.

221
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,240
So, I'm doing this one
as a tribute to her.

222
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,480
So I've made my marzipan.
I've found that when I put it in in lumps,

223
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,520
it kind of goes very stodgy,
so I'm gonna grate it in.

224
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,199
Pretty sure this is a,
a new technique...

225
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
...Paul's gonna hate.

226
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,880
So I'm making
my sweet soda bread now.

227
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:03,400
So I'm just crumbling the butter
into the flours and sugar.

228
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,560
Gives it more of a scone-like texture.

229
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,360
Who makes sweet soda bread, what is that?

230
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,959
I am making it today,
but it's not my finest work.

231
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,480
It's a shame that
Paul Hollywood's judging it.

232
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,680
Cheers.

- Sixty grams.

241

- 350.

242
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,480
- Okay.
- Love that face.

243
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,160
Maybe less, even.

244
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,800
- Less?
- Maybe none.

245
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,480
More. Maybe more blueberries.

246
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,440
- Yeah.
- More?

247
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,480
No, I'm not putting in any.

248
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,760
- Start again. Get back to square one.
- Call the whole thing off.

<i>Peter is taking

251
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:00,480
The soda bread is gonna be
ginger-beer flavour.

252
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,839
This is green ginger wine
that I'm adding in.

253
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,079
I'm also gonna add in
just some regular ginger beer as well.

254
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,560
And so,
should have really nice, good flavour.

255
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,719
No, you've gotta layer it on there.
A bit more.

00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,880
- Using bicarb as the rising agent.
- Yeah.

263
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,560
I've got xanthan gum in it to bind it.

264
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,120
- And keep it all together.
- Okay.

265
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,120
For such a young head,
you seem to operate at a different level.

Have you always been
into cooking and baking?

267

Yeah, I've been into cooking

- Yeah. Thank you, Peter.

273
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:06,760
The shape I'm going for
is to replicate a chocolate bar.

274
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,160
Basically a whole nut bar.

275
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,199
<i>Like our Paul,
Dave is a bit of a petrolhead,</i>

<i>and he also follows Mr Hollywood's lead
when it comes to baking.</i>

277
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:18,320
I was watching videos
of Paul Hollywood making it,

278
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,040
just to see how you do it.

279
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:23,920
<i>Dave's sweet loaf
is inspired by his favourite nut mix,</i>

280

<i>and he's confident that bacon and cheese
will prove to be a savoury sensation.</i>

281
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,680
I enjoyed coming up with the flavours
and making flavours that I like,

282
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,280
but also a lot of people
would like, as well.

283
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,240
That's ready. Thirty-five minutes.

284
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:39,520
<i>With their second soda breads
in the oven,</i>

285
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:42,599
<i>it's time to concentrate
on the complementary butters.</i>

286
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,880
Butter, would you believe,
is the easiest thing to make in the world.

287
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,280
That's a thick double cream,

288
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,079
and it'll go past that stage
and turn into butter.

289
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,680
And when it curdles,
you strain all the milk fluids out of it.

290
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
And that's it.

291
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,199
I've never made butter.

292
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,599
I mean, it's lovely. It's very twee.

293
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,280
But why would you make butter?

294
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,839
Added some more Irish stout
into the butter

295
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,319
to give it a bit of a kick.

296
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,920
This is from Mak who left us,
sadly, on the last program.

297
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,400
He didn't have a chance
to showcase his honey.

298
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,920
So that's going in for Mak.

299
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,319
Black garlic tastes
a bit like balsamic vinegar.

300
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,319
Don't ask me why I choose it.
I just thought I'd be a bit wild.

301
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,800
Let's see if that works.

302
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,920
Or it could well be my ticket home.

303
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:32,959
Paul's amazed at your baking knowledge,
'cause you're so young.

304
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,719
- I hope I'm showing knowledge.
- He fears you.

305
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,640
He knows that eventually,
the apprentice kills the master.

306
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,040
Be an interesting end to <i>Bake Off.</i>

307
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,439
- What is it, ten minutes?
- Yes.

308
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,880
- I'll tell them.
- Yeah.

309
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,280
- Okay.
- Ten minutes.

310
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,599
- Bakers, you have ten minutes.
- Ten.

311
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,400
You might need to do it louder.

312
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,959
Bakers, you have ten minutes.

313
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,000
Let's see
what we're dealing with.

314
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:58,640
It's hot. Ooh.

315
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,160
It's spread a bit more than
I'd have liked, but, no,

316
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,599
it's traditional, that shape,
so it's perfect.

317
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,920
I'm tapping it to hear
if it's hollow inside.

318
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,880
I think that's okay.
It's certainly cooked.

319
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,000
It could be darker in colour,
but I don't want it to overcook.

320
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,160
It's a bit of a take on a pizza
I learned to make at school.

321
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,800
Soda bread topped with tomato puree.
I wanted to do a little nod to that.

322
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,319
I think I'm gonna take that out.
I'm going with it.

323
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,839
It is what it is.

324
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,120
This one, it's very dense
with the marzipan.

325
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,199
So it kind of just looks raw. It's not.

326
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,839
Is that not a sign
that you shouldn't use marzipan?

327
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,560
- No, I grated it.
- Did you?

328
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,839
Yeah.

329
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,880
I look forward to seeing what happens.

330
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,359
Mate, it's gonna be carnage.

331
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:39,680
Carnage.

332
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,400
Oh, crumbs.

333
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:43,400
That wasn't good. It just broke off.

334
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:45,359
I'll shove it to the back,
they'll never know.

335
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,120
- Has it got enough blueberries in there?
- Look, Noel.

336
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,199
I think if he says anything
about your cake that you don't like,

337
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,959
just grab a handful of blueberries
and mush them in his face.

338
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,880
- Mush.
- You should do it.

339
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,680
I won't.

340
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,719
My orange zest is thick.
It's not coming through the piping nozzle.

341
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,319
- It looks a bit messy.
- Bakers, you have one minute left.

342
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:09,119
So if you haven't started
making your bread yet...

343
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,280
...now is probably a good time.

344
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:17,680
It looks kind of like a poo.

345
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,399
Four-leaf clover.
I need plenty of luck.

346
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,919
Scary moment.

347
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,120
I think we're good. Hopefully Nana Peg
will be proud of that.

348
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,840
Bakers, your time is up.

349
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,000
Please step away from the breads.

350
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,800
Someone should tell Linda
that's not doing anything.

351
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,360
<i>The bakers' sweet
and savoury soda breads</i>

352
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,880
<i>now face the judgment of Paul and Prue.</i>

353
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,000
- Hello, Mark.
- Hello.

354
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
- Hi, Mark.
- Hi.

355
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,560
They're quite impressive.
I like the stout one.

356
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,640
It's the colour I expected it to be.
This has been coloured a bit

357
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,159
but I don't really mind that,
to be honest.

358
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,320
It's got sobrasada
and an Irish sheep's-milk cheddar.

359
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:12,840
It's a decent soda bread.

360
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:15,480
There's flavour in there,
but you've got to hunt it.

361
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,120
It's delicious with the top,
then you really get the flavour.

362
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,000
And then, I've got
chocolate and Irish stout.

363
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,360
The chocolate comes through.

364
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,560
Very good.
You get the chocolate instantly.

365
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,720
Then the stout lingers.

366
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,600
- A great loaf.
- The butter's lovely.

367
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,040
-Good job.

368
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,679
- Thank you.
- Well done.

369
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,440
Whoo!

370
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,000
They look quite rustic,
but both the same size.

371
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,640
They look quite nice.

372
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,280
The onions and the chorizo
go really well together.

373
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,800
- A little underbaked.
- It's a pity, the edge is perfect.

374
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,480
Glacé cherry bread.

375
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
Look at that.

376
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,360
Can't taste the glacéed cherries,
but the marzipan is delicious.

377
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,480
The marzipan comes whacking through.

378
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
It's just lovely.

379
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,960
- There's a good crunch.
- Mmm.

380
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,440
It's a really lovely texture.
Beautiful.

381
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:06,760
A great tasting loaf.

382
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,360
- Yes.
- You've chosen flavours

383
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,520
that work in all breads,
and olive is one of those.

384
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,000
And my sweet
is blueberry and maple bacon.

385
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,800
Well, the blueberries
are not exactly evenly spread, are they?

386
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,520
When I get a blueberry, it's delicious,
the texture's good.

387
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,720
I'm missing the bacon.

388
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,880
It's wasted on the outside.

389
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Lot of it's gonna end up on the plate
and you won't taste it.

390
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

391
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,520
They look great.

392
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,760
It's very brave to take
the gluten-free option.

393
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:37,760
Difficult though, isn't it?

394
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,240
It's falling to bits a bit

395
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,040
- and then it gets glue-y in your mouth.
- Okay.

396
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,159
- This is the ginger?
- Ginger beer.

397
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,120
I love that, texture's beautiful.

398
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,760
Very cake-like, though, isn't it?

399
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,480
It's a little bit stodgy.

400
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,800
The flavours are delicious.

401
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,480
Your flavours are normally spot-on.

402
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,600
- Very rustic.
- They look classic.

403
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,560
- They're really good.
- Hmm.

404
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
I love that.

405
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,720
- Really?
- Mmm. It's a nice loaf.

406
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,440
If you get a mouthful of everything,
it's delicious.

407
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,000
Thank you very much.

408
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,560
- Okay.
- This is a little doughier.

409
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,600
- More cake-like.
- Nice flavour, though.

410
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,480
- It's cranberries, is it?
- Cranberries, chocolates, and sea salt.

411
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,000
Not getting the cranberry.

412
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,679
It's just a little bit weak.

413
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,640
Needs a bit more.

414
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,080
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

415
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:29,399
They both look as if
they haven't risen enough.

416
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,960
- There are very big lumps of sausage.
- Yes.

417
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,000
- You always like a lot of sausage?
- Wouldn't care to comment.

418
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,480
Okay, fair enough.

419
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,399
Actually, the sausage is okay,
the olives are okay.

420
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,919
- I would have left the bread in longer.
- Right.

421
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,679
- See how wet...
- That's why it's so heavy.

422
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,440
It'd be nice if it was lighter.

423
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,200
Wow.

424
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,679
That much polenta in there was a mistake.

425
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,240
It's too gritty for me.

426
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,360
It's a bit like eating
a lemon drizzle cake in a sandstorm.

427
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,919
Looks as if it's risen nicely.

428
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,600
- Not enough flavour for me.
- No?

429
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:10,200
- You put Gruyère?
- Yes.

430
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,840
- You need double that, triple that.
- Yeah. Okay.

431
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,960
You do get the chocolate,
just not enough in each bite.

432
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,760
It's a shame,
'cause it's baked well, actually.

433
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,360
Two very good loaves.

434
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,240
You just need a bit more flavour.

435
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,679
Let's try the za'atar one first.

436
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,640
- What oven temperature did you use?
- 160.

437
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,280
That's why it's so pale.

438
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,399
The blend of olives
and za'atar is delicious.

439
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,760
I like the flavour.
Right, sweet one.

440
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,679
Are the fruits mostly apricots?

441
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,679
Apricots,
dried cherries, and walnut.

442
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,720
- I think that is delicious.
- Thank you.

443
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,439
Really, really good.

444
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,960
My only issue of both loaves
is your temperature choice.

445
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,040
You should've baked them higher
and it would've been spot-on.

446
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,159
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

447
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,360
Looks good, but I hope
it's baked all the way through.

448
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:03,320
I get worried when they're that pale.

449
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,360
Needed a little longer in the oven.

450
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:07,880
It's such a pity
because the flavour is lovely.

451
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,720
That's a bit soggy, too.

452
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,480
Does have that spicy
<i>bara-brith</i> flavour to it.

453
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,080
When you try and push
a load of fruit into a loaf,

454
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,320
if you shape it too tight,
all the fruit goes to the outside.

455
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:21,679
There's nothing inside.

456
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,320
I like the flavour,
but unfortunately, all the fruit burnt

457
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:26,439
- on the top of the loaf, not in it.
- Yeah.

458
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,520
They look really nice.

459
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,760
The idea of putting
the smoked salmon in it is so original.

460
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,760
I've never had that.

461
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,960
- You invented a bread.
- Yeah!

462
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,480
That, I really like.
The salmon really works.

463
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,520
It's like a whole sandwich all in one.

464
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,960
The aftertaste is lovely.

465
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,080
- It's nice and well-baked.
- Thank you.

466
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,760
- That's a very grown-up fruit cake.
- Mmm.

467
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,320
Lots of booze. Lovely.

468
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:53,919
I've soaked the fruit
for a couple of weeks.

469
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,399
You serious?

470
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,856
- She wanted us to taste it.
- Wow.

471
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,976
- Lovely.
- Thank you.

472
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,200
I think they're very special. I really do.

473
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,480
Oh!

474
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,439
Thank you.

475
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,720
Know what I love?
The fact that I've never had them before.

476
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,960
- Thank you.
- This has really complex flavours.

477
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,280
I love it. It's special.

478
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
Well done.

479
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,679
That's it, I'm packing.

480
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,360
Time to go home.

481
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,320
That's 2020, over.

482
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,200
That went better than I expected.
I was terrified, honestly.

483
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,399
But the flavour queen is back.

484
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,439
The comments were not entirely positive,

485
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,200
but I'm very determined learning
from the last technical

486
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,000
to spend a bit of time thinking
and not just dashing straight into it.

487
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,600
<i>Bread Week
isn't about to get any easier.</i>

488
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,640
<i>Our ten bakers will now face
a technical with a twist.</i>

489
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,520
Bakers, it's time for
your technical challenge,

490
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,000
which today has been set by Paul.

491
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,480
Paul, any words of advice?

492
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,640
You need...

493
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,159
to get your timings right.

494
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,080
Yeah, he said words of advice,
not just words.

495
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,000
Your technical challenge
will be judged blind,

496
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,080
so we're gonna have to ask
these two rascals to skedaddle.

497
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,159
Off you pop.

498
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,679
So, Paul would like you to bake
six rainbow-coloured bagels.

499
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,520
Rainbow-coloured bagels
are the same as normal bagels,

500
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,320
just with five different-coloured doughs.

501
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,720
Layered, shaped, then boiled and baked
to achieve a lovely, shiny, chewy crust.

502
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,679
Chewy crust.

503
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,480
You have two hours and 45 minutes.

504
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
- On your marks.
- Get set.

505
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,159
Bake.

506
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,480
Oh, my God.

507
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,200
What the hell is a rainbow bagel?
I mean...

508
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,560
No idea.

509
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,040
Never made them before,
certainly not the rainbow one,

510
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,880
so... interesting.

511
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,840
I've made bagels before,
but I don't wanna say,

512
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:57,560
"I've made bagels before,"
and then they come out awful.

513
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,800
Kind of makes sense
when you read it through.

514
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,600
Just go with it.

515
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,960
There's a bagel shop near work,
so I've seen how they make it,

516
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,399
but I've never made it myself.

517
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,720
I wouldn't have to, it's right there.

518
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Paul.

519
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,800
Paul, why rainbow-coloured bagels?

520
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,399
Bagels are a great challenge
when you're making bread.

521
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,080
Gotta boil them, which is unusual,
and then bake them.

522
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:22,679
The rainbow colours for me,

523
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,480
although it originated over in the States,
I think it represents the NHS.

524
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,439
It does now.

525
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,080
Certainly.

526
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,880
What they've gotta do is

527
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,439
roll each piece, each colour,
into a rectangle.

528
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,480
Lay the next one on the top and continue.

529
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,399
- Stack them.
- Yes.

530
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,240
And twist it to create that spiral
and then you seal.

531
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,280
You plunge it in the water
for anything between 15 and 40 seconds

532
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,600
and then bake it off.

533
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:47,800
Can we taste them?

534
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,960
Absolutely.

535
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,399
What could go wrong?

536
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,199
You can easily overprove
and underprove a bagel.

537
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,520
If it's overproved
before it's gone in the water

538
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,439
or if it's left in the water too long,
it will flatten in the oven.

539
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,679
Absolutely delicious.

540
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,280
It's even brighter inside
than it is outside.

541
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,480
Pretty vibrant.

542
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,919
They may have made bagels before,
but I guarantee not like this.

543
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,439
I've never made them like this.

544
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,760
Happy bread.

545
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,320
"Happy bread." That's what it is.

546
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,640
"Make and knead the dough."

547
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,080
It's, erm, scant, isn't it, at best?

548
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:21,280
Normally, I would
chuck it in a stand mixer.

549
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,840
We're definitely getting
a full workout today.

550
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,159
We're in 2020,
who kneads by hand?

551
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,720
I know it needs to be kneaded
a good amount for a bagel,

552
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,600
so I'm gonna be working this
until it's super smooth.

553
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,600
Think it's gonna be
quite a stretchy, elastic dough.

554
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,120
It still feels a little tight.

555
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:41,240
Stretch and tear,
that's the way to go.

556
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,080
Rowan's doing the slap already.

557
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:44,159
Whack it.

558
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,399
It's very therapeutic, it really is.

559
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,880
So disappointed that there
aren't any rainbows in a rainbow bagel.

560
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,040
Real rainbows?

561
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,240
I wanted you to have to go
and catch a rainbow.

562
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,240
- Yeah.
- Lasso it.

563
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,720
Chop it up, grate it into the bagel...

564
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,199
...but no, it's just some coloured bread.

565
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,399
I think that must be about it now.

566
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,560
And it says to divide the dough
into five pieces.

567
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,000
We'll colour them each a different colour.

568
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,800
Never done coloured bread.

569
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,120
So it's all part
of the voyage of discovery.

570
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,480
A very messy business.

571
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,360
They wanna be nice and vibrant.

572
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,760
Really hard to mix in all the colours.

573
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,679
I might have used too much,

574
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,840
just judging by the fact that no one
else's bench is the same colour as mine.

575
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,679
- You're a Smurf, aren't you?
- Yes.

576
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,120
That'll do. I'm over that.

577
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:34,760
"Number four, rise."
Exceptionally descriptive.

578
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,040
Arise, Sir Dough.

579
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,960
I'm gonna leave it
to prove till it's doubled in size.

580
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,520
It's only small pieces.

581
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,800
I'm gonna go
about 20 minutes to start with.

582
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,240
And breathe.

583
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,120
I would normally snooze,
or play the piano, actually,

584
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:51,960
while the dough is rising.
Perhaps do a spot of gardening.

585
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,439
I could nip outside
and do a bit of pruning.

586
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,480
If you prod,

587
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,080
leaves a slight indent,
then they're ready to go.

588
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:05,560
They're doing all that,
so it's time to go with them.

589
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,760
Gonna start rolling them out
in colour order, so red first.

590
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,399
Is this from the handshake?

591
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,159
That's what happens... with Paul.

592
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,560
That's his fake tan.

593
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,320
They can take handshakes back.

594
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,399
Oh, yeah?

595
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,159
They'll just reverse the footage.

596
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,000
Like...

597
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,720
"Roll out to a rectangle,
measuring 15 by 20 centimetres."

598
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,880
I'm gonna check what
15 centimetres looks like, just so I know.

599
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:35,520
What are you comparing against?

600
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,640
Just half the ruler, Dave.

601
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,840
You're just layering the doughs.

602
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,639
I'm just trying
to get some kind of evenness.

603
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,760
Like making
brightly coloured mattresses.

604
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
They're very bouncy and very illuminous.

605
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,280
So now I'm cutting the dough into six.

606
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,760
"Roll and twist the dough to a rope,

607
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,040
measuring approximately
24 centimetres long."

608
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,840
You are approximately 24.

609
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,000
I am, aren't I?
We've got to 24 centimetres.

610
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,240
- Yeah.
- How many inches? I think in inches.

611
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,040
Erm, that's nine and a half inches.

612
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:07,840
Think that's respectable, myself.

613
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,199
Kind of pull back on this palm,

614
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,879
and go forward on this palm.

615
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:14,360
Oh, dear.

616
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:16,480
This is a rainbow, isn't it?

617
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,679
There you go.

618
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,280
Just gotta
try and seal this bit now.

619
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,679
"Gently roll back and forth."

620
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,000
- Don't get it.
- I don't want it to fall apart.

621
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,120
Haven't got a clue.

622
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:34,000
It's not too bad.
Once you get the knack of it,

623
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,280
it's like... Whoo!

624
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,480
Everyone's twisted theirs,
I didn't twist mine.

625
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,600
I think that's right,
'cause they're gonna expand,

626
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,879
the hole's gonna shrink.

627
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:45,720
By the time it's expanded
and shrunk, it should be about right.

628
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,720
- It does say twist.
- Does it?

629
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,240
Yeah. It says "roll and twist."

630
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,480
Bakers, you are halfway through.

631
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:59,000
And number ten is prove.

632
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,840
Just the one word in that step.

633
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,399
Not very elaborate, is he?

634
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,159
Wanna give them
as much time as possible.

635
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,520
I think the trick
with these is in the timing.

636
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,679
The second prove
is gonna be the one for texture.

637
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,280
Try that again, shall we?

638
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:16,639
I'll put the drawer up a bit warmer.
See if we can get a quick prove on the go.

639
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,360
We'll see how we get on.

640
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:22,159
<i>Judging the right time
to stop the final prove is critical.</i>

641
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,000
It's driven me to drink green tea.

642
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,439
- Come on. That's gin, we know.
- Yeah.

643
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,840
If I was on this competition,
I'd drink through it.

644
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:31,080
I've started drinking.
Haven't drunk in four years.

645
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:32,959
Started drinking here again.

646
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,040
<i>If the bagels are underproved...</i>

647
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,240
Anything happening?

648
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,159
<i>...they won't
have the dome-like rise</i>

649
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,240
<i>that Paul and Prue are expecting.</i>

650
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,159
Ooh, check you out!

651
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,800
They're looking good!

652
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:47,560
They don't look bad, actually.

653
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,040
Reckon, about ready.
Right, glasses off.

654
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,000
"Bring a saucepan of water to a boil,
add the bicarbonate soda."

655
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,800
<i>If they're overproved,</i>

656
00:30:56,879 --> 00:30:58,919
<i>they'll puff up too much
when they hit the water...</i>

657
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,760
Who's gonna take the plunge first?

658
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,679
<i>...and collapse
before they go into the oven.</i>

659
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,760
So, let's have a look.

660
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:09,360
I feel a bit nervous,
'cause I don't think they cook long.

661
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:12,520
"Cook until the bagels
are puffed and the shape has set."

662
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,040
I think this is what gives
the bagels that chewy kind of texture.

663
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,959
So I'm boiling for about
30 to 45 seconds on each side.

664
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,120
I have no idea whether that's done.

665
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,560
Have you seen
the size of them? They're huge.

666
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:29,800
Bakers, you have 30 minutes left.

667
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:31,320
- Have I missed it?
- Yes.

668
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,439
Not any more than that.

669
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,000
They go in looking good,
and then... things happen.

670
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,080
This is not a bagel.

671
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,399
It's a unicorn horn.

672
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,879
It's hard to know.

673
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:47,199
Especially when
you never made them before.

674
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Why don't you see
what other people are doing?

675
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,360
I have been, but theirs
aren't looking terribly good, either.

676
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,000
Is that set?

677
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,560
So hard to know.
Let's have them in a bit longer.

678
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:01,280
Ooh! Paul Hollywood is definitely
taking his handshake back.

679
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,360
'Cause these...

680
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,840
That's them all boiled now.

681
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:06,760
Even though they've doubled in size,

682
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,639
they seem to have
lost it when I boiled them.

683
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:12,159
I got it.

684
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,399
This one opened up, but don't tell Paul.

685
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,919
I've stuck it back together,

686
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,919
and hopefully it'll just
glue back together in the oven.

687
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,560
Going into the oven now.

688
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:24,120
- It just says "bake"!
- We'll see what the oven does with them.

689
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:26,159
Could be just a case
of getting a nice crust.

690
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,719
Twenty maximum, I think.

691
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,439
I don't know for how long.

692
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,080
I'm hoping they'll puff up again.

693
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:34,040
And it will disguise the wrinkly bits
they've now got.

694
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,520
Bakers,
you've got, ooh, ten minutes left.

695
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,959
That's not very much time, is it?

696
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:44,159
So, how do you know
they're ready? 'Cause normally,

697
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,639
they'll get brown.

698
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:47,040
These got colour.

699
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,040
My blue's way too dark.

700
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,280
I really don't know what I'm looking for.

701
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,360
Not loving what is going on inside there.

702
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,879
I think they're too thin and too wide.

703
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:58,320
I think they're gonna
want them to be a bit... puffier.

704
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,600
- In there?
- Yes.

705
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,800
They're looking <i>pretty</i> good.

706
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:04,199
Yours, not so much.

707
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,320
Aw, Sura looks sad.

708
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,679
- You all right?
- Yeah.

709
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,840
- Do you want a piggyback?
- No.

710
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:10,919
Okay.

711
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,320
- Do not wanna overbake them.
- Another minute.

712
00:33:13,879 --> 00:33:16,679
- What have we got?
- Bakers, you have five minutes left.

713
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,679
Oh!

714
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,919
I'm looking to make sure
they're not going too brown.

715
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,159
They look great, Linda.

716
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,639
Mine are all wrinkled.

717
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:28,919
And they have been boiled for some time.

718
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,480
I think I'm gonna take 'em out.

719
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,040
That looks good. Well done.

720
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,600
They sound hollow, so...

721
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,480
They sound done.

722
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,560
Flat as pancakes.

723
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:45,560
Bakers, your time is up.

724
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,399
That's not a bagel.

725
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:50,080
I'll be honest.

726
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,360
I think I overcooked all of them.

727
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,280
Strategic placing.

728
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,639
Exactly.

729
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:59,240
Mine seem kind of soft and wrinkly.

730
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,560
It's not attractive.

731
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:10,639
<i>Paul and Prue are looking for
six vibrant rainbow-coloured bagels</i>

732
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,679
<i>that are smooth and crisp on the outside</i>

733
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,319
<i>and slightly chewy inside.</i>

734
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,360
We've got the five different colours.

735
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,440
Right.

736
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,080
These aren't too bad.
You've got the colours.

737
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,319
They're quite smooth.

738
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,639
- And quite light.
- Smaller than most of the others.

739
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,920
They're a good size.

740
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,920
- Nice, soft. Crispy on the outside.
- Mmm.

741
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,719
Er, very nice.

742
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:34,839
Nice bread,
same size, nice, smooth,

743
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,719
and the crumb's really tasty.

744
00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:38,119
- Good.
- Very good.

745
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,199
Right, moving on to the hula hoops.

746
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,000
These are a little bit big,
and actually, it's overproved, it's flat.

747
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,080
- Tastes all right, though.
- Mmm. Tastes fine.

748
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,440
On to these whoppers.
They haven't been twisted.

749
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,280
You can see where it's joined,
but it's just gone round as one.

750
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,280
Colours are nice.
Very bright and vibrant.

751
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,319
- Nice flavour. Good texture.
- Nice flavour.

752
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,560
Now moving on to this. Very, very flat.
Overproved before they went in the water,

753
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,319
then they lost all the height.
Tastes great, though.

754
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,920
Now, these are a little bit dark.

755
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Feel the crispiness?

756
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,600
Yeah.

757
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,040
- But the shape, uniform.
- Hmm.

758
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,760
Actually, they're not too bad.
Just slightly overbaked.

759
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:19,720
Now these also had the issue
with the water, overproved.

760
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:22,520
- You can see the marks on it.
- That's not at all crisp.

761
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,120
- And it's soft.
- Underbaked.

762
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,600
- The flavour's okay, though.
- Flavour's fine.

763
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,520
These aren't bad. Fairly smooth,
but just overdone it in the water.

764
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,280
Hmm. Good flavour.

765
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,880
These are overbaked again.

766
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,880
- See how dark they've gone?
- Not very attractive.

767
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,680
Bit tough.

768
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,560
These are big.

769
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,200
They look more like pretzels.

770
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,400
But they're vibrant colours.

771
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,920
- And they are pretty smooth.
- Mmm.

772
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,400
Yeah. That is delicious.

773
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,360
It is nice. Now the last one.

774
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,040
Lost its way a little in the shaping,
but also with the water, as well.

775
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,160
- Again, see the marks.
- Hmm.

776
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,040
Nice bread, though.

777
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,880
This is gonna be
interesting to judge.

778
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:06,480
<i>Paul and Prue
will now rank the bagels...</i>

779
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,000
That one second from the end's good.

780
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,799
<i>...from worst to best.</i>

781
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,400
So, in last place, we have this one.

782
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,360
Rowan, they are overproved and underbaked.

783
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,720
In ninth spot, we have this one.

784
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:21,560
You've managed to bake this one,
but it is overproved.

785
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,160
Then, in eighth place, we have this one.

786
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,600
Sura, lovely colour.
Your twisting wasn't perfect.

787
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,799
It was a bit wobbly.

788
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,799
<i>Hermine is seventh, Laura is sixth,</i>

789
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,600
<i>Lottie, fifth, and Peter, fourth.</i>

790
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,240
In third, we have this one.

791
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,680
Not bad. You've managed
to get a nice colour.

792
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,920
There's a nice twist.

793
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,360
And in second place...

794
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,760
we have this one.

795
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,280
Who's that?
Marc, they are really nice bagels.

796
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,560
They are properly risen. Good effort.

797
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,960
And in first place, we have this one.

798
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,839
Well done. It's nice and chewy.

799
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,000
Got lovely colours inside
with the flavour, too.

800
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,920
- Thank you.
- They tasted really good.

801
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,040
Well done, Linda.

802
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,520
Oh, wow! What a high.
Can't wait to tell my family.

803
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,400
- Can't wait to tell Richard.
- I'll ring him up and go...

804
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,400
It was a good result for me.

805
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,359
Last two technicals,
I've not fared too well,

806
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,120
so, I was happy with that one.

807
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,720
I had a fabulous time.
It was a good challenge.

808
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:20,319
The result wasn't great.

809
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,880
Tomorrow, we can do better.
We gotta do better.

810
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:31,400
<i>Just one challenge remains.</i>

811
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,319
So, Bread Week.
Something very close to your heart, Paul.

812
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,200
Overall standard
has been pretty good.

813
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,600
It was nice to give
a handshake to Hermine.

814
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,680
- She did well. Very clever.
- Yeah.

815
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,880
She invented a new genre of bread.

816
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,040
But, for Star Baker,
she struggled a bit in the technical.

817
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,240
Not saying she's not,
there are a couple of others.

818
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:50,880
Both Marks have done well
in signature and technical.

819
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,480
- Yeah.
- Actually, Lottie, as well.

820
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,319
Lottie describes herself as a swan.

821
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,960
She said, "You don't know
what's going on beneath the surface."

822
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,960
She is not swan-like.
She's always just going...

823
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,799
I've never seen a swan
panicking that hard.

824
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,359
Who's in trouble?

825
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,200
I think Rowan is in difficulty
this week again.

826
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,799
The soda breads, one was a polenta cake.

827
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,799
- One was a sand pit.
- Very sandy.

828
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,120
I think David's done okay,
but he is slipping down there.

829
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,160
Curse of the Star Baker.

830
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,520
Ultimately,
it's a tricky showstopper today,

831
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,040
but I'd like to see
all the bakers complete the task,

832
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,319
including Rowan.

833
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,520
- Interesting.
- Interesting.

834
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,120
I think I'm in love with you.

835
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,000
- We'll talk about this later.
- We should talk about it now.

836
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,839
Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your showstopper challenge.

837
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,160
Today, the judges would like you to make
a large decorative bread plaque

838
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,400
in the style of a traditional
harvest festival sheaf.

839
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,200
Giving your own take on the sheaf,

840
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,600
your bread plaque must portray
the one thing you are most grateful for.

841
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,560
Your bread must be
impressive in size, visually powerful,

842
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,600
and, of course,
it's got to be delish-delosh.

843
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,319
You have three hours and 30 minutes.

844
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,680
Don't seem long enough.

845
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,600
I know. They've been done up
like a kipper.

846
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,600
- On your marks!
- Get set.

847
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,680
Bake!

848
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,319
Feeling nervous today. It's a big one.

849
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,839
Traditionally,
the harvest plaque is inedible

850
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,720
and rock hard and varnished.
So, to make it utterly delicious...

851
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:26,400
...it's quite a challenge.

852
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,760
Bricking it.

853
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:31,000
The bread plaque itself
must be a celebration

854
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,160
of something that the bakers
are thankful for.

855
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,359
It could be your house,
it could be their health, anything.

856
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,280
But it's really easy to sit there
and design something elaborate on paper.

857
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,080
It's not anything like easy
to make it in bread.

858
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,640
It's about manipulating dough itself,
using knife techniques,

859
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,160
plaiting, twisting, spiralling the bread.

860
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,960
It's a great challenge,
because it'll give me the indication

861
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,080
of how far these bakers have travelled
on their bread journey.

862
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,440
I hope they've practised it,

863
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,720
because they'll never get it right
if they haven't.

864
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,839
<i>To give their elaborate plaques
different flavours, textures and shapes,</i>

865
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,000
<i>all of the bakers have chosen
to make multiple breads.</i>

866
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,160
I'm making three breads.
There's a lot of multitasking going on.

867
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,680
There's no time for faffery today.

868
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,760
I'm doing two breads. A basic white bread,
a wholemeal bread,

869
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,720
and then, around the edges,
I've got this Tibetan monastery bread.

870
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,520
<i>Flavoured with fennel,
coriander and caraway seeds,</i>

871
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,560
<i>Marc's bread will be swirled together
to form a Buddhist dharma wheel.</i>

872
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,240
Are you a Buddhist?
Is this what you're grateful for?

873
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:38,520
I'm not a Buddhist, but after I had
the accident where I lost my leg,

874
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,440
and I wasn't in a very good place,

875
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,440
and just trying to come to terms
with what had happened,

876
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,280
I read a wonderful book
about the philosophy of Buddhism.

877
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:48,600
It made it a lot clearer,
what I needed to do

878
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,000
to still live a life,
and make my life worth living, you know?

879
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,640
So, this... Yeah,
it means a lot to me, this one.

880
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,160
I'm gonna knead it for ten minutes.

881
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,960
It's not too sticky.
More smooth and silky.

882
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,400
Nowhere near ready.
Let's have a bit of welly.

883
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,799
Good bit of exercise,
which I'm missing at the moment.

884
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,040
I just absolutely love
this part about bread.

885
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,400
You can put so much feeling into it,

886
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,400
put a lot of love into it, you know.

887
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,240
<i>Linda's putting her love
into two family favourites.</i>

888
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:24,560
<i>Her black-olive plait
will frame tiger-bread animals</i>

889
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,920
<i>that she helped look after
on her uncle's farm.</i>

890
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,880
As a kid, I used to milk the cows,

891
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,080
and we used to carry the buckets
of milk through the farm

892
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,480
to my auntie's kitchen
where she made beautiful cakes.

893
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,480
- So rural idyll, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah.

894
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,200
- You've really gone for the harvest theme.
- Absolutely.

895
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,200
It's all about that circle of life.

896
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,720
- Thank you. Good luck.
- Thank you.

897
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,240
Shape of that bottle even reminds me
of the milk churns.

898
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,520
It's a wonderful memory.

899
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,680
I've a little piping there.

900
00:41:56,359 --> 00:41:59,680
<i>Linda's not the only baker
celebrating the good life.</i>

901
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,080
I'm feeling very grateful
for my life in Worcestershire.

902
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,200
The wonderful countryside and the theatre,
literature and music

903
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,280
that form such a big part
of my life there.

904
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,280
<i>Rowan's huge plaque
will be made of three flavoured breads</i>

905
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:17,920
<i>and shaped into Worcestershire's
coat of arms, the pear tree.</i>

906
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,960
<i>He's hoping it'll be enough to make up
for yesterday's technical disaster.</i>

907
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,319
- Did you come...
- Last.

908
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,960
- Did you?
- Of course. Yeah.

909
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,839
If you smash this, then?

910
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,440
It's probably curtains,
but I'm gonna have fun anyway.

911
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,040
I love your attitude.
Also, look at your boots.

912
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,440
- This is strong boot game.
- Look at that.

913
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,760
Look at these two guys.

914
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,440
<i>While Rowan's taking on
the biggest bread plaque...</i>

915
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,799
It seems to be enormous
compared with everybody else's.

916
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,280
<i>...Hermine might have
the most ambitious plan of them all.</i>

917
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:49,160
The plan is to make an enriched dough.

918
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,839
- Something close to a brioche.
- It can't be a brioche in three hours.

919
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,160
What have you cut back on
to get it done on time?

920
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,200
I haven't cut back on anything.

921
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,440
It's supposed to stay
in the fridge overnight,

922
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,720
but I'm gonna put it in a freezer
on both sides for about 15 minutes

923
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:09,839
to harden the butter,
so that I can then work.

924
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,240
- Quite risky.
- I agree.

925
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,480
<i>Hermine's brioche will form</i>

926
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,560
<i>the border
of her focaccia-and-breadstick plaque,</i>

927
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,640
<i>recreating her annual road trips
from London to Paris</i>

928
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,400
<i>to visit family and friends.</i>

929
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,880
They might say it's risky
doing an enriched dough,

930
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,640
but I like doing it, so I'm gonna
do it anyway. We shall see.

931
00:43:30,799 --> 00:43:33,280
<i>While Hermine
is heading to the freezer...</i>

932
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,040
Should be done now.
The light's coming through.

933
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,480
- It's good to go.
- Proving drawer, there it is.

934
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,000
<i>...the other bakers
are ready to start proving.</i>

935
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,680
Grow. That's in for an hour.

936
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,000
Quite warm in here today,
so, hopefully,

937
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,200
it'll just rise without having
to force it up.

938
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,520
I'm gonna go by eye.
Set the timer for 40 minutes and see.

939
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,359
<i>With one dough down...</i>

940
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,839
Right. Back to some kneading.

941
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,680
<i>...the process
starts all over again.</i>

942
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,960
I've added fresh yeast.
First load will go 15.

943
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,520
This one, 20,
just to let it catch up a little bit.

944
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,400
So, in theory, this should all
be proved around the same time.

945
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,640
<i>And if juggling multiple doughs
wasn't tricky enough...</i>

946
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,160
This is the most manic bit.

947
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,200
<i>...some of the bakers
have also chosen to make fillings.</i>

948
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,120
The mango, lime and chilli paste
is my signature flavour for breads.

949
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,319
It's just fantastic.

950
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,960
That smells delish.

951
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,879
I've got a focaccia base
which is stuffed with pancetta

952
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,920
and Gruyère cheese.

953
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,120
It's basically a posh
cheese and ham sandwich.

954
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,040
<i>Laura's stuffed focaccia will take
centre stage of a musical-themed plaque,</i>

955
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,640
<i>which will be adorned
with spicy fougasse curtains and masks.</i>

956
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,080
I've probably seen about 70 shows
in the West End.

957
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,400
And I have seen none.

958
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,319
- Never been to a West End musical?
- Never.

959
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,200
Call yourself a gay man?
Honestly, terrible.

960
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,400
When this show is over,
we are hitting the town.

961
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,640
- Okay.
- We're gonna take him to <i>Wicked,</i>

962
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,560
<i>Mamma Mia, Phantom, Les...</i>
We'll make a list.

963
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,560
Okay. Sounds good. It's a date.

964
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,960
So, I'm pureeing my apples.

965
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,120
I grew up in County Armagh
in Northern Ireland,

966
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,000
which is known as Orchard County
because of the apple orchards.

967
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,200
I'm gonna freeze the apple puree in straws

968
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,920
and then I will braid around
the frozen puree.

969
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,720
Hope it works. Fingers crossed.

970
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,120
<i>Mark's also taking a chance
with his flavours,</i>

971
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,200
<i>combining his apple-filled trees
with hazelnut and wild garlic.</i>

972
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,400
Will they
love apple and wild garlic?

973
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,240
I'm not sure, but I love it.
It's such an amazing taste.

974
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:29,640
I'm gonna put that in
for its first prove now.

975
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,440
<i>As more dough begins proving...</i>

976
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,280
Ready to go.

977
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,680
<i>...Hermine's brioche dough
is finally cold enough to shape.</i>

978
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:42,040
I'm twisting. I'm a bit pushed for time,
'cause I don't want the butter melting.

979
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:47,520
But I think it will be fine
to go prove now, just on time.

980
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,960
- It might be ready in time to bake.
- I hope so.

981
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,920
<i>Ninety minutes remain
for the bakers</i>

982
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,240
<i>to complete their
decorative bread plaques.</i>

983
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:03,120
This is such enormous fun.
It's a shame it's a competition, really.

984
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,799
<i>And their first batch
of dough has risen to the occasion...</i>

985
00:46:06,879 --> 00:46:11,240
The focaccia has doubled in size.
Good rise.

986
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:14,080
<i>...and any additional ingredients</i>

987
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,359
<i>- can now be added.</i>
- I need that.

988
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,600
Hazelnut's going in.

989
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,920
Wanna make sure they get in,
not just on the top.

990
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,240
It smells amazing, doesn't it?

991
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:27,400
And I'm just putting in very mature
Somerset cheddar and a Spanish chorizo.

992
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,440
This is an incorporated dough.
It's tricky to get right.

993
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,359
I have warmed the pre-soaked pear.

994
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,520
I didn't want it to cool the dough
and impede the rise.

995
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,160
I don't want it to go
as flat as a pancake and stodgy,

996
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,720
which is another of my trademarks.

997
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,400
This is the canvas
for the bread plaque.

998
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,440
I'm just gonna start shaping it.

999
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,240
Oh, that's stuck. Well done, Sura.

1000
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,960
<i>Once her canvas is ready,</i>

1001
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,640
<i>Sura's recreating one of her
most cherished childhood memories,</i>

1002
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,240
<i>picking tomatoes off the vine
her mum grew in their London flat.</i>

1003
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,480
It was huge.
It was behind the TV, in the living room.

1004
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,120
Like that.

1005
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,600
It was on the ceiling.
And so, whenever I see a tomato vine,

1006
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,640
I remember my mum.
She's my favourite person on the Earth.

1007
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,240
Very thankful for her.

1008
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,080
<i>Dave is also giving thanks
to his family...</i>

1009
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,359
I'm making
a bread plaque of my house

1010
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,319
with the family stood outside the front.

1011
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,720
<i>...which is soon
getting a new addition.</i>

1012
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,720
Very excited about being a dad.
Looking forward to it.

1013
00:47:26,799 --> 00:47:29,680
We're expecting a boy.
Stacey says I'm laid-back with kids.

1014
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,240
It will be baking, DIY, driving.

1015
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,480
<i>Dave's giving his Hampshire home</i>

1016
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,839
<i>far-flung flavours
inspired by a holiday to Mexico.</i>

1017
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,319
<i>Woven hibiscus and guava bread
will sit under a mango-chili roof.</i>

1018
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,720
- Are you doing a shed?
- No shed. That's in the back garden.

1019
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:50,799
- What about a driveway? Garage?
- No driveway.

1020
00:47:50,879 --> 00:47:52,480
- Recycling bins?
- No.

1021
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,040
- Anything else, Matt?
- Decking outside.

1022
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,720
- No decking.
- No.

1023
00:47:56,799 --> 00:47:59,480
I just think, 'cause it's 2020,
maybe some solar panels.

1024
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,280
We don't have solar panels, so...

1025
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,600
- You don't?
- No.

1026
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,960
I might get a solar panel on my head
just to give me more energy.

1027
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,400
Over the long run,
it'd be cheaper than coffee.

1028
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,120
Ah.

1029
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,359
- <i>Dave's not the only baker...</i>
- What part of my house is that?

1030
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,440
<i>...grateful for their humble abode.</i>

1031
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,280
I live with my aunt, my uncle
and my two cousins.

1032
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:20,480
It's by the beach.
It's a lovely place to be.

1033
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,000
So I'm making my house.

1034
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,760
<i>Lottie's sun-dried tomato
and chorizo beach house</i>

1035
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,080
<i>will be surrounded by
pesto palm trees and bushes.</i>

1036
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,640
I am doing this in a proving bag

1037
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,520
so that I can work on it
whilst it's proving.

1038
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,319
<i>While Lottie and Dave are finding
it hard enough to build one house...</i>

1039
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,120
It's not easy when restricted.

1040
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,720
It makes it look like
I'm performing some bizarre operation.

1041
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,520
<i>...Peter's taking on an entire city.</i>

1042
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,640
I'm making
an Edinburgh cityscape bread plaque.

1043
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,879
I made these and did the drawing myself.

1044
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,359
<i>But he's got one more step
before construction can begin.</i>

1045
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,319
I've chosen to make a bagel dough
because after you've boiled it,

1046
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,040
and it sets its shape, you're able
to get pretty precise cuts out of it.

1047
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:05,120
<i>A seeded multigrain dough
will form the rocky backdrop</i>

1048
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,359
<i>to his poppy seed-covered
Edinburgh landmarks.</i>

1049
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,760
We did have a little practice
on bagels yesterday.

1050
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,680
I think I'm gonna slightly change
how I do it in response to their comments.

1051
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,520
I want to try
and make it slightly lighter.

1052
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,440
Bakers, you have one hour left.

1053
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,879
Oh, Matthew.

1054
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,879
Time's disappearing already.

1055
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,160
Just have to crack on.

1056
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,839
This is the trunk of the tree.

1057
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,160
Concerned about Rowan.

1058
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,280
He's confident
he'll get this finished in time,

1059
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,120
but he is taking on a lot, again.

1060
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,920
Crack on with the decoration.

1061
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,280
I agree with you.
There is such a lot going on.

1062
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,720
I hope to goodness he finishes.

1063
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:42,960
There is a plan.
I know that's surprising.

1064
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,480
And so far, I think I'm going to it.

1065
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,040
I'm not happy with the rise.
It needs a bit more time.

1066
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,839
- Hermine is doing brioche.
- Brioche in three and a half hours

1067
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,000
- is tricky to do.
- Yeah.

1068
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,600
It'll be interesting to see,

1069
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,000
with her French background,
what she can come up with.

1070
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,720
I'm gonna carry on proving this.

1071
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:01,920
<i>While Hermine's wait goes on...</i>

1072
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,080
It's looking good.

1073
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,200
<i>...the rest of the bakers'
dough has finished proving.</i>

1074
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,560
I'm happy with my tiger bread.
That's come up lovely. Ooh.

1075
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,040
<i>And their intricate designs
can now begin to take shape.</i>

1076
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,839
So, here we go.

1077
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,799
<i>The judges are expecting
a variety of bread-shaping techniques.</i>

1078
00:50:18,879 --> 00:50:21,520
I've tried to show twists
and some plaits,

1079
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,000
but hoping that my flavours
will make up for the fact

1080
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,319
that I'm not the most intricate of bakers.

1081
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:28,399
This is my frozen-apple puree.

1082
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,359
They're out of the straws,
and braided over.

1083
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,200
Just wanna make sure
I've got a good definition in there.

1084
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,520
<i>But the bakers
need to work quickly.</i>

1085
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,120
Bread's gonna keep proving,

1086
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,799
so you're not gonna get
anything defined enough

1087
00:50:39,879 --> 00:50:41,560
if you don't get your move on.

1088
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,040
Not very good at plaiting.

1089
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,879
So it is a little bit tricky.

1090
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,080
It's not as good-looking
as the other one.

1091
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,200
I'm happy with the way that
that's come around, yeah.

1092
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,799
Hopefully, when it bakes,
it won't get too many...

1093
00:50:55,879 --> 00:50:57,359
Like a hernia.

1094
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,080
This is the canopy of the tree.

1095
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,640
It looks like a bit of a shambles
at the moment.

1096
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,440
But a few well-placed details
can bring the whole thing to life.

1097
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,600
Pears go on next.

1098
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,680
Does that look like a tractor?
Not quite, does it?

1099
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,480
These are the tomatoes
with feta inside.

1100
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,560
This is the Forth Rail Bridge.

1101
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,799
I'll give it a red egg wash
before going in the oven.

1102
00:51:17,879 --> 00:51:20,960
It comes out a rusty red colour.
Looks similar to the real thing.

1103
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,680
The tyres will be sprayed gold.

1104
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,176
I think Paul's gonna hate it, but...

1105
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,440
He doesn't like glitter,
he doesn't like theatre.

1106
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,920
I mean, pretty sad life, if you ask me.

1107
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,080
- Have you seen Matt in <i>Les Mis?</i>
- I did.

1108
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,280
He was amazing.
I genuinely mean it when I say

1109
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,399
it was the best thing I've seen
in the West End.

1110
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,200
- Really?
- I saw it five times.

1111
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,440
Wow. It's quite a mess over here.

1112
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,560
I think I'm the messy one
out of the group.

1113
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,399
- Look at it.
- I'm all right with that.

1114
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,240
- I got loads to do.
- I know. Sorry.

1115
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:46,319
- Bye-bye.
- Love you.

1116
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,359
I have a wheel.
It's starting to come together.

1117
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,839
This is my twist to go on the outside.

1118
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,040
How far can I make that stretch?
Oh, well, that's sad.

1119
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,200
How about if I just do that?
No one would ever know.

1120
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,640
This is a tiger glaze. I've tamed it down

1121
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,680
so that it doesn't crack up too much.

1122
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,480
I'm painting it with spirulina.

1123
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,560
And then I've got some beetroot powder
on the tomatoes.

1124
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,879
Stacey's pregnant,
and a furlough belly for me.

1125
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,160
Hopefully, the dough will rise
in the right places.

1126
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,600
I'm going in.

1127
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,520
For possibly the last time.

1128
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,720
Please be good to me, Mr Bread.

1129
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,359
Don't drop it. Don't drop it.

1130
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,359
I'm gonna put it in for 35.
Yeah! In she goes.

1131
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,600
I'm gonna have
about four minutes to spare, I think.

1132
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,680
I'm having to rush these.
I'm really out of time now,

1133
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,280
and I need to get this in the oven.

1134
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,680
You have half an hour left.

1135
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,560
- All right, it's gone in.
- That's 30 minutes.

1136
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,720
Oh, crumbs! Right. I'm going in.

1137
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,520
Let's get on with some baking!

1138
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:54,600
That was really close.

1139
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,240
It needs 30 minutes.
I've got exactly 30 minutes.

1140
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,319
My brioche, it hasn't proved
as well as I wanted.

1141
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,600
I'm gonna give it a bit more time.

1142
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,120
It feels like
that's the challenge over, though.

1143
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,120
It's really weird.

1144
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,160
Have a little clean-up now.

1145
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,760
I take every opportunity I can
just to take a mindful breath.

1146
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:21,319
Just kind of bring me back
to the present moment.

1147
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:22,920
'Cause when we're worrying,

1148
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,240
we're worrying about things in our past.

1149
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:27,480
I shouldn't have floured it,
to be honest.

1150
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,640
Or they're worrying about the future.

1151
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,640
- Have enough time to cook it?
- I hope so.

1152
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,640
And ultimately, we've got
no control over that, have we?

1153
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,520
Of course, it's easier said than done.

1154
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,600
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes.

1155
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,040
Paul Hollywood wants bread,

1156
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,799
and if he doesn't get it,
he's gonna be furious.

1157
00:53:43,879 --> 00:53:46,240
You ain't baking, you're gonna be quaking!

1158
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:49,359
That should take
about 15 minutes, hopefully.

1159
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,879
I think it's gonna be really close.

1160
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,319
I'm just worried about the base.

1161
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:56,600
So I think I might up it, you know.

1162
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,879
Oh, it's coming out now.

1163
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,359
Not bad.

1164
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,760
Hopefully it's baked.

1165
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,720
That does sound hollow.
That sounds brilliant.

1166
00:54:07,799 --> 00:54:10,280
- We're good.
- Let's trim those bits off.

1167
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:13,920
Lots of leaves to paint green,
so I need to get busy with that.

1168
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,040
I'll give it some makeup.

1169
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,040
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1170
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,440
I think it's cooked.

1171
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,320
- Just us in the oven?
- Just us three.

1172
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,720
Hmm. That's too big.

1173
00:54:25,799 --> 00:54:27,600
Just take it carefully and slowly.

1174
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,240
- There's a lot to trim.
- Going in.

1175
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,440
Everyone is out...

1176
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,600
This is my chilli oil.

1177
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,359
Bakers, your time is up.

1178
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:41,200
Please step away from your bread.

1179
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:44,839
Amazing.

1180
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,200
- Well done, Hermine.
- Ooh!

1181
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,760
It'll taste appalling,
but I'm pleased with the look.

1182
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,680
We'll go with it.
Just hope I've done enough.

1183
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:04,319
<i>It's judgment time
for our bakers' decorative bread plaques.</i>

1184
00:55:04,399 --> 00:55:07,000
Hermine, would you like
to bring up your showstopper?

1185
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,640
Looks a bit abstract.

1186
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,560
- You're driving through vineyards?
- Yes.

1187
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,359
- These?
- That's supposed to be farmer's field

1188
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,040
- and a tractor.
- A tractor.

1189
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,440
- Yes.
- I see, okay.

1190
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,520
You've lost a bit of definition
in the swirl on the outside,

1191
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,399
but overall, it looks good.

1192
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,160
Let's have a look
at the frame to start with.

1193
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,040
This is the brioche.

1194
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,319
Yes.

1195
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:39,520
- And the main bit is the focaccia.
- Yeah.

1196
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,720
The brioche doesn't hold much flavour.

1197
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:46,160
I knew you were gonna struggle
to get that out in time.

1198
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,560
It's an enriched dough,
but it's not a brioche.

1199
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,520
- Focaccia's lovely.
- Thank you.

1200
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,080
It's springy. I like both, actually.

1201
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,879
The focaccia is not bad.
But I do like the design.

1202
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,839
- It's very, very good.
- Thank you.

1203
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,000
I think it looks quite dramatic
and effective.

1204
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,920
The plait on the outside
is not bad.

1205
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,520
I like the effect you've got
by interlacing the two.

1206
00:56:10,359 --> 00:56:11,600
Texture looks good.

1207
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:15,680
I think that is beautifully seasoned.

1208
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,080
The tomato bread is nice.
It's got a nice zing.

1209
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,920
But more importantly, it's the structure,

1210
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,879
the air bubbles, it's regular,
and it's even all the way down.

1211
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,359
- It's a nice loaf.
- Thank you.

1212
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,920
Did you try one of the balls?

1213
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,560
They've got feta inside.

1214
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,000
Mmm.

1215
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,600
That is delicious.

1216
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,000
- Can I go?
- Yes, absolutely.

1217
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,040
Your agony is over.

1218
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,600
- Well done, Sura.
- Thank you.

1219
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,240
I love your Victorian swags
of great velvet curtain.

1220
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,680
Your gilded tassels are wonderful.

1221
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,440
It's simple, but effective.

1222
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,120
- Shall we have a look?
- Yeah.

1223
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,560
It's a focaccia base
with pancetta and cheese.

1224
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,680
It's got quite a punch.

1225
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,280
Your ingredient choices are good.

1226
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:05,240
The problem is focaccia
is a very, very light dough

1227
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:07,600
and you put that
on top of it so it couldn't rise.

1228
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,680
So what it did is
concertina back down again

1229
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,560
and so it feels quite raw.

1230
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,839
It's a pity, because when you get
the edge of the focaccia,

1231
00:57:14,919 --> 00:57:15,919
it's really nice bread.

1232
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,640
The chili bread's got a kick to it.

1233
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,759
Not bad at all.

1234
00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:24,440
I think it's full of flavour,
but textures weren't right.

1235
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,560
It's simple, sort of effective.

1236
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,600
I think you could've done more with it.

1237
00:57:36,279 --> 00:57:37,720
Your flavours are coming from

1238
00:57:37,799 --> 00:57:40,520
the seeds on the top of the dried herbs.
They carry through.

1239
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,960
- It's a nice eat.
- It tastes very nice.

1240
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,640
I just feel it's a little dense and tough.

1241
00:57:46,399 --> 00:57:47,960
You made a bagel like a pitta.

1242
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,560
- It's a little weird.
- It is, isn't it?

1243
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,919
A bread shouldn't do that.

1244
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,399
It's like a piece of leather.

1245
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,879
Oh, Peter.

1246
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,960
The design's pretty good.

1247
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,080
You kept some definition in there, too.

1248
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,839
The bread is well risen,
it feels great,

1249
00:58:12,919 --> 00:58:14,600
- but it lacks flavour.
- Okay.

1250
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,359
- And this is tomato and paprika.
- Yes.

1251
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,440
Yeah, tomato, paprika and chorizo.

1252
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,440
- That packs a punch. That's nice.
- Yes.

1253
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,520
Nice balance of flavour with it.

1254
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,399
Nice bread. Should've
done more with that...

1255
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,320
- Very nice.
- ...rather than the white.

1256
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,480
I like the concept,
I like the design, I love the cow.

1257
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,080
We drunk milk straight from the cow
when we was children.

1258
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,279
- From the udders?
- Not quite.

1259
00:58:38,359 --> 00:58:40,000
Wow.

1260
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,279
Remind me of the flavour again?

1261
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:44,040
It's olive and tiger bread.

1262
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,600
That's not tiger-bread topping.

1263
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,720
It's the flavours of it,
but not so much the cracking.

1264
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:49,960
Okay.

1265
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,279
- It's dense.
- Needs more olives.

1266
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,839
More proving's needed.
More flavour's needed.

1267
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,359
Interesting trees.

1268
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,279
Little bit bulky
compared to the rest of it.

1269
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:04,240
I like the bee.

1270
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,960
The plaiting's a little bit
irregular, thick and then thin.

1271
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:17,520
The structure's not bad, because actually,
you do have a light crust.

1272
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,200
It is wetter on the mouth,
which is what you want.

1273
00:59:20,279 --> 00:59:21,720
Flavour's not that strong, though,

1274
00:59:21,799 --> 00:59:23,399
considering you're using wild garlic,

1275
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,680
you should be getting
a serious kick from that.

1276
00:59:25,759 --> 00:59:27,319
This one's got apple and cinnamon?

1277
00:59:27,399 --> 00:59:29,160
In the middle, yeah.

1278
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,480
Mmm. The apple
and cinnamon is really nice.

1279
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:34,160
It's a bit basic, the picture,
but the bread is okay.

1280
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,480
Well, it looks really surprising

1281
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,919
and pretty, and quite neat.
Certainly colourful.

1282
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,160
If you dig deeper around the edges,

1283
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,120
it's a bit weak on the plaiting.
It's slightly underproved,

1284
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,456
- and ripped in the oven.
- Okay.

1285
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,839
But this particular area here is gorgeous.

1286
00:59:52,919 --> 00:59:55,080
- Thank you.
- Really nice. Neat, clever.

1287
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,319
It's intricate detail, isn't it?

1288
00:59:57,399 --> 01:00:01,200
Oh, look.
That looks like nice bread.

1289
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,399
The flavour of the brown's not bad.

1290
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,319
- It could do with more salt.
- Okay.

1291
01:00:06,399 --> 01:00:09,080
Fennel one is nice.
Overall, I like those flavours.

1292
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:12,000
- Thank you.
- I think you've done a really good job.

1293
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,560
It looks good, tastes good,
smells good. It is good.

1294
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,720
- Great.
- Thank you.

1295
01:00:16,759 --> 01:00:18,440
- Thank you very much.
- Well done.

1296
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,640
Thank you very much.

1297
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,600
Your wife's pregnant?

1298
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,080
Yes. Although I do look
more pregnant than she does.

1299
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,359
I was gonna say.

1300
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,600
It's called sympathetic pregnancy.

1301
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,759
I would've spent time
cutting bricks out

1302
01:00:32,839 --> 01:00:35,720
and placed them on
and just built up that brickwork look.

1303
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,080
You sort of get it,
but it would look nice with that.

1304
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,160
Okay.

1305
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,480
This is the one with...

1306
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,000
Mango, lime and chili paste
running through.

1307
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,120
You certainly get
the mango and the chilli.

1308
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,720
I like the flavour.
Never had anything like that.

1309
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,600
But I think the bread's a little too dry.

1310
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,120
- It's overbaked.
- Okay.

1311
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,279
The flavour of the base?

1312
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,319
That is hibiscus and guava flavour drops.

1313
01:00:57,399 --> 01:00:59,560
I've never met guava flavour.

1314
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,440
Never had an Um Bongo, Prue?

1315
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,279
- Never been to the Congo?
- I know guavas well,

1316
01:01:04,359 --> 01:01:06,799
- but I've never known it as an essence.
- Right.

1317
01:01:06,879 --> 01:01:08,120
And I can't really taste it.

1318
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,680
The ideas are unique.
Never tried either before.

1319
01:01:10,759 --> 01:01:12,560
Just that the baking was a little too far.

1320
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,720
- Yeah. Fair enough.
- Thank you.

1321
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,040
- You need a hand, right?
- I do, please.

1322
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,520
Let's do this.

1323
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,359
- Is that gonna fit?
- Let's hope.

1324
01:01:27,799 --> 01:01:29,359
Well, Rowan.

1325
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,919
I think it looks great.
I think it looks quite attractive.

1326
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,839
Very big.

1327
01:01:32,919 --> 01:01:35,879
- What's the bread?
- Worcestershire, blue cheese

1328
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,960
and pears soaked in local cider.

1329
01:01:42,759 --> 01:01:44,160
Get the cider.

1330
01:01:45,279 --> 01:01:46,560
Where's the blue cheese?

1331
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,759
- Well, I pressed it in.
- You pressed it in?

1332
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:50,279
That's why we don't get the taste.

1333
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:52,520
- Right.
- I would've mixed it in the dough.

1334
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,000
And you needed much more proving in that.

1335
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,960
Keeping these restrained to keep the look.

1336
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,520
You've gone for all style
and no substance.

1337
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,919
You've ended up with a bread
which is quite bland.

1338
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,920
- Right.
- What's the flavour of that one?

1339
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,879
That is chestnut and walnut.

1340
01:02:08,919 --> 01:02:11,200
Again, walnuts, lot more.

1341
01:02:11,279 --> 01:02:13,879
It's such a pity,
'cause that's much nicer bread.

1342
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,759
Should we try the earthy one?

1343
01:02:16,839 --> 01:02:18,000
I can smell the truffle.

1344
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,960
Definitely has more flavour,
but it could do with some salt.

1345
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,200
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.

1346
01:02:23,279 --> 01:02:24,560
Many thanks.

1347
01:02:26,359 --> 01:02:28,040
All style, no substance, that's me.

1348
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,440
I'd rather be all style,
no substance anyway.

1349
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:34,680
Somewhat disappointed.
I was very happy with the look of it

1350
01:02:34,759 --> 01:02:38,000
and so, I'm glad to have
done what I could do.

1351
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,399
Feeling a little uneasy.

1352
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,399
I might be home tomorrow,
but, erm, I haven't phoned her yet.

1353
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,319
It would mean a lot
to come back next week.

1354
01:02:44,399 --> 01:02:46,040
That went better than expected.

1355
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,759
I hear these things from my parents,

1356
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:49,640
and think,
"It's 'cause you're my parents."

1357
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,480
But it's nice to hear it from them.

1358
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,080
I'm really happy with that.

1359
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,560
It'd feel amazing, I think,

1360
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,160
if they called out that
I was Star Baker for the week.

1361
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,480
But, yeah, I don't know how I'd handle it.

1362
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,040
How do you think that went?

1363
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,160
Overall, the standard wasn't good.

1364
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,240
I think they feel a lot of pressure
on Bread Week to impress you

1365
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,480
and often, they implode.

1366
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,440
They needed to come in strong.

1367
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,080
If you're not confident, it shows.

1368
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,520
Sura and Marc E,

1369
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:21,200
those two worked with terrific confidence
and they're bang in your face.

1370
01:03:21,279 --> 01:03:24,080
They both managed to get
the right texture, the right flavour,

1371
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,319
the right look.

1372
01:03:25,399 --> 01:03:28,160
- So, Star Baker, Marc E and Sura.
- Yeah.

1373
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,000
What about Hermine?
She had a handshake.

1374
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,759
Hermine has got a possibility.
Technical wasn't brilliant.

1375
01:03:32,839 --> 01:03:36,160
And her showstopper,
I didn't like the enriched dough.

1376
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,919
Who do you think's at the bottom?

1377
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,600
- Obviously Rowan. Anyone else?
- Peter's in trouble.

1378
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,640
I also think David's in trouble.

1379
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,640
- Our two previous Star Bakers.
- Yeah.

1380
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,040
In defence of Rowan,

1381
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,200
his showstopper really looked like
a showstopper, didn't it?

1382
01:03:49,279 --> 01:03:51,439
Again, style and substance.
It lacked flavour.

1383
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,799
But how much flavour
do breads really need?

1384
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,080
- You've crossed the line.
- I've crossed the line.

1385
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,680
Do you wanna fight, Matt?

1386
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,120
So, bakers, congratulations.

1387
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,879
I know it's been a long couple of days.

1388
01:04:14,439 --> 01:04:16,480
One of you is Star Baker

1389
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,160
and that person is...

1390
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:21,359
Marc E.

1391
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,759
Wow.

1392
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,040
Oh, bakers, that means
I've got the horrible job

1393
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,279
of sending someone home.

1394
01:04:32,879 --> 01:04:38,640
The person who is leaving us is...

1395
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,080
Rowan.

1396
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:51,399
That's fine.

1397
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,600
These boots were made for walking.

1398
01:04:54,919 --> 01:04:57,040
I feel very content, really.

1399
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,839
I've had a wonderful time.

1400
01:04:58,919 --> 01:05:02,359
Erm, it is exhausting, but very rewarding.

1401
01:05:02,439 --> 01:05:04,240
Bring it in. Bring it in, kids.

1402
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:05,439
Sorry, Rowan.

1403
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,000
And I was also quite pleased
that Noel said to me,

1404
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,520
"I'm all style and no substance."

1405
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,240
He said, "It's on my CV."

1406
01:05:12,439 --> 01:05:13,919
Gonna miss those laughs.

1407
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,080
Oh!

1408
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,799
Rowan's been such a character.
I'm sorry to see him go

1409
01:05:18,879 --> 01:05:22,839
because he is so ambitious
and so imaginative

1410
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,879
and he puts so much thought
into his baking.

1411
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,560
He delivered a showstopper

1412
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,960
which was very impressive to look at,

1413
01:05:31,439 --> 01:05:33,000
but it just didn't taste good.

1414
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,520
Gonna miss you, Rowan.

1415
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,839
Such mixed emotions.
Sad for Rowan, ecstatic for Marc

1416
01:05:37,919 --> 01:05:41,040
'cause he really deserved
and needed that for his confidence.

1417
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,560
I just got Star Baker, didn't I?

1418
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,640
On Bread Week.
It's the thing that I enjoy making.

1419
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,960
It's the thing that started me on
this whole baking experience.

1420
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,759
To get Star Baker is amazing.

1421
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,439
- Well done.
- Thank you.

1422
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,520
It was really good.

1423
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:58,040
Marc did really well in the signature.
Pretty well in the technical, too.

1424
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,359
And in the showstopper,

1425
01:05:59,439 --> 01:06:02,080
he managed to get his dough risen
and tasting good.

1426
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,839
So, the whole Buddhist ethos
really worked for him.

1427
01:06:06,439 --> 01:06:07,960
Hey!

1428
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,240
- Well done for being Star Baker.
- Thank you.

1429
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:11,600
Hey, Gibbygibs.

1430
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,160
- Thank you, girls.
- Love you.

1431
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,919
I love you, too. You're the best.

1432
01:06:15,759 --> 01:06:16,759
Thank you.

1433
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,240
Oh, you made me get emotional now.

1434
01:06:24,423 --> 01:06:27,423
