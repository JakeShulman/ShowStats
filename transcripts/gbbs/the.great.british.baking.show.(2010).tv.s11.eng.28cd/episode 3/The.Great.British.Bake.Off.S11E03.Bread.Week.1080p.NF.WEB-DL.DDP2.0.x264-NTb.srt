00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,040
- Uncle Noel.
- Yeah.

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,400
You know what week it is? I'll tell you.
It's Bread Week, Paul's favourite.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,320
- Wanna see something amazing?
- Yes.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,959
I was messing about in Paul's
dressing room last night and I found this.

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,160
Check this out.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,400
[both gasp]

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,560
- [Noel] It's the Hollywood handshake.
- Wow!

8
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,760
- Shall we try it out?
- Yes, please, actually.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,160
- I'll be Paul.
- Thank you.

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,080
- Really like your baps.
- Thank you, actually.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,640
- [electricity zapping]
- [yelps]

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,360
It's too powerful!

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,080
- Too powerful.
- [groans]

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,520
Hi, guys. You all right?

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,480
- Good?
- All right.

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,520
Have you been playing with my handshake?

17
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:53,120
- [Noel] No.
- What handshake?

18
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,640
Because if you have, you get this!

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,640
- [exclaims]
- All right?

20
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,680
[both] Welcome
to <i>The Great British Baking Show.</i>

21
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,759
- [Noel] <i>Now...</i>
- Whack it.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,080
- [Noel] <i>...the bakers face trial by bread.</i>
- [Lottie] It's a shame Paul's judging it.

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,840
[Noel] <i>A soda-bread signature...</i>

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,240
[Hermine] Interesting flavours. [laughs]

00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,119
[Noel] <i>...a technicolour technical...</i>

- Yes. [laughs]

27
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,800
[Noel] <i>...and a showstopper challenge</i>
<i>where transforming dough...</i>

<i>- ...into intricate bread plaits...</i>

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,040
- [Hermine] Might be ready in time to bake.
- I hope so.

30
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,360
- [Noel] <i>...will push the bakers...</i>
- [Laura] Don't drop it.

31
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,360
- [Noel] <i>...to their limits.</i>
- [liquid splatters]

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,119
[Marc laughing]

33
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,080
It's not funny.

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,320
- Yuck.
- [squelch]

35
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,640
[opening theme music playing]

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,199
Bread's the one area
I've probably got more experience in.

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,960
But am I confident? I don't know.

38
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,320
Bread is something
that I've had to teach myself for this.

39
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,160
I wish I hadn't practised, to be honest.
I felt more confident before.

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,040
[Laura] l like making bread at home,
in my kitchen, with music on,

41
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,040
but under the eyes of Paul Hollywood?

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,400
Bit scary.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You have to laugh about it,
because we all dreading it.

44
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,680
Hello. Welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your signature challenge.

45
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,519
Today, the judges would like you to make
two beautifully baked soda bread loaves.

46
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,640
Now, you may flavour your soda breads
any way you like,

47
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,640
but one should be sweet
and one should be savoury.

48
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,600
Also, your loaves should be baked
free-form,

49
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,760
- not in a tin.
- What do you mean, free-form?

50
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,799
- Just floatin' in the air?
- Yes.

51
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,480
And the judges would like you each
to make a butter to go with your breads.

52
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,640
Blimey! They don't want much, do they?

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,239
- Oh!
- [chuckles]

54
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,160
You have one hours, 45 minute.

55
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,200
- On your marks...
- Get set...

56
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,320
Bake!

57
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:09,959
- [Marc] Okay, let's go.
- Feeling good and ready to go.

58
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,239
[Mark] I'm excited about soda breads.

59
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,600
Gran used to make us soda bread
every day. I hope I do a good job.

60
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:18,600
[Matt] <i>As opposed to a slow prove</i>
<i>with yeasted breads,</i>

61
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:23,040
<i>the chemical raising agent in soda breads
starts work almost immediately.</i>

62
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,920
And bicarb into my mixture.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,560
[Matt] <i>So they must get their loaves</i>
<i>into the oven as quickly as possible</i>

64
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,399
<i>in order to achieve the rise
the judges are after.</i>

65
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,519
Cream of tartar. I'm not sure
what it's doing in my recipe.

66
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,040
I'm sure it plays a role.

67
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,040
This challenge is only
an hour and three-quarters,

68
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:43,600
so they won't deal with yeast,
but they gotta deal with the reaction

69
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:47,720
between the rising agents and milk or
buttermilk to create growth in the loaf.

70
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,440
We've asked our bakers to make two
soda breads, one sweet and one savoury.

71
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,959
I'm expecting lots of cheese,
and lots of herbs, and lots of nuts.

72
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,600
It would be really nice to find somebody
using something really different.

73
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,720
Za'atar is more like an aromatic spice.

74
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,160
Traditionally, we have it in pastries,
on top of breads,

75
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,920
so it's perfect for this.

76
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,239
[Paul] They'll be nervous 'cause it's
their first time on Bread Week with me,

77
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,519
but I think I've given them
an easy challenge. It's soda bread.

78
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,160
Listen to me, Paul Hollywood.
I wanna talk to you about bread.

79
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,720
You go on about bread,
and you go on about bread.

80
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,240
No one under the age of 40
eats bread anymore.

81
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
- [chuckles]
- Okay?

82
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,800
- Morning.
- Hello. Morning. Morning.

83
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,680
Mark, tell us about your soda bread.

84
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,120
My savoury soda bread is a sobrasada
and an Irish sheep's-milk cheese.

85
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,000
And then my sweet soda bread
is a Irish stout and chocolate.

86
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,440
- You're baking for Ireland today.
- I am, yes.

87
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,440
I have the weight of a nation
on my shoulders.

88
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,840
- Are you Irish?
- I am. Yeah.

89
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,919
- I'm joking.
- [laughs]

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,960
- Hello, Mark speaking.
- [Noel] <i>Mark loves to travel</i>

<i>will blend the chocolate in his sweet loaf
with a classic stout.</i>

96
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,520
- What's the liquid you're putting in?
- Melted butter and honey.

97
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,919
- Interesting. No buttermilk?
- Sorry, and buttermilk. Sorry, yeah.

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,080
- I was gonna say.
- Of course buttermilk.

99
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,280
This is a tip,
going through the competition,

100
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,200
when he says "interesting,"
that means you've done it wrong.

101
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,440
- Done it wrong? Okay.
- [laughing]

102
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,760
[Matt] <i>Along with Mark, three others</i>
<i>are using a location as their inspiration.</i>

103
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,720
I lived in Chester for a little while,
and I used to love the Welsh <i>bara brith</i>.

104
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,840
So, I've based my sweet one
on that <i>bara brith</i> flavour,

105
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,400
which is just like a bread pud,
in a sense.

108

[Linda] Hey!

109
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,440

110

<i>while her love for traditional Welsh
tea cakes has inspired her sweet loaf.</i>

111
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,160
- [Linda] Lots of fruit in it.
- Mmm-hmm. Nice.

112
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,080

This is the salsiccia,
the Italian sausage.

120
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,479
So, I'll just get it fried off
in a moment. Get a quick start.

128
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,960
- [Prue] It's quite a lot.
- It is, isn't it? There's a shock.

129
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,440
[laughs]

130
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,320
I just hope they work in combination.
I think they do.

131
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,440
When you say polenta you've got in there,
what's the polenta to the flour mix?

132
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,440
370 grams of polenta and 130 flour.

133
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,160
So, it is quite gritty. It's a risky one.
Some don't like the grittiness. I like it.

134
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:08,799
Okay, thank you. Interesting.

135
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,080

a Cornish-themed soda bread,

138

so I'm using Cornish Kern.
It's based on the Cornish Yarg.

139
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,320
Quite strong actually,
but not overpowering.

140
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,479
I thought it might work well for this.

141
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120

"You make a really good Turkish <i>pide</i>,"

If you use a pizza stone,
you get more even heat distribution,

233
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,199
The sweet bread, it's sort of based
on my Nana Peg's scones that she does.

234

Soda bread's kinda like a scone.

So, I'm doing this one
as a tribute to her.

236
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,480
So I've made my marzipan.
I've found that when I put it in in lumps,

237
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,520
it kind of goes very stodgy,
so I'm gonna grate it in.

241
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:03,400
So I'm just crumbling the butter
into the flours and sugar.

242
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,560
Gives it more of a scone-like texture.

[Matt] <i>Dave's sweet loaf</i>
<i>is inspired by his favourite nut mix,</i>

296
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,040
<i>and he's confident that bacon and cheese
will prove to be a savoury sensation.</i>

297
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,680
I enjoyed coming up with the flavours
and making flavours that I like,

298
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,280
but also a lot of people
would like, as well.

299
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,240
That's ready. Thirty-five minutes.

300
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:39,520
[Noel] <i>With their second soda breads</i>
<i>in the oven,</i>

301
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:42,599
<i>it's time to concentrate
on the complementary butters.</i>

302
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,880
Butter, would you believe,
is the easiest thing to make in the world.

303
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,280
That's a thick double cream,

304
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,079
and it'll go past that stage
and turn into butter.

305
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,680
[Sura] And when it curdles,
you strain all the milk fluids out of it.

306
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
And that's it.

307
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,199
[Laura] I've never made butter.

308
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,599
I mean, it's lovely. It's very twee.

309
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,280
But why would you make butter?

310
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,839
[Mark] Added some more Irish stout
into the butter

311
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,319
to give it a bit of a kick.

312
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,920
[Linda] This is from Mak who left us,
sadly, on the last program.

313
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,400
He didn't have a chance
to showcase his honey.

314
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,920
So that's going in for Mak.

315
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,319
[Hermine] Black garlic tastes
a bit like balsamic vinegar.

316
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,319
Don't ask me why I choose it.
I just thought I'd be a bit wild.

317
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,800
Let's see if that works.

318
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,920
Or it could well be my ticket home.

319
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,719
[chuckling]

320
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,640
[indistinct chatter]

321
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:32,959
Paul's amazed at your baking knowledge,
'cause you're so young.

322
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,719
- [Peter] I hope I'm showing knowledge.
- [Noel] He fears you.

323
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,640
He knows that eventually,
the apprentice kills the master.

324
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,040
Be an interesting end to <i>Bake Off.</i>

325
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,439
- What is it, ten minutes?
- Yes.

326
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,880
- I'll tell them.
- Yeah.

327
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,280
- Okay.
- Ten minutes.

328
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,599
- Bakers, you have ten minutes.
- Ten.

329
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,400
[chuckles] You might need to do it louder.

330
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,959
[Matt] Bakers, you have ten minutes.

331
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,000
[Lottie] Let's see
what we're dealing with.

332
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:58,640
It's hot. Ooh.

333
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,160
It's spread a bit more than
I'd have liked, but, no,

334
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,599
it's traditional, that shape,
so it's perfect.

335
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,920
I'm tapping it to hear
if it's hollow inside.

336
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,880
I think that's okay.
It's certainly cooked.

337
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,000
It could be darker in colour,
but I don't want it to overcook.

338
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,160
It's a bit of a take on a pizza
I learned to make at school.

339
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,800
Soda bread topped with tomato puree.
I wanted to do a little nod to that.

340
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,319
[Rowan] I think I'm gonna take that out.
I'm going with it.

341
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,839
It is what it is.

342
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,120
This one, it's very dense
with the marzipan.

343
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,199
So it kind of just looks raw. It's not.

344
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,839
Is that not a sign
that you shouldn't use marzipan?

345
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,560
- No, I grated it.
- Did you?

346
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,839
Yeah. [chuckles]

347
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,880
I look forward to seeing what happens.

348
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,359
Mate, it's gonna be carnage.

349
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:39,680
- Carnage.
- [laughs]

350
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,400
Oh, crumbs.

351
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:43,400
That wasn't good. It just broke off.

352
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:45,359
I'll shove it to the back,
they'll never know.

353
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,120
- Has it got enough blueberries in there?
- Look, Noel.

354
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,199
I think if he says anything
about your cake that you don't like,

355
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,959
just grab a handful of blueberries
and mush them in his face.

356
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,880
- [Noel chuckles] Mush.
- You should do it.

357
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,680
- I won't.
- [Lottie laughs]

358
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,719
My orange zest is thick.
It's not coming through the piping nozzle.

359
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,319
- It looks a bit messy.
- Bakers, you have one minute left.

360
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:09,119
So if you haven't started
making your bread yet...

361
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,280
- [laughs]
- ...now is probably a good time.

362
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:17,680
It looks kind of like a poo.

363
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,399
[Hermine] Four-leaf clover.
I need plenty of luck.

364
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,919
[Rowan] Scary moment.

365
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,120
I think we're good. Hopefully Nana Peg
will be proud of that. [laughs]

366
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,840
Bakers, your time is up.

367
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,000
Please step away from the breads.

368
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,800
Someone should tell Linda
that's not doing anything.

369
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,680
[laughs]

370
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,360
[Matt] <i>The bakers' sweet</i>
<i>and savoury soda breads</i>

371
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,880
<i>now face the judgment of Paul and Prue.</i>

372
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,000
- Hello, Mark.
- Hello.

373
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
- Hi, Mark.
- Hi.

374
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,560
They're quite impressive.
I like the stout one.

375
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,640
It's the colour I expected it to be.
This has been coloured a bit

376
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,159
but I don't really mind that,
to be honest.

377
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,320
[Mark] It's got sobrasada
and an Irish sheep's-milk cheddar.

378
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:12,840
[Paul] It's a decent soda bread.

379
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:15,480
There's flavour in there,
but you've got to hunt it.

380
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,120
[Prue] It's delicious with the top,
then you really get the flavour.

381
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,000
[Mark] And then, I've got
chocolate and Irish stout.

382
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,360
The chocolate comes through.

383
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,560
[Paul] Very good.
You get the chocolate instantly.

384
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,720
Then the stout lingers.

385
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,600
- A great loaf.
- [Prue] The butter's lovely.

386
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,040
-Good job.

387
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,679
- Thank you.
- Well done.

388
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,440
- [exhales and chuckles]
- [Matt] Whoo!

389
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,000
[Paul] They look quite rustic,
but both the same size.

390
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,640
They look quite nice.

391
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,280
The onions and the chorizo
go really well together.

392
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,800
- A little underbaked.
- [Prue] It's a pity, the edge is perfect.

393
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,480
[Paul] Glacé cherry bread.

394
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
Look at that.

395
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,360
[Paul] Can't taste the glacéed cherries,
but the marzipan is delicious.

396
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,480
The marzipan comes whacking through.

397
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
It's just lovely.

398
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,960
- [Matt] There's a good crunch.
- [Paul] Mmm.

399
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,440
[Prue] It's a really lovely texture.
Beautiful.

400
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:06,760
[Paul] A great tasting loaf.

401
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,360
- [Prue] Yes.
- You've chosen flavours

402
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,520
that work in all breads,
and olive is one of those.

403
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,000
[Lottie] And my sweet
is blueberry and maple bacon.

404
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,800
Well, the blueberries
are not exactly evenly spread, are they?

405
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,520
When I get a blueberry, it's delicious,
the texture's good.

406
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,720
I'm missing the bacon.

407
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,880
It's wasted on the outside.

408
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Lot of it's gonna end up on the plate
and you won't taste it.

409
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,560
- Thank you.
- [Lottie] Thank you.

410
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,440
[inhales and blows raspberry]

411
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,520
[Paul] They look great.

412
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,760
It's very brave to take
the gluten-free option.

413
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:37,760
Difficult though, isn't it?

414
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,240
It's falling to bits a bit

415
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,040
- and then it gets glue-y in your mouth.
- Okay.

416
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,159
- [Paul] This is the ginger?
- Ginger beer.

417
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,120
I love that, texture's beautiful.

418
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,760
Very cake-like, though, isn't it?

419
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,480
It's a little bit stodgy.

420
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,800
The flavours are delicious.

421
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,480
Your flavours are normally spot-on.

422
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,600
- [Paul] Very rustic.
- [Prue] They look classic.

423
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,560
- They're really good.
- [Paul] Hmm.

424
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
I love that.

425
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,720
- Really?
- Mmm. It's a nice loaf.

426
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,440
If you get a mouthful of everything,
it's delicious.

427
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,000
Thank you very much.

428
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,560
- [Paul] Okay.
- [Prue] This is a little doughier.

429
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,600
- [Paul] More cake-like.
- Nice flavour, though.

430
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,480
- It's cranberries, is it?
- Cranberries, chocolates, and sea salt.

431
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,000
Not getting the cranberry.

432
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,679
It's just a little bit weak.

433
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,640
Needs a bit more.

434
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,080
- [Paul] Thank you.
- Thank you.

435
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:29,399
They both look as if
they haven't risen enough.

436
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,960
- There are very big lumps of sausage.
- Yes.

437
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,280
[Rowan laughs]

438
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,000
- You always like a lot of sausage?
- Wouldn't care to comment.

439
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,480
- Okay, fair enough.
- [chuckles]

440
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,399
Actually, the sausage is okay,
the olives are okay.

441
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,919
- I would have left the bread in longer.
- Right.

442
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,679
- [Paul] See how wet...
- [Prue] That's why it's so heavy.

443
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,440
[Prue] It'd be nice if it was lighter.

444
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,200
[Paul] Wow.

445
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,679
That much polenta in there was a mistake.

446
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,240
It's too gritty for me.

447
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,360
It's a bit like eating
a lemon drizzle cake in a sandstorm.

448
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
[laughs]

449
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,919
[Prue] Looks as if it's risen nicely.

450
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,600
- Not enough flavour for me.
- [Dave] No?

451
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:10,200
- You put Gruyère?
- [Dave] Yes.

452
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,840
- You need double that, triple that.
- Yeah. Okay.

453
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,960
You do get the chocolate,
just not enough in each bite.

454
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,760
It's a shame,
'cause it's baked well, actually.

455
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,360
[Prue] Two very good loaves.

456
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,240
You just need a bit more flavour.

457
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,679
[Paul] Let's try the za'atar one first.

458
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,640
- [Prue] What oven temperature did you use?
- 160.

459
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,280
[Paul] That's why it's so pale.

460
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,399
The blend of olives
and za'atar is delicious.

461
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,760
[Prue] I like the flavour.
Right, sweet one.

462
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,679
Are the fruits mostly apricots?

463
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,679
[Sura] Apricots,
dried cherries, and walnut.

464
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,720
- I think that is delicious.
- Thank you.

465
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,439
Really, really good.

466
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,960
My only issue of both loaves
is your temperature choice.

467
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,040
You should've baked them higher
and it would've been spot-on.

468
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,159
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

469
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,360
[Paul] Looks good, but I hope
it's baked all the way through.

470
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:03,320
I get worried when they're that pale.

471
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,360
Needed a little longer in the oven.

472
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:07,880
It's such a pity
because the flavour is lovely.

473
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,720
That's a bit soggy, too.

474
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,480
Does have that spicy
<i>bara-brith</i> flavour to it.

475
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,080
When you try and push
a load of fruit into a loaf,

476
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,320
if you shape it too tight,
all the fruit goes to the outside.

477
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:21,679
There's nothing inside.

478
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,320
I like the flavour,
but unfortunately, all the fruit burnt

479
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:26,439
- on the top of the loaf, not in it.
- Yeah.

480
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,520
[Paul] They look really nice.

481
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,760
The idea of putting
the smoked salmon in it is so original.

482
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,760
I've never had that.

483
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,960
- You invented a bread.
- [whispering] Yeah!

484
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,480
That, I really like.
The salmon really works.

485
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,520
It's like a whole sandwich all in one.

486
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,960
The aftertaste is lovely.

487
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,080
- It's nice and well-baked.
- Thank you.

488
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,760
- That's a very grown-up fruit cake.
- [Prue] Mmm.

489
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,320
Lots of booze. Lovely.

490
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:53,919
I've soaked the fruit
for a couple of weeks.

491
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,399
You serious?

492
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,856
- [Prue] She wanted us to taste it.
- [Paul] Wow.

493
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,976
- [Prue] Lovely.
- Thank you.

494
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,200
I think they're very special. I really do.

495
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,480
- [all exclaiming and clapping]
- [Hermine] Oh!

496
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,439
Thank you.

497
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,720
Know what I love?
The fact that I've never had them before.

498
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,960
- Thank you.
- This has really complex flavours.

499
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,280
I love it. It's special.

500
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
Well done.

501
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,679
That's it, I'm packing.

502
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,360
Time to go home.

503
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,320
That's 2020, over.

504
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,200
That went better than I expected.
I was terrified, honestly.

505
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,399
But the flavour queen is back.

506
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,439
The comments were not entirely positive,

507
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,200
but I'm very determined learning
from the last technical

508
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,000
to spend a bit of time thinking
and not just dashing straight into it.

509
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,600
[Noel] <i>Bread Week</i>
<i>isn't about to get any easier.</i>

510
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,640
<i>Our ten bakers will now face
a technical with a twist.</i>

511
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,520
Bakers, it's time for
your technical challenge,

512
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,000
which today has been set by Paul.

513
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,480
Paul, any words of advice?

514
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,640
You need...

515
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,159
to get your timings right.

516
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,080
Yeah, he said words of advice,
not just words.

517
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,000
Your technical challenge
will be judged blind,

518
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,080
so we're gonna have to ask
these two rascals to skedaddle.

519
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,159
Off you pop.

520
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,679
So, Paul would like you to bake
six rainbow-coloured bagels.

521
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,520
[Noel] Rainbow-coloured bagels
are the same as normal bagels,

522
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,320
just with five different-coloured doughs.

523
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,720
Layered, shaped, then boiled and baked
to achieve a lovely, shiny, chewy crust.

524
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,679
Chewy crust.

525
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,480
You have two hours and 45 minutes.

526
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
- On your marks.
- [Noel] Get set.

527
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,159
Bake.

528
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,480
[Dave] Oh, my God.

529
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,200
What the hell is a rainbow bagel?
I mean...

530
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,560
No idea. [chuckles]

531
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,040
Never made them before,
certainly not the rainbow one,

532
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,880
so... interesting.

533
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,840
I've made bagels before,
but I don't wanna say,

534
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:57,560
"I've made bagels before,"
and then they come out awful.

535
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,800
[Linda] Kind of makes sense
when you read it through.

536
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,600
Just go with it. [laughs]

537
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,960
There's a bagel shop near work,
so I've seen how they make it,

538
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,399
but I've never made it myself.

539
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,720
I wouldn't have to, it's right there.

540
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Paul.

541
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,800
Paul, why rainbow-coloured bagels?

542
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,399
[Paul] Bagels are a great challenge
when you're making bread.

543
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,080
Gotta boil them, which is unusual,
and then bake them.

544
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:22,679
The rainbow colours for me,

545
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,480
although it originated over in the States,
I think it represents the NHS.

546
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,439
It does now.

547
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,080
- Certainly.
- [Prue chuckles]

548
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,880
[Paul] What they've gotta do is

549
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,439
roll each piece, each colour,
into a rectangle.

550
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,480
Lay the next one on the top and continue.

551
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,399
- Stack them.
- Yes.

552
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,240
And twist it to create that spiral
and then you seal.

553
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,280
You plunge it in the water
for anything between 15 and 40 seconds

554
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,600
and then bake it off.

555
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:47,800
Can we taste them?

556
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,960
[Paul] Absolutely.

557
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,399
[Prue] What could go wrong?

558
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,199
[Paul] You can easily overprove
and underprove a bagel.

559
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,520
If it's overproved
before it's gone in the water

560
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,439
or if it's left in the water too long,
it will flatten in the oven.

561
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,679
Absolutely delicious.

562
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,280
It's even brighter inside
than it is outside.

563
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,480
[Paul] Pretty vibrant.

564
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,919
They may have made bagels before,
but I guarantee not like this.

565
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,439
I've never made them like this.

566
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,760
Happy bread.

567
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,320
"Happy bread." That's what it is.

568
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,640
[Lottie] "Make and knead the dough."

569
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,080
It's, erm, scant, isn't it, at best?

570
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:21,280
Normally, I would
chuck it in a stand mixer.

571
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,840
We're definitely getting
a full workout today.

572
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,159
We're in 2020,
who kneads by hand? [exclaims]

573
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,720
[Peter] I know it needs to be kneaded
a good amount for a bagel,

574
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,600
so I'm gonna be working this
until it's super smooth.

575
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,600
Think it's gonna be
quite a stretchy, elastic dough.

576
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,120
It still feels a little tight.

577
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:41,240
[Rowan] Stretch and tear,
that's the way to go.

578
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,080
Rowan's doing the slap already.

579
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:44,159
Whack it.

580
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,399
It's very therapeutic, it really is.

581
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,880
[chuckling] So disappointed that there
aren't any rainbows in a rainbow bagel.

582
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,040
Real rainbows?

583
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,240
I wanted you to have to go
and catch a rainbow.

584
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,240
- Yeah.
- Lasso it.

585
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,720
- Chop it up, grate it into the bagel...
- [chuckles]

586
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,199
...but no, it's just some coloured bread.

587
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,399
[Rowan] I think that must be about it now.

588
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,560
And it says to divide the dough
into five pieces.

589
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,000
We'll colour them each a different colour.

590
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,800
[Rowan] Never done coloured bread.

591
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,120
So it's all part
of the voyage of discovery.

592
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,480
A very messy business.

593
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,360
[Marc] They wanna be nice and vibrant.

594
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,760
Really hard to mix in all the colours.

595
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,679
[Lottie] I might have used too much,

596
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,840
just judging by the fact that no one
else's bench is the same colour as mine.

597
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,679
- You're a Smurf, aren't you?
- Yes. [chuckles]

598
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,120
[Lottie] That'll do. I'm over that.

599
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:34,760
"Number four, rise."
Exceptionally descriptive.

600
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,040
Arise, Sir Dough.

601
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,960
I'm gonna leave it
to prove till it's doubled in size.

602
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,520
It's only small pieces.

603
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,800
I'm gonna go
about 20 minutes to start with.

604
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,240
And breathe. [chuckling]

605
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,120
[Rowan] I would normally snooze,
or play the piano, actually,

606
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:51,960
while the dough is rising.
Perhaps do a spot of gardening.

607
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,439
I could nip outside
and do a bit of pruning.

608
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,480
[Marc] If you prod,

609
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,080
leaves a slight indent,
then they're ready to go.

610
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:05,560
They're doing all that,
so it's time to go with them.

611
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,760
Gonna start rolling them out
in colour order, so red first.

612
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,399
Is this from the handshake?

613
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,720
[both laughing]

614
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,159
That's what happens... with Paul.

615
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,560
- That's his fake tan.
- [both laughing]

616
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,320
They can take handshakes back.

617
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,399
Oh, yeah?

618
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,159
They'll just reverse the footage.

619
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,439
[both chuckling]

620
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,000
Like... [mimics rewinding]

621
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,720
"Roll out to a rectangle,
measuring 15 by 20 centimetres."

622
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,880
I'm gonna check what
15 centimetres looks like, just so I know.

623
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:35,520
What are you comparing against?

624
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,640
Just half the ruler, Dave.

625
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,080
[chuckles]

626
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,840
[Linda] You're just layering the doughs.

627
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,639
I'm just trying
to get some kind of evenness.

628
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,760
[Rowan] Like making
brightly coloured mattresses.

629
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
They're very bouncy and very illuminous.

630
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,280
So now I'm cutting the dough into six.

631
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,760
"Roll and twist the dough to a rope,

632
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,040
measuring approximately
24 centimetres long."

633
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,840
You are approximately 24.

634
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,000
I am, aren't I?
We've got to 24 centimetres.

635
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,240
- Yeah.
- How many inches? I think in inches.

636
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,040
Erm, that's nine and a half inches.

637
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:07,840
Think that's respectable, myself.

638
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,199
[Marc] Kind of pull back on this palm,

639
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,879
and go forward on this palm.

640
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:14,360
[Hermine giggles] Oh, dear.

641
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:16,480
This is a rainbow, isn't it?

642
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,679
There you go. [chuckles]

643
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,280
[Dave] Just gotta
try and seal this bit now.

644
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,679
[Lottie] "Gently roll back and forth."

645
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,000
- Don't get it.
- I don't want it to fall apart.

646
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,120
[Laura in singsong voice]
Haven't got a clue.

647
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:34,000
[Linda] It's not too bad.
Once you get the knack of it,

648
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,280
it's like... Whoo!

649
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,639
[laughing]

650
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,480
[Lottie] Everyone's twisted theirs,
I didn't twist mine.

651
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,600
I think that's right,
'cause they're gonna expand,

652
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,879
the hole's gonna shrink.

653
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:45,720
By the time it's expanded
and shrunk, it should be about right.

654
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,720
- It does say twist.
- [Dave] Does it?

655
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,240
Yeah. It says "roll and twist."

656
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,480
Bakers, you are halfway through.

657
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:59,000
[Marc] And number ten is prove.

658
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,840
Just the one word in that step.

659
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,399
Not very elaborate, is he?

660
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,159
[Mark] Wanna give them
as much time as possible.

661
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,520
I think the trick
with these is in the timing.

662
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,679
The second prove
is gonna be the one for texture.

663
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,280
Try that again, shall we?

664
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:16,639
I'll put the drawer up a bit warmer.
See if we can get a quick prove on the go.

665
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,360
We'll see how we get on. [chuckles]

666
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:22,159
[Matt] <i>Judging the right time</i>
<i>to stop the final prove is critical.</i>

667
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,000
[Marc] It's driven me to drink green tea.

668
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,439
- Come on. That's gin, we know.
- [laughing] Yeah.

669
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,840
If I was on this competition,
I'd drink through it.

670
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:31,080
I've started drinking.
Haven't drunk in four years.

671
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:32,959
- Started drinking here again.
- [both laugh]

672
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
[exhales heavily]

673
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,040
[Matt] <i>If the bagels are underproved...</i>

674
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,240
[Rowan] Anything happening?

675
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,159
[Matt] <i>...they won't
have the dome-like rise</i>

676
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,240
<i>that Paul and Prue are expecting.</i>

677
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,159
[Hermine] Ooh, check you out!

678
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,800
They're looking good!

679
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:47,560
They don't look bad, actually.

680
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,040
[Marc] Reckon, about ready.
Right, glasses off.

681
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,000
"Bring a saucepan of water to a boil,
add the bicarbonate soda."

682
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,800
[Noel] <i>If they're overproved,</i>

683
00:30:56,879 --> 00:30:58,919
<i>they'll puff up too much
when they hit the water...</i>

684
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,760
[Mark] Who's gonna take the plunge first?

685
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,679
[Noel] <i>...and collapse</i>
<i>before they go into the oven.</i>

686
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,760
So, let's have a look.

687
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:09,360
I feel a bit nervous,
'cause I don't think they cook long.

688
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:12,520
"Cook until the bagels
are puffed and the shape has set."

689
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,040
I think this is what gives
the bagels that chewy kind of texture.

690
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,959
So I'm boiling for about
30 to 45 seconds on each side.

691
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,120
I have no idea whether that's done.

692
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,560
Have you seen
the size of them? They're huge.

693
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:29,800
Bakers, you have 30 minutes left.

694
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:31,320
- Have I missed it?
- Yes.

695
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,199
[laughing]

696
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,439
Not any more than that.

697
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,000
They go in looking good,
and then... things happen.

698
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,080
[Sura gasps] This is not a bagel.

699
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,399
It's a unicorn horn.

700
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,879
[Matt] It's hard to know.

701
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:47,199
Especially when
you never made them before.

702
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Why don't you see
what other people are doing?

703
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,360
I have been, but theirs
aren't looking terribly good, either.

704
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:53,600
[laughing]

705
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,000
[Rowan] Is that set?

706
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,560
So hard to know.
Let's have them in a bit longer.

707
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:01,280
Ooh! Paul Hollywood is definitely
taking his handshake back. [chuckles]

708
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,360
'Cause these... [groans]

709
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,840
That's them all boiled now.

710
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:06,760
Even though they've doubled in size,

711
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,639
they seem to have
lost it when I boiled them.

712
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:12,159
[Linda] I got it.

713
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,399
This one opened up, but don't tell Paul.

714
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,919
I've stuck it back together,

715
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,919
and hopefully it'll just
glue back together in the oven.

716
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,560
Going into the oven now.

717
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:24,120
- It just says "bake"!
- We'll see what the oven does with them.

718
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:26,159
Could be just a case
of getting a nice crust.

719
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,719
Twenty maximum, I think.

720
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,439
I don't know for how long.

721
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,080
I'm hoping they'll puff up again.

722
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:34,040
And it will disguise the wrinkly bits
they've now got.

723
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,520
[comical northern accent] Bakers,
you've got, ooh, ten minutes left.

724
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,959
That's not very much time, is it?

725
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:44,159
So, how do you know
they're ready? 'Cause normally,

726
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,639
they'll get brown.

727
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:47,040
These got colour.

728
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,040
[Lottie] My blue's way too dark.

729
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,280
I really don't know what I'm looking for.

730
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,360
Not loving what is going on inside there.

731
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,879
I think they're too thin and too wide.

732
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:58,320
I think they're gonna
want them to be a bit... puffier.

733
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,600
- [Noel] In there?
- [Marc] Yes.

734
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,800
They're looking <i>pretty</i> good.

735
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:04,199
[chuckling] Yours, not so much.

736
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,320
Aw, Sura looks sad.

737
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,679
- [Noel] You all right?
- Yeah.

738
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,840
- Do you want a piggyback?
- No.

739
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:10,919
Okay.

740
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,320
- Do not wanna overbake them.
- Another minute.

741
00:33:13,879 --> 00:33:16,679
- What have we got?
- Bakers, you have five minutes left.

742
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,679
[Marc] Oh!

743
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,919
[Linda] I'm looking to make sure
they're not going too brown.

744
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,159
They look great, Linda.

745
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,639
[Rowan] Mine are all wrinkled.

746
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:28,919
And they have been boiled for some time.

747
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,480
I think I'm gonna take 'em out.

748
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,040
[Laura] That looks good. Well done.

749
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,600
They sound hollow, so...

750
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,480
- [tapping]
- [Linda] They sound done.

751
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,560
Flat as pancakes.

752
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:45,560
Bakers, your time is up.

753
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,399
That's not a bagel.

754
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:50,080
[Lottie] I'll be honest.

755
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,360
I think I overcooked all of them.

756
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,280
Strategic placing.

757
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,639
[Hermine laughing] Exactly.

758
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:59,240
- [laughing]
- Mine seem kind of soft and wrinkly.

759
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,560
- [chuckling] It's not attractive.
- [laughs]

760
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:10,639
[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue are looking for</i>
<i>six vibrant rainbow-coloured bagels</i>

761
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,679
<i>that are smooth and crisp on the outside</i>

762
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,319
<i>and slightly chewy inside.</i>

763
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,360
- We've got the five different colours.
- [all laughing]

764
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,440
[Paul] Right.

765
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,080
These aren't too bad.
You've got the colours.

766
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,319
[Prue] They're quite smooth.

767
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,639
- And quite light.
- Smaller than most of the others.

768
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,920
[Paul] They're a good size.

769
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,920
- Nice, soft. Crispy on the outside.
- Mmm.

770
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,719
Er, very nice.

771
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:34,839
[Paul] Nice bread,
same size, nice, smooth,

772
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,719
and the crumb's really tasty.

773
00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:38,119
- [Prue] Good.
- [Paul] Very good.

774
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,199
Right, moving on to the hula hoops.

775
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,000
These are a little bit big,
and actually, it's overproved, it's flat.

776
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,159
[bagels crunching]

777
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,080
- Tastes all right, though.
- Mmm. Tastes fine.

778
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,440
[Paul] On to these whoppers.
They haven't been twisted.

779
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,280
You can see where it's joined,
but it's just gone round as one.

780
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,280
[Prue] Colours are nice.
Very bright and vibrant.

781
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,319
- Nice flavour. Good texture.
- Nice flavour.

782
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,560
Now moving on to this. Very, very flat.
Overproved before they went in the water,

783
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,319
then they lost all the height.
Tastes great, though.

784
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,920
Now, these are a little bit dark.

785
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Feel the crispiness?

786
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,600
- [crunching]
- [Prue] Yeah.

787
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,040
- [Paul] But the shape, uniform.
- [Prue] Hmm.

788
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,360
[crunching]

789
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,760
Actually, they're not too bad.
Just slightly overbaked.

790
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:19,720
Now these also had the issue
with the water, overproved.

791
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:22,520
- You can see the marks on it.
- [Prue] That's not at all crisp.

792
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,120
- And it's soft.
- [Paul] Underbaked.

793
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,600
- The flavour's okay, though.
- Flavour's fine.

794
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,520
[Paul] These aren't bad. Fairly smooth,
but just overdone it in the water.

795
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,280
Hmm. Good flavour.

796
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,880
[Paul] These are overbaked again.

797
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,880
- See how dark they've gone?
- [Prue] Not very attractive.

798
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,680
Bit tough.

799
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,560
[Paul] These are big.

800
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,200
They look more like pretzels.

801
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,400
But they're vibrant colours.

802
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,920
- And they are pretty smooth.
- [Prue] Mmm.

803
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,400
Yeah. That is delicious.

804
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,360
[Paul] It is nice. Now the last one.

805
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,040
Lost its way a little in the shaping,
but also with the water, as well.

806
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,160
- Again, see the marks.
- [Prue] Hmm.

807
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,040
Nice bread, though.

808
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,880
[Paul] This is gonna be
interesting to judge.

809
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:06,480
[Matt] <i>Paul and Prue</i>
<i>will now rank the bagels...</i>

810
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,000
That one second from the end's good.

811
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,799
[Matt] <i>...from worst to best.</i>

812
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,400
So, in last place, we have this one.

813
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,360
Rowan, they are overproved and underbaked.

814
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,720
In ninth spot, we have this one.

815
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:21,560
You've managed to bake this one,
but it is overproved.

816
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,160
Then, in eighth place, we have this one.

817
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,600
Sura, lovely colour.
Your twisting wasn't perfect.

818
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,799
It was a bit wobbly.

819
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,799
[Noel] <i>Hermine is seventh, Laura is sixth,</i>

820
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,600
<i>Lottie, fifth, and Peter, fourth.</i>

821
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,240
In third, we have this one.

822
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,680
Not bad. You've managed
to get a nice colour.

823
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,920
There's a nice twist.

824
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,360
And in second place...

825
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,760
we have this one.

826
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,280
Who's that?
Marc, they are really nice bagels.

827
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,560
They are properly risen. Good effort.

828
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,960
And in first place, we have this one.

829
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,839
Well done. It's nice and chewy.

830
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,000
Got lovely colours inside
with the flavour, too.

831
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,920
- Thank you.
- They tasted really good.

832
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,040
[softly] Well done, Linda.

833
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,520
Oh, wow! What a high.
Can't wait to tell my family.

834
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,400
Can't wait to tell Richard.
I'll ring him up and go... [screams]

835
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,400
It was a good result for me.

836
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,359
Last two technicals,
I've not fared too well,

837
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,120
so, I was happy with that one.

838
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,720
I had a fabulous time.
It was a good challenge.

839
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:20,319
The result wasn't great.

840
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,880
Tomorrow, we can do better.
We gotta do better.

841
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:31,400
[Matt] <i>Just one challenge remains.</i>

842
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,319
So, Bread Week.
Something very close to your heart, Paul.

843
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,200
[Paul] Overall standard
has been pretty good.

844
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,600
It was nice to give
a handshake to Hermine.

845
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,680
- She did well. Very clever.
- [Matt] Yeah.

846
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,880
She invented a new genre of bread.

847
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,040
But, for Star Baker,
she struggled a bit in the technical.

848
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,240
Not saying she's not,
there are a couple of others.

849
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:50,880
Both Marks have done well
in signature and technical.

850
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,480
- Yeah.
- Actually, Lottie, as well.

851
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,319
Lottie describes herself as a swan.

852
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,960
She said, "You don't know
what's going on beneath the surface."

853
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,960
She is not swan-like.
She's always just going... [exclaims]

854
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,799
I've never seen a swan
panicking that hard.

855
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,359
- [exclaims]
- [Matt] Who's in trouble?

856
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,200
[Paul] I think Rowan is in difficulty
this week again.

857
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,799
The soda breads, one was a polenta cake.

858
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,799
- One was a sand pit.
- [Prue chuckles] Very sandy.

859
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,120
I think David's done okay,
but he is slipping down there.

860
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,160
Curse of the Star Baker.

861
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,520
[Paul] Ultimately,
it's a tricky showstopper today,

862
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,040
but I'd like to see
all the bakers complete the task,

863
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,319
including Rowan.

864
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,520
- Interesting.
- Interesting.

865
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,120
- I think I'm in love with you.
- [laughs]

866
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,000
- We'll talk about this later.
- We should talk about it now.

867
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,839
Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your showstopper challenge.

868
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,160
Today, the judges would like you to make
a large decorative bread plaque

869
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,400
in the style of a traditional
harvest festival sheaf.

870
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,200
[Matt] Giving your own take on the sheaf,

871
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,600
your bread plaque must portray
the one thing you are most grateful for.

872
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,560
[Noel] Your bread must be
impressive in size, visually powerful,

873
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,600
and, of course,
it's got to be delish-delosh.

874
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,319
You have three hours and 30 minutes.

875
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,680
Don't seem long enough.

876
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,600
I know. They've been done up
like a kipper.

877
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,600
- On your marks!
- Get set.

878
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,680
Bake!

879
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,319
Feeling nervous today. It's a big one.

880
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,839
[Rowan] Traditionally,
the harvest plaque is inedible

881
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,720
and rock hard and varnished.
So, to make it utterly delicious...

882
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:26,400
[softly] ...it's quite a challenge.

883
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,760
[sighs] Bricking it.

884
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:31,000
The bread plaque itself
must be a celebration

885
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,160
of something that the bakers
are thankful for.

886
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,359
It could be your house,
it could be their health, anything.

887
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,280
But it's really easy to sit there
and design something elaborate on paper.

888
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,080
It's not anything like easy
to make it in bread.

889
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,640
It's about manipulating dough itself,
using knife techniques,

890
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,160
plaiting, twisting, spiralling the bread.

891
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,960
It's a great challenge,
because it'll give me the indication

892
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,080
of how far these bakers have travelled
on their bread journey.

893
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,440
I hope they've practised it,

894
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,720
because they'll never get it right
if they haven't.

895
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,839
[Noel] <i>To give their elaborate plaques</i>
<i>different flavours, textures and shapes,</i>

896
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,000
<i>all of the bakers have chosen
to make multiple breads.</i>

897
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,160
[Lottie] I'm making three breads.
There's a lot of multitasking going on.

898
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,680
There's no time for faffery today.

899
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,760
I'm doing two breads. A basic white bread,
a wholemeal bread,

900
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,720
and then, around the edges,
I've got this Tibetan monastery bread.

<i>coriander and caraway seeds,</i>

<i>Marc's bread will be swirled together
to form a Buddhist dharma wheel.</i>

903
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,240
Are you a Buddhist?
Is this what you're grateful for?

904
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:38,520
I'm not a Buddhist, but after I had
the accident where I lost my leg,

905
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,440
and I wasn't in a very good place,

906
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,440
and just trying to come to terms
with what had happened,

907
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,280
I read a wonderful book
about the philosophy of Buddhism.

908
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:48,600
It made it a lot clearer,
what I needed to do

909
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,000
to still live a life,
and make my life worth living, you know?

910
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,640
So, this... Yeah,
it means a lot to me, this one.

911
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,160
[Dave] I'm gonna knead it for ten minutes.

912
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,960
It's not too sticky.
More smooth and silky.

913
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,400
[Laura sighs] Nowhere near ready.
Let's have a bit of welly.

914
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,799
Good bit of exercise,
which I'm missing at the moment.

915
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,040
[Linda] I just absolutely love
this part about bread.

916
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,400
You can put so much feeling into it,

917
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,400
put a lot of love into it, you know.

918
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,240
[Noel] <i>Linda's putting her love</i>

921
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,880
As a kid, I used to milk the cows,

922
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,080
and we used to carry the buckets
of milk through the farm

923
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,480
to my auntie's kitchen
where she made beautiful cakes.

924
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,480
- So rural idyll, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah.

925
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,200
- You've really gone for the harvest theme.
- Absolutely.

926
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,200
It's all about that circle of life.

927
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,720
- Thank you. Good luck.
- Thank you.

928
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,240
Shape of that bottle even reminds me
of the milk churns.

929
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,520
It's a wonderful memory. [exclaims]

930
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,680
I've a little piping there.

I'm feeling very grateful
for my life in Worcestershire.

934
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,200
The wonderful countryside and the theatre,
literature and music

935

that form such a big part

- Last.

- Did you?
- Of course. Yeah.

941
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,839
[Noel] If you smash this, then?

942
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,440
It's probably curtains,

Also, look at your boots.

945
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,440
- This is strong boot game.
- [Rowan] Look at that.

946
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,760

[Matt] <i>...Hermine might have</i>
<i>the most ambitious plan of them all.</i>

950
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:49,160
The plan is to make an enriched dough.

951
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,839
- Something close to a brioche.
- It can't be a brioche in three hours.

952
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,160
What have you cut back on
to get it done on time?

953
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,200
I haven't cut back on anything.

954
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,440
It's supposed to stay
in the fridge overnight,

955
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,720
but I'm gonna put it in a freezer
on both sides for about 15 minutes

956
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:09,839
to harden the butter,
so that I can then work.

957
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,240
- Quite risky. [chuckles]
- I agree.

958

963

do it anyway. We shall see.

[Matt] <i>While Hermine</i>

- Proving drawer, there it is.

[Linda] Quite warm in here today,
so, hopefully,

970
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,200
it'll just rise without having
to force it up.

971
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,520
[Laura] I'm gonna go by eye.
Set the timer for 40 minutes and see.

972
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,359
[Matt] <i>With one dough down...</i>

973
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,839
Right. Back to some kneading.

974
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,680
[Matt] <i>...the process
starts all over again.</i>

975
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,960
[Marc] I've added fresh yeast.
First load will go 15.

976
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,520
This one, 20,
just to let it catch up a little bit.

977
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,400
So, in theory, this should all
be proved around the same time.

978
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,640
[Matt] <i>And if juggling multiple doughs</i>
<i>wasn't tricky enough...</i>

979

980
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,200
[Matt] <i>...some of the bakers</i>
<i>have also chosen to make fillings.</i>

981
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,120

is my signature flavour for breads.

982
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,319

and Gruyère cheese.

986
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,120
It's basically a posh
cheese and ham sandwich.

987
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,040
[Noel] <i>Laura's stuffed focaccia will take</i>

<i>which will be adorned

989
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,080

in the West End.

990
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,400

991

- Never been to a West End musical?
- Never.

992
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,200
Call yourself a gay man?
Honestly, terrible.

993
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,400
When this show is over,
we are hitting the town.

994

- Okay.
- We're gonna take him to <i>Wicked,</i>

995

<i>Mamma Mia, Phantom, Les...</i>

996
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,560
Okay. Sounds good. It's a date.

997
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,960
[Mark] So, I'm pureeing my apples.

998
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,120
I grew up in County Armagh
in Northern Ireland,

999
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,000
which is known as Orchard County
because of the apple orchards.

1000
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,200
I'm gonna freeze the apple puree in straws

1001
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,920
and then I will braid around
the frozen puree.

1002
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,720
Hope it works. Fingers crossed. [chuckles]

1003

I'm not sure, but I love it.
It's such an amazing taste.

1007

'cause I don't want the butter melting.

1012
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:47,520
But I think it will be fine
to go prove now, just on time.

1013

Somerset cheddar and a Spanish chorizo.

[Rowan] I have warmed the pre-soaked pear.

1028

I didn't want it to cool the dough
and impede the rise.

1029
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,160
I don't want it to go
as flat as a pancake and stodgy,

1030
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,720

1033
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,240
Oh, that's stuck. Well done, Sura.

00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,720
Very excited about being a dad.
Looking forward to it.

1047
00:47:26,799 --> 00:47:29,680
We're expecting a boy.
Stacey says I'm laid-back with kids.

1048
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,240
It will be baking, DIY, driving. [laughs]

1049
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,480
[Matt] <i>Dave's giving his Hampshire home</i>

1050
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,839
<i>far-flung flavours

1052
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,720
- Are you doing a shed?
- No shed. That's in the back garden.

1053
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:50,799
- What about a driveway? Garage?
- No driveway.

1054
00:47:50,879 --> 00:47:52,480
- Recycling bins?
- No.

1055
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,040
- Anything else, Matt?
- Decking outside.

1056
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,720
- [Dave] No decking.
- [Matt] No.

1057
00:47:56,799 --> 00:47:59,480
I just think, 'cause it's 2020,
maybe some solar panels.

1058
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,280
We don't have solar panels, so...

1059
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,600
- You don't?
- No.

1060
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,960
I might get a solar panel on my head
just to give me more energy.

1061
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,400
Over the long run,
it'd be cheaper than coffee.

1062
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,120
Ah.

1063
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,359
- [Noel] <i>Dave's not the only baker...</i>
- What part of my house is that?

1064
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,440
[Noel] <i>...grateful for their humble abode.</i>

1065
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,280
I live with my aunt, my uncle
and my two cousins.

1066
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:20,480
It's by the beach.
It's a lovely place to be.

1067
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,000
So I'm making my house.

1068
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,760
[Noel] <i>Lottie's sun-dried tomato</i>
<i>and chorizo beach house</i>

1069
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,080
<i>will be surrounded by
pesto palm trees and bushes.</i>

1070
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,640
[Lottie] I am doing this in a proving bag

1071
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,520
so that I can work on it
whilst it's proving.

1072
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,319
[Matt] <i>While Lottie and Dave are finding</i>
<i>it hard enough to build one house...</i>

1073
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,120
[Lottie] It's not easy when restricted.

1074
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,720
It makes it look like
I'm performing some bizarre operation.

1075
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,520
[Matt] <i>...Peter's taking on an entire city.</i>

1076
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,640
I'm making
an Edinburgh cityscape bread plaque.

1077
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,879
I made these and did the drawing myself.

1078
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,359
[Matt] <i>But he's got one more step</i>
<i>before construction can begin.</i>

1079
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,319
I've chosen to make a bagel dough
because after you've boiled it,

1080
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,040
and it sets its shape, you're able
to get pretty precise cuts out of it.

1081
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:05,120
[Noel] <i>A seeded multigrain dough</i>
<i>will form the rocky backdrop</i>

1082

<i>to his poppy seed-covered
Edinburgh landmarks.</i>

1083
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,760
We did have a little practice
on bagels yesterday.

1084
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,680
I think I'm gonna slightly change
how I do it in response to their comments.

1085
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,520
I want to try
and make it slightly lighter.

1086
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,440
[comical German accent]
Bakers, you have one hour left.

1087
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,879
- Oh, Matthew.
- [both chuckle]

1088
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,879
[Mark] Time's disappearing already.

1089
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,160
Just have to crack on.

1090
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,839
[Rowan] This is the trunk of the tree.

1091
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,160
[Paul] Concerned about Rowan.

1092
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,280
He's confident
he'll get this finished in time,

1093
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,120
but he is taking on a lot, again.

1094
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,920
[Rowan] Crack on with the decoration.

1095
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,280
I agree with you.
There is such a lot going on.

1096
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,720
I hope to goodness he finishes.

1097
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:42,960
[Rowan] There is a plan.
I know that's surprising.

1098
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,480
And so far, I think I'm going to it.

1099
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,040
I'm not happy with the rise.
It needs a bit more time.

1100
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,839
- Hermine is doing brioche.
- Brioche in three and a half hours

1101
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,000
- is tricky to do.
- Yeah.

1102
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,600
[Paul] It'll be interesting to see,

1103
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,000
with her French background,
what she can come up with.

1104
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,720
[Hermine] I'm gonna carry on proving this.

1105
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:01,920
[Noel] <i>While Hermine's wait goes on...</i>

1106
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,080
It's looking good.

1107
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,200
[Noel] <i>...the rest of the bakers'</i>
<i>dough has finished proving.</i>

1108
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,560
I'm happy with my tiger bread.
That's come up lovely. Ooh.

1109
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,040
[Noel] <i>And their intricate designs</i>
<i>can now begin to take shape.</i>

1110
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,839
[Linda] So, here we go.

1111
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,799
[Noel] <i>The judges are expecting</i>
<i>a variety of bread-shaping techniques.</i>

1112
00:50:18,879 --> 00:50:21,520
[Lottie] I've tried to show twists
and some plaits,

1113
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,000
but hoping that my flavours
will make up for the fact

1114
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,319
that I'm not the most intricate of bakers.

1115
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:28,399
[Mark] This is my frozen-apple puree.

1116
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,359
They're out of the straws,
and braided over.

1117
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,200
Just wanna make sure
I've got a good definition in there.

1118
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,520
[Noel] <i>But the bakers</i>
<i>need to work quickly.</i>

1119
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,120
[Linda] Bread's gonna keep proving,

1120
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,799
so you're not gonna get
anything defined enough

1121
00:50:39,879 --> 00:50:41,560
if you don't get your move on.

1122
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,040
[Marc] Not very good at plaiting.

1123
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,879
So it is a little bit tricky.

1124
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,080
[Dave] It's not as good-looking
as the other one.

1125
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,200
[Linda] I'm happy with the way that
that's come around, yeah.

1126
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,799
Hopefully, when it bakes,
it won't get too many...

1127
00:50:55,879 --> 00:50:57,359
[blows raspberry] Like a hernia.

1128

[laughs]

1129
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,080
[Rowan] This is the canopy of the tree.

1130
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,640
It looks like a bit of a shambles
at the moment.

1131
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,440
But a few well-placed details
can bring the whole thing to life.

1132
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,600
Pears go on next.

1133
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,680
Does that look like a tractor?
Not quite, does it?

1134
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,480
[Sura] These are the tomatoes
with feta inside.

1135
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,560
[Peter] This is the Forth Rail Bridge.

1136
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,799
I'll give it a red egg wash
before going in the oven.

1137
00:51:17,879 --> 00:51:20,960
It comes out a rusty red colour.
Looks similar to the real thing.

1138
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,680
[Laura] The tyres will be sprayed gold.

1139
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,176
I think Paul's gonna hate it, but...

1140
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,440
He doesn't like glitter,
he doesn't like theatre.

1141
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,920
I mean, pretty sad life, if you ask me.

1142
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,080
- [Noel] Have you seen Matt in <i>Les Mis?</i>
- I did.

1143
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,280
He was amazing.
I genuinely mean it when I say

1144
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,399
it was the best thing I've seen
in the West End.

1145
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,200
- Really?
- I saw it five times.

1146
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,440
[Noel] Wow. It's quite a mess over here.

1147
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,560
I think I'm the messy one
out of the group.

1148
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,399
- Look at it.
- I'm all right with that.

1149
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,240
- I got loads to do.
- I know. Sorry.

1150
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:46,319
- Bye-bye.
- Love you.

1151
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,359
I have a wheel.
It's starting to come together.

1152
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,839
This is my twist to go on the outside.

1153
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,040
How far can I make that stretch?
Oh, well, that's sad.

1154
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,200
How about if I just do that?
No one would ever know.

1155
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,640
This is a tiger glaze. I've tamed it down

1156
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,680
so that it doesn't crack up too much.

1157
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,480
[Sura] I'm painting it with spirulina.

1158
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,560
And then I've got some beetroot powder
on the tomatoes.

1159
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,879
Stacey's pregnant,
and a furlough belly for me.

1160
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,160
Hopefully, the dough will rise
in the right places.

1161
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,600
I'm going in.

1162
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,520
For possibly the last time.

1163
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,720
Please be good to me, Mr Bread.

1164
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,359
[Laura] Don't drop it. Don't drop it.

1165
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,359
I'm gonna put it in for 35.
Yeah! In she goes.

1166
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,879
[huffing excitedly]

1167
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,600
I'm gonna have
about four minutes to spare, I think.

1168
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,680
I'm having to rush these.
I'm really out of time now,

1169
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,280
and I need to get this in the oven.

1170
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,680
[in American accent]
You have half an hour left.

1171
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,560
- All right, it's gone in.
- [Matt] That's 30 minutes.

1172
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,720
Oh, crumbs! Right. I'm going in.

1173
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,520
Let's get on with some baking!

1174
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:54,600
[chuckling] That was really close.

1175
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,240
It needs 30 minutes.
I've got exactly 30 minutes.

1176
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,319
[Hermine] My brioche, it hasn't proved
as well as I wanted.

1177
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,600
I'm gonna give it a bit more time.

1178
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,120
[Mark] It feels like
that's the challenge over, though.

1179
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,120
It's really weird.

1180
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,160
Have a little clean-up now.

1181
00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:13,480
[exhales deeply]

1182
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,760
[Marc] I take every opportunity I can
just to take a mindful breath.

1183
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:21,319
Just kind of bring me back
to the present moment.

1184
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:22,920
'Cause when we're worrying,

1185
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,240
we're worrying about things in our past.

1186
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:27,480
[Dave] I shouldn't have floured it,
to be honest.

1187
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,640
Or they're worrying about the future.

1188
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,640
- [Peter] Have enough time to cook it?
- I hope so.

1189
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,640
And ultimately, we've got
no control over that, have we?

1190
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,520
Of course, it's easier said than done.

1191
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,600
[Noel] Bakers, you've got 15 minutes.

1192
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,040
Paul Hollywood wants bread,

1193
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,799
and if he doesn't get it,
he's gonna be furious.

1194
00:53:43,879 --> 00:53:46,240
You ain't baking, you're gonna be quaking!

1195
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:49,359
[Hermine] That should take
about 15 minutes, hopefully.

1196
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,879
I think it's gonna be really close.

1197
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,319
- [laughs]
- [Sura] I'm just worried about the base.

1198
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:56,600
So I think I might up it, you know.

1199
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,879
Oh, it's coming out now.

1200
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,359
[imitates chorus singing]

1201
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,359
[whistles] Not bad.

1202
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,760
Hopefully it's baked.

1203
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,720
[Sura] That does sound hollow.
That sounds brilliant.

1204
00:54:07,799 --> 00:54:10,280
- [Laura] We're good.
- [Marc] Let's trim those bits off.

1205
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:13,920
Lots of leaves to paint green,
so I need to get busy with that.

1206
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,040
[Linda] I'll give it some makeup.

1207
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,040
[Matt] Bakers, you have one minute left.

1208
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,440
[Hermine] I think it's cooked.

1209
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,320
- [Mark] Just us in the oven?
- Just us three.

1210
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,720
Hmm. That's too big.

1211
00:54:25,799 --> 00:54:27,600
[Rowan] Just take it carefully and slowly.

1212
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,240
- [Hermine] There's a lot to trim.
- Going in.

1213
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,440
[groans] Everyone is out...

1214
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,600
[Laura] This is my chilli oil.

1215
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,359
[Noel] Bakers, your time is up.

1216
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:41,200
- [sighs]
- Please step away from your bread.

1217
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,200
[sighs]

1218
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:44,839
[Marc] Amazing.

1219
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,200
- Well done, Hermine.
- Ooh!

1220
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,760
[Rowan] It'll taste appalling,
but I'm pleased with the look.

1221
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,680
We'll go with it.
Just hope I've done enough.

1222
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:04,319
[Matt] <i>It's judgment time</i>
<i>for our bakers' decorative bread plaques.</i>

1223
00:55:04,399 --> 00:55:07,000
Hermine, would you like
to bring up your showstopper?

1224
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,640
Looks a bit abstract.

1225
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,560
- [Prue] You're driving through vineyards?
- [Hermine] Yes.

1226
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,359
- These?
- That's supposed to be farmer's field

1227
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,040
- and a tractor.
- [Prue] A tractor.

1228
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,440
- Yes.
- [Paul] I see, okay.

1229
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,520
You've lost a bit of definition
in the swirl on the outside,

1230
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,399
but overall, it looks good.

1231
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,160
Let's have a look
at the frame to start with.

1232
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,040
This is the brioche.

1233
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,319
[Hermine] Yes.

1234
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:39,520
- And the main bit is the focaccia.
- Yeah.

1235
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,720
The brioche doesn't hold much flavour.

1236
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:46,160
I knew you were gonna struggle
to get that out in time.

1237
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,560
It's an enriched dough,
but it's not a brioche.

1238
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,520
- [Prue] Focaccia's lovely.
- Thank you.

1239
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,080
It's springy. I like both, actually.

1240
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,879
The focaccia is not bad.
But I do like the design.

1241
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,839
- It's very, very good.
- Thank you.

1242
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,000
I think it looks quite dramatic
and effective.

1243
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,920
[Paul] The plait on the outside
is not bad.

1244
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,520
[Prue] I like the effect you've got
by interlacing the two.

1245
00:56:10,359 --> 00:56:11,600
Texture looks good.

1246
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:15,680
I think that is beautifully seasoned.

1247
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,080
The tomato bread is nice.
It's got a nice zing.

1248
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,920
But more importantly, it's the structure,

1249
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,879
the air bubbles, it's regular,
and it's even all the way down.

1250
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,359
- It's a nice loaf.
- Thank you.

1251
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,920
Did you try one of the balls?

1252
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,560
They've got feta inside.

1253
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,000
[Prue] Mmm.

1254
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,600
That is delicious.

1255
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,000
- Can I go?
- Yes, absolutely.

1256
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,040
- [all laughing]
- Your agony is over.

1257
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,600
- [Noel] Well done, Sura.
- Thank you.

1258
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,240
I love your Victorian swags
of great velvet curtain.

1259
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,680
Your gilded tassels are wonderful.

1260
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,440
It's simple, but effective.

1261
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,120
- Shall we have a look?
- [Prue] Yeah.

1262
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,560
[Laura] It's a focaccia base
with pancetta and cheese.

1263
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,680
[Prue] It's got quite a punch.

1264
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,280
Your ingredient choices are good.

1265
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:05,240
The problem is focaccia
is a very, very light dough

1266
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:07,600
and you put that
on top of it so it couldn't rise.

1267
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,680
So what it did is
concertina back down again

1268
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,560
and so it feels quite raw.

1269
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,839
[Prue] It's a pity, because when you get
the edge of the focaccia,

1270
00:57:14,919 --> 00:57:15,919
it's really nice bread.

1271
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,640
The chili bread's got a kick to it.

1272
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,759
Not bad at all.

1273
00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:24,440
I think it's full of flavour,
but textures weren't right.

1274
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,560
It's simple, sort of effective.

1275
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,600
I think you could've done more with it.

1276
00:57:36,279 --> 00:57:37,720
Your flavours are coming from

1277
00:57:37,799 --> 00:57:40,520
the seeds on the top of the dried herbs.
They carry through.

1278
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,960
- It's a nice eat.
- [Prue] It tastes very nice.

1279
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,640
I just feel it's a little dense and tough.

1280
00:57:46,399 --> 00:57:47,960
[Paul] You made a bagel like a pitta.

1281
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,560
- It's a little weird.
- [laughs] It is, isn't it?

1282
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,919
A bread shouldn't do that.

1283
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,399
It's like a piece of leather.

1284
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,879
Oh, Peter.

1285
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,960
The design's pretty good.

1286
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,080
You kept some definition in there, too.

1287
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,839
[Prue] The bread is well risen,
it feels great,

1288
00:58:12,919 --> 00:58:14,600
- but it lacks flavour.
- Okay.

1289
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,359
- And this is tomato and paprika.
- Yes.

1290
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,440
Yeah, tomato, paprika and chorizo.

1291
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,440
- That packs a punch. That's nice.
- [Prue] Yes.

1292
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,520
[Paul] Nice balance of flavour with it.

1293
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,399
Nice bread. Should've
done more with that...

1294
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,320
- [Prue] Very nice.
- ...rather than the white.

1295
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,480
I like the concept,
I like the design, I love the cow.

1296
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,080
We drunk milk straight from the cow
when we was children.

1297
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,279
- From the udders?
- Not quite.

1298
00:58:38,359 --> 00:58:40,000
- [Noel] Wow.
- [Linda laughs]

1299
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,279
[Paul] Remind me of the flavour again?

1300
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:44,040
It's olive and tiger bread.

1301
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,600
That's not tiger-bread topping.

1302
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,720
It's the flavours of it,
but not so much the cracking.

1303
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:49,960
[Paul] Okay.

1304
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,279
- [Prue] It's dense.
- [Paul] Needs more olives.

1305
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,839
More proving's needed.
More flavour's needed.

1306
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,359
Interesting trees.

1307
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,279
Little bit bulky
compared to the rest of it.

1308
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:04,240
[Prue] I like the bee.

1309
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,960
[Paul] The plaiting's a little bit
irregular, thick and then thin.

1310
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:17,520
The structure's not bad, because actually,
you do have a light crust.

1311
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,200
It is wetter on the mouth,
which is what you want.

1312
00:59:20,279 --> 00:59:21,720
Flavour's not that strong, though,

1313
00:59:21,799 --> 00:59:23,399
considering you're using wild garlic,

1314
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,680
you should be getting
a serious kick from that.

1315
00:59:25,759 --> 00:59:27,319
This one's got apple and cinnamon?

1316
00:59:27,399 --> 00:59:29,160
[Mark] In the middle, yeah.

1317
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,480
Mmm. The apple
and cinnamon is really nice.

1318
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:34,160
It's a bit basic, the picture,
but the bread is okay.

1319
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,480
Well, it looks really surprising

1320
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,919
and pretty, and quite neat.
Certainly colourful.

1321
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,160
If you dig deeper around the edges,

1322
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,120
it's a bit weak on the plaiting.
It's slightly underproved,

1323
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,456
- and ripped in the oven.
- Okay.

1324
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,839
But this particular area here is gorgeous.

1325
00:59:52,919 --> 00:59:55,080
- [Marc] Thank you.
- Really nice. Neat, clever.

1326
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,319
[Matt] It's intricate detail, isn't it?

1327
00:59:57,399 --> 01:00:01,200
[Prue] Oh, look.
That looks like nice bread.

1328
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,399
[Paul] The flavour of the brown's not bad.

1329
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,319
- It could do with more salt.
- [Marc] Okay.

1330
01:00:06,399 --> 01:00:09,080
[Paul] Fennel one is nice.
Overall, I like those flavours.

1331
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:12,000
- Thank you.
- I think you've done a really good job.

1332
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,560
It looks good, tastes good,
smells good. It is good.

1333
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,720
- Great.
- [Paul] Thank you.

1334
01:00:16,759 --> 01:00:18,440
- Thank you very much.
- Well done.

1335
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,640
[Marc] Thank you very much.

1336
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,600
Your wife's pregnant?

1337
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,080
Yes. Although I do look
more pregnant than she does.

1338
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,359
[laughs] I was gonna say.

1339
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,600
It's called sympathetic pregnancy.

1340
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,759
[Paul] I would've spent time
cutting bricks out

1341
01:00:32,839 --> 01:00:35,720
and placed them on
and just built up that brickwork look.

1342
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,080
You sort of get it,
but it would look nice with that.

1343
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,160
Okay.

1344
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,480
[Prue] This is the one with...

1345
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,000
Mango, lime and chili paste
running through.

1346
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,120
You certainly get
the mango and the chilli.

1347
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,720
[Paul] I like the flavour.
Never had anything like that.

1348
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,600
But I think the bread's a little too dry.

1349
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,120
- It's overbaked.
- Okay.

1350
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,279
[Paul] The flavour of the base?

1351
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,319
That is hibiscus and guava flavour drops.

1352
01:00:57,399 --> 01:00:59,560
I've never met guava flavour.

1353
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,440
Never had an Um Bongo, Prue?

1354
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,279
- [Matt] Never been to the Congo?
- [Prue] I know guavas well,

1355
01:01:04,359 --> 01:01:06,799
- but I've never known it as an essence.
- Right.

1356
01:01:06,879 --> 01:01:08,120
And I can't really taste it.

1357
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,680
[Paul] The ideas are unique.
Never tried either before.

1358
01:01:10,759 --> 01:01:12,560
Just that the baking was a little too far.

1359
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,720
- Yeah. Fair enough.
- [Paul] Thank you.

1360
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,040
- You need a hand, right?
- I do, please.

1361
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,520
[Noel] Let's do this.

1362
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,359
- Is that gonna fit?
- [Rowan] Let's hope.

1363
01:01:27,799 --> 01:01:29,359
[Prue] Well, Rowan. [chuckles]

1364
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,919
I think it looks great.
I think it looks quite attractive.

1365
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,839
Very big.

1366
01:01:32,919 --> 01:01:35,879
- [Prue] What's the bread?
- [Rowan] Worcestershire, blue cheese

1367
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,960
and pears soaked in local cider.

1368
01:01:42,759 --> 01:01:44,160
[Prue] Get the cider.

1369
01:01:45,279 --> 01:01:46,560
Where's the blue cheese?

1370
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,759
- Well, I pressed it in.
- You pressed it in?

1371
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:50,279
That's why we don't get the taste.

1372
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:52,520
- [Rowan] Right.
- I would've mixed it in the dough.

1373
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,000
And you needed much more proving in that.

1374
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,960
Keeping these restrained to keep the look.

1375
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,520
You've gone for all style
and no substance.

1376
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,919
You've ended up with a bread
which is quite bland.

1377
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,920
- Right.
- [Paul] What's the flavour of that one?

1378
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,879
That is chestnut and walnut.

1379
01:02:08,919 --> 01:02:11,200
Again, walnuts, lot more.

1380
01:02:11,279 --> 01:02:13,879
It's such a pity,
'cause that's much nicer bread.

1381
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,759
Should we try the earthy one?

1382
01:02:16,839 --> 01:02:18,000
I can smell the truffle.

1383
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,960
Definitely has more flavour,
but it could do with some salt.

1384
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,200
- Okay. [chuckles]
- [Paul] Thank you very much.

1385
01:02:23,279 --> 01:02:24,560
[Rowan] Many thanks.

1386
01:02:26,359 --> 01:02:28,040
All style, no substance, that's me.

1387
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,440
[Noel] I'd rather be all style,
no substance anyway.

1388
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:34,680
Somewhat disappointed.
I was very happy with the look of it

1389
01:02:34,759 --> 01:02:38,000
and so, I'm glad to have
done what I could do.

1390
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,399
[Dave] Feeling a little uneasy.

1391
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,399
I might be home tomorrow,
but, erm, I haven't phoned her yet.

1392
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,319
It would mean a lot
to come back next week.

1393
01:02:44,399 --> 01:02:46,040
That went better than expected.

1394
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,759
I hear these things from my parents,

1395
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:49,640
and think,
"It's 'cause you're my parents."

1396
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,480
But it's nice to hear it from them.

1397
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,080
I'm really happy with that.

1398
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,560
It'd feel amazing, I think,

1399
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,160
if they called out that
I was Star Baker for the week.

1400
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,480
But, yeah, I don't know how I'd handle it.

1401
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,040
[Matt] How do you think that went?

1402
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,160
Overall, the standard wasn't good.

1403
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,240
I think they feel a lot of pressure
on Bread Week to impress you

1404
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,480
and often, they implode.

1405
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,440
They needed to come in strong.

1406
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,080
If you're not confident, it shows.

1407
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,520
[Prue] Sura and Marc E,

1408
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:21,200
those two worked with terrific confidence
and they're bang in your face.

1409
01:03:21,279 --> 01:03:24,080
They both managed to get
the right texture, the right flavour,

1410
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,319
the right look.

1411
01:03:25,399 --> 01:03:28,160
- So, Star Baker, Marc E and Sura.
- Yeah.

1412
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,000
What about Hermine?
She had a handshake.

1413
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,759
Hermine has got a possibility.
Technical wasn't brilliant.

1414
01:03:32,839 --> 01:03:36,160
And her showstopper,
I didn't like the enriched dough.

1415
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,919
Who do you think's at the bottom?

1416
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,600
- Obviously Rowan. Anyone else?
- [Paul] Peter's in trouble.

1417
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,640
I also think David's in trouble.

1418
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,640
- Our two previous Star Bakers.
- Yeah.

1419
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,040
[Matt] In defence of Rowan,

1420
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,200
his showstopper really looked like
a showstopper, didn't it?

1421
01:03:49,279 --> 01:03:51,439
Again, style and substance.
It lacked flavour.

1422
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,799
But how much flavour
do breads really need?

1423
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,080
- You've crossed the line.
- I've crossed the line.

1424
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,680
Do you wanna fight, Matt?

1425
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,120
So, bakers, congratulations.

1426
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,879
I know it's been a long couple of days.

1427
01:04:14,439 --> 01:04:16,480
One of you is Star Baker

1428
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,160
and that person is...

1429
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:21,359
Marc E.

1430
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,759
- Wow.
- [all clapping]

1431
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,040
Oh, bakers, that means
I've got the horrible job

1432
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,279
of sending someone home.

1433
01:04:32,879 --> 01:04:38,640
[sighs] The person who is leaving us is...

1434
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,080
Rowan.

1435
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:51,399
That's fine. [laughs]

1436
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,600
These boots were made for walking.

1437
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,839
[laughing]

1438
01:04:54,919 --> 01:04:57,040
I feel very content, really.

1439
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,839
I've had a wonderful time.

1440
01:04:58,919 --> 01:05:02,359
Erm, it is exhausting, but very rewarding.

1441
01:05:02,439 --> 01:05:04,240
Bring it in. Bring it in, kids.

1442
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:05,439
[Mark] Sorry, Rowan.

1443
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,000
And I was also quite pleased
that Noel said to me,

1444
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,520
"I'm all style and no substance."

1445
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,240
He said, "It's on my CV." [laughs]

1446
01:05:12,439 --> 01:05:13,919
[Hermine] Gonna miss those laughs.

1447
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,080
[Rowan] Oh!

1448
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,799
Rowan's been such a character.
I'm sorry to see him go

1449
01:05:18,879 --> 01:05:22,839
because he is so ambitious
and so imaginative

1450
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,879
and he puts so much thought
into his baking.

1451
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,560
He delivered a showstopper

1452
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,960
which was very impressive to look at,

1453
01:05:31,439 --> 01:05:33,000
but it just didn't taste good.

1454
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,520
[Laura] Gonna miss you, Rowan.

1455
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,839
Such mixed emotions.
Sad for Rowan, ecstatic for Marc

1456
01:05:37,919 --> 01:05:41,040
'cause he really deserved
and needed that for his confidence.

1457
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,560
I just got Star Baker, didn't I?

1458
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,640
On Bread Week.
It's the thing that I enjoy making.

1459
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,960
It's the thing that started me on
this whole baking experience.

1460
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,759
To get Star Baker is amazing.

1461
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,439
- [Paul] Well done.
- Thank you.

1462
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,520
It was really good.

1463
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:58,040
Marc did really well in the signature.
Pretty well in the technical, too.

1464
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,359
And in the showstopper,

1465
01:05:59,439 --> 01:06:02,080
he managed to get his dough risen
and tasting good.

1466
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,839
So, the whole Buddhist ethos
really worked for him.

1467
01:06:06,439 --> 01:06:07,960
Hey! [chuckles]

1468
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,240
- Well done for being Star Baker.
- Thank you.

1469
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:11,600
Hey, Gibbygibs.

1470
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,160
- Thank you, girls.
- [girl] Love you.

1471
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,919
[Marc] I love you, too. You're the best.

1472
01:06:15,759 --> 01:06:16,759
Thank you.

1473
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,240
Oh, you made me get emotional now.

1474
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,399
