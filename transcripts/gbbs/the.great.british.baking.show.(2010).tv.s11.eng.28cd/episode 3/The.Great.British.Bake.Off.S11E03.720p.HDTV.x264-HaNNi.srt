1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,080
Uncle Noel? Yeah? Do you know
what week it is this week?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,840
It's Bread Week - Paul's favourite.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,200
Do you wanna see something amazing?
Yes, please.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,160
I was messing about in Paul's
dressing room last night

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,760
and I found this. Check this out.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,240
It's the Hollywood handshake. Wow!

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,080
Shall we try it out?
Yes, please, actually.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,960
I'll be Paul. Thank you.
Really like your baps.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,600
Thank you, actually.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,600
It's too powerful! Too powerful.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,440
Hi, guys. You all right?
All right?

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,160
You haven't been playing
with my handshake, have you?

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,000
No, Mr Hollywood.
What handshake?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,320
Because if you have
you get this...

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,040
..right?

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,320
Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,080
Last time...

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,840
..it was biscuit week.

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,160
I went to art school for this.

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,120
If I rubbed them,
I'd wish for Star Baker.

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,480
Dave conjured up
a spectacular showstopper.

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,880
That is remarkable.
And his Star Baker wish was granted.

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,240
Oh, it's cracked.
Rowan was all at sea.

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,600
It's definitely been in a storm,
this pot.

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,640
But in the end, it was Mak...
I know, it's not brilliant.

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,960
I just think the whole thing's
just a little bit clumsy.

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,400
..who had to walk the plank.

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,120
I'm gonna miss you.

29
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,960
Now... Whack it.

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,960
..the bakers face trial by bread.

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,560
It's a shame that
Paul Hollywood's judging it, eh?

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,160
A soda bread signature.

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,880
Interesting flavours.

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,760
A Technicolour Technical.

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,120
You're a Smurf, aren't you?

36
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,640
Yes.

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,680
And a Showstopper Challenge
where transforming dough...

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
I'm not very good at plaiting.
..into intricate bread plaques...

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,560
Might be ready in time to bake.
I hope so.

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,080
..will push the bakers...

41
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,800
Don't drop it, don't drop it,
don't drop it. ..to their limits.

42
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,480
It's not funny!

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,000
Yuck.

44
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,120
Bread's the one area I've probably
got more experience in,

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,440
but am I confident? I don't know.

46
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,760
Bread is something that
I've had to teach myself for this.

47
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,360
I kind of wish I hadn't practised,
to be honest.

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,160
I felt more confident before.

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,920
I like making bread at home
in my kitchen with music on,

50
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,920
but under the eyes
of Paul Hollywood...bit scary.

51
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,320
You have to laugh about it,
because we all dreading it.

52
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,480
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

53
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,200
It's time for
your Signature Challenge.

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,080
Today, the judges would like you to
make two beautifully baked

55
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,760
soda bread loaves.

56
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,080
Now, you may flavour your
soda breads any way you like,

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,160
but one should be sweet
and one should be savoury.

58
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,560
Also, your loaves should be baked
freeform rather than in a tin.

59
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,720
What do you mean, freeform?
Just floating in the air? Yes.

60
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,680
And the judges would like you
each to make a butter

61
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,280
to go with your breads.

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,160
Blimey, they don't want much,
do they?

63
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,640
You have one hours, 45 minute.

64
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,080
On your marks. Get set. Bake.

65
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,600
OK, let's go.

66
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,280
Feeling good and ready to go.

67
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,720
I'm excited about soda breads.
I had a lot of it.

68
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,040
My granny used to make
a soda bread every day.

69
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,240
I hope I do a good job with it.

70
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,240
As opposed to a slow prove
with yeasted breads,

71
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,640
the chemical raising agents
in soda breads

72
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,520
starts work almost immediately.

73
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,840
And bicarb into my mixture.

74
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,280
So they must get their loaves
into the oven as quickly as possible

75
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,040
in order to achieve the rise
the judges are after.

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,680
Cream of tartar. I'm not sure
what it's doing in my recipe.

77
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,240
I'm sure it plays a role.

78
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,800
The thing is with this challenge,

79
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,520
it's only an hour
and three quarters.

80
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,160
They haven't got to deal with
yeast but they've gotta deal with

81
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,840
the reaction between
the rising agents

82
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,240
and milk or buttermilk to
create the growth in the loaf.

83
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,440
We've asked our bakers to make
two soda breads,

84
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,280
one sweet and one savoury.
Do you know, I'm expecting

85
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,880
lots of cheese and lots of herbs
and lots of nuts.

86
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,160
It would be really nice

87
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,040
to find somebody using something
really different.

88
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,400
Za'atar is more like
an aromatic spice.

89
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,200
Traditionally we have it
like in pastries, on top of breads

90
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,480
so it's perfect for this.

91
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,240
I think they'll all be nervous

92
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,760
because it's their first time
Bread Week with me,

93
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,760
but I think I've given them
an easy challenge. It's soda bread.

94
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,520
Listen to me, Paul Hollywood,
I want to talk to you about bread.

95
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,200
You go on about bread
and you go on about bread.

96
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,600
No-one under the age of 40
eats bread any more.

97
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,200
OK?

98
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,400
Morning. Hello, morning.
Morning. Hello.

99
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,160
So Mark, tell us about
your soda bread.

100
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,200
My, uh, savoury soda bread
is a sobrasada

101
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,640
and an Irish sheep smoked cheese

102
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,080
and then my sweet soda bread
is a Irish stout and chocolate.

103
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,400
So you're baking for Ireland today?

104
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,920
I am, yes. I have the weight
of a nation on my shoulders.

105
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,360
Are you Irish? I am, yeah.
I'm joking.

106
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,360
Hello, Mark speaking.

107
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,440
Mark loves to travel in his job
as a project manager

108
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,720
for public health research programs
in developing countries.

109
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,480
He's adding Spanish sausage,
honey, and mature Cheddar

110
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,200
to his savoury soda bread, but in
a nod to his Northern Irish roots

111
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,880
will blend the chocolate in his
sweet loaf with a classic stout.

112
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,840
And what's the liquid
you're putting in there?

113
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,200
Some melted butter and honey.
Honey in both.

114
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,640
Interesting. No buttermilk?
And buttermilk sorry, yeah,

115
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,680
of course. I was gonna say.
Of course buttermilk.

116
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,040
This is a tip
going through the competition.

117
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,600
When he says "interesting",
that means you've done it wrong.

118
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,080
Done it wrong? OK, OK.

119
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,400
Along with Mark,
three other bakers are using

120
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,720
a location as their inspiration.

121
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,760
I lived in Chester
for a little while

122
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,600
and I used to love
the Welsh bara brith

123
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,480
so I've based my sweet one
on that bara brith flavour,

124
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,640
which is just like a bread pud,
in a sense.

125
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,360
East Sussex-based Linda loves to
head to Bexhill beach

126
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,520
to fish for mackerel and mullet
which she can throw on the barbie.

127
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,600
Hey!

128
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,800
Chilli, cheese and coriander will
flavour Linda's savoury bread

129
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,440
while her love for
traditional Welsh tea cakes

130
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,760
has inspired her sweet loaf.

131
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,240
Lots of fruit in it. Mm-hmm, nice.
I've soaked my fruit in brandies.

132
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,280
Ooh!

133
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,280
I'm like one of those '80s,
uh, game-show hosts.

134
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,600
Say something else.
Pepped it up a little bit.

135
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Oo-er!

136
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,440
I could do this all day.
Oo-er!

137
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,360
Rowan's creativity has been sparked
from a little further afield.

138
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,280
This is the salsiccia,
the Italian sausage.

139
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,120
So just get it fried off
in a moment.

140
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,600
Get a quick start.

141
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
When he's not baking,
Rowan loves to spend time

142
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,000
in his Worcestershire garden.

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,680
That one's rosa mundi. OK.

144
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,280
Uh, which is Latin,
rose of the world.

145
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,720
Rowan's bakes include southern
Italian sausage, fennel and olives

146
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,840
for his savoury loaf,
and northern Italian polenta

147
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,360
with raisins and honey
for his sweet loaf.

148
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,520
It's quite a lot, isn't it?

149
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,480
It is. There's a lot going on.
There's a shock.

150
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,240
I just hope they work
in combination. I think they do so.

151
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,600
When you say polenta
you've got in there.

152
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,520
Yeah. What's the polenta
to the flour mix?

153
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,640
370g of polenta and 130 flour.

154
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,320
So it is quite gritty.
It's a risky one.

155
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,680
Some people don't like the
grittiness - I rather like it.

156
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,000
OK, thank you very much.
Interesting. Good luck, Rowan!

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,040
Thanks.

158
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,360
Marc's inspiration
comes from shores closer to home.

159
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,000
So I'm doing a Cornish-themed
soda bread

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,440
so I'm using Cornish Kern.
It's based on the Cornish Yarg.

161
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,880
It's quite strong, actually,
but not overpowering

162
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,200
so I thought it might
work well for this.

163
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,720
Get a bit of flour.

164
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,640
Born and raised in Leicester,
adopted Cornishman Marc

165
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,480
loves baking with his daughters.

166
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,800
Great. Fist bumps.

167
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,120
To cope with the pressure
of baking bread in the tent,

168
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,440
Marc is keen to keep things familiar

169
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,480
by including as many Cornish
ingredients as possible.

170
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,280
So I'm doing a Cornish kelp,
Cornish cheese,

171
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,520
Cornish sea salt and Cornish cream.

172
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,280
Covered in buttermilk!

173
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,040
It's not funny!

174
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,920
Yeah, I'm all right,
I'm carrying on. Yuck.

175
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,920
So the bicarb
will react with the buttermilk

176
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,280
and is what causes your soda bread
to rise.

177
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,320
The bakers need to ensure
their chosen flavours

178
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,720
work alongside the soft,
cakey dough.

179
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,600
I'm gonna be trying to get
the black pudding

180
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,960
as well-distributed
within the bread as possible.

181
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,520
Any additional moisture or fat could
inhibit the rise of the soda bread

182
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,760
or prevent it from baking through
properly.

183
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,120
There's a lot of chopping
going on today.

184
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,520
When it comes to her ingredients,
Hermine isn't playing it safe.

185
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,880
I was trying to be
a bit adventurous.

186
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,840
I thought I'd try salmon
and cheese.

187
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,160
I don't even know
if that's a combination.

188
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,280
When she's not combining her
job as an accountant

189
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,600
with being a single mother
to son Stephen...

190
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,040
Oh, ooh, sorry.

191
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,920
..Hermine enjoys a spot of knitting.

192
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,520
Another scarf for Stephen.

193
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,920
Hopefully it will be ready
for winter.

194
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,800
She'll be hoping her salmon and
cheese flavours knit together well

195
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,600
alongside her sweet loaf of dried
fruits soaked in orange liqueur.

196
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,040
How much salmon have you got
going in? I've got 180 gram.

197
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,720
How have you gone with practice?

198
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,160
It's been all right, yes.

199
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,520
There was a bit of dread
in your face then.

200
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,760
And Hermine's not the only baker
taking a risk

201
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,120
with their ingredients.
With za'atar,

202
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,880
it's quite an overpowering flavour
if you allow it to be.

203
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,680
When I was trying to make
the recipes I was asking my dad,

204
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,280
I was like, "What should I do?"

205
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,640
And he goes, "Well, you make
a really good Turkish pide,"

206
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,440
and I always put za'atar
on top of it for him.

207
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,760
He was like, "Why don't you
put that in your bread?"

208
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,400
So I was like, this is for my dad.

209
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,000
And it's not just Dad
giving out advice.

210
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,440
Hospital pharmacist Sura
grew up surrounded by a family

211
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,760
of women who loved to cook.

212
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Fond of incorporating her heritage
into her bakes,

213
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,800
she'll be hoping
Middle Eastern flavours of za'atar,

214
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,080
olive and dried fruits will impress.

215
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,440
Are you confident?

216
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,320
Uh, quietly confident.

217
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,280
Look - he's trying to break you
but he can't, can't do it.

218
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,680
I know - that's why I don't look
in his eyes. Too powerful.

219
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,320
No-one can look into those eyes.
They'll turn to stone, right?

220
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,200
Yeah, they turn to baking flour.

221
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,480
Bakers, you are halfway through.

222
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,080
Are you sure about that? No.

223
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,480
I don't have a watch, do you? No.

224
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,200
Just get that feeling though,
don't you,

225
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,760
that they're halfway through. Yes.

226
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,560
Interesting flavours.

227
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Hopefully they'll like it.

228
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Once their ingredients have been
introduced to the dough...

229
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,360
Texture's reasonable.

230
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,960
..the bakers can begin delicately
shaping their breads.

231
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,360
Just try and bring it together

232
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,720
as much as possible
without overworking it.

233
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,280
Too much kneading will result in
dense, unrisen loaves.

234
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,680
Want to make it smooth but make sure
that I'm not handling it too much.

235
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,840
I'm just cutting the bread -
kind of lets it all puff up nicely.

236
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,160
It lets it cook through better

237
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,800
plus it's just a nice little bit
of decoration.

238
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,480
It's in the oven at 200 degrees
for 30 minutes.

239
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,640
One down.

240
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,720
Right, I'm using a pizza stone
which I've brought from home.

241
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,920
If you use a pizza stone, you get
a more even heat distribution

242
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,640
and it also gives
a really nice crusty bottom.

243
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Laura likes to put her pizza stone
to good use

244
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,240
at home with her husband Matt.

245
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,840
You're king of the pizzas - I'll
stick to the baking. I'm pizza king.

246
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,640
Laura's aiming for bold flavours
for both of her soda breads,

247
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,960
tweaked from family recipes.

248
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,320
The sweet bread,
it's sort of based on

249
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,680
my Nana Peg's scones that she does.

250
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,280
Soda bread's kind of like a scone.

251
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,880
So I'm kind of doing this one
as like a bit of a tribute to her.

252
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,920
And so I've just made my marzipan.

253
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,640
I've found that when I put it in
in lumps

254
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,000
it kind of goes very stodgy
so I'm gonna grate it in.

255
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,480
Pretty sure this is
a new technique Paul's gonna hate.

256
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,640
So I'm making my sweet soda bread
now,

257
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,400
so I'm just crumbling the butter
into the flours and sugar -

258
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,800
gives it more of a scone-like
texture.

259
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,160
I mean, who makes sweet sofa bread?
What is that?

260
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,520
I am making it today,
but it's not my finest work.

261
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,440
It's a shame that Paul Hollywood's
judging it, eh?

262
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,600
Cheers.

263
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,080
When she's looking to unwind,
Lottie likes to relax on the beach

264
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,960
with friends and family.

265
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,240
Long summer afternoons
are Lottie's inspiration

266
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,640
for her savoury summertime soda,
while her sweet ingredients

267
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,640
are inspired by her favourite
breakfast of blueberry pancakes.

268
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,160
How are the blueberries going in?
Well, they're going in whole.

269
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,480
How many are you putting in?
Only 60g.

270
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,760
So much how flour? 350.

271
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,680
OK. Love that face. That's great.

272
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,400
Maybe less, even. Less?
Maybe none.

273
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,720
Maybe...no, more, more,
maybe more blueberries, yeah. More?

274
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,760
No, none. I'm not putting in any.

275
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,080
Start again.
Go back to square one.

276
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,800
Call the whole thing off.

277
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,400
For his sweet soda bread, Peter is
taking the soda element literally.

278
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,080
The soda bread is gonna be
ginger beer flavour.

279
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,520
This is some green ginger wine
that I'm adding in

280
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,920
and then I'm also gonna add in just
some regular ginger beer as well,

281
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,560
and so should have really nice,
good flavour.

282
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,320
No, you've gotta layer it on there.
Yeah, a wee bit more.

283
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,200
Finance student Peter loves to bake

284
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,520
with his gluten-intolerant
brother Andrew

285
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,920
back home in Edinburgh.

286
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,920
That's fantastic finesse
and technique. I've spilled some.

287
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,360
And in honour of Andrew,
he's making his black pudding,

288
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,680
walnut and thyme loaf gluten-free.

289
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,040
What are you using
as the rising agents in there?

290
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,280
Just using bicarb as the rising
agent but I've got xanthe gum in it

291
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,760
to bind it. Yeah.
And keep it all together. OK.

292
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,920
For such a young head, you seem to
operate at quite a different level.

293
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,280
Have you always been into cooking
and baking?

294
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,400
Yeah, I've been into cooking
and baking for a very long time

295
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,760
but it genuinely has been
shows like Bake Off.

296
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,840
I mean, Bake Off's been around
for more than half of my life now,

297
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,200
so it's...

298
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,600
..yeah, pretty cool.
That accounts for all the grey hair.

299
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,000
All right, Old Father Time? Yeah.

300
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you, Peter.

301
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,680
The shape I'm going for
is to sort of replicate

302
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,920
what a chocolate bar would be like.
Basically a Whole Nut bar.

303
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,640
Like our Paul,
Dave is a bit of a petrolhead,

304
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,040
and he also follows Mr Hollywood's
lead when it comes to baking.

305
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,920
I was watching videos
of Paul Hollywood making it

306
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,560
just to see how you do it.

307
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,160
Dave's sweet loaf is inspired
by his favourite nut mix

308
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,520
and he's confident
that bacon and cheese

309
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,560
will prove to be
a savoury sensation.

310
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,920
I really enjoyed coming up with
the flavours

311
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,640
and making, like,
flavours that I like

312
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,960
but also a lot of people
would like as well.

313
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,320
That's ready...35 minutes.

314
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,440
With their second soda breads
in the oven,

315
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,560
it's time to concentrate on
the complementary butters.

316
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,280
Butter, would you believe, is the
easiest thing to make in the world.

317
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,120
At the moment
that's a thick double cream,

318
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,560
and it'll go past that stage
and then turn into butter.

319
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,880
And then when it curdles, you strain
all the milk fluids out of it

320
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,640
and that's it.

321
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,000
Never made butter.
I don't really know why you would.

322
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,720
I mean, it's lovely, it's very twee,
but why would you make butter?

323
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,040
I've just added some more
Irish stout into the butter

324
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,840
just to give it a bit of a kick.

325
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,360
This is from Mak, who left us,
sadly, on the last programme.

326
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,200
He didn't have a chance to
showcase his honey,

327
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,520
so that's going in for Mak.

328
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,000
Black garlic tastes a bit like
balsamic vinegar.

329
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,400
Don't ask me why I choose it.
I just thought I'd be a bit wild.

330
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,160
Let's see if that works.
Or it could well be my ticket home.

331
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,480
Paul's quite amazed at
your baking knowledge, isn't he,

332
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,120
cos you're so young. I hope that
I'm showing some good knowledge.

333
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,600
He fears you. He knows that
eventually the apprentice

334
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,040
always kills the master.

335
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,680
Be an interesting end
to Bake Off this year.

336
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,720
So what is it, ten minutes?
I tell them they've got ten minutes?

337
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,040
Yeah. OK. Ten minutes.

338
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,800
Bakers,
you have ten minutes.

339
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,160
You might need to do it
a bit louder.

340
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,840
Bakers,
you have ten minutes.

341
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,440
OK, let's see what we're
dealing with. It's hot. Ooh!

342
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,800
So it's spread a little bit more
than I'd have liked,

343
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,080
but no, it's traditional,
that shape so it's perfect.

344
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,600
So I'm tapping it just to hear
if it's hollow inside.

345
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,400
I think that's OK.
It's certainly cooked, anyway.

346
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,360
It could be darker in colour,
but I don't want it to overcook.

347
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,160
It's a bit of a take
on the Paddy's Pizza

348
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,800
that I learned to make at school.

349
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,360
Soda bread topped with tomato puree.
I want to do a little nod to that.

350
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,000
I think I'm gonna take that out.
I'm going with it.

351
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,400
It is what it is.

352
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,000
This one, it's very dense
with the marzipan,

353
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,720
so it kind of just looks raw.
It's not.

354
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,120
Is that not a sign, then,
that you shouldn't use marzipan?

355
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,520
No, I grated it. Oh, did you? Yeah.

356
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,400
I look forward to seeing
what happens.

357
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,120
Mate, it's gonna be carnage.
Carnage!

358
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,760
Oh, crumbs.

359
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,120
That wasn't good.
It just broke off.

360
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,600
We'll shove that to the back,
and they'll never know.

361
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,760
Don't know if you've got enough
blueberries in there. Look, Noel...

362
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,840
I just think if he says anything
about your cake that you don't like,

363
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,920
just grab a handful of blueberries
and mush them in his face.

364
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,200
Mush. Yeah, you should do it.
I won't.

365
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,680
Think my orange zest is a bit thick.
It's not really coming through

366
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,360
the piping nozzle.
It looks a bit messy.

367
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,200
Bakers, you have one minute left,
so if you haven't started

368
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,640
making your bread yet,
now is probably a good time.

369
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,560
It looks kind of like a poo.

370
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,640
Four-leaf clover.
I need plenty of luck.

371
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,600
Scary moment.

372
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,800
I think we're good. Hopefully
Nana Peg will be proud of that.

373
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,720
Bakers, your time is up.

374
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,400
Please step away from the breads.

375
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,400
Someone should tell Linda
that's not doing anything.

376
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:06,332
sponsors The Great British Bake Off.

377
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:07,212
sponsors The Great British Bake Off.
The bakers' sweet and savoury soda
breads

378
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,852
now face the judgment of Paul and
Prue.

379
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:11,532
Hello, Mark. Hello. Hi, Mark. Hi.

380
00:18:14,932 --> 00:18:17,252
I mean, they're quite impressive.
I do like the stout one.

381
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:18,772
It's the colour I expected it to be.

382
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:21,092
This has been coloured quite a bit,

383
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:23,052
but I don't really mind
that to be honest.

384
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:26,812
So we've got a sobrasada
and an Irish sheep smoked cheddar.

385
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:28,572
I think it's a decent soda bread.

386
00:18:28,572 --> 00:18:30,892
There is flavour in there,
but you've got to hunt it.

387
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,092
I tell you what, it's delicious

388
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:34,412
if you taste it with the top,
then you really get the flavour.

389
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:35,692
Yeah, well, that's the cheese, yeah.

390
00:18:35,692 --> 00:18:38,572
And then I've got chocolate
and Irish stout.

391
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:39,732
The chocolate comes through.

392
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:40,812
It's very good.

393
00:18:40,812 --> 00:18:43,332
You do get the chocolate instantly
and then the stout lingers.

394
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:44,532
That's a great loaf.

395
00:18:44,532 --> 00:18:46,892
And the butter's lovely. Thank you.
I think it's a good job. Thank you.

396
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,772
Thank you. Thank you. Well done!

397
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:50,372
Ooh!

398
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:54,732
They look quite rustic,

399
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:55,772
but both the same size.

400
00:18:55,772 --> 00:18:57,132
I think they look quite nice.

401
00:18:57,132 --> 00:18:59,652
The onions and the chorizo
go really well together.

402
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:00,852
It's a little underbaked.

403
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:03,372
It's a pity because
the edge is perfect.

404
00:19:03,372 --> 00:19:05,132
Right, glace cherry bread.

405
00:19:05,132 --> 00:19:06,692
Ooh, look at that.

406
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:08,012
You can't taste the glace cherries,

407
00:19:08,012 --> 00:19:10,492
but I'm getting the marzipan, which
is delicious. Oh, it's delicious.

408
00:19:10,492 --> 00:19:13,252
The marzipan comes whacking
through. It's just lovely.

409
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:17,532
There's a good crunch to it. Hmm.

410
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,932
It's really lovely texture.
Beautiful.

411
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:22,612
I think it's a great-tasting loaf.
So do I.

412
00:19:22,612 --> 00:19:24,932
You've chosen some flavours that
work in all breads,

413
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:26,332
and olive is one of those.

414
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,492
And my sweet is blueberry
and maple bacon.

415
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:33,212
Well, the blueberries are not
exactly evenly spread, are they?

416
00:19:33,212 --> 00:19:35,012
But when I do get a blueberry,
it's delicious

417
00:19:35,012 --> 00:19:36,412
and the texture's really good.

418
00:19:36,412 --> 00:19:38,772
It's just that I'm missing the
bacon. It's wasted on the outside.

419
00:19:38,772 --> 00:19:40,852
A lot of it's just going to end up
on the plate, as we see there,

420
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:44,052
and you're not going to taste it.
Thank you very much, Lottie.
Well done. Thank you.

421
00:19:47,492 --> 00:19:48,692
Think the loaves look great.

422
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:52,052
It's very brave to take
the gluten-free option.

423
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:53,612
It's difficult, though, isn't it?

424
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:56,892
It's falling to bits a bit and then
it gets gluey in your mouth.

425
00:19:56,892 --> 00:19:58,852
OK. This is the ginger?

426
00:19:58,852 --> 00:19:59,932
Ginger beer, yeah.

427
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,852
I love that, I think
the texture's beautiful.

428
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:03,692
It's very cake-like, though,
isn't it?

429
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:05,212
I just think it's a little bit
stodgy.

430
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:06,612
I think the flavours are delicious.

431
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:08,412
Your flavours are normally spot on.

432
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:15,252
Very rustic, aren't they?
Yeah, they both look classic.

433
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:16,732
Yeah, really good.

434
00:20:17,732 --> 00:20:19,012
I love that. Really?

435
00:20:19,012 --> 00:20:20,412
Mm. It's a nice loaf.

436
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:23,212
If you get a mouthful of everything,
it's delicious. Yeah.

437
00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:25,492
Thank you. Thank you very much. OK.

438
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:26,772
This one's a little doughier.

439
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:28,252
Bit more cake-like.

440
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:30,612
Nice flavour, though.
It's cranberries, is it?

441
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:33,252
Cranberries, chocolate and sea
salt.

442
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:34,492
I'm not getting the cranberry.

443
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:35,972
It's just a little bit weak.

444
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:37,372
Hmm. It just needs a bit more.

445
00:20:37,372 --> 00:20:38,932
Thank you. Thank you very much.

446
00:20:42,852 --> 00:20:45,172
They both look as if they
haven't risen quite enough.

447
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:46,852
There are very big lumps of sausage.

448
00:20:46,852 --> 00:20:48,772
Oh, yes.

449
00:20:48,772 --> 00:20:50,532
Do you always like a large sausage?

450
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:51,732
Don't care to comment.

451
00:20:51,732 --> 00:20:52,892
OK, fair enough.

452
00:20:54,092 --> 00:20:57,012
Actually, the sausage is OK,
the olives are OK.

453
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:59,372
The bread itself, I'd have
left it in longer. Right.

454
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:01,732
See how wet it is?
Oh, that's why it's heavy.

455
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:03,652
Yeah.
It would be nice if it was lighter.

456
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:06,852
Wow.

457
00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:09,172
That much polenta in there, I think,
was a mistake.

458
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:10,732
It's too gritty for me.

459
00:21:10,732 --> 00:21:14,532
It's a bit like eating a lemon
drizzle cake in a sandstorm.

460
00:21:17,932 --> 00:21:20,172
It looks as if it's risen nicely.

461
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:25,132
Hasn't got enough flavour in it for
me. No?

462
00:21:25,132 --> 00:21:26,412
Did you put gruyere in there? Yes.

463
00:21:26,412 --> 00:21:28,692
You need double that. Treble that.
Yeah. OK.

464
00:21:30,972 --> 00:21:32,132
You do get the chocolate,

465
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:34,492
you're just not getting enough in
each bite, that's my issue,

466
00:21:34,492 --> 00:21:36,292
which is a shame cos it's baked
well, actually.

467
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:37,852
You made two very good loaves.

468
00:21:37,852 --> 00:21:40,092
You just need a bit more flavour.

469
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,132
Let's try the za'atar one first.

470
00:21:45,132 --> 00:21:48,092
What temperature did you put them
in the oven? 160.

471
00:21:48,092 --> 00:21:49,692
That's why it's as pale as it is,

472
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:52,052
but the blend of the olives
with the za'atar is delicious.

473
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:53,492
Hmm, I like the flavour, too.

474
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:56,172
Right, sweet one.
So the fruit's mostly apricots?

475
00:21:56,172 --> 00:21:59,212
Apricots, dried cherries and walnut.

476
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:01,532
I think that is delicious.
Thank you.

477
00:22:01,532 --> 00:22:03,052
Really, really good.

478
00:22:03,052 --> 00:22:05,572
My only issue with both those
is your temperature choice.

479
00:22:05,572 --> 00:22:06,892
You should've baked it higher

480
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,852
and it would've been spot on for
both of them.

481
00:22:08,852 --> 00:22:10,772
Thank you.
Thank you so much, thank you.

482
00:22:14,252 --> 00:22:16,892
I think they look good, but I hope
that's baked all the way through

483
00:22:16,892 --> 00:22:19,452
cos I get a bit worried
when they're that pale.

484
00:22:19,452 --> 00:22:21,132
Just needed a little
longer in the oven.

485
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,772
It's such a pity
because the flavour is lovely.

486
00:22:23,772 --> 00:22:25,292
That's a bit soggy, too.

487
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:30,092
Does have that spicy bara brith
flavour to it.

488
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:33,132
When you try and push a load of
fruit into a loaf,

489
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:35,892
if you shape it too tight, all
the fruit goes to the outside.

490
00:22:35,892 --> 00:22:37,812
If you look inside, there's nothing
in there.

491
00:22:37,812 --> 00:22:40,172
I like the flavour, but,
unfortunately, all the fruit burnt

492
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:41,932
on the top of the loaf, not in it.
Yeah.

493
00:22:45,412 --> 00:22:47,292
I think, overall, they look really
nice.

494
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:50,012
I think the idea of putting a smoked
salmon in it is so original.

495
00:22:50,012 --> 00:22:51,252
I've never had that.

496
00:22:51,252 --> 00:22:53,532
You invented a bread!

497
00:22:53,532 --> 00:22:54,692
That, I really like.

498
00:22:54,692 --> 00:22:56,052
The salmon in there really works.

499
00:22:56,052 --> 00:22:57,852
It's like a whole sandwich all in
one.

500
00:22:57,852 --> 00:22:59,612
The aftertaste is lovely as well.

501
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,572
It's nice, that, and it's well
baked. Thank you.

502
00:23:02,812 --> 00:23:07,212
Well, that's a very grown-up fruit
cake. Lots of booze. Lovely!

503
00:23:07,212 --> 00:23:09,532
I've soaked the fruit
a couple of weeks.

504
00:23:09,532 --> 00:23:11,492
A couple of weeks? Are you serious?

505
00:23:11,492 --> 00:23:14,052
Wow. She wanted us to taste it.
It's lovely. Thank you.

506
00:23:14,052 --> 00:23:16,732
Hermine, I think they're very
special. I really do.

507
00:23:18,612 --> 00:23:20,412
Thank you.

508
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:23,212
Do you know what I love? I love the
fact that I've never had 'em before

509
00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:25,172
and this is what Bake Off's all
about.

510
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:27,892
This is really, really complex in
its flavours.

511
00:23:27,892 --> 00:23:29,212
I love it, I think it's special.

512
00:23:29,212 --> 00:23:31,012
Well done.

513
00:23:31,012 --> 00:23:34,892
That's it - I'm packing.
Time to go home.

514
00:23:34,892 --> 00:23:37,772
That's 2020 over!

515
00:23:37,772 --> 00:23:39,612
That went better than I expected.

516
00:23:39,612 --> 00:23:43,212
I was terrified, I'll be honest with
you, but the flavour queen is back.

517
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:48,492
The comments were not
entirely positive,

518
00:23:48,492 --> 00:23:51,372
but I'm very determined,
learning from the last technical,

519
00:23:51,372 --> 00:23:54,732
to spend a bit of time thinking and
not just dashing straight into it.

520
00:23:59,532 --> 00:24:02,492
Bread week isn't about to
get any easier.

521
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:05,972
Our ten bakers will now face
a technical...with a twist.

522
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,532
Bakers, it's time for your technical
challenge,

523
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,012
which, today, has been set by Paul.

524
00:24:13,012 --> 00:24:14,612
Paul, any words of advice?

525
00:24:14,612 --> 00:24:17,692
You need to get your timings right.

526
00:24:19,652 --> 00:24:23,012
Yeah, he said words of advice,
not just words.

527
00:24:23,012 --> 00:24:25,372
As ever, your technical
challenge will be judged blind

528
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:28,092
so we're going to have to ask these
two rascals to skedaddle.

529
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,332
Off you pop.

530
00:24:29,332 --> 00:24:30,892
# Go on now, go

531
00:24:30,892 --> 00:24:32,892
# Walk out the door

532
00:24:32,892 --> 00:24:35,172
# Just turn around now

533
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:37,092
# You're not welcome any more. #

534
00:24:39,652 --> 00:24:45,252
So, Paul would like you to bake
six rainbow-coloured bagels.

535
00:24:45,252 --> 00:24:48,812
Rainbow coloured bagels are the same
as normal bagels,

536
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:51,292
just with five different-coloured
doughs.

537
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:53,652
Layered, shaped then boiled
and baked

538
00:24:53,652 --> 00:24:56,012
to achieve a lovely, shiny, chewy
crust.

539
00:24:56,012 --> 00:24:57,172
Chewy crust.

540
00:24:57,172 --> 00:25:00,652
You have two hours and 45 minutes.

541
00:25:00,652 --> 00:25:01,812
On your marks.

542
00:25:01,812 --> 00:25:03,212
Get set.

543
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:04,492
Bake.

544
00:25:06,452 --> 00:25:07,892
Oh, my God.

545
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:09,692
What the hell is a rainbow bagel?

546
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:10,692
I mean...

547
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,012
No idea.

548
00:25:14,172 --> 00:25:19,932
Never made them before, certainly
not a rainbow one, so...interesting.

549
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:22,492
I have made bagels before,
but I don't want to say, like,

550
00:25:22,492 --> 00:25:24,972
"Oh, I've made bagels before and
then they come out awful."

551
00:25:24,972 --> 00:25:27,772
Kind of makes sense when you
read it through. Just go with it.

552
00:25:29,012 --> 00:25:32,812
There's a bagel shop near work
so I've seen how they make it,

553
00:25:32,812 --> 00:25:35,132
but I've never made it myself.

554
00:25:35,132 --> 00:25:37,532
I wouldn't have to - it's right
there.

555
00:25:37,532 --> 00:25:38,532
Paul.

556
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:42,372
Paul, why rainbow-coloured bagels?

557
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:45,732
Well, I think bagels are a great
challenge when you're making bread.

558
00:25:45,732 --> 00:25:49,132
You've got to boil them, which is
unusual, and then bake them as well.

559
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:51,492
I think the rainbow colours
for me, although it originated

560
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:54,652
over in the States, I think it
represents the NHS.

561
00:25:54,652 --> 00:25:55,772
Well, it does now.

562
00:25:55,772 --> 00:25:57,572
It does now, certainly.

563
00:25:57,572 --> 00:26:00,492
Now, basically, what they've got to
do is roll each piece, each colour,

564
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,012
into a rectangle and then you lay
the next one on the top

565
00:26:03,012 --> 00:26:04,372
all the way up. You stack them.

566
00:26:04,372 --> 00:26:08,772
Yes, and twist it to create that
spiral and then you seal.

567
00:26:08,772 --> 00:26:12,612
You plunge it in the water for
anything between 15 and 40 seconds

568
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,452
and then pop in the oven,
bake it off.

569
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:16,132
Can we taste them? Absolutely.

570
00:26:16,132 --> 00:26:17,892
What could go wrong?

571
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:20,772
You can overprove and underprove
very easily on a bagel.

572
00:26:20,772 --> 00:26:23,252
If they've overproved it before
it's gone in the water or

573
00:26:23,252 --> 00:26:25,852
if they leave it in the water too
long, it will flatten in the oven.

574
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:27,332
It's absolutely delicious.

575
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:29,732
It's even brighter
inside than it is outside.

576
00:26:29,732 --> 00:26:31,172
Pretty vibrant, Prue.

577
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,452
They may have made bagels before,

578
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:34,292
but I guarantee they wouldn't have
made 'em like this.

579
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,972
I've never made them like this.

580
00:26:35,972 --> 00:26:38,972
Happy bread. Happy bread,
that's what it is.

581
00:26:41,012 --> 00:26:43,332
Make and knead the dough.

582
00:26:43,332 --> 00:26:45,612
It's, erm...scant, isn't it, at
best?

583
00:26:46,612 --> 00:26:49,132
So I normally would just chuck
it in a stand mixer.

584
00:26:49,132 --> 00:26:51,452
We're definitely getting a full
workout today.

585
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:53,692
We're in 2020. Who kneads by hand?

586
00:26:55,372 --> 00:26:58,372
I know it needs to be kneaded
a good amount for a bagel

587
00:26:58,372 --> 00:27:00,892
so I'm going to be working this
until it's super, super smooth.

588
00:27:00,892 --> 00:27:03,612
Think it's got to be quite
a stretchy, elastic dough.

589
00:27:03,612 --> 00:27:06,372
It still feels a little tight.

590
00:27:06,372 --> 00:27:08,652
Stretch and tear, that's how to go.

591
00:27:08,652 --> 00:27:10,452
Rowan's doing the slap already.

592
00:27:10,452 --> 00:27:11,812
Whack it.

593
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:14,292
It's very therapeutic, it really is.

594
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:18,172
So disappointed that there aren't
any rainbows in a rainbow bagel.

595
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:19,252
Real rainbows?

596
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:21,252
I wanted you to have to go
and catch a rainbow.

597
00:27:21,252 --> 00:27:25,132
Yeah. Lasso it, chop it up,
grate it into the bagel.

598
00:27:25,132 --> 00:27:27,652
But, no, it's just some coloured
bread.

599
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:30,572
I think that must be about it now.

600
00:27:30,572 --> 00:27:33,852
And then it says to divide
the dough into five pieces.

601
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,772
We colour them each a
different colour.

602
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:38,732
I've never done coloured bread
before

603
00:27:38,732 --> 00:27:41,052
so it's all part of the voyage
of discovery, really.

604
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:42,332
It's a very messy business.

605
00:27:42,332 --> 00:27:45,492
# Red and yellow and
pink and green... #

606
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:49,652
Don't know the words to the
rainbow song.

607
00:27:49,652 --> 00:27:52,012
I suspect they want to be nice
and vibrant.

608
00:27:52,012 --> 00:27:54,932
It's really hard to
mix in all the colours.

609
00:27:54,932 --> 00:27:57,812
I might have used too much, just
judging by the fact that

610
00:27:57,812 --> 00:28:00,932
no-one else's bench is the same
colour as mine.

611
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:03,372
You're a Smurf, aren't you? Yes.

612
00:28:04,652 --> 00:28:06,412
Right, that'll do. I'm over that.

613
00:28:06,412 --> 00:28:08,332
Number four, rise.

614
00:28:08,332 --> 00:28:10,012
Exceptionally descriptive.

615
00:28:10,012 --> 00:28:11,532
Arise, sir dough.

616
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:14,212
I'm going to leave it to prove
until it's doubled in size.

617
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:15,932
It's only small pieces.

618
00:28:15,932 --> 00:28:19,252
I'm going to go about 20 minutes
to start with.

619
00:28:19,252 --> 00:28:20,372
And breathe.

620
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:24,972
I would normally snooze
or play the piano, actually,

621
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:27,652
while the dough was rising or
perhaps do a spot of gardening.

622
00:28:27,652 --> 00:28:30,052
I could nip outside and do
a little bit of pruning.

623
00:28:34,372 --> 00:28:38,772
If you prod and it leaves a slight
indent, then they're ready to go,

624
00:28:38,772 --> 00:28:41,812
so they're doing all of that so
I think it's time to go with them.

625
00:28:41,812 --> 00:28:45,612
Going to start rolling them
out in colour order, so red first.

626
00:28:45,612 --> 00:28:48,012
Is this from the handshake?

627
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:51,172
Is this what happens with Paul?

628
00:28:51,172 --> 00:28:52,412
That's his fake tan.

629
00:28:54,052 --> 00:28:56,572
You know they can take handshakes
back? Oh, yeah.

630
00:28:56,572 --> 00:28:58,292
They'll just reverse the footage.

631
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:00,972
It'll be like...

632
00:29:02,252 --> 00:29:05,732
Roll out to a rectangle,
measuring 15 by 12 centimetres.

633
00:29:05,732 --> 00:29:08,332
I'm just going to check what
15 centimetres looks like,

634
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:09,492
just so I know.

635
00:29:09,492 --> 00:29:11,212
What are you comparing it against?

636
00:29:11,212 --> 00:29:13,012
Just half the ruler, Dave.

637
00:29:14,892 --> 00:29:17,852
So you're actually just layering
the doughs.

638
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:20,212
I'm just trying to get
some kind of evenness.

639
00:29:20,212 --> 00:29:22,172
It's like making very brightly
coloured mattresses.

640
00:29:22,172 --> 00:29:24,172
They're very bouncy and very
illuminous.

641
00:29:24,172 --> 00:29:26,572
So now I'm cutting
the dough into six.

642
00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:29,052
You have to do, roll and twist
the dough to a rope

643
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:31,532
measuring approximately
24 centimetres long.

644
00:29:31,532 --> 00:29:33,212
You are approximately 24.

645
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:35,612
I am, aren't I? We've got
the 24 centimetres. Yeah.

646
00:29:35,612 --> 00:29:38,252
How many inches is that?
I think in inches.

647
00:29:38,252 --> 00:29:39,972
Erm, that's nine and a half inches.

648
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:43,172
I think that's respectable myself.

649
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:46,892
Kind of pull back on this palm
and go forward on this palm.

650
00:29:48,652 --> 00:29:49,932
Oh, dear.

651
00:29:49,932 --> 00:29:52,452
This is a rainbow, isn't it?

652
00:29:52,452 --> 00:29:53,452
There you go.

653
00:29:55,812 --> 00:29:58,172
Just got to try
and seal this bit now.

654
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:01,012
Gently roll backwards and forwards.

655
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:02,372
Don't get it.

656
00:30:02,372 --> 00:30:04,652
I don't want it to fall apart.

657
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:05,812
Haven't got a clue!

658
00:30:07,412 --> 00:30:10,252
It's not too bad. Once you get
the knack of it, it's like, woo!

659
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:15,052
Oh, look - everyone's twisted
theirs. I didn't twist mine.

660
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:17,812
I think it's about right cos they're
going to expand so that hole's going

661
00:30:17,812 --> 00:30:20,132
to shrink and I think by the time
it's expanded and shrunk,

662
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:21,372
it should be about right.

663
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:24,612
It does say twist, it does say
twist. Does it? Yeah.

664
00:30:24,612 --> 00:30:26,132
It says "roll and twist".

665
00:30:28,492 --> 00:30:32,212
Bakers, you are halfway through.

666
00:30:32,212 --> 00:30:34,812
And number ten is "prove".

667
00:30:34,812 --> 00:30:37,252
Just the one word in that step.

668
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,532
He's not very elaborate, is he?

669
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:41,372
So I want to give them as much
time as possible, really.

670
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,852
I think the trick with these is the
timing.

671
00:30:43,852 --> 00:30:46,412
The second prove is really going to
be the one for texture.

672
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:47,972
Try that again, shall we?

673
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:49,732
I'll put the drawer up a bit warmer,

674
00:30:49,732 --> 00:30:52,052
see if we can get a quicker prove on
the go.

675
00:30:52,052 --> 00:30:53,652
And we'll see how we get on.

676
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:57,492
Judging the right time to stop
the final prove is critical.

677
00:30:57,492 --> 00:30:59,252
It's even driven me to drink green
tea.

678
00:30:59,252 --> 00:31:01,212
Come on. That's gin, we know. Yeah.

679
00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:03,732
If I was on this competition,
I'd drink though it.

680
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:04,852
I've started drinking.

681
00:31:04,852 --> 00:31:06,292
I've not drank for four years.

682
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:09,132
Here, I've started
drinking in the evening.

683
00:31:09,132 --> 00:31:11,412
If the bagels are underproved...

684
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:12,532
Anything happening in there?

685
00:31:12,532 --> 00:31:16,932
..they won't have the dome-like rise
that Paul and Prue are expecting.

686
00:31:16,932 --> 00:31:18,372
Oh, check you out!

687
00:31:19,692 --> 00:31:21,252
They're looking good!

688
00:31:21,252 --> 00:31:23,052
It doesn't look bad, actually.

689
00:31:23,052 --> 00:31:24,372
Reckon they're about ready.

690
00:31:24,372 --> 00:31:26,332
Right, glasses off.

691
00:31:26,332 --> 00:31:30,692
"And bring a saucepan of water to a
boil. Add the bicarbonate of soda."

692
00:31:30,692 --> 00:31:31,732
If they're overproved,

693
00:31:31,732 --> 00:31:34,172
they'll puff up too much when they
hit the water...

694
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:36,212
Who's going to take the plunge
first?

695
00:31:36,212 --> 00:31:38,772
..and collapse before
they go into the oven.

696
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,132
So let's have a look.

697
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:44,652
It's where I feel a bit nervous
cos I don't think they cook long.

698
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,492
"Cook until the bagels are puffed
and the shape has set."

699
00:31:47,492 --> 00:31:51,892
I think this is what gives the
bagels that chewy kind of texture.

700
00:31:51,892 --> 00:31:56,332
So I'm boiling them for about
30 to 45 seconds on each side.

701
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:59,052
I have no idea whether that's done.

702
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:01,932
You seen the size of them?
They're huge.

703
00:32:01,932 --> 00:32:04,852
Bakers, you have 30 minutes left.

704
00:32:04,852 --> 00:32:05,932
Have I missed it? Yes.

705
00:32:09,452 --> 00:32:11,212
Not doing any more than that.

706
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:13,492
They go in looking good
and then things happen.

707
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:17,532
This is not a bagel.

708
00:32:17,532 --> 00:32:18,932
This is a unicorn horn.

709
00:32:18,932 --> 00:32:20,012
It's hard to know, isn't it?

710
00:32:20,012 --> 00:32:22,532
I know, especially when you've never
made them before.

711
00:32:22,532 --> 00:32:25,652
Why don't you, like, look up
and see what other people are doing?

712
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,932
I have been, but theirs aren't
looking terribly good either.

713
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:32,412
Is that set? So hard to know.
Let's have 'em in a bit longer.

714
00:32:32,412 --> 00:32:33,772
Ooh!

715
00:32:33,772 --> 00:32:37,252
Paul Hollywood is definitely taking
his handshake back cos these...

716
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:38,452
Hmm.

717
00:32:38,452 --> 00:32:40,732
Yeah, so that's them all boiled now.

718
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:42,412
Even though they've doubled in size,

719
00:32:42,412 --> 00:32:44,692
they seem to have lost it when I've
boiled them.

720
00:32:46,052 --> 00:32:47,212
I got it.

721
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:49,732
This one opened up,
but don't tell Paul.

722
00:32:49,732 --> 00:32:51,252
But I've stuck it back together

723
00:32:51,252 --> 00:32:53,932
and hopefully it'll just glue back
together in the oven.

724
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:55,852
Going into the oven now.

725
00:32:55,852 --> 00:32:57,652
It just says bake.

726
00:32:57,652 --> 00:32:59,572
We'll see what the oven does with
'em.

727
00:32:59,572 --> 00:33:01,532
Could be just a case of getting
a nice crust on them.

728
00:33:01,532 --> 00:33:02,692
20 maximum, I think.

729
00:33:02,692 --> 00:33:04,332
I don't know for how long.

730
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:06,652
I'm hoping they'll puff up again

731
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:10,332
and it will disguise the wrinkly
bits they've now got.

732
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:13,932
Ba-bakers, you've got, ooh...
ten minutes left!

733
00:33:13,932 --> 00:33:15,692
That's not very much time, is it?

734
00:33:17,132 --> 00:33:18,572
So how do you know they're ready?

735
00:33:18,572 --> 00:33:20,892
Cos normally they'll get brown.

736
00:33:20,892 --> 00:33:22,692
These got colour.

737
00:33:22,692 --> 00:33:24,532
My blue's way too dark.

738
00:33:24,532 --> 00:33:26,892
I really don't know what
I'm looking for.

739
00:33:26,892 --> 00:33:29,252
I'm not loving what's going
on inside there.

740
00:33:29,252 --> 00:33:31,212
I think they're a bit too thin and
too wide.

741
00:33:31,212 --> 00:33:34,332
I think they're going to want them
to be a bit...puffier.

742
00:33:34,332 --> 00:33:36,612
They in there? They're in there.

743
00:33:36,612 --> 00:33:38,372
They're looking pretty good.

744
00:33:38,372 --> 00:33:39,772
Yours not so much.

745
00:33:39,772 --> 00:33:41,612
Oh, look, Sura looks sad.

746
00:33:41,612 --> 00:33:43,012
You all right? Yeah.

747
00:33:43,012 --> 00:33:44,052
Do you want a piggy back?

748
00:33:44,052 --> 00:33:45,052
No. OK.

749
00:33:46,332 --> 00:33:47,732
Do not want to overbake them.

750
00:33:47,732 --> 00:33:48,772
Another minute.

751
00:33:48,772 --> 00:33:50,012
What have we got?

752
00:33:50,012 --> 00:33:52,372
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

753
00:33:52,372 --> 00:33:53,372
Ohhh!

754
00:33:55,932 --> 00:33:58,252
I'm just looking to make sure
they're not going too brown.

755
00:33:58,252 --> 00:34:00,052
They look great, Linda.

756
00:34:00,052 --> 00:34:01,692
Mine are all kind of wrinkled.

757
00:34:01,692 --> 00:34:04,292
And they have been
boiled for some time.

758
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,292
I think I'm going to take 'em out.

759
00:34:07,932 --> 00:34:09,772
That looks good. Well done.

760
00:34:11,412 --> 00:34:13,252
They sound hollow, so...

761
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:14,772
Yeah, they sound done.

762
00:34:16,612 --> 00:34:18,892
Flat as pancakes.

763
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,372
Bakers, your time is up.

764
00:34:22,412 --> 00:34:24,172
That's not a bagel.

765
00:34:24,172 --> 00:34:27,812
I'll be honest...I think
I've overcooked all of them.

766
00:34:27,812 --> 00:34:29,452
Just strategic placing.

767
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,492
Exactly!

768
00:34:32,492 --> 00:34:34,412
Mine seem kind of soft and
wrinkly...

769
00:34:34,412 --> 00:34:35,892
..which is not attractive!

770
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,480
Paul and Prue are looking for six
vibrant, rainbow-coloured bagels

771
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,720
that are smooth and crisp on the
outside and slightly chewy inside.

772
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,680
We've got the five vivid colours.

773
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,960
Right...

774
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,400
These aren't too bad.
You've got the colours.

775
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,280
And they're quite smooth.
And quite light.

776
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,280
They're a lot smaller
than most of the others.

777
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,440
They're a good size.

778
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,400
Nice and soft,
crispy on the outside.

779
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,720
Very nice. It's nice bread.

780
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,080
All the same size, nice and smooth

781
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,400
and the crumb's really tasty
as well.

782
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,680
Good. Very good.

783
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,600
Right, moving on to the Hula Hoops.

784
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,240
These are a little bit big
and, actually, it's overproved.

785
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,560
It's flat.

786
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,720
Tastes all right, though.
Mm, tastes fine.

787
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,760
Moving on to these whoppers.

788
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,000
They haven't been twisted.

789
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,720
You can see where it's joined,
but it's just gone round as one.

790
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Colours are nice -
very bright and vibrant.

791
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,080
Nice flavour, though.
It's a nice flavour. Good texture.

792
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,680
Right, moving on to this.
Very, very flat.

793
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,320
Again, they've been overproved
before they went in the water

794
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,200
and then afterwards,
they'd lost all their height.

795
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,400
Taste great, though.

796
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,120
Now, these are a little bit dark.

797
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,680
Just feel the crispiness here.

798
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,120
Yeah.

799
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,720
But, actually,
the shape, pretty uniform.

800
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,320
It's actually... They're not too
bad. Just slightly overbaked.

801
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,960
Now these, again, have had the issue
with the water, overproved.

802
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,680
You can see the marks on it.

803
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,560
That's not at all crisp
and it's soft.

804
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,960
Underbaked. The flavour's OK,
though. Flavour's fine.

805
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,320
Now, these aren't bad,
these are fairly smooth,

806
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,080
but they've just overdone it
slightly in the water.

807
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,840
Good flavour.

808
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,240
These are overbaked again.

809
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,520
You see how dark they've gone?

810
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,800
They're not very attractive.

811
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,720
Bit tough.

812
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,960
These are big.

813
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,000
They look more like pretzels,
but they're vibrant colours,

814
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,400
and they are pretty smooth.
Mm.

815
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,400
Yeah. That is delicious.
It is nice.

816
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,920
Now, moving on to the last one.

817
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,840
Lost its way a little bit
in the shaping,

818
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,440
but also with the water as well.

819
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,800
Again, see, the marks?

820
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,440
Nice bread, though.

821
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,440
OK, this is going to be interesting
to judge.

822
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,760
Paul and Prue
will now rank the bagels...

823
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,560
That one second from the end's good.

824
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,200
..from worst to best.

825
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,680
So, in last place...

826
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,360
..we have this one.

827
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,680
Rowan, they are overproved
and underbaked.

828
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,440
In ninth spot we have this one.

829
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,040
You've actually managed to bake this
one, but it is overproved.

830
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,720
And then, in eighth place,
we have this one.

831
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,200
Sura, lovely colour.

832
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,840
Your twisting wasn't perfect.

833
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,400
It was a little bit wobbly.

834
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,320
Hermine is seventh,
Laura is sixth,

835
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,840
Lottie, fifth,
and Peter, fourth.

836
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,720
In third, we have this one.

837
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,080
Not bad at all.
You've managed to get a nice colour.

838
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,480
It's got the nice twist in there.

839
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,000
And in second place...

840
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,840
..we have this one.

841
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,560
Who's that? Marc,
they are really nice bagels.

842
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,960
They're properly risen, good effort.

843
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,440
And in first place,
we have this one.

844
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,200
Well done, Linda.
It's nice and chewy.

845
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,800
You've got lovely colours inside
with the flavour as well.

846
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,600
Thank you.
They tasted really good.

847
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,880
Well done, Linda.

848
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,520
Oh, wow! What a high.

849
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,280
Can't wait to tell my family.
I can't wait to tell Richard.

850
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,120
I'll ring him up
and I'll just go, "Argh!"

851
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,760
That was a good result for me.

852
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,680
The last two Technicals,
I've not fared too well,

853
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,480
so, yeah, I was really happy
with that one.

854
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,040
Well, I had a fabulous time.

855
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,840
It was a really good challenge.
The result wasn't great.

856
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,200
Tomorrow, we can do better.
Got to do better.

857
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,880
Just one challenge remains.

858
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,320
So, Bread Week, something
very close to your heart, Paul.

859
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,680
I think, overall, the standards have
been pretty good.

860
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,040
It was nice to give out
a handshake to Hermine.

861
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,040
I think she did really well. Yeah.
Very clever.

862
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,320
She invented a new genre of bread.

863
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,400
But, for Star Baker, I think

864
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,440
she struggled a little bit
in the Technical.

865
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm not saying she's not.
There are a couple of other people.

866
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,640
Both Marks have done well
in Signature and Technical. Yeah.

867
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,080
And, actually, Lottie as well.

868
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,840
Lottie described
herself as a swan.

869
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,520
She said, "Oh, you don't know what's
going on beneath the surface."

870
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,720
She is not swan like.

871
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,360
She's always just going, "Urgh...!"

872
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,160
I've never seen a swan
panicking that hard.

873
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,600
"Urgh...!"

874
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,760
Who's in trouble?

875
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,600
I think Rowan, he's in difficulty
this week again.

876
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,080
Those soda breads,
one was a polenta cake.

877
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,400
One was a sandpit.

878
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,240
It was very sandy.

879
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,520
I think David's actually done OK,
but he is slipping down there.

880
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,600
Curse of the Star Baker!

881
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,960
Ultimately, it's quite a tricky
Showstopper today,

882
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,320
but what I'd like to see is all
the bakers complete the task -

883
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,760
including Rowan.

884
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,040
Interesting. Interesting.

885
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,600
I think I'm in love with you.

886
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,560
Shall we talk about this later?
I think we should talk about it now.

887
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,200
Hello, bakers,
welcome back to the tent.

888
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,120
It's time for
your Showstopper Challenge.

889
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,560
Today, the judges would like you to
make a large decorative bread plaque

890
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,960
in the style of a traditional
harvest festival sheaf.

891
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,640
Giving your own take on the sheaf,
your bread plaque must portray

892
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,120
the one thing
you are most grateful for.

893
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,960
Your bread must be impressive
in size, visually powerful

894
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,280
and, of course, it's got to be
delish-delosh.

895
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,320
You have three hours and 30 minutes.

896
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,120
Don't seem long enough!

897
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,480
I know, they've been
done up like a kipper!

898
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,040
On your marks...
..get set...

899
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,040
..bake!

900
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,960
Feeling nervous today.
It's a big one.

901
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,280
Traditionally the harvest plaque
is completely inedible

902
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,840
and rock hard and varnished,

903
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,280
so to have to make it utterly
delicious,

904
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,120
it's quite a challenge, really.

905
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,440
Bricking it.

906
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,840
Now, the bread plaque itself must be

907
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,360
a celebration of something that
the bakers are thankful for.

908
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,120
It could be your house, it could be
their health - it could be anything.

909
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,520
But it's really easy to sit there

910
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,880
and design something
elaborate on paper.

911
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,360
It's not anything like easy
to make it in bread.

912
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,120
It's about manipulating dough
itself, using knife techniques,

913
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,440
plaiting, twisting, spiralling
the bread.

914
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,680
I think it's a great challenge

915
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,400
because it'll give me the indication

916
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,320
of how far these bakers have
travelled on their bread journey.

917
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,840
And I hope they've practised it

918
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,200
because they'll never get it right
if they haven't.

919
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,280
To give their elaborate
plaques different flavours, textures

920
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,720
and shapes, all of the bakers have
chosen to make multiple breads.

921
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,280
I'm making three breads,

922
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,160
there's a lot of multitasking
going on.

923
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,960
There's no time for faffery today.

924
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,960
So, I'm doing two breads - a basic
white bread, a wholemeal bread

925
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,360
and then, around the edges, I've got
this Tibetan monastery bread.

926
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,800
Flavoured with fennel,
coriander and caraway seeds,

927
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,120
Marc's bread will be swirled
together

928
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,120
to form a Buddhist dharma wheel.

929
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,160
Are you a Buddhist?
Is this what you're grateful for?

930
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,840
I'm not a Buddhist, no, but after I
had the accident where I lost my leg

931
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,160
and I wasn't in a very good place...

932
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,800
..and just trying to come to terms
with what had happened,

933
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,200
I picked up a wonderful book.

934
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,920
It was about the philosophy
of Buddhism.

935
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,920
It made it a lot clearer what
I needed to do to kind of still

936
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,520
live a life and make my life
worth living, you know?

937
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,080
So this, yeah, it means
a lot to me, this one.

938
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,680
I'm going to knead it
for about ten minutes.

939
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,880
It's not too sticky.

940
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,320
More smooth and silky.

941
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,200
Nowhere near ready.
Give it some real welly.

942
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,400
Good bit of exercise, which
I'm slightly missing at the moment.

943
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,400
I just absolutely love
this part about bread.

944
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,720
You can put so much feeling into it.

945
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,760
Can put a lot of love into it,
you know?

946
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,600
Linda's putting her love
into two family favourite.

947
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,240
A black olive plait will frame
tiger bread animals that she helped

948
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,520
look after on her uncle's farm.

949
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,480
As a kid, I used to milk the cows

950
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,520
and we used to carry the buckets
of milk up through the farm

951
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,000
to my auntie's kitchen,
where she made beautiful cakes.

952
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,360
So rural idyll, isn't it?
Beautiful. Oh, yeah.

953
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,720
You've really gone for the harvest
theme, then, haven't you?

954
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,720
Absolutely, yeah.
It's all about that circle of life.

955
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,600
All right, thank you, Linda.
Thank you. Thank you. Good luck.

956
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,520
Shape of that bottle even reminds me
of the milk churns.

957
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,320
It's a wonderful memory. Mm!

958
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,520
I'll have a little pipe
in a minute.

959
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,880
La-la, la-la, la-la, la...

960
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,040
Linda's not the only baker
celebrating the good life.

961
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,800
I'm feeling very grateful
for my life in Worcestershire

962
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,560
and the wonderful countryside
and the theatre, literature

963
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,160
and music that form such
a big part of my life there.

964
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,560
Rowan's huge plaque will be
made of three flavoured breads

965
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,240
and shaped into Worcestershire's
coat of arms - the pear tree.

966
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,840
He's hoping it'll be enough

967
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,560
to make up for yesterday's
Technical disaster.

968
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,840
Did you come...? Last!

969
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,320
Did you? Of course, yeah.

970
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,040
But if you smash this, then...

971
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,440
But it's probably curtains,
but I'm going to have fun anyway.

972
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,240
I love your attitude.
And also - look at your boots.

973
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,080
This is strong boot game right here.

974
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,440
Look at that, look at that.
Look at these two guys.

975
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,800
While Rowan's taking on
the biggest bread plaque...

976
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,200
It seems to be enormous
compared with everybody else's.

977
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,520
..Hermine might have the most
ambitious plan of them all.

978
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,120
The plan is to make
an enriched dough.

979
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,240
Something to close a brioche.

980
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,200
It can't be a brioche
in three and a half hours.

981
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,560
What have you cut back on
to get it done in the time?

982
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,560
I haven't cut back on anything.

983
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,600
It's supposed to stay
in the fridge overnight,

984
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,440
but I'm going to put it
in the freezer on both sides

985
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,240
for about 15 minutes to harden
the butter so that I can then work.

986
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,600
Quite risky.

987
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,000
I agree.

988
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,440
Hermine's brioche will form
the border of her focaccia

989
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,880
and breadstick plaque
recreating her annual road trips

990
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,960
from London to Paris
to visit family and friends.

991
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,240
They might say it's risky,
doing an enriched dough,

992
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,720
but I like doing it,
so I'm going to do it anyway.

993
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,240
We shall see.

994
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,160
While Hermine is
heading to the freezer...

995
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,520
Think that's probably done now.

996
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,440
Yeah, can you see,
the light's coming through?

997
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,720
So that's good to go.

998
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,960
Proving drawer - there it is.

999
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,720
..the other bakers
are ready to start proving.

1000
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,080
Grow. So that's in for an hour.

1001
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,720
Quite warm in here today,

1002
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,680
so hopefully it'll just rise
without having to force it up.

1003
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,000
I'm going to go by eye today.

1004
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,160
Set the timer for 40 minutes
and just see how it looks.

1005
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,760
With one dough down...

1006
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,600
Right back to some kneading.

1007
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,880
..the process starts all over again.

1008
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,000
I've added fresh yeast.

1009
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,440
The first load will go 15.

1010
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,080
We'll give this one 20, just to let
it kind of catch up a little bit.

1011
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,880
So, in theory, this should all be
proved around the same time.

1012
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,920
And if juggling multiple doughs
wasn't tricky enough...

1013
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,560
This is the most manic bit.

1014
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,520
..some of the bakers have chosen
to make fillings as well.

1015
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,840
The mango, lime and chilli taste is,
like,

1016
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,440
my signature flavour for bread.

1017
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,680
It's just fantastic.

1018
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,320
That smells delish.

1019
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,000
I've got a focaccia base which is
stuffed with pancetta,

1020
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,320
Padano and Gruyere cheese.

1021
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,120
It's basically a posh cheese
and ham sandwich.

1022
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,280
Laura's stuffed focaccia
will take centre stage

1023
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,640
of her musical-themed plaque

1024
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,160
which will be adorned with
spicy fougasse curtains and masks.

1025
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,320
I've probably seen about 70 shows
in the West End.

1026
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,920
And I've seen none. Really?

1027
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,280
You've never been to
a West End musical? No, never.

1028
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,680
Call yourself a gay man?!
Honestly, terrible.

1029
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,120
When this show is over,
we are hitting the town! OK.

1030
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,080
We're going to take him to Wicked...
Yeah.

1031
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,920
..Mamma Mia, Phantom, Les Mis...

1032
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,320
We'll make a list. OK.

1033
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,040
We'll make a list.
Sounds good. It's a date.

1034
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,400
So, I'm just pureeing my apples.

1035
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,760
I grew up in County Armagh
in Northern Ireland,

1036
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,440
which is known as Orchard County
because of all the apple orchards.

1037
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,800
I'm going to freeze the apple puree
in straws

1038
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,240
and then I will braid around
the frozen puree.

1039
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,240
I hope it works. Fingers crossed.

1040
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,600
Mark's also taking a chance with
his flavours,

1041
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:58,000
combining his apple-filled trees
with hazelnut and wild garlic.

1042
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,520
Will Prue and Paul love apple
and wild garlic? I'm not sure.

1043
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,880
But I love it. I think it's such
an amazing taste

1044
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,200
So I'm going to put that in
for its first prove now.

1045
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,760
As more dough begins proving...

1046
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,560
Ready to go.

1047
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,000
..Hermine's brioche dough
is finally cold enough to shape.

1048
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,760
I'm twisting. I'm a bit pushed
for time.

1049
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,480
Cos I don't want the butter melting.

1050
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,880
But I think it will be fine
to go prove now.

1051
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,840
Just on time.

1052
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,440
Might be ready in time to bake.

1053
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,640
I hope so.

1054
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,920
Ah!

1055
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:36,450
90 minutes remain for the bakers to
complete their decorative

1056
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:37,890
bread plaques...

1057
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,490
This is such enormous fun.

1058
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:41,850
It's just a shame it's a
competition, really.

1059
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:45,770
..and their first batch of dough has
risen to the occasion.

1060
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:48,770
The focaccia has doubled in size.

1061
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:50,370
Good rise.

1062
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,610
And any additional ingredients...

1063
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,410
..can now be added.

1064
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:56,690
I need that.

1065
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:59,050
Hazelnuts going in, I want to
really make sure I get it in

1066
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,370
and just not on the top. It smells
amazing, doesn't it?

1067
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,490
Oh!

1068
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,490
I'm just putting in very mature
Somerset Cheddar

1069
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:05,930
and a Spanish chorizo.

1070
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,250
This is going to be an incorporated
dough.

1071
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,770
It's a tricky one to get right.

1072
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:12,090
I've warmed the pre-soaked pear.

1073
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:15,410
I didn't want it to cool the dough
and impede the rise.

1074
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:18,050
It doesn't want to go as flat as a
pancake and stodgy,

1075
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:20,770
which is another of my trademarks.

1076
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,290
This is the canvas for the
bread plaque.

1077
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:26,490
I'm just going to start
shaping it.

1078
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,730
Oh, that's stuck. Well done, Sura!

1079
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:33,090
Once her canvas is ready,
Sura's recreating one of her

1080
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:35,650
most cherished childhood memories,

1081
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:40,010
picking tomatoes off the vine her
mum grew in their London flat.

1082
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:41,490
It was huge.

1083
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:44,930
It was behind the TV in the living
room...like that.

1084
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:48,130
It was on the ceiling and so
whenever I see a tomato vine,

1085
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,770
I remember my mum.

1086
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:52,090
She's like my favourite
person on the Earth.

1087
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,810
Very thankful for her.

1088
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:56,410
Dave is also giving thanks
to his family...

1089
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:58,370
So, I'm making a bread plaque
of my house,

1090
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:00,330
with the family stood outside
the front.

1091
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:02,690
..which is soon getting a new
addition.

1092
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:05,570
Very excited about being a dad,
yeah, really looking forward to it.

1093
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:08,370
We're expecting a boy. Stacey says
I'm very laidback with kids.

1094
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:12,290
It will be baking, DIY, driving.

1095
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:16,530
Dave's giving his Hampshire home
far flung flavours

1096
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,850
inspired by a holiday to Mexico.

1097
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:23,210
Woven hibiscus and guava bread will
sit under a mango, chilli roof.

1098
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:25,050
Are you doing like a shed?

1099
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:27,450
No shed that's in the back garden.
Garden shed? So from....

1100
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:29,810
What about a driveway?
No driveway, no.

1101
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:32,170
Garage? Recycling bins?
No.

1102
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,970
Anything else, Matt?
Decking outside?

1103
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:35,730
No decking, no.

1104
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:38,210
I just think cos it's 2020,
maybe some solar panels.

1105
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:40,770
But we don't have solar panels
on our house at the moment, so...

1106
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:43,090
You don't? No. I might get a solar
panel on my head,

1107
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,770
just to give me more energy.

1108
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:47,050
Over the long run, it'd be
cheaper than coffee.

1109
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:50,650
Dave's not the only baker...

1110
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,370
What part of my house is that?

1111
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:54,450
..grateful for their humble abode.

1112
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:57,170
I live with aunt and my uncle
and my two cousins.

1113
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:59,490
It's by the beach,
it's a lovely place to be,

1114
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:01,810
so I am making my house.

1115
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,850
Lottie's sun-dried tomato and
chorizo beach house

1116
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:08,330
will be surrounded by pesto palm
trees and bushes.

1117
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:11,410
I am doing this in a proving bag,
so that I can work on it

1118
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,490
whilst it's proving.

1119
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:16,130
But while Lottie and Dave are
finding it hard enough

1120
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:17,330
to build one house...

1121
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,250
It's not easy when you're
restricted.

1122
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:22,450
This makes it look like I'm
performing some bizarre operation.

1123
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:25,410
..Peter's taking on an entire city.

1124
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:27,770
I'm making an Edinburgh cityscape
bread plaque.

1125
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:30,130
I made these and did the drawing
myself.

1126
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,250
But he's got one more step before
construction can begin.

1127
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:36,210
I've chosen to make a bagel dough
because after you've boiled it,

1128
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:38,530
then it sets its shape and you're
actually able to get

1129
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,290
pretty precise cuts out of it.

1130
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:43,850
A seeded multigrain dough will form
the rocky backdrop

1131
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:46,490
to his poppy seed covered
Edinburgh landmarks.

1132
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:48,850
We did have a little practice on
bagels yesterday.

1133
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:51,170
I think I'm going to slightly change
how I do it,

1134
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:53,050
in response to their comments.

1135
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,490
I want to try and make it
slightly lighter.

1136
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:58,290
Bakers, you have
one hour left.

1137
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,770
Ah, Matthew!

1138
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:04,090
God this time's disappearing
already, isn't it?

1139
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:06,090
Just have to crack on.

1140
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,650
This is the trunk of the tree.

1141
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:10,410
Bit concerned about Rowan.

1142
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,770
He seems confident that he'll get
this finished in the time

1143
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:14,410
but he is taking on a lot - again.

1144
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,010
Crack on with the decoration.

1145
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,890
I agree with you, there's such
a lot going on.

1146
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,210
I just hope to goodness he finishes.

1147
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:22,170
There is a plan -
I know that's surprising -

1148
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:24,490
and, so far, I think I'm going to
it.

1149
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,210
I'm not happy with the rise.

1150
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,890
It needs a bit more time.

1151
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:29,850
Hermine is doing brioche.

1152
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:32,210
Brioche in three and a half hours is
tricky to do. Yeah.

1153
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:34,570
So it's going to be interesting
to see, certainly with her

1154
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:36,410
French background, what she can come
up with.

1155
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,690
I'm going to carry on proving this.

1156
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:40,730
While Hermine's wait goes on...

1157
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:42,250
That's looking good.

1158
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,850
..the rest of the bakers' dough has
finished proving...

1159
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:47,490
I'm happy with my tiger bread,
that's come up lovely.

1160
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:49,010
Oh!

1161
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,810
..and their intricate designs can
now begin to take shape.

1162
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:54,130
So, here we go.

1163
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:57,810
The judges are expecting a variety
of bread shaping techniques.

1164
00:50:57,810 --> 00:51:00,170
I've tried to show twists
and some plaits,

1165
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,530
but just hoping that my flavours
will make up for the fact

1166
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:05,010
that I'm not the most intricate of
bakers.

1167
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,930
This is just my frozen apple
puree.

1168
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,450
I'll push them out of the straws
and braid it over the top.

1169
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:12,090
Just want to sure I've got that
good definition in there.

1170
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,490
But the bakers need to work quickly.

1171
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:17,250
Your bread's going to continue to
prove, so you're not going to get

1172
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:20,410
anything defined enough if you
don't get your move on.

1173
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,170
I'm not very good at plaiting...

1174
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:25,050
..so it is a little bit tricky.

1175
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:29,450
It's not as good looking as the
other one.

1176
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:32,130
I'm really happy with the way that
that's come round, yeah.

1177
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,610
Hopefully, when it bakes, it won't
get too many pfft...

1178
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,450
..like a hernia.

1179
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,370
This is the canopy of the tree.

1180
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:41,850
It looks just like a bit of a
shambles at the moment

1181
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:45,370
but a few well-placed details can
bring a whole thing to life.

1182
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:46,970
The pears go on next.

1183
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,610
Does that look like a tractor?
Not quite, does it?!

1184
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:52,330
These are the tomatoes with
feta inside.

1185
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:54,650
This is the Forth rail bridge.

1186
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:57,010
I'm going to give it a red eggwash
before it goes in the oven.

1187
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:59,330
It comes out rusty red colour
that looks fairly similar

1188
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:00,410
to the real thing.

1189
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,010
The ties are going to be sprayed
gold.

1190
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:04,410
I think Paul's going to hate it
but he doesn't like glitter,

1191
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:07,610
he doesn't like the theatre, I mean,
pretty sad life if you ask me.

1192
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:10,890
Have you see Matt in Les Mis?
I did. He was amazing!

1193
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:12,930
I genuinely mean it when I say it
was the best thing

1194
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,930
I've ever seen in the West End.
Really?!

1195
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:16,890
I've seen it about five times.
Wow.

1196
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:18,490
It's quite a mess over here.
Look at it.

1197
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:20,890
I know! I think I'm the messy one
out of the group, to be fair.

1198
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:23,330
Wow, look at it. I'm all right with
that. I've got loads to do.

1199
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:25,850
Yeah, I know sorry. Bye-bye.
Love you!

1200
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,410
I have a wheel. This is starting to
come together now.

1201
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:30,770
This is my twist to go on the
outside.

1202
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:33,450
How far can I make that stretch?

1203
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,130
Oh, well that's sad.

1204
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:39,210
What about if I just do that?
No-one would ever know.

1205
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:41,690
This is a tiger glaze and I've tamed
it down so that it doesn't

1206
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:44,450
crack up too much.

1207
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:47,690
I'm painting it with spirulina and
then I've got some beetroot powder

1208
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:49,690
on the tomatoes.

1209
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:52,050
Stacey's pregnant and a furlough
belly for me.

1210
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,410
Hopefully, the dough will rise in
the right places.

1211
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:57,690
I am going in... For possibly
the last time.

1212
00:52:57,690 --> 00:52:59,930
Please be good to me, little bread.

1213
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:04,090
Don't drop it, don't drop it,
don't drop it.

1214
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:08,210
I'm going to put it in for... 35.

1215
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,490
Yeah, in she goes!

1216
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:12,810
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1217
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:15,490
I'm going to have about four minutes
to spare, I think.

1218
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:17,210
I'm having to rush these.

1219
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:20,290
I'm really out of time now and I
need to get this in the oven.

1220
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:22,730
Bakers, you
have half an hour left.

1221
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:23,930
Right, it's going in.

1222
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:26,450
That's 30 minutes.

1223
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:28,410
Oh, crumbs, right, I'm going in.

1224
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,690
Let's get on with some baking!

1225
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:33,770
That was really close.

1226
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:36,690
It needs 30 minutes.
I've got exactly 30 minutes.

1227
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:40,210
My brioche, it hasn't proved
as well as I wanted.

1228
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:44,170
I'm going to give it
a bit more time.

1229
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:46,490
Oh, it feels like that's the
challenge over though.

1230
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,570
It's really weird.

1231
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:49,290
Have a little clean up now.

1232
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:56,690
I take every opportunity that I can
just to try and take

1233
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:57,970
a mindful breath.

1234
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:00,330
Just like bring me back to the
present moment,

1235
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:02,330
cos when you think about it,
when we're worrying,

1236
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:04,890
we're worrying about things that
have happened in our past...

1237
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,250
Don't think I should've floured it,
to be honest.

1238
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,130
..or we're worrying
about the future.

1239
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:11,770
Have you got enough time to cook it?
I hope so.

1240
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:14,810
And, ultimately, we've got no
control over that, have we?

1241
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:17,130
But, of course, it's easier
said than done.

1242
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,650
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes.

1243
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:20,970
Paul Hollywood wants bread
and if he doesn't get it,

1244
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:22,690
he's going to be furious.

1245
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:25,410
You ain't baking,
you're going to be quaking!

1246
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:28,850
That should take about 15 minutes,
hopefully.

1247
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,770
It's going to be really close.

1248
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:35,770
I'm just worried about the base,
so I think I might up it, you know.

1249
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,450
That's coming out now.

1250
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:39,330
# Ah, ah, ah-ah! #

1251
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:41,650
Not bad!

1252
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:43,970
Hopefully, it's baked.

1253
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:46,370
That does sound hollow.
That sounds brilliant.

1254
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:47,930
We're good, we're good, we're good.

1255
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,410
Let's trim those bits off.

1256
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,290
There're an awful lot of leaves to
paint green,

1257
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:53,570
so I need to get busy with that.

1258
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:55,090
I'll give it a make-up job.

1259
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:57,330
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1260
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:00,410
I think it's cooked.

1261
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,730
Is it just us three in the ovens?
Just us three, yeah.

1262
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:04,330
Hmm, that's too big.

1263
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:06,250
Just take it carefully and slowly.

1264
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,090
So, there's a lot to trim.

1265
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:09,450
Going in!

1266
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,730
Urgh! Everyone's is out.

1267
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,170
This is my chilli oil.

1268
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:16,770
Bakers, your time is up.

1269
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:20,130
Please step away from your bread.

1270
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,530
I've done it.
Amazing.

1271
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,410
Well done, Hermine.
Oh!

1272
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:32,450
It'll probably taste appalling but
I'm quite pleased with the look.

1273
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:34,370
We'll go with it.

1274
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:36,610
Just hope I've done enough.

1275
00:55:40,847 --> 00:55:44,847
It's judgement time for our bakers'
decorative bread plaques.

1276
00:55:44,847 --> 00:55:47,567
Hermine, would you like to bring
up your Showstopper, please?

1277
00:55:56,727 --> 00:55:57,927
Looks a bit abstract.

1278
00:55:57,927 --> 00:55:59,927
You're driving through vineyards,
are you? Yes.

1279
00:55:59,927 --> 00:56:01,367
So there's grapes. These?

1280
00:56:01,367 --> 00:56:03,967
Um, that's supposed to be a farmer's
field and there's a tractor.

1281
00:56:03,967 --> 00:56:05,607
Oh, that's a tractor. Yes.

1282
00:56:05,607 --> 00:56:06,927
Oh, it's there, OK.

1283
00:56:06,927 --> 00:56:10,127
You've lost a bit of definition
in the swirl on the outside,

1284
00:56:10,127 --> 00:56:12,447
but, overall, it looks good.

1285
00:56:12,447 --> 00:56:14,767
OK, well, let's have a look
at the frame to start with.

1286
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:16,167
This is the brioche.

1287
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:17,527
Yes.

1288
00:56:17,527 --> 00:56:19,847
And then the main bit is
the focaccia.

1289
00:56:19,847 --> 00:56:22,247
Yeah.

1290
00:56:22,247 --> 00:56:24,607
The brioche doesn't hold
much flavour.

1291
00:56:24,607 --> 00:56:26,567
I knew you were going to struggle to
get that out in time.

1292
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:29,047
It's an enriched dough,
but it's certainly not a brioche.

1293
00:56:29,047 --> 00:56:31,327
Focaccia's lovely. Thank you.

1294
00:56:31,327 --> 00:56:33,327
It's springy, I like both, actually.

1295
00:56:33,327 --> 00:56:34,927
The focaccia's not bad.

1296
00:56:34,927 --> 00:56:36,207
But I do like the design.

1297
00:56:36,207 --> 00:56:38,047
It's very, very good. Thank you.

1298
00:56:41,447 --> 00:56:42,927
I think it looks quite

1299
00:56:42,927 --> 00:56:44,527
dramatic and effective.

1300
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:46,367
The plait on the outside's not bad.

1301
00:56:46,367 --> 00:56:49,767
I like the effect you've got
by interlacing the two.

1302
00:56:50,927 --> 00:56:52,207
Texture looks good.

1303
00:56:53,847 --> 00:56:56,207
I think that is
beautifully seasoned.

1304
00:56:56,207 --> 00:56:58,607
The tomato bread is nice as well -
it's got a nice zing to it.

1305
00:56:58,607 --> 00:57:01,087
But, more importantly,
it's the structure,

1306
00:57:01,087 --> 00:57:02,527
the air bubbles,

1307
00:57:02,527 --> 00:57:04,327
it's regular
and it's even all the way down.

1308
00:57:04,327 --> 00:57:05,847
It's a nice loaf. Thank you.

1309
00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:07,407
Did you try one of the balls?

1310
00:57:07,407 --> 00:57:09,807
They've got feta inside.

1311
00:57:09,807 --> 00:57:11,287
Mm.

1312
00:57:11,287 --> 00:57:13,647
That is delicious.

1313
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:16,287
Can I go? Yes, absolutely.
Thank you.

1314
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,527
Your agony is over.

1315
00:57:17,527 --> 00:57:20,047
Well done, Sura. Well done.
Thank you.

1316
00:57:22,407 --> 00:57:24,207
I love your Victorian swags

1317
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:26,487
of great velvet curtains,

1318
00:57:26,487 --> 00:57:29,127
your gilded tassels are wonderful.

1319
00:57:29,127 --> 00:57:30,687
It's simple but effective.

1320
00:57:30,687 --> 00:57:32,527
Shall we have a look at it, then?
Yeah.

1321
00:57:32,527 --> 00:57:36,847
It's a focaccia base with pancetta
and cheese.

1322
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:41,007
It's got quite a punch, hasn't it?

1323
00:57:41,007 --> 00:57:42,607
Your ingredient choices are good.

1324
00:57:42,607 --> 00:57:45,687
The problem is focaccia's a very,
very light dough

1325
00:57:45,687 --> 00:57:47,647
and you put that on the top of it,

1326
00:57:47,647 --> 00:57:49,567
so it couldn't rise,
so what it did is

1327
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,967
concertina back down again
and so it feels quite raw.

1328
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:53,287
It is a pity,

1329
00:57:53,287 --> 00:57:55,607
because, when you get a bit of
the edge of the focaccia,

1330
00:57:55,607 --> 00:57:56,567
it's really nice bread.

1331
00:57:58,327 --> 00:58:00,647
The chilli bread's got a kick to it.

1332
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:02,967
Yeah, it's not bad at all.
I think it's full of flavour,

1333
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:04,407
but the textures weren't right.

1334
00:58:08,207 --> 00:58:09,527
It's simple.

1335
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:11,207
It's sort of effective.

1336
00:58:11,207 --> 00:58:13,807
I think you could've done more
with it, though.

1337
00:58:17,247 --> 00:58:19,567
All your flavours are coming
from the seeds on the top,

1338
00:58:19,567 --> 00:58:20,767
the dried herbs.

1339
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:23,127
They sort of carry through.
It's a nice eat, isn't it?

1340
00:58:23,127 --> 00:58:26,367
It tastes very nice. I just feel
it's a little dense and tough.

1341
00:58:26,367 --> 00:58:29,047
You made a bagel like a pitta.
It's a little weird.

1342
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,887
It is, isn't it?

1343
00:58:30,887 --> 00:58:33,207
You shouldn't be able to do
that with bread.

1344
00:58:33,207 --> 00:58:34,407
It's like a piece of leather.

1345
00:58:35,487 --> 00:58:36,847
Oh, Peter...

1346
00:58:40,607 --> 00:58:42,967
I think the design's
pretty good.

1347
00:58:42,967 --> 00:58:46,207
You've kept some definition in there
as well, which is nice.

1348
00:58:50,647 --> 00:58:52,407
That bread's beautifully risen.

1349
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:54,847
It feels great, but it lacks
flavour. OK.

1350
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,647
And this is tomato and paprika?

1351
00:58:56,647 --> 00:58:59,047
That's, yeah, tomato,
paprika and chorizo.

1352
00:58:59,047 --> 00:59:01,087
That packs a punch. That's nice.
Very nice.

1353
00:59:01,087 --> 00:59:02,727
Nice balance of flavour
with it as well.

1354
00:59:02,727 --> 00:59:05,487
That's a nice bread - you should've
done more with that... Very nice.

1355
00:59:05,487 --> 00:59:06,727
..rather than the white.

1356
00:59:10,407 --> 00:59:13,887
I like the concept,
I like the design, I love the cow.

1357
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:16,567
We drank milk straight from the cow
when we was children.

1358
00:59:16,567 --> 00:59:18,847
From the udders? Not quite, Noel.

1359
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:21,127
Wow.

1360
00:59:21,127 --> 00:59:22,767
Remind me of the flavour again?

1361
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:24,487
It's olive and tiger bread.

1362
00:59:24,487 --> 00:59:26,367
But that's not the tiger
bread topping.

1363
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:28,807
It's the flavours of it
but not so much the cracking.

1364
00:59:28,807 --> 00:59:29,807
OK.

1365
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,447
It's quite dense.

1366
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:35,167
More olives are needed,
more proving's needed,

1367
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:37,407
more flavour's needed.

1368
00:59:40,487 --> 00:59:41,767
Interesting trees.

1369
00:59:41,767 --> 00:59:43,727
Little bit bulky, compared with
the rest of it.

1370
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:45,407
I like the little bee.

1371
00:59:45,407 --> 00:59:49,047
The plaiting's a little bit
irregular, thick and then thin.

1372
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:55,847
The structure's not bad,

1373
00:59:55,847 --> 00:59:58,407
because, actually,
you do have a light crust

1374
00:59:58,407 --> 01:00:00,727
and it is wetter on the mouth
which is what you want.

1375
01:00:00,727 --> 01:00:02,207
Flavour's not that strong, though,

1376
01:00:02,207 --> 01:00:03,887
considering you're using
wild garlic,

1377
01:00:03,887 --> 01:00:06,247
you should be getting a serious kick
from that. Hm. Hm.

1378
01:00:06,247 --> 01:00:07,967
This one's got apple
and cinnamon in it.

1379
01:00:07,967 --> 01:00:10,007
Apple and cinnamon in the middle,
yeah, yeah.

1380
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:12,367
Hm, the apple
and cinnamon's really nice.

1381
01:00:12,367 --> 01:00:14,967
It's a bit basic, the picture,
but the bread is OK.

1382
01:00:18,527 --> 01:00:20,807
Well, it looks really surprising

1383
01:00:20,807 --> 01:00:23,327
and pretty and quite neat.

1384
01:00:23,327 --> 01:00:24,687
Certainly colourful.

1385
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:27,047
If you dig a little deeper
around the edges,

1386
01:00:27,047 --> 01:00:28,687
it's a little bit weak on the
plaiting. Yes.

1387
01:00:28,687 --> 01:00:31,047
It's slightly underproved
so it's ripped in the oven. OK.

1388
01:00:31,047 --> 01:00:33,367
But this particular area here
is gorgeous. Thank you.

1389
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:36,087
Really nice, neat, clever.

1390
01:00:36,087 --> 01:00:38,487
- It's intricate detail, isn't it?
- Lovely colours.

1391
01:00:38,487 --> 01:00:39,607
Ah, look.

1392
01:00:39,607 --> 01:00:41,247
And that looks nice bread.

1393
01:00:43,487 --> 01:00:44,967
The flavour of the brown's not bad.

1394
01:00:44,967 --> 01:00:46,727
It could do with a little bit
more salt. OK.

1395
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:49,647
Fennel one, particularly, is nice.
But, overall, I like those flavours.

1396
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:50,727
Thank you very much.

1397
01:00:50,727 --> 01:00:52,527
Marc, I think
you've done a really good job.

1398
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:55,767
It looks good, tastes good,
smells good, it is good.

1399
01:00:55,767 --> 01:00:58,127
That's great. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.

1400
01:00:58,127 --> 01:01:01,047
Well done.
OK, thanks, thank you very much.

1401
01:01:03,607 --> 01:01:04,847
Your wife's pregnant?

1402
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:07,727
Yes, yeah, although I do look more
pregnant than she does.

1403
01:01:07,727 --> 01:01:09,167
I was going to say.

1404
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:11,487
It's called sympathetic pregnancy.

1405
01:01:11,487 --> 01:01:13,807
I would've spent time
cutting bricks out

1406
01:01:13,807 --> 01:01:14,847
and placed them on,

1407
01:01:14,847 --> 01:01:17,207
and just built up
that brickwork look.

1408
01:01:17,207 --> 01:01:20,607
I mean, you sort of get it, but it
would look nice with that. OK.

1409
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:22,287
This is the one with mango.

1410
01:01:22,287 --> 01:01:24,687
Mango, lime and chilli paste
running through.

1411
01:01:24,687 --> 01:01:27,047
Well, you certainly get the mango
and the chilli.

1412
01:01:27,047 --> 01:01:29,407
I like the flavour. I've never had
anything quite like that.

1413
01:01:29,407 --> 01:01:31,167
But I just think the bread's
a little bit too dry,

1414
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:32,167
it's overbaked. OK.

1415
01:01:33,247 --> 01:01:35,247
And the flavour of the base?

1416
01:01:35,247 --> 01:01:37,567
That is hibiscus
and guava flavour drops.

1417
01:01:37,567 --> 01:01:40,167
I've never met guava flavour.

1418
01:01:40,167 --> 01:01:41,927
Never had an Um Bongo, Prue?

1419
01:01:41,927 --> 01:01:43,607
You've never been to the
Congo.

1420
01:01:43,607 --> 01:01:46,207
Oh, no, I know guavas well, but I've
never known it as an essence.

1421
01:01:46,207 --> 01:01:48,527
Right. And I can't really taste it.

1422
01:01:48,527 --> 01:01:49,927
But the ideas are unique.

1423
01:01:49,927 --> 01:01:51,607
I've never tried either of them
before.

1424
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:53,647
It's just that the baking was
a little bit too far.

1425
01:01:53,647 --> 01:01:55,927
Yeah, all right, fair enough.
Thank you.

1426
01:01:58,407 --> 01:02:00,727
You need a hand, right?
I do, please.

1427
01:02:00,727 --> 01:02:02,447
Let's do this.

1428
01:02:02,447 --> 01:02:04,167
Is that going to fit?

1429
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:05,607
Let's hope.

1430
01:02:07,887 --> 01:02:09,727
Well, Rowan...

1431
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:12,407
Overall, I think it looks great.
I think it looks quite attractive.

1432
01:02:12,407 --> 01:02:14,847
Very big. What's the bread there?

1433
01:02:14,847 --> 01:02:19,167
Worcestershire blue cheese
and pears soaked in local cider.

1434
01:02:23,047 --> 01:02:24,207
Get the cider.

1435
01:02:25,527 --> 01:02:28,167
And where's the blue cheese?
Well, I pressed it in.

1436
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:31,807
You pressed it in, OK, that's why
we're not getting the taste. Right.

1437
01:02:31,807 --> 01:02:34,167
And, actually, I would've mixed
it in the dough

1438
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,847
and you needed much more
proving in that.

1439
01:02:35,847 --> 01:02:38,487
Keeping these restrained to keep
the look,

1440
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:40,847
you've gone for all style
and no substance.

1441
01:02:40,847 --> 01:02:43,207
You've ended up with a bread
which is actually quite bland.

1442
01:02:43,207 --> 01:02:45,527
Right. What's the flavour of that
one?

1443
01:02:45,527 --> 01:02:46,887
That is chestnut and walnut.

1444
01:02:49,287 --> 01:02:51,687
Again, walnuts, a lot more.

1445
01:02:51,687 --> 01:02:55,127
It's such a pity cos
that's a much nicer bread.

1446
01:02:55,127 --> 01:02:56,967
Shall we try the earthy one?

1447
01:02:56,967 --> 01:02:58,567
I can smell the truffle.

1448
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:01,247
It definitely has more flavour,
but it could do with some salt.

1449
01:03:01,247 --> 01:03:03,287
OK. Thank you very much.

1450
01:03:03,287 --> 01:03:04,687
Many thanks.

1451
01:03:06,327 --> 01:03:08,647
All style, no substance - that's me.

1452
01:03:08,647 --> 01:03:11,087
I'd rather be all style,
no substance, anyway.

1453
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:15,807
Somewhat disappointed, I was very
happy with the look of it,

1454
01:03:15,807 --> 01:03:18,687
and, so, I'm glad to have done
what I could do.

1455
01:03:18,687 --> 01:03:20,327
Feeling a little uneasy.

1456
01:03:20,327 --> 01:03:22,687
I might be home tomorrow,
but I haven't phoned her yet.

1457
01:03:22,687 --> 01:03:25,007
Oh, it'd mean a lot to be
able to come back next week.

1458
01:03:25,007 --> 01:03:26,367
That went better than expected.

1459
01:03:26,367 --> 01:03:28,207
Usually, I hear these things
from my parents

1460
01:03:28,207 --> 01:03:30,207
and I just thought,
"It's cos you're my parents."

1461
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:31,847
But it's nice to hear it from them.

1462
01:03:31,847 --> 01:03:33,727
Really happy with that,
really happy.

1463
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,687
Oh, it'd feel amazing, I think,

1464
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:38,047
if they called out that
I was star baker for the week.

1465
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:40,567
Uh, but, yeah,
I don't know how I'd handle it.

1466
01:03:45,814 --> 01:03:48,174
So how do you think that went?
I think overall,

1467
01:03:48,174 --> 01:03:50,574
the standard wasn't particularly
good. I think they feel

1468
01:03:50,574 --> 01:03:52,454
a lot of pressure on Bread Week
to impress you,

1469
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:53,814
and often, they implode.

1470
01:03:53,814 --> 01:03:55,614
They needed to come in strong,
didn't they?

1471
01:03:55,614 --> 01:03:58,094
If you're not confident,
it'll always show.

1472
01:03:58,094 --> 01:04:01,094
Sura and Marc E, those two
had terrific confidence

1473
01:04:01,094 --> 01:04:04,254
and they're bang in your face.

1474
01:04:04,254 --> 01:04:06,134
They both managed to get the right
texture,

1475
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,694
the right flavour, the right look.

1476
01:04:07,694 --> 01:04:11,174
So star baker, Marc E and Sura.
Yeah.

1477
01:04:11,174 --> 01:04:13,494
What about Hermine? She had a
handshake yesterday.

1478
01:04:13,494 --> 01:04:14,494
Hermine has a possibility.

1479
01:04:14,494 --> 01:04:16,174
Didn't do brilliant
in the technical.

1480
01:04:16,174 --> 01:04:18,614
And her showstopper,
I didn't like the enriched dough.

1481
01:04:18,614 --> 01:04:20,094
Who do you think is down the
bottom?

1482
01:04:20,094 --> 01:04:21,614
Obviously, Rowan is. Anyone else?

1483
01:04:21,614 --> 01:04:24,934
I think Peter's in trouble I also
think David's in trouble as well.

1484
01:04:24,934 --> 01:04:26,894
Our two previous star bakers. Yeah.

1485
01:04:26,894 --> 01:04:28,254
In defence of Rowan,

1486
01:04:28,254 --> 01:04:32,214
his showstopper really looked like a
showstopper, didn't it? It did.

1487
01:04:32,214 --> 01:04:34,574
Again, style and substance.
It lacked flavour.

1488
01:04:34,574 --> 01:04:36,854
But how much flavour
do breads really need?

1489
01:04:37,894 --> 01:04:40,214
You've crossed the line.
I've crossed the line.

1490
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:41,854
Do you want a fight, Matt?

1491
01:04:52,414 --> 01:04:56,854
So bakers, congratulations. I know
it's been a long couple of days.

1492
01:04:56,854 --> 01:04:59,454
One of you is star baker,

1493
01:04:59,454 --> 01:05:01,814
and that person is...

1494
01:05:03,254 --> 01:05:04,334
Marc E.

1495
01:05:10,934 --> 01:05:14,094
Oh, bakers, that means I've got
the horrible job

1496
01:05:14,094 --> 01:05:15,774
of sending someone home.

1497
01:05:16,094 --> 01:05:22,054
The person who is leaving us is...

1498
01:05:30,174 --> 01:05:31,494
Rowan.

1499
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,734
Oh! That's fine.

1500
01:05:35,134 --> 01:05:37,454
These boots were made for walking.

1501
01:05:37,454 --> 01:05:40,934
I feel very content, really.
I've had a wonderful time.

1502
01:05:41,174 --> 01:05:43,934
Um, it is exhausting,
but very rewarding.

1503
01:05:43,934 --> 01:05:48,014
Bring it in, bring it in, kids.
Sorry, Rowan.

1504
01:05:48,014 --> 01:05:50,454
And I was also quite pleased
that Noel said to me,

1505
01:05:50,454 --> 01:05:52,894
"Well, I'm all style
and no substance".

1506
01:05:52,894 --> 01:05:55,334
He said, "It's on my CV!"

1507
01:05:55,334 --> 01:05:57,894
I'm going to miss those laughs. Oh.

1508
01:05:57,894 --> 01:06:00,214
Rowan has been such a character.

1509
01:06:00,214 --> 01:06:03,174
I'm sorry to see him go
because he is so ambitious

1510
01:06:03,174 --> 01:06:07,494
and so imaginative and he puts
so much thought into this baking.

1511
01:06:08,334 --> 01:06:12,694
He delivered a showstopper which
was very impressive to look at,

1512
01:06:12,694 --> 01:06:14,574
but it just didn't taste good.

1513
01:06:14,574 --> 01:06:16,854
Going to miss you, Rowan.

1514
01:06:16,854 --> 01:06:17,854
Such mixed emotions.

1515
01:06:17,854 --> 01:06:21,494
Sad for Rowan, ecstatic for Marc
because he really deserved

1516
01:06:21,494 --> 01:06:23,334
and needed that for his confidence.

1517
01:06:23,334 --> 01:06:25,814
I just got star baker, didn't I?
On Bread Week.

1518
01:06:25,814 --> 01:06:28,174
It's the thing that I enjoy making,

1519
01:06:28,174 --> 01:06:31,414
it's the thing that started me
on this whole baking experience.

1520
01:06:31,414 --> 01:06:33,694
To get star baker, that is amazing.

1521
01:06:33,694 --> 01:06:34,934
Well done, Marc. Thank you.

1522
01:06:34,934 --> 01:06:36,694
It was good, it was really good.

1523
01:06:36,694 --> 01:06:39,294
Marc E did really
well in the signature,

1524
01:06:39,294 --> 01:06:41,654
pretty well in the technical as well

1525
01:06:41,654 --> 01:06:43,014
and in the showstopper,

1526
01:06:43,014 --> 01:06:45,854
he managed to get his dough risen
and tasting good,

1527
01:06:45,854 --> 01:06:48,934
so the whole Buddhist ethos
really worked for him.

1528
01:06:48,934 --> 01:06:51,334
Hey! Well done for getting star
baker.

1529
01:06:51,334 --> 01:06:53,254
Thank you very much.

1530
01:06:53,254 --> 01:06:54,774
Hey, Gibbygibs.
Thank you, girls.

1531
01:06:54,774 --> 01:06:57,494
Love you. I love you too.
You're the best. Thank you.

1532
01:06:59,494 --> 01:07:02,174
Oh, you've made me
get all emotional now.

1533
01:07:05,534 --> 01:07:08,534
Next time... Oh, my God.
It's Chocolate Week. Sweet.

1534
01:07:08,534 --> 01:07:10,454
And there's tension in the tent...
Oh, come on.

1535
01:07:10,454 --> 01:07:12,854
..as the bakers face a
nerve-wracking signature.

1536
01:07:12,854 --> 01:07:14,414
Don't drop, don't drop, don't drop.

1537
01:07:14,414 --> 01:07:16,774
It's a waiting game as they prove
themselves...

1538
01:07:16,774 --> 01:07:19,294
High five. There you go.
..In a tough technical.

1539
01:07:19,294 --> 01:07:21,614
Never heard of one.
I wish I knew what it looked like.

1540
01:07:21,614 --> 01:07:23,934
And the temperature rises...

1541
01:07:23,934 --> 01:07:26,254
It's starting to really heat
up in here now.

1542
01:07:26,254 --> 01:07:27,574
..with a triple-tiered showstopper

1543
01:07:27,574 --> 01:07:29,934
which will lead to one of the bakers
coming off the tracks.

1544
01:07:29,934 --> 01:07:31,334
We're getting hammered.

1545
01:07:31,334 --> 01:07:33,014
Ruthless.

1546
01:07:48,614 --> 01:07:53,614
