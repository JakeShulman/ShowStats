Hello, viewer.

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,279
I hope you're as excited as we are
about Patisserie Week.

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,720
I love patisserie.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,080
I love tiny French cakes.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,160
Smaller, the better.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,040
I like them so small you can
only see them under a microscope.

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,760
I've written a song about patisserie.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,840

- No.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,000
I found it needlessly surreal.

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,479
[Peter] I'm looking forward to this week.

40
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:51,320
Patisserie is an exciting thing.

41
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:54,479
It's not home baking any more,
it's perfection, precision,

42
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:55,559
that's patisserie.

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,759
[exhales]

44
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:58,360
[Laura] I'm not feeling too confident.

45
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,440
I'm just a home baker,
so this is out of my comfort zone.

46
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,280
It would be a killer
to go out just before the final.

47
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:07,360
I'm feeling more nervous
that it's the semifinals

48
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,239
than the fact that it's Patisserie Week.

49
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:13,920
But I think we're all worried about
Hermine because she is patisserie.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,560
She's really good at what she does.

51
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,920
It's supposed to be
the week I enjoy the most,

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,400
but I need to make it to the final,
so pressure's on. [chuckles]

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,120
Hello, kids. Congratulations,
you've made it to the semifinal.

54
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,040
Whoo!

55
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,360
Which means that three of you
are gonna be in the final

56
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,400
and one of you is gonna
have to spend the rest of their life

57
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,840
as Prue's live-in butler.

58
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,840
[chuckles]

59
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,080
[Noel] Imagine that.

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,640
Ma'am, your buttered crumpet.

61
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,120
[mimicking Prue] Oh,
it's not worth the calories.

62
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,560
Thank you, ma'am.

63
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,320
The judges would like you
to make 12 identical patisseries

64
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,880
using pâte à savarin,
which is a yeasted enriched dough.

65
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,920
- [Matt] Your savarin...
- [Noel chuckles]

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
...can be any shape or flavour you like,

67
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,880
but once baked, should be soaked
in a syrup of your choosing.

68
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,519
This is the semifinal, kids,

69
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,880
so the judges are looking for high-end
and they want an exquisite finish.

70
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,760
You have two hours and 45 minutes.

71
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,519
- On your marks...
- Get set...

72
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Bake.

73
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,480
We're in the semifinal.
This is pretty awesome.

74
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Stressed.

75
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,920
I doubt that many
home bakers do patisserie.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,959
Not something I've really done before.

77
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,880
[Prue] Patisserie is one
of the hardest challenges.

78
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,200
It's neat, it's exquisite, it's elegant.

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,799
[Paul] Some may not know
what a savarin is,

80
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,160
but think rum baba.
That base is a savarin.

81
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,239
It's a yeasted enriched dough
baked and cooked in a mould.

82
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,799
Hermine says, "savarin"
and I go, "sav-rin." [chuckles]

83
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,040
[cockney accent] Doing the old
savarins this week, ain't we?

84
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:49,920
Shove 'em in the oven, the old savarins.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,119
[Paul] It's all about the proving,
the softness of the sponge

86
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,119
and beautiful, delicate flavours.

87
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,679
That's what patisserie's all about.

88
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:00,880
[Prue] Almost the worst challenge
is they're baking in a heatwave

89
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,799
which means that proving times
will probably be shorter.

90
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,160
They ought to watch that.

91
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:08,399
[Paul] Gonna be interesting to see
who steps up to the plate

92
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,200
and creates something
that deserves its place in a patisserie

93
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,200
anywhere in the world.

94
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,839
[Prue] But any of our four bakers
could go through to the final.

95
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,680
I think these four are as good
as we've ever had. I really do.

96
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,640
[Dave] Strange dough to work with.
It needs to be pipeable.

97
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,520
If done right, it bakes beautifully.

98
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,080
Normal dough,
you can knead it. Can't touch that.

99
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
It's very, very wet.

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,479
Just looking for a really
silky smooth, stretchy dough

101
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,920
and I'm pretty much there.

102
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,960
- [Paul] Hi.
- [Hermine] Hello.

103
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:38,039
Hello, Prue.

104
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,440
[Paul] Tell us about your savarin.

105
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,000
So I'm doing a baba au rhum.

106
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,880
Oh, lovely. I do like a rum baba.

107
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,520
And I'm gonna glaze it
with, erm, an apricot jam

108
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:50,240
to kind of give it the shine.

109
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,560
Hermine, this should be your day.

110
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,440
This is such a classic French thing.

111
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,240
I hope I can deliver. [chuckles]

112
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,440
[Noel] <i>Hermine's chosen</i>

going into the final?

117

I don't want that
to give me a big head so... [chuckles]

118
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,120
- You've had a handshake, as well.
- No.

119
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,280
But then you can let things
like that distract you, isn't it?

120
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,919
Exactly. Don't think about that.

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,160
Just concentrate on today, relax,

- do your best.
- Yes.

123
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,680
Say "apricot" for us one more time?

124
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,640
Apricot.

125

A fairly standard savarin dough.

139
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,919
I used fresh yeast
'cause it gives a nicer rise.

[Paul] Really?

141
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,039
Why do you think fresh yeast is better?

Er...

143

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,280
The whole point of it is
you make it like a bread-type cake

157
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:38,479
and then you soak it in syrup.

158
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,440
All the flavour comes from the syrup.

159
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,840
The rum is spiced but I'm adding
some spices as well to the mix.

160
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,840
[Noel] <i>While Hermine and Laura</i>
<i>are aiming to perfect a French classic...</i>

161
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:49,840
Yum.

162
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,960
[Noel] <i>...Dave is taking</i>
<i>his savarin all the way to Mexico.</i>

163
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,160
Tequila.

164
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,120
[Noel] <i>Dave's savarins</i>
<i>will be soaked in honey tequila</i>

165
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,560
<i>before being set on
a mango-passion fruit curd</i>

166
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,479
<i>and crowned with a honey
and cocoa Chantilly cream.</i>

167
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,880
Mango, passion fruit,
chocolate and tequila.

168
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,160
[Dave] And tequila, yes.

169
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,080
Hmm.

170
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,000
Quite a mix.

171
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,760
You think you'll get into the final?

172
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,440
It's in sight, but there's
tough competition here.

173
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,640
I'm just gonna try my best.

174
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:16,880
I tell you what, Dave, you are
looking so much more confident.

175
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,960
- Thank you.
- Different from when we first met you.

176
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,159
- Good luck.
- Right, cheers.

177
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,800
- Thank you. Tequila.
- Tequila. Come on.

178
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,880
[Noel whistles] Now you're talking.
Jiminy Christmas.

179
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,840
[Matt] <i>While Dave, Laura,</i>
<i>and Hermine are all banking on booze...</i>

180
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,000
[Hermine] Whenever I make syrup,
I always add my alcohol last

181
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,200
because I don't want the alcohol
to evaporate too much.

182
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,719
I want it quite strong,
trying to make Prue happy.

183
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:41,200
[Matt] <i>...to meet the demands</i>
<i>of Patisserie Week...</i>

184
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,120
[Peter] I'm not overcomplicating it today.

185
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,000
I wanna get something out that's
really clean and looks professional.

186
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,400
[Matt] <i>...Peter's chosen</i>
<i>to keep a clear head.</i>

187
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,919
[Peter] Not soaking it in alcohol.

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,440
In here, I've got elderflower cordial,
lemon juice, water, and sugar.

189
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,039
I don't drink very much myself

190
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,400
so I thought, we'll go
for a teetotal savarin.

191
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm the one that goes to the club sober,
leaves after an hour.

192
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,400
I'm really boring. [chuckles]

193
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,120
[Matt] <i>He may think he's a square,</i>

194
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,640
<i>but Peter's hoping rectangular savarins
will help him pass this exam.</i>

195
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:09,799
<i>He's soaking them in an elderflower syrup</i>

196
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,960
<i>before finishing with elderflower
and strawberry crème diplomats.</i>

197
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:16,239
I would like to see the old Peter today.

198
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,000
We've got a bit of heat in the tent.

199
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,760
You just gotta concentrate,
ignore that and just don't make mistakes.

200
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,880
Do you like that advice?
"Don't make mistakes."

201
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,479
- It sounds...
- [laughs]

202
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,239
- As easy as that.
- It's so simple.

203
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,655
- We can do it.
- [Paul] Thank you.

204
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:29,919
Don't make mistakes, yeah?

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,120
That's the plan.

206
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm gonna bring back week-one Star Baker
and show them what I can do.

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,480
That's your yeasted enriched dough.

208
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,280
- Is it proving now?
- [Laura] It is. Wanna see the best bit?

209
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,120
- Go on.
- Imagine it's Paul's face.

210
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:44,959
- [chuckling] Oh! Really?
- [chuckles]

211
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,560
- And then you go, boof.
- Oh, poor Paul. Oh, my Lord.

212
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,520
- [Laura] Wanna do it?
- Okay, here we go.

213
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,480
- Go for it.
- Biff.

214
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,199
- Oh!
- [chuckles]

215
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,120
- [Laura] You can keep that.
- [Matt] Wow.

216
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:57,640
- I'm gonna sell this on eBay.
- [laughs]

217
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,920
[Matt] <i>With the first prove finished...</i>

218
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,520
[Peter] I'm gonna
get this into a piping bag

219
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,360
and you'll see how we can
pipe such a substance.

220
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,000
[Matt] <i>...the savarins</i>
<i>can begin to take shape.</i>

221
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:11,079
[Hermine] It's not easy
to pipe because it's quite elastic

222
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,839
but I want it to be consistent.

223
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,880
[Dave] I'm just making
each one even in weight.

224
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,400
They should all rise identically.

225
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,839
That's what I'm hoping for.

226
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,360
Right, so, that's me done.

227
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,800
I've gotta prove these
until they double in size.

228
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,720
[Noel] <i>But the savarin might be</i>
<i>ready sooner than expected.</i>

229
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,280
'Cause it's getting really hot now,
could be as little as 30 minutes.

230
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,720
We have to wait and see.

231
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,400
[Noel] <i>High temperatures in the tent</i>

232
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,839
<i>mean the bakers risk
over-proving their dough...</i>

233
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,440
It had 30 minute during practice.

234
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,800
I'll give it the same
and then have a look.

235
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,480
[Noel] <i>...resulting in</i>
<i>flat, collapsed cakes.</i>

236
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,640
[Laura] They're not
gonna buy rustic this time.

237
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,720
It's gotta be perfect.

238
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,320
[Noel] <i>But stop proving too soon</i>

239
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,800
<i>and they'll rise too quickly in the oven,
causing them to tear.</i>

240
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,720
[exhales]

241
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,160
So warm in here. [chuckles]

242
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,199
Bakers, you have 4,950 seconds left.

243
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,360
Is that real? [chuckles]

244
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,280
Matt, how long do we actually have?

245
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Hmm?

246
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,600
- Oh, you're halfway through.
- Thank you.

247
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,480
[Matt] <i>With their dough rapidly rising...</i>

248
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,640
- [Dave] Did you try and work that out?
- No.

249
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,199
[Matt] <i>...they'll need every second</i>
<i>to create their fillings and toppings.</i>

250
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
Mmm.

251
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,680
[Laura] It's about balance with flavours.

252
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,920
Quite a lot going on with the rum,
fruit, the dough, everything,

253
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,600
so the Chantilly cream
just breaks it up a bit.

254
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,640
[Dave] The savarin is gonna be set
on a mango and passion fruit curd.

255
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,120
So, like a fruity custard.

256
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:32,160
[Hermine] I'm making a crème pat.

257
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,440
I'm worried that they might say
it's simple, but it is a classic.

258
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,920
A classic is simple.

259
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,720
[Matt] Ever seen <i>Babar?</i>

260
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,040
Yes, when I was young.

261
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,360
I still watch it now.

262
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,120
I love <i>Pingu.</i> I watch <i>Pingu.</i>
Do you ever watch <i>Pingu?</i>

263
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:45,560
- No.
- Love <i>Pingu.</i>

264
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,000
[gibbering in voice of Pingu] Pingu.

265
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,839
Ooh, yeah, they're definitely well-proved.

266
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,520
[Dave] They've really risen
but they're all even.

267
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,440
[Laura] Think that's proved.

268
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,560
So, they're going in
for 15 minutes at 175.

269
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,800
I think that is quite hot,
but it's for a quick bake.

270
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,120
[Hermine] I'm baking them for 14 minutes.

271
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,240
Ten to 12-ish minutes until they're
nice and dark golden brown on top.

272
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
[Laura sighs]

273
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,400
[Noel] Look at you go.

274
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,400
- You're so laid-back.
- Am I?

275
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,600
Think you're gonna win this?

276
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,920
Who knows. It's in
the hand of the universe.

277
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,640
I love that you trust the universe.

278
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:26,000
What about old good flavours Laura?

279
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,199
Gonna have to...
[makes snapping noise] Aren't you?

280
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,839
Gonna have to... Bang!

281
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,640
- Oh.
- You do what you've

282
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:34,400
- gotta do in this business.
- No, that's not nice.

283
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,400
[laughs]

284
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,920
It's gotta be a proud win.

285
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Universe win.

286
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:43,560
They look golden.
Keep them in for a few more minutes.

287
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,360
[Hermine chuckles] They're rising nicely.

288
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,199
Maybe talking too early. [chuckles]

289
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:51,040
[Peter] They're looking
very golden and lovely.

290
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,040
Gonna make sure that they're not under.

291
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,320
I'd rather them be
slightly over and a bit drier.

292
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,320
[Dave] Right, I need to take these out.

293
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,880
[Laura] Yeah, they're cooked.

294
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,680
[Peter] Looking good. Puffed up nicely.

295
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,440
Hopefully nice, light and airy.

296
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,120
Feeling good. Really good.

297
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:07,000
They're the colour you want?

298
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,160
Yes, they are.

299
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,120
Probably Paul will say they're too dark...

300
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:13,240
Say that you've modelled them on his tan.
I dare you.

301
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,240
You might not get a Hollywood handshake,
but you'll get one from me.

302
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,880
[Hermine] From the look of them,
I've underproved it.

303
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Oh. Dear, dear, dear.

304
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,199
I'll do another batch.

305
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,160
This is the semifinal,
so I do want it to be perfect.

306
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,320
Let's start again.

307
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,560
Okay, bakers,
you've only got one hour left.

308
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,880
[Dave] Time flies when you're having fun.

309
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,120
[Hermine] Let's try again
and see this time.

310
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:43,079
I mean, the weather's not helping.

311
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Hopefully, this one will be all right.

312
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,400
[Noel] <i>While Hermine's babas</i>
<i>are starting at the beginning...</i>

313
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,360
This time, I'll just give it 15 minutes.

314
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,719
[Noel] <i>...the rest of the bakers</i>
<i>will now find out</i>

315
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,719
<i>if theirs passed the final test.</i>

316
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,160
[Dave] Just dip them in.

317
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,079
The whole point is to saturate it.

318
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,920
So you want no dry spots.

319
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,400
It just holds onto
as much syrup as it can.

320
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,640
[Laura] Get down.

321
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:07,079
[Dave] Soaking them
for 30 seconds each side.

322
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,920
They should soak up enough syrup.

323
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,959
I'll be soaking them for four minutes,

324
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,120
which, for tiny things, is a long soak.

325
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:16,520
But they're gonna be absolutely bursting
with this lovely syrup.

326
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,719
Only concern is if they hold their shape.

327
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,240
[in high-pitched voice]
Bakers, you have 30 minutes left.

328
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,280
Was that okay?

329
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,800
[Hermine] Gonna get them in now.
Don't take long to cook.

330
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,560
Hopefully, we're good this time.

331
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,560
[Dave] These need to go in the fridge
to firm up and set more

332
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,160
and then the savarin will sit on the curd.

333
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,520
I need to focus now 'cause
this is the tough bit, the fancy bit.

334
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:41,839
[Peter] Concentration station.

335
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,440
[Hermine] I'm gonna
get my decoration ready.

336
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,920
So as soon as I soak my savarin,
I'm ready to go.

337
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,560
[Dave] The mango curd's set nicely.
Happy with that.

338
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,320
[Peter] They look pretty uniform.

339
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,160
[Laura] Deep breath.

340
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,400
[Hermine] These are also popping off.

341
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm just gonna pick the best ones.

342
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,520
Okay, bakers, you have five minutes left.

343
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:06,199
What? Oh, God,
my hands are shaking so much.

344
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,240
[Dave] I need to make 12 mango flowers.

345
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,760
It's just really fiddly to roll these up.

346
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,719
[Peter] I wanna make sure
I get this absolutely bang on.

347
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,680
[Hermine] This one is leaning.

348
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,199
These are little pipettes
to just get a bit of extra syrup.

349
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,160
Okay, bakers, your time is up.

350
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:27,120
Please step away from your bakes.

351
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,800
[Laura in sing-song voice]
I did patisserie.

352
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,839
I can't believe I've just done that.

353
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
[Dave] Where are yours?

354
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,800
- [Hermine] In the freezer.
- Oh, are they?

355
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,199
[Matt] <i>The bakers' soaked savarins</i>
<i>will now be judged by Prue and Paul.</i>

356
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,760
Hello, Hermine.

357
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,240
- Hello, Prue, Paul.
- Hey, Hermine.

358
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,280
They look really interesting

359
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,959
- and very elegant.
- [Paul] Mmm.

360
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,400
- And quite modern.
- [Paul] I love the pipe work on them.

361
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:05,760
There's a little irregularity
with the colour on these.

362
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,839
Let's have a look.

363
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:10,160
I love the little tempered chocolate disk
on the top.

364
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,120
I quite like the flavour.
Alcohol's just enough to give it a kick.

365
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:21,040
The Chantilly and crème pat
work beautifully, nice and creamy

366
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,640
and the texture's all good.

367
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:25,280
The savarin itself,
it's slightly under-proofed.

368
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,760
The air holes inside are very tight,
they should be a little more open.

369
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,040
- [Prue] I find it a little tough...
- [Paul] Mmm.

370
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,360
...and too bread-like. Flavour's lovely.

371
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:35,920
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

372
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,719
- I love that cream.
- Well done.

373
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,160
[whispers] Well done.

374
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,599
At first glance,
I think they're really pretty.

375
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,120
I love the combination of colours.

376
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,319
They're golden brown.
They really do look scrumptious.

377
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,920
They're a little bit messy on the icing.
Likewise with the actual bake.

378
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,920
They all look different sizes.
That one looks bigger than this one.

379
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,839
Let's have a look.

380
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,719
- [Prue] So what's in the little pipette?
- [Laura] Rum syrup.

381
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,920
- [Prue] Squeeze and it'll get more?
- [Laura] Yeah.

382
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:14,520
That's a lovely, light sponge.
That's beautiful.

383
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,199
[Paul] Got some spice in there?

384
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,560
- [Laura] I put star anise and cinnamon.
- Cinnamon? Mmm.

385
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,000
You slightly overdid it
with some of the spices.

386
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,680
- Okay.
- [Paul] It's little things.

387
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,719
You're like a rough diamond.
Need polishing up a little bit.

388
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,959
- [Prue] This is a very good rum baba.
- Thank you.

389
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,079
Nobody would send it back in a restaurant.

390
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,959
I probably would. Just to meet the chef.

391
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,719
- Oh, no, stop.
- [laughing]

392
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,319
- A compliment from Paul.
- See? Lowered your hopes,

393
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,680
raised them at the end.

394
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,079
- Well done.
- Thank you.

395
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:48,599
They look unusual.
They're different. Bold, strong colour.

396
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,640
Ripped it there
getting it out of the mould.

397
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,479
- Yeah.
- I think they look really sensational

398
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,040
and fun.

399
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,599
Well, the texture of the cake is so light.

400
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,120
It's almost impossible
to get it onto the fork.

401
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,240
- I think it's lovely.
- [Prue] Mmm. So do I.

402
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,560
[Paul] I don't get
the curd sitting at the bottom.

403
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,000
- I know it's a design thing...
- Yeah.

404
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,760
...but I would've put that inside
and topped it with chocolate.

405
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,240
But, you know, the thing that surprises me

406
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,319
is I thought
you had too many flavours in this.

407
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:24,000
- It's not. It really works.
- Really, thank you.

408
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,240
- Cheers.
- There you go.

409
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,080
[Paul] I think they look very neat
and very uniform.

410
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,640
It looks like they're quite soaked,
which is good.

411
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,760
- [Prue] That looks light.
- [Paul] Lovely.

412
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
[Prue] Look at that.

413
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,200
I didn't think I was going to like

414
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,880
a savarin without any booze in it.
[chuckles]

415
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,080
- But it's delicious.
- [Peter] Fantastic.

416
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,640
- [Prue] Mouth-watering.
- Yeah.

417
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,000
You got such a nice texture to that.
Very open inside,

418
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,480
which is classic savarin.

419
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,640
All I can say, Peter...

420
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,640
- Oh, wow.
- Welcome back to the tent.

421
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,120
Thank you so much.

422
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,520
And welcome back to the Peter standard.

423
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,640
He told me I wasn't allowed to clap
when someone gets a handshake, but...

424
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,880
Well done.

425
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,080
Ba-boom. Yeah! Handshake. [giggles]

426
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:27,840
Usual comments, tastes nice, looks a mess.

427
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,120
Getting a bit bored of that, to be honest.

428
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,960
[Hermine] It's disappointing.

429
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,280
But hey, you win some, you lose some.

430
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,399
I'm feeling overwhelmed now.

431
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,880
This is incredible
that I managed to do so well.

432
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,000
So going into the technical,
I'm going in with confidence.

433
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,280
It's gonna definitely be
a tough technical, I think.

434
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,200
Yeah. Bring it on.

435
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,360
[Noel] <i>For the bakers, the pressure</i>
<i>of Patisserie Week is about to rise</i>

436
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,000
<i>as they face their toughest technical yet.</i>

437
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,000
[Matt] Bakers, it's time
for your semifinal technical challenge.

438
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,480
And this one has been set by Paul.

439
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,800
Paul, any words of advice?

440
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,080
It's quite methodical, this challenge.
It's about precision.

441
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,360
- Has he finished?
- Well, he went on for quite a long time.

442
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,560
- For him.
- Yeah.

443
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,360
As ever, this technical challenge
will be judged blind,

444
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,520
so we're gonna have to ask
these two to pop out of the tent.

445
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Off you go.

446
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,560
- Where they going?
- It's all right. Calm down.

447
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,800
[whimpers] Where they going?

448
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,895
- They'll be back.
- [Matt] I don't want them to go.

449
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,640
- Pull yourself together.
- [whimpers]

450
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,640
- Finished?
- No.

451
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,040
[whimpers] Okay, I'm finished.

452
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,640
The judges would like you
to make a Danish cornucopia,

453
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,800
a traditional Danish celebration cake

454
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,200
otherwise known as the Horn of Plenty.

455
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,280
Now, the classic horn shape
is achieved by stacking rings of dough.

456
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,800
Your dough needs to be firm
on the outside, but chewy on the inside.

457
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,159
You have two hours and 15 minutes.

458
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,880
- Bake.
- On your marks.

459
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,280
Get set.

460
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,240
[chuckles]

461
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,960
[Dave] Danish cornucopia?
No, I've never heard of one.

462
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,800
I can't really think
of what it's gonna be.

463
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,480
[Hermine] I've never even
heard of it before, so...

464
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,960
All my guess, really.

465
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
[Peter] I need to read the instructions

466
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,919
to get an idea
of what it's gonna look like.

467
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But no, it's not a clear picture
in my head right now.

468
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,600
Never heard of it. Never eaten it.

469
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:29,560
Never seen it. It's gonna be fun, innit?

470
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,200
Paul, Danish cornucopia,
what's all this about?

471
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,880
[Paul] It's a perfect challenge,
I think, for the bakers.

472
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,840
It's got no flour in it.
It's basically ground almonds in there.

473
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,360
Once you've made the dough,
they've got to divide it up

474
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
and then shape it.

475
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,640
Shape it into a round, bit like a cigar,

476
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,960
just taper the ends so they bind together.

477
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,399
When you do the cigar shape,
you encourage a little bit of a slope.

478
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,000
So as you piece them all together,

479
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,440
the slope begins to curve
and that's how you get that shape.

480
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,720
- [Prue] They're thicker in one side.
- [Paul] Exactly.

481
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,120
If they don't,
they'll end up being very flat.

482
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,800
And you won't get that depth
which you see here

483
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,560
in the Horn of Plenty all the way along.

484
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,360
Do you wanna try some of my horn?

485
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:11,000
- [grunts] You can have that piece.
- [Prue] Thank you.

486
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,720
This is lovely and chewy and very almondy.

487
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,640
You've got this gorgeous,
soft, chewy almond filling

488
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,520
with this light, crispy exterior.

489
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,720
You've got
so many different textures in there.

490
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,320
I'm sure we're gonna get
some bakers in there

491
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:29,919
who'll struggle with the shape,

492
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,600
but I hope they don't struggle
with the overall texture.

493
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:35,560
Paul, I think it's a really good challenge

494
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,560
and especially for the semifinal.

495
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,320
Not easy, very delicate,
absolutely delicious.

496
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,679
Right, where am I? Oh.

497
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,200
Just says, "Make the dough."

498
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,399
Icing sugar, egg whites,
almond extract and ground almonds.

499
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,159
Never made a dough without flour before.

500
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,640
[Hermine] I've never seen
a biscuit like this before

501
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,000
and I've certainly never baked one before.

502
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,919
I understand what he means by
crisp outside, chewy in the middle.

503
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,520
It's kind of like an amaretti biscuit
that's not quite baked.

504
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,679
We're gonna have to work fast,
there's lots of shaping to do

505
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,200
and we've got two hours fifteen,
which is not a long time.

506
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,080
- Hello, Noel. [laughs]
- How did you know it was me?

507
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,320
You're still elated
from the handshake, aren't you?

508
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:14,399
It was like this.

509
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:18,480
Whoo. And then you went, "Aah."

510
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,159
And then did you get on his shoulders?

511
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:23,080
Did you kiss him?
Did you get his number at least?

512
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,760
That was your moment.
He softens for a minute.

513
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,399
You've got like a window to get his email,
get his number, try his clothes on.

514
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
[Laura] That'll do.

515
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,560
[Hermine] I've made the dough now.

516
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,399
[Peter] So the next step
is to start shaping this.

517
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,360
Gotta use these templates.

518
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:44,000
"Measure 18 grams of dough
and shape it into a cigar shape."

519
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,679
"Press the ends together..."

520
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,120
[Peter] "...overlapping by
half a centimetre to form a ring

521
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,960
that's approximately
half a centimetre the height..." No.

522
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,720
[Dave] Gotta get my head round this.

523
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,560
"Press the ends together
overlapping by one centimetre."

524
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,760
Er...

525
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,840
[Hermine] This is like rocket science.

526
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,399
Makes no sense.

527
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,240
I just read that and I have no idea
what I actually read,

528
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,560
so I'll reread that
probably about six times.

529
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,560
This is literally my worst nightmare.

530
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,960
I don't have a logical brain.
I can't do this.

531
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,200
[exhales wearily]

532
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,120
[Peter] I think I know what I'm doing.

533
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,560
Where I'm joining the two bits of dough,
it's gonna be thin.

534
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,159
So it's gonna be like a circle,

535
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,080
thick at one end, thin at the other.

536
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,800
[Dave] And I'm guessing like that.

537
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,159
Right, got it.

538
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,760
[crying]

539
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
How's it going?

540
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:41,600
Stressful, innit?

541
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,159
[Laura] I just don't have a logical brain.

542
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,880
This is literally my worst fear

543
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,880
of not being able to present anything
on the technical.

544
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,880
But you are gonna
present something, aren't you?

545
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,040
Yeah.

546
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,120
You can do it. There's something in you
that'll get you to the next step

547
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,280
because if there wasn't,
you wouldn't be here.

548
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,040
- You're gonna smash it.
- Thank you.

549
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,679
Don't literally smash it.
That'd be a disaster.

550
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,320
- I'm quite clumsy. It could happen.
- If you literally smash it.

551
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,200
- Bless you. You're the best.
- See you later.

552
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,640
Thank you, Matt.

553
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
Oh.

554
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
I love him.

555
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,720
So I can start shaping.

556
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,280
I'm going with that.

557
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,200
When you join it together,
you get a smaller and a thicker side.

558
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,399
- [Hermine] This will have to do.
- [Laura] Like that?

559
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,320
- [sighs]
- [Peter] I feel good about that one.

560
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:27,320
- [Laura] This is number two.
- Eleven in total, there should be.

561
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,480
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

562
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,320
If I achieve this,
I'm gonna have the biggest glass of gin...

563
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,000
and sambuca chasers.

564
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,840
Obviously, it all comes down to the bake.

565
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,560
Going in.

566
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,600
Gonna check that in about ten minutes.

567
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,880
I'm gonna put them in for 15 minutes,
but I'll check it after ten.

568
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,480
[Hermine] I think
I'm gonna freestyle and see.

569
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,720
[Laura] Forgot to put the oven on.

570
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,080
I think we'll whack it up a bit.

571
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,439
I'm just gonna do my chocolate.
Save some time, be a bit strategic.

572
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,880
"Place a sheet of acetate

573
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,480
over the template provided
and pipe chocolate scrolls."

574
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,439
[Hermine] Melting my chocolate.

575
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,000
- [whispers] Hi.
- Hi.

576
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,159
[in normal voice] You okay?

577
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,320
Yeah.

578
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:20,760
Shall I get on your shoulders?

579
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:23,600
It's all right.

580
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,919
You get on my shoulders. Trench coat.

581
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,679
Your head out the top.

582
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,720
Buttons pop open,
Horn of Plenty comes out.

583
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,720
[chuckles]

584
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Yes or no?

585
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,120
Right, I'll get that stuff ready.

586
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,919
<i>Boulangers.</i>
<i>Vous êtes demi...</i> the way through.

587
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:43,880
Was that okay, Hermine?

588
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,880
No.

589
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,560
[Peter] Gonna leave them in.
The more they're baked,

590
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,840
the stronger
they have the chance of being.

591
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:52,640
Going in for another ten minutes.

592
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,560
[Laura] It's nearly there.
They're gonna have to go in.

593
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,720
I'm sure I had another timer.

594
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:03,320
Oh, well,
we'll just... Until they're brown.

595
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:05,960
"Spoon the chocolate into a piping bag."

596
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,240
"Pipe chocolate scrolls."

597
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,760
I don't mind doing this stuff,
it's quite nice.

598
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,360
It gets better as I go along, I think.

599
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,439
[Laura] They look brilliant.

600
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,080
[Peter] Ooh, that one's a bit wonky.

601
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,600
Whoo.

602
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,000
[Hermine] I think it's about time
to come out now.

603
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,240
I'm pulling them now.

604
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,720
Quite sort of golden.
They don't look burnt.

605
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,439
No point not being happy,
so let's stay happy.

606
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,399
They look a bit cracked.
Are they supposed to be cracked?

607
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,240
[Dave] No, they need a little longer.

608
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,199
Just do a couple of minutes at a time

609
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,199
because that extra minute...
You can go over too much.

610
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:51,800
[Laura] Mmm. Brilliant.

611
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,159
All cracked.

612
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,040
[exhales]

613
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,360
[Dave] It's the right colour.
Any more, it would've burnt.

614
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:02,280
So next step is to make royal icing.

615
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,679
Whisking together
icing sugar and egg whites.

616
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,919
That's gonna be decorating
the biscuits themselves.

617
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,199
"Pipe zigzag patterns
onto the cooled rings and leave to set."

618
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,919
[Laura] Good with icing. Can do icing.

619
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,720
Good start.

620
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:20,760
It's very messy, isn't it?

621
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,840
- [Peter] I don't love that one.
- Bit scruffier now.

622
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,080
[Laura] Well, that'll do.

623
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,800
Ah. Look at that. What a day.

624
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,960
Bakers, you've got half hour left.

625
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,919
It's not long.

626
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,800
"Step 12, make caramel."

627
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,399
- [Dave] The caramel will glue it together.
- So I need 200 grams of sugar.

628
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,280
I'm gonna do my caramel.
I'm just gonna do it by eye.

629
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,439
I need this to be liquid

630
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,360
whilst I'm sticking things together,
but have some tackiness to it

631
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:55,960
so that it's gonna bind and set on there,
not just run out everywhere.

632
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,960
[Dave] It's crystallised.

633
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,040
[exhales]

634
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,840
Caramel just never goes right for me.

635
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,000
Gonna start making the old tower of doom.

636
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,000
"Dip the bottom flat side
of ring number eight in the caramel

637
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,040
and place it on top of ring nine
so that they are joined base to base."

638
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:16,880
- [Matt] Do you want me to say it?
- That might be helpful.

639
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,600
[in Scottish accent]
"Repeat the ring by ring process

640
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,280
while gently supporting the horn
to each ring."

641
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,280
[Dave] Right.
I have to stick this and leave to set.

642
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,080
[Laura] Right. That'll do.

643
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,880
[Hermine] It's not the prettiest of jobs.

644
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,000
[Peter] It's stuck.

645
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,520
Sugar.

646
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:38,679
That's gonna be on the bottom anyway,

647
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,840
so they won't see it.

648
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:43,320
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

649
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,840
- [Laura] This is dangerous.
- [Dave] This is a bit crazy.

650
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,320
[Hermine] I'm not convinced
about what I'm doing here.

651
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,959
It's a bit leany, isn't it? Oh, well.

652
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,639
I wouldn't say it's the most
horn-like thing I've ever seen.

653
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,840
And then, I'm supposed
to stick the horn to the stand.

654
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,760
[Peter] That feels very precarious.

655
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,439
[Hermine] Supposed to be like that?

656
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,320
- That's how you know it's a horn, right?
- [sighs]

657
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,280
- [grunts]
- Bakers, you have one minute left.

658
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,959
- All right.
- I'm sticking the chocolate scrolls on.

659
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,159
Oh, gosh. It's not gonna stand,
it's just too hot.

660
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,480
- [Laura] I can't peel them off.
- [Dave groaning]

661
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,320
Oh, my God. Still not cool enough.

662
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:28,919
[Hermine] Lordy...

663
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,840
I'm just gonna pipe over them.

664
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:32,560
Try and swirl it on.

665
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:35,280
Not sure if that's what they want,
but it's what they'll get.

666
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,639
My face says it all.

667
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,600
Bakers, your time is up.

668
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,840
Please bring your Horns of Plenty
down to the front

669
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:47,679
and place them behind your photographs.

670
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,080
Horrible challenge. Worst one yet.

671
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,720
I thought the matcha pancakes were bad.
It's an abomination, that is.

672
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,840
[Noel] <i>Prue and Paul are looking</i>
<i>for beautifully decorated cornucopia</i>

673
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,760
<i>in a classic horn shape.</i>

674
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,959
I should've looked around.

675
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,720
[Noel] <i>Crispy on the outside</i>
<i>and soft and chewy inside.</i>

676
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:12,280
[Paul] Let's start with this one,
which is, erm...

677
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,560
[laughs]

678
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,600
[all laughing]

679
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,480
Stop it, Paul.

680
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,439
It has no chocolate on it.

681
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,679
It should've been sitting more like that.

682
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,159
[Prue] In which case,
it was the right shape.

683
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:29,600
[Paul] The graduation
of the rings are there to the top.

684
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,000
I think you might break
your teeth on that.

685
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,159
- [Paul] Hugely overbaked. Bone dry.
- [Prue] Yes.

686
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,000
- Shame.
- Lovely flavour, though.

687
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,480
- I love that flavour.
- Hmm. That almond's lovely.

688
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,639
Right.

689
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,439
[Prue] I'm sure that chocolate was...

690
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
- [Paul] Standing up at one point.
- Yeah.

691
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,040
The icing's much nicer.

692
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,360
The graduation's okay
but there's no horn shape to it.

693
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,199
[crunching]

694
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,280
Little ones are overbaked,
top ones aren't.

695
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,600
You can't bake them all at the same time

696
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,199
- because they're different sizes.
- The fat ones are good.

697
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,760
- [Paul] Hmm.
- [Prue] Chewy.

698
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,639
- Neat. And they have the chocolate on 'em.
- [Prue] Hmm.

699
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,760
[Paul] Moving on. This is a bit of a mess.

700
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,360
Chocolate's gone all over the place,

701
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:12,120
- but the royal icing's terrible.
- Gone all over the place.

702
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:14,879
[Paul] The colour of the rings
are all over the place.

703
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:18,320
That does look as if the baker
just didn't understand at all

704
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,919
what they were trying to do. [crunching]

705
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,840
- Hmm.
- Almost raw.

706
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,159
[Prue chuckles]

707
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,959
- Like marzipan.
- [Paul] Hmm.

708
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,760
There's been issues with that one.

709
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,840
Last one, we have a nice shape here.

710
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:32,800
They do look overbaked, though.

711
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:34,720
But there is chocolate on there.

712
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,080
- It is fairly neat.
- The icing's not good,

713
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:38,159
- because...
- No.

714
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,320
The whole idea of the icing
is to come down the sides

715
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,560
so that you can see it.

716
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,040
The flavour of that one's okay.
It's softer.

717
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:49,360
[Matt] <i>Paul and Prue will now rank</i>
<i>the Horns of Plenty</i>

718
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:51,240
<i>from worst to best.</i>

719
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,280
In fourth place, we have this one.

720
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:56,439
Laura, almost everything
was wrong with this.

721
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,639
It did look like a mess.

722
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:01,879
Funnily enough, it was the only one
that was underbaked.

723
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:03,879
It was not your finest hour.

724
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:05,240
In third spot, this one.

725
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:08,159
David, they were a little bit solid.

726
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,480
- Yeah.
- All the way through.

727
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,639
In second place is this one. Who's that?

728
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,679
- [mouths] Me.
- Hermine, this was so nearly there.

729
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,840
The decoration was really awful

730
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:21,439
but it was nicely baked,
and the right shape.

731
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,000
- [mouths] Thank you.
- So in first spot is this one.

732
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,520
Peter, you forgot to put the horn shape
but they were delicious.

733
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,159
The look of them with the icing,

734
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,000
you even managed to do some nice little
swirls of chocolate on there as well.

735
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,560
- Well done.
- [clapping]

736
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,159
[laughing]
That's not been a bad day. Yeah.

737
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,719
But I don't wanna be complacent.
There's only four of us,

738
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,639
and anything can happen.

739
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:48,040
[Hermine] I'm really, really happy.

740
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,159
I can't complain, and Peter deserves it.

741
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,000
He's really good with detail,

742
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,399
which I'm not particularly,
so you can't take that away from him.

743
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,040
Third isn't too great in technical.

744
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,360
It's getting tougher as we go along,
but I had a good signature,

745
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:03,439
so I'm comfortable going
into the showstopper tomorrow.

746
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,639
Glad that's over.

747
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:07,040
It's not ideal,
but there's always tomorrow.

748
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,800
Gonna have to smash that.

749
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:15,320
[Matt] <i>There's just</i>
<i>the showstopper challenge left</i>

750
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:18,879
<i>before Prue and Paul decide
who's destined for Star Baker</i>

751
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:21,199
<i>and who will miss out
on a place in the final.</i>

752
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,760
[Noel] Hello bakers, welcome back.

753
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,800
It's time for your semifinal
showstopper challenge.

754
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:29,360
[Matt] Today, Paul and Prue

755
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:31,560
would like you each to make a cube cake.

756
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:35,600
This should be comprised
of at least 25 mini cube-shaped cakes.

757
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,919
[Noel] This is all about precision.

758
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,080
So the cubes need to be sharp
and uniform and very neat.

759
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:44,879
We're looking for an exquisite finish.

760
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:48,679
Your mini cakes can be
flavoured and decorated however you like.

761
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,399
And you can use non-edible supports
to help stack the layers.

762
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,439
But you will get extra points
if the whole thing is edible.

763
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,959
I'm on a diet
so I'll just eat the supports.

764
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,879
[chuckles] You have four and a half hours,
which seems like a lifetime.

765
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,600
- On your marks...
- Get set...

766
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:05,760
Bake.

767
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,560
One last challenge
before the potential final.

768
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,319
I'm just gonna have fun today.

769
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,360
Bake from the heart
and what will be, will be.

770
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,239
[Noel] This is right up your street.

771
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:21,520
If you can't pull yourself
into the victory spot today,

772
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,960
- there's something wrong.
- Let's see what happens.

773
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,880
[Paul] We've set the bakers a four-
and-a-half hour, gruelling, hot challenge.

774
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,440
And they have to make
a cube cake, straight edges, flat sides.

775
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,880
Think Rubik's Cube.

776
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,000
And in Patisserie Week,
we are looking for that precision,

777
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,040
that artistic flair,
and obviously, their baking skill.

778
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,639
This is a sponge cake.

779
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:45,639
And sponge has to be,
as always, beautifully flavoured

780
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,159
and beautifully textured.

781
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:50,080
Inside that sponge,
we'd like to see something like a mousse

782
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,880
or a melted chocolate or a ganache.

783
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,920
The four bakers are amateurs.

784
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,400
I want to see them pushing themselves
into that world of professionalism.

785
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,920
I think there's going to be
a real fight to get into the final,

786
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,280
and they need to fight for it.

787
00:35:03,799 --> 00:35:05,479
- [Prue and Paul] Hello.
- [Peter] Morning.

788
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,000
Tell us about your cube cake.

789
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,760
I'm making a chocolate,
raspberry and pistachio cube cake.

790
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,560
- Yes. My favourite.
- Erm...

791
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,200
Magic. Erm... [chuckles]

792
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,360
We've got the three flavours
running through the entire cake.

793
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,760
I've got three different sponges,
mousses and glazes.

794
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,280
Wow. Clever.

795
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,600
[Matt] <i>Peter's going big</i>
<i>to avoid going home</i>

796
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,600
<i>with the tent's most ambitious cube cake,</i>

797
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,400
<i>made up of three types of cube.</i>

798
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,400
<i>Each will contain a different combination</i>

799
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,680
<i>of chocolate, raspberry
and pistachio sponge,</i>

800
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,000
<i>mousse and mirror glaze.</i>

801
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,160
- It sounds wonderful.
- [Paul] It does.

802
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,280
- That's a lot to do.
- So cracking on.

803
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,720
It is. Yeah, good luck.

804
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:39,640
Thank you.

805
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,920
I promise I won't disturb you at all.

806
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,400
Except you know I will.

807
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,560
[chuckles]

808
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,160
The strategy for today
is to go out hard and fast,

809
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,360
so that by the end, I'll have time
to get that patisserie precision

810
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,000
that the judges are looking for.
It's gone well in practice.

811
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,120
[Noel] <i>While Peter's hoping</i>
<i>practice makes perfect,</i>

812
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,920
<i>for one baker, today's showstopper
will be a step into the unknown.</i>

813
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,280
There's been a change of plan.

814
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,960
When I practised, it didn't go quite well.

815
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,319
So everything
I'm doing today is literally...

816
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,680
- New.
- ...new.

817
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,520
When did you decide to change your recipe?

818
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,560
- I wrote it yesterday morning.
- Yesterday?

819
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:22,280
[Noel] <i>Hermine's gambling everything</i>

820
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,040
<i>on a cube cake made up
of two different varieties,</i>

821
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,000
<i>both featuring her favourite flavours,</i>

822
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,440
<i>coffee and praline,
and cherry and chocolate.</i>

823
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,960
They sound delicious.

824
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,280
- If it works, that'll be amazing.
- Very good luck.

825
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,560
[chuckling] Thanks.

826
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,319
- Sometimes, you have to take risks.
- True.

827
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,799
- Fortune favours the bold. Good luck.
- Thank you. [chuckles]

828
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,480
[Matt] <i>Not only must the bakers' sponges</i>
<i>pack plenty of flavour...</i>

829
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,720
I always add a bit of coffee
in my chocolate sponge

830
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:50,920
so it brings the flavour out.

831
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,200
[Matt] <i>...texture must be spot-on, too.</i>

832
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,720
I'm making my pistachio friand.

833
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:59,480
It's gonna be like a frangipane.
Very moist, very soft.

834
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,120
[Laura] Always thinking about textures.

835
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,720
They're really important, I think.
It's not just about flavour.

836
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:10,240
[Matt] <i>Deliciously delicate, yet able</i>
<i>to hold their shape when layered.</i>

837
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:12,600
[Dave] This is the joconde sponge,

838
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,160
so that's just gone in at 190
for 12 minutes.

839
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,080
Today, I'm gonna be making
a chocolate cube cake.

840
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,960
I love chocolate, so this is just
to celebrate all things chocolate.

841
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,200
[Matt] <i>As well as chocolate sponge</i>
<i>and mousse, Dave's cubes will also contain</i>

842
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,520
<i>either a white, milk
or dark chocolate liquid caramel centre,</i>

843
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,880
<i>but with temperatures in the tent rising,</i>

844
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,480
<i>is Dave risking a meltdown?</i>

845
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,960
- It's gonna be hot today.
- I know it's gonna be hot today, yeah.

846
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,560
Try to get most of it done
before the heat starts rising.

847
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,120
- Good luck.
- Yeah. Cheers.

848
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,000
That's for my praline mousse.

849
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,760
Don't have a clear vision at the moment,
so it's just keep going and don't stop.

850
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,359
[Noel] <i>With so many elements to juggle...</i>

851
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,520
[Dave] This is for
my chocolate hazelnut mousse.

852
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,480
[Noel] <i>...the bakers can't relax</i>
<i>for a second.</i>

853
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,120
[Peter] I always listen to my cakes
and hear them bubble.

854
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,120
If they bubble too much, they're not done.

855
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
[Laura winces]

856
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,240
If they don't bubble at all,
they're overbaked.

857
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,760
[Noel] <i>The smallest lapse</i>
<i>in concentration...</i>

858
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,359
I've done that wrong.

859
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,160
[Noel] <i>...could spell disaster.</i>

860
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,359
[Dave] I meant to split the cream.
Heat half, and whisk half.

861
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,880
- [Noel] Hello.
- Hello, vampire.

862
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,440
That's strong booze you've got going
on there. Whew!

863
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,040
- This is for Prue.
- What is it?

864
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,560
Kirsch. Yeah.

865
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,080
She might require
a little shot of that on the side

866
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,799
if you really wanna blackmail her.
A jug. Jug of kirsch.

867
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,760
[Laura] Put lots of kirsch on.
If you're gonna do it, do it.

868
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,040
I'm doing a Black Forest gâteau-
inspired cube cake.

869
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,400
I like the flavours,
the dark chocolate and cherries.

870
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,480
They work nicely together.
It's one of my dad's favourite things.

871
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,440
This one's for him.

872
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,760
[Noel] <i>Although Laura's cake is made up</i>
<i>of just one type of cube,</i>

873
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,960
<i>each contains five layers,
including a biscuit crumb,</i>

874
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,799
<i>chocolate sponge, two mousses
and whole cherries.</i>

875
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,680
<i>All decorated
in a dark chocolate mirror glaze.</i>

876
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,376
- I'm looking forward to this one.
- Good.

877
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,640
It's one of my favourite cakes.

878
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,440
And it's sort of important
that you do it really well, Laura.

879
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah, it's one of my favourite things
that I've, like, made.

880
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,280
I'm really proud of it.

881
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:10,080
Good. That's the spirit.

882
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,600
- [Paul] Excited.
- Hope you like it.

883
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,440
I already like it.
I haven't even ate it yet.

884
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,359
- Ate it?
- And I already like it.

885
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,440
[Laura] Thank you.

886
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,600
I'm confident with the flavours
of this one,

887
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,040
it's all about the setting time.

888
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,560
That's the big concern with the mousse,
that it doesn't set.

889
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,160
I'm using gelatin. It's got
two and a half leaves in each

890
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,560
of the mousse-es, moussi... meesse.

891
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,080
[Laura] It's a delicate balance
with the gelatin

892
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,359
'cause you need it to set
but if you put too much in,

893
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,080
then it'll just be rubbery.
That's not very nice.

894
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,680
[Hermine] 'Cause I'm not really
following a recipe,

895
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,640
I don't even know
if the quantities are all right.

896
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:50,240
Hopefully, this whole concoction
will work.

897
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:52,880
[Noel] Easy on the gelatin. Easy.

898
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,240
You know exactly how many to use,
don't you?

899
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:57,760
I mean, I eat sheets of it as a snack.

900
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,640
- Fancy one?
- But not everyone's like me.

901
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,400
I used to wear boots from the '70s
made out of gelatin.

902
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,960
In hot weather, I'd get shorter.

903
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,200
[Laura] That's looking good.

904
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,160
Does look nice,
I wanna eat it just like it is.

905
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,680
Right, how's this going?
Caramel's a big part of the cube cake,

906
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,240
so it needs to go right today.

907
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,920
I've still got my biscuit to make
for the cube cake stand

908
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,480
so I'm just gonna start prepping that.

909
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,560
[Hermine] This is gonna be
my cherry mousse.

910
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,480
Hopefully, it sets nicely.

911
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,720
I feel I'm behind.

912
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,920
It's crystallised. I just don't know
what it is with this caramel.

913
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,680
I've not stirred it or disturbed it
and it just does that.

914
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,920
Caramel's not my friend
at the moment. [exhales]

915
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,400
[Noel and Matt] Bakers,
you are halfway through.

916
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,200
Oh, sorry, you say it.

917
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,760
Bakers, you are halfway through. Yeah.

918
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:56,000
I've made every single component,
it's now just assembly.

919
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,960
[Dave] I'm currently lining the moulds
with the joconde sponge.

920
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,880
I decided not to make cube cakes
in a mould because I tried it once at home

921
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,560
and I just found it an absolute nightmare
to get them out.

922
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,040
So I decided to go with the cake frame

923
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,880
and then I can slice them and get them
nice and neat and square at the sides.

924
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,560
Looks pretty good, don't it?

925
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,920
[Laura] White chocolate bavarois
is now going in.

926
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,359
It's just the assembly.
My stomach's in knots.

927
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,720
Must remember to be neat.

928
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,160
[Dave] I'm just balling out a hole
in the mousse for the caramel to sit in.

929
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:34,920
I wanted a gooey centre,
almost have a little bit of a chew.

930
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,960
[Laura] I'm not cutting the cherries up.

931
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,319
I'll get marked down for that,
but that's how I like it.

932
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,160
It's getting hot again in the tent.

933
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,839
- It is.
- Just in the last ten minutes,

934
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,480
- it's started to get a bit watery.
- [Laura] It's melting.

935
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,839
- Temperature's creeping up again.
- Yeah.

936
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,160
Ooh, what's that?

937
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,120
- Cherry mousse.
- Ooh.

938
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,359
[Hermine] Yeah, well.

939
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,640
Are you allowing yourself
to think about being in the final yet?

940
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,960
Er, not quite,

941
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,120
'cause there might not be any final
if this doesn't go to plan.

942
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,960
- No, there would still be a final.
- Well, not for me, I mean.

943
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,360
- [Matt] Not for you.
- That's it.

944
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,880
Do you want us to cancel the final
if you're not in it?

945
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,080
[Peter] Rinky dink.
Into the freezer we go.

946
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,480
[Laura] They just need to stay in
as long as possible.

947
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:22,480
- [Hermine sighs]
- [Peter] Going pretty good.

948
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,359
Got the raspberry glaze chilling down,
the chocolate glaze is on.

949
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,120
I'm weighing out ingredients
for the pistachio glaze.

950
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,000
More gelatin. This is for my mirror glaze,

951
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,040
so I think there's 24 sheets of gelatin
going into that.

952
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,480
Basically, you'll be able
to see yourself in it.

953
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,640
Mirror glaze is a bit tricky.
I'm not looking forward to it.

954
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,319
I'm preparing the shapes
for my cube cake stand.

955
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,160
I need to make three platforms
and then I need to make some cubes.

956
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,640
I'm a square guy.

957
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:57,080
I don't know if this is how
it's supposed to look, my mirror glaze.

958
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,400
Oh, it's such a messy business.

959
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,440
Don't think it's supposed
to look this gloopy.

960
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,640
[Peter] That's the raspberry
mirror glaze complete.

961
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,080
That just has to cool down.

962
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,760
Let's crack on.

963
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,560
Come on. Just this bake
and then it's final.

964
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,319
I know. It's so close.

965
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,720
- [Noel] How's it going?
- It's all right so far.

966
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:22,240
This bit always goes fine.
It's just all this assembling...

967
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,400
- It's just the judging.
- [both laughing]

968
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:28,359
Oh. What a nightmare.

969
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,760
[Matt] Oh, no, viewers. Where's Noel?

970
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,040
[Noel] I'm in here.

971
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,319
Huh?

972
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,080
Oh!

973
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,360
- Not really.
- You were there.

974
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,520
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

975
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,520
Yeah, that's not good.

976
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,799
It hasn't set,

977
00:43:45,879 --> 00:43:50,920
but I don't have time,
so I'm gonna keep adding the layers.

978
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,960
[Laura] I'm just gonna try
and get these out,

979
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,520
get the mirror glaze on. Job's a good 'un.

980
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,160
[Hermine] I'm a bit worried now.

981
00:43:58,879 --> 00:44:00,280
I'm not gonna have the cakes

982
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:03,120
because they're not gonna set.

983
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,120
[Laura] Oh, this is gonna take longer
than I thought.

984
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,640
[Dave] They don't release
very well from these,

985
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,200
so unfortunately, I have to butcher 'em.

986
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,200
[Laura] Oh.

987
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,720
[Peter] Happy. It looks good.
Looks really, really good.

988
00:44:19,799 --> 00:44:22,240
[Hermine] Doesn't look quite set inside.

989
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,359
Ah, it's not going too well, is it?

990
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,520
[Noel] Till you've seen
a man getting cubes

991
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,400
out of a silicone mat, you've not lived.

992
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,920
[Dave] Do you know how much
each silicone mat costs?

993
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,040
- [Noel] How much?
- Like, nearly £9.

994
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,680
- £9?
- Yeah.

995
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,200
[Noel] Who pays for that? Prue?

996
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,720
[Dave] Yeah, Prue did, yeah.

997
00:44:42,799 --> 00:44:44,640
- I've been sponsored by Prue.
- Have you?

998
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,839
[Noel] My whole life, yeah.
I walk her dogs.

999
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,120
I shampoo her hair.

1000
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,760
Put her husband's waistcoats
in a neat pile.

1001
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,480
Get in the wardrobe so they don't see me.

1002
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,400
Get sucked into Narnia,
which is a nightmare

1003
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,440
'cause it takes about three hours
to get out.

1004
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,480
You have to bargain
with some sort of lion king.

1005
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,680
It's a disaster, really.

1006
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,000
But it's an interesting life,
I wouldn't change it.

1007
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,080
Race to the finish.

1008
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,319
As usual.

1009
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,879
[Peter] Let's glaze these puppies.

1010
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,760
[Dave] So there's eight in the milk,
eight in the dark and nine in the white.

1011
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,319
I've gotta speed up a little bit now.
There's not a lot of time left.

1012
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,040
[Hermine] This is just not gonna happen.

1013
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,160
[Peter] Please be good. Please be good.

1014
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,319
[Laura] They looked better without,
didn't they?

1015
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,080
Not happy at all with that.

1016
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,160
[Hermine] They look a bit jelly-like,
but I might be able to get them out.

1017
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,000
[Dave] This is for the chocolate support.

1018
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:42,920
[Peter] They look good.

1019
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,920
[Laura] Oh, it's just not staying on.

1020
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,120
This is gonna look like a complete mess.

1021
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,200
Oh, my God.

1022
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,600
[Hermine] I think I've got
a bit too much gelatin.

1023
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,000
Don't know if I can glaze those ones.

1024
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,000
[Laura] I honestly don't know
what's happened.

1025
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,839
It hasn't gone like this in practice.

1026
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,359
[Hermine sighs]

1027
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,400
[Laura] What's wrong? Are you okay?

1028
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,120
- Don't even wanna carry on.
- [Laura] Come on.

1029
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,839
You can do it. I believe in you.

1030
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,080
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

1031
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,879
[Peter] I think they're looking good.
Is it perfection?

1032
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,200
Probably not quite, but it's not far off.

1033
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,240
[softly] Just keep going. It's good.
It's getting a bit tight so...

1034
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:40,400
Okay.

1035
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,120
[Peter groans softly]

1036
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,920
[Laura] Oh, dear.

1037
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,040
Can't believe I'm done.

1038
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,520
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1039
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,720
Fit, fit, fit.

1040
00:47:04,799 --> 00:47:06,240
Snug as a bug in a rug.

1041
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,960
[Laura] If the mirror glaze had worked,
I would be so proud of these.

1042
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,359
Bakers, your time is up.

1043
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,799
So upset.

1044
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,560
Please step away from your bakes.

1045
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,680
Good? Happy?

1046
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,120
- [whispering] Yeah. Are you happy?
- Yeah.

1047
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,879
[Laura] Absolutely gutted.

1048
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,240
Oh, that would've looked so good
if that mirror glaze had worked.

1049
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,440
[Peter] How'd it go?

1050
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,240
Nightmare. I never had such a disaster.

1051
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,960
I've definitely earned my crown
as the messiest, messiest baker.

1052
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,799
[Matt] <i>It's judgement time</i>
<i>for the bakers' showstopping cube cakes.</i>

1053
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,200
Dave, would you like to bring up
your showstopper?

1054
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,799
- I think they look great.
- Cheers, thank you.

1055
00:48:25,879 --> 00:48:28,000
[Paul] Neat, tidy, uniform.

1056
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,839
The chocolate is holding
which is amazing considering the heat.

1057
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,480
That was a brave choice.

1058
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,359
I like that you made the base, too.

1059
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,760
So it looks quite neat.

1060
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,760
[Matt] Mmm.

1061
00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:40,640
[Prue] Look at that caramel in the middle.

1062
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,640
Personally, I think they're a triumph.

1063
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:50,280
The caramel is delicious.
It's just the right melting point,

1064
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:52,000
so it oozes, but it still holds.

1065
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,720
The mousse is perfectly set.

1066
00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:56,960
[Prue] And the amount of mousse
and filling is quite a lot,

1067
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,920
so when you get a mouthful,
it's all fudgy.

1068
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,200
[Paul] Everything together...

1069
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,680
- Very good.
- Thank you.

1070
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,000
[Paul] You've improved
a lot actually, David.

1071
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,440
Yeah, I think I have, as well.
I feel that I've improved myself.

1072
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,120
- Well done.
- Cheers. Thank you.

1073
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,160
[Matt and Noel] Well done.

1074
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,520
[Noel] Well done.

1075
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,480
The heat's taken its toll.

1076
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,640
It's really difficult
because it's melting,

1077
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,280
it looks a little bit messy.

1078
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:30,240
- [Paul] This is Patisserie Week.
- I know.

1079
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,520
- So it's gotta look good.
- [Laura] I'm so disappointed in the look.

1080
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,720
[Prue] Mmm.

1081
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,799
Absolutely delicious.

1082
00:49:43,879 --> 00:49:46,000
I love the flavours going through there.

1083
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,600
[Prue] The textures are terrific.

1084
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,879
The whole cherries, that was brave,
but it's really delicious.

1085
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,160
[Paul] Not the best you've ever made,
but the flavours are really good.

1086
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,680
Worth all the calories.

1087
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,359
- Yay! [chuckles]
- [Paul] Thank you.

1088
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,839
Well done, Laura.

1089
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,120
- Thanks. You, too.
- [Hermine] Well done.

1090
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,319
[Laura] Thank you.

1091
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,200
That is so clever, Peter.

1092
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,760
And so complicated.

1093
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,480
[Paul] The overall look is effective

1094
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,120
'cause you've got a nice shine
on all of them.

1095
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,480
And it's set beautifully.

1096
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,480
Sponge and the mousse are gorgeous.

1097
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,319
- [Prue] Mmm.
- [Paul] Really nice.

1098
00:50:28,399 --> 00:50:30,560
I just wanna see what one
of the other one's like.

1099
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,920
Let's go for the chocolate one.

1100
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,720
[Peter] It has pistachio mousse
and a raspberry sponge.

1101
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:35,879
Works beautifully.

1102
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,440
Can I ask that you try the final one?
It's my favourite.

1103
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,920
So that's pistachio cake,
chocolate mousse, raspberry glaze.

1104
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,080
Like a sort of friand cake.

1105
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,399
- Oh, that one quite disappoints me.
- Oh, no.

1106
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,160
- Only joking.
- [all laughing]

1107
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,760
- [Prue] I love them.
- [Paul] Very clever. Well executed.

1108
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,080
- Thank you.
- [Matt] Well done.

1109
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,720
[Prue and Noel] Well done.

1110
00:50:58,799 --> 00:51:00,839
- Smashed it.
- Well done, Peter.

1111
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,080
[Hermine] Well done, Peter.

1112
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,560
Erm, well, it doesn't look great, does it?

1113
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,520
No. Not my finest, I'm afraid.

1114
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,839
[Prue] The mousse hasn't quite set here.

1115
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,960
[Paul] The bottom is collapsing
with the weight as it's melting.

1116
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,080
But before it melts too much,
let's have a quick look.

1117
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:29,640
That, for me, tastes more like raspberry
than it does cherry.

1118
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,520
It's the outside with the raspberry on it,
I love the flavour.

1119
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,640
These do feel like panna cotta.
It's really odd.

1120
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,440
It's actually quite stodgy and bouncy.

1121
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,440
It's got too much gelatin in it.
It's like a rubber ball.

1122
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,799
- It's a shame.
- [Prue] To be honest,

1123
00:51:45,879 --> 00:51:48,120
- I'm really disappointed...
- I am, too.

1124
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,000
...because you are so good at patisserie

1125
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,680
and this is, by your standards,
it's a failure.

1126
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,080
I think it goes without saying
I'm really disappointed in myself.

1127
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,720
I haven't had any disastrous bake.

1128
00:52:06,799 --> 00:52:10,399
This is my first one. It's a shame
that it happened in week nine.

1129
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,000
If I do make it to the final,
it would mean a lot.

1130
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,799
But it's really 50/50.

1131
00:52:17,879 --> 00:52:19,600
[Peter] I'm happy. Yeah.

1132
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,000
It's been a really good week.

1133
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,280
Got my first handshake,
first in the technical.

1134
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,720
I think I've got a really good
shot for Star Baker.

1135
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:27,600
[Dave] That was phenomenal.

1136
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,280
I am so proud
that I even managed to pull that off.

1137
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:34,359
Paul said it was a triumph.
And that's gonna stick with me forever.

1138
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,560
[Laura] That went
a lot better than expected.

1139
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,120
Prue said it was worth the calories.

1140
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,640
That's the golden comment
you want from Prue,

1141
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,920
so it's gonna be close.

1142
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,160
I'm certain it's between
me and Hermine going home.

1143
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,080
Hopefully, it'll be enough.

1144
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,799
[Matt] Let's start
with who's had a good week.

1145
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,399
I think the lads had a good week.

1146
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,799
David and Peter have both done very well.

1147
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,120
He struggled from the off.
To come up with that in the semifinal?

1148
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,879
[Prue] Absolutely delicious,
and it's such a sophisticated thing to do.

1149
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,680
The other thing
that was really good was Peter's.

1150
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,640
[Paul] I liked the fact that he had
different mousses going in.

1151
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,359
Each one, the flavours were amazing.

1152
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,920
I would like to give Star Baker
to both those boys.

1153
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,120
But what I found so disappointing
is Hermine.

1154
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,760
This is Patisserie Week.
It should've been her finest hour, really.

1155
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,799
[Paul] This is basically a rubber ball.

1156
00:53:25,879 --> 00:53:28,520
But in her defence,
Hermine made two things.

1157
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,680
Laura did one cake.

1158
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,879
Doesn't look brilliant,

1159
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,359
but when you bit into that,
that was absolutely delicious.

1160
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,839
But how many times have we said

1161
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,799
Laura's got to save herself
in the showstopper? Five times?

1162
00:53:39,879 --> 00:53:41,920
Hermine did have a better technical.

1163
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,680
This is a tricky one.
This could go either way.

1164
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,879
- [Matt] Really?
- Yeah.

1165
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,280
And this is the worst time
to go out, isn't it?

1166
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:51,359
- It's heartbreaking. You're just there.
- It's brutal.

1167
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,040
But that's the position we're in.

1168
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:04,640
Well, it's time for me to tell you
who has been Star Baker this week.

1169
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,319
There are a couple of candidates,
but this week's Star Baker is...

1170
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:13,440
Peter.

1171
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,879
Well done, Peter.

1172
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,680
That leaves me
with the horrible job of announcing

1173
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,680
the baker who will be leaving us.

1174
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,640
It's especially hard
because the person who's leaving us

1175
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,359
is not gonna get to the final,

1176
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,280
and you've all been so fantastic
to get this far.

1177
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:32,359
But sadly, there can only be three.

1178
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,839
So the person who is leaving us...

1179
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,560
is Hermine.

1180
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,040
Aw.

1181
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,120
- [Hermine] It's been a pleasure.
- [Dave] It has.

1182
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,160
I'm disappointed 'cause, er,
I didn't want to leave.

1183
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,399
- [Laura] Sorry.
- It's fine.

1184
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,600
I'm so sorry.

1185
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,120
I believe everything has a reason,

1186
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,879
and it was the right time for me.

1187
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,760
You are so good
and that was just a bad day, wasn't it?

1188
00:55:10,839 --> 00:55:15,040
When I go home and I have time to reflect,

1189
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,680
there will be, you know,
a lot of happy memories,

1190
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,600
a lot of proud moments.

1191
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,280
You've been an inspiration,
you really have.

1192
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:24,200
[Hermine] Thank you.

1193
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,480
I take a lot of good things
away from this.

1194
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,879
Well done for getting Star Baker.

1195
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,560
I've hit <i>Bake Off</i> jackpot this week.

1196
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,520
[Prue] You are such a clever lad.

1197
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,000
Thank you very much, Prue.

1198
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,960
I think it'll take a while to sink in.
It feels a bit surreal.

1199
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,359
This whole thing is surreal.

1200
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,280
I mean, we're locked down
in a country estate

1201
00:55:44,359 --> 00:55:46,600
with Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood
eating your bakes

1202
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,040
and Matt Lucas coming round
to make you laugh with Noel.

1203
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,799
[laughs] It's bonkers.

1204
00:55:50,879 --> 00:55:52,216
- [Matt] Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1205
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,640
[Matt] You made the final.

1206
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,240
Like, genuinely
I can't process it all right now.

1207
00:55:57,319 --> 00:55:59,000
[laughing] It's mad.

1208
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,319
Er, like I'm in the final
of <i>The Great British Bake Off.</i>

1209
00:56:02,399 --> 00:56:04,200
Like, the actual final.

1210
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,879
Like, yeah. It's, erm... [speaks gibberish]
