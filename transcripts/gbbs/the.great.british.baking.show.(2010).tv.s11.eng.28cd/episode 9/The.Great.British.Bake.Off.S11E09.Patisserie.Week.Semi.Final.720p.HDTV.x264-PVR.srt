00:00:02,126 --> 00:00:04,646
Hello, viewers. I hope you're as
excited as are for patisserie week.

2
00:00:04,647 --> 00:00:07,885
<font color="#ffff00">I love patisserie. I love tiny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">French cakes. The smaller,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the better.</font>

3
00:00:07,886 --> 00:00:11,366
Yeah, I like them so small you can
only see them under a microscope.

4
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:13,405
<font color="#ffff00">I've written a song about</font>
<font color="#ffff00">patisserie. Do you want to hear it?</font>

5
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:15,206
No.<font color="#ffff00">It's great.</font>

6
00:00:15,207 --> 00:00:17,845
<font color="#ffff00"># I eat patisserie,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">sometimes in my lingerie... #</font>

7
00:00:17,846 --> 00:00:20,725
I'm going to stop you there.<font color="#ffff00">Why?</font>
I felt it was needlessly surreal.

8
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:22,165
<font color="#ffff00">I was up all night writing that.</font>

9
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,526
Should have gone to sleep.

10
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:26,406
<font color="#00ffff">BOTH: Welcome to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">The great British Bake Off.</font>

11
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:27,526
<font color="#ffff00"># I like patisserie</font>

12
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,485
<font color="#00ffff"># Sometimes in my lingerie... #</font>

13
00:00:29,486 --> 00:00:32,245
La la la!<font color="#ffff00">See, you enjoyed it!</font>
No, I hate it.

14
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:37,446
<font color="#ffff00">To secure a place in the semifinal</font>
<font color="#ffff00">meant surviving dessert week.</font>

15
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:41,286
<font color="#00ffff">It all hangs on this.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, help, help, help.</font>

16
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:42,566
<font color="#ffff00">And it was Hermine...</font><font color="#00ffff">Beautiful.</font>

17
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:44,365
<font color="#ffff00">..who triumphed...</font>

18
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:46,765
<font color="#00ffff">Straight out of</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a Parisian patisserie.</font>

19
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:49,766
<font color="#ffff00">..and was crowned Star Baker</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for the second time,</font>

20
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:52,045
<font color="#ffff00">while puddings proved problematic</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for Peter...</font>

21
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:53,965
<font color="#00ffff">It has collapsed.</font>

22
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:55,765
<font color="#00ffff">That's slightly concerning.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">..it was Mark...</font>

23
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:56,966
<font color="#00ff00">Whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>

24
00:00:56,967 --> 00:00:59,605
<font color="#ffff00">..who had a wobble.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">The jelly is too rubbery.</font>

25
00:00:59,606 --> 00:01:01,606
<font color="#ffff00">And his time in the tent was up.</font>

26
00:01:01,607 --> 00:01:03,565
<font color="#00ff00">It's just been the most incredible</font>
<font color="#00ff00">experience.</font>

27
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:04,646
This time...

28
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,925
Biff! Oh!

29
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:09,606
With a place in the final
at stake...<font color="#ffff00">Come on!</font>

30
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:12,205
..the bakers must produce
perfect patisserie...

31
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:15,565
<font color="#00ffff">Concentration station.</font>
..with an elegant
French signature...

32
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:19,206
<font color="#00ff00">Hermine says "savarin."</font>
<font color="#00ff00">And I go, "sav-rin."</font>

33
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:21,446
..a bewildering technical...
<font color="#00ffff">It makes no sense.</font>

34
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:23,846
<font color="#00ff00">I just don't have a logical brain.</font>

35
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:25,766
..and as temperatures in the tent
soar...

36
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:27,206
It's getting hot again, isn't it?

37
00:01:27,207 --> 00:01:28,525
..a scorching show stopper...

38
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:30,886
<font color="#00ffff">Please be good. Please be good.</font>

39
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:32,806
..guaranteed to cause a meltdown.

40
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:36,205
<font color="#ffff00">It's not quite set inside.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I don't even want to carry on.</font>

41
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:42,325
<font color="#00ff00">This is going to look like</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a complete mess. Oh, my God. Oh.</font>

42
00:01:42,326 --> 00:01:46,216
<font color="#ffff00">What a nightmare.</font>

43
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:09,565
<font color="#00ffff">I'm really looking forward</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to this week.</font>

44
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:11,846
<font color="#00ffff">Patisserie is one of those</font>
<font color="#00ffff">exciting things.</font>

45
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:14,886
<font color="#00ffff">It's not home baking any more,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it's perfection, precision.</font>

46
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:16,806
<font color="#00ffff">That's patisserie.</font>

47
00:02:16,807 --> 00:02:18,726
<font color="#00ff00">I'm not feeling massively confident.</font>

48
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:21,926
<font color="#00ff00">I'm just a home baker, so this is</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a little bit out of my comfort zone.</font>

49
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:25,126
<font color="#00ff00">It would be a bit of a killer to go</font>
<font color="#00ff00">out just before the final.</font>

50
00:02:25,127 --> 00:02:28,285
<font color="#00ffff">I'm feeling more nervous that it's</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the semifinals than the fact</font>

51
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:29,965
<font color="#00ffff">that it's patisserie week.</font>

52
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:33,805
<font color="#00ffff">But I think we are all worried about</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Hermine, because she is patisserie.</font>

53
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:35,846
<font color="#00ffff">She is really good at what she does.</font>

54
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:38,246
<font color="#ffff00">It's supposed to be the week</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I enjoy the most,</font>

55
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:44,217
<font color="#ffff00">but I need to make it to the final,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">so pressure's on.</font>

56
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:50,406
<font color="#ffff00">Hello, kids. Congratulations. You've</font>
<font color="#ffff00">made it to the semifinal.</font>Whoo!

57
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:53,365
Which means that three of you
are going to be in the final

58
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:55,686
and one of you is going to
have to spend

59
00:02:55,687 --> 00:03:00,085
the rest of their life as Prue's
live-in butler.<font color="#ffff00">Imagine that.</font>

60
00:03:00,086 --> 00:03:02,365
<font color="#ffff00">"Ma'am, your buttered crumpet."</font>

61
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:05,446
"Oh, it's not worth the calories."

62
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:06,886
<font color="#ffff00">"Thank you, ma'am."</font>

63
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:10,566
<font color="#ffff00">The judges would like you to make</font>
<font color="#ffff00">12 identical patisseries using</font>

64
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:15,846
<font color="#ffff00">pate a savarin, which is</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a yeasted, enriched dough.</font>

65
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:20,365
Your savarin can be any shape or
flavour you like,

66
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,085
but, once baked, should be
soaked in a syrup of your choosing.

67
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:27,526
<font color="#ffff00">This is the semifinal, kids, so the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">judges are looking for high-end</font>

68
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:33,126
<font color="#ffff00">and they want an exquisite finish.</font>
You have two hours and 45 minutes.

69
00:03:33,127 --> 00:03:38,246
<font color="#ffff00">On your marks.</font>Get set.<font color="#ffff00">Bake!</font>

70
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:41,766
<font color="#00ffff">We are in the semifinal.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">This is pretty awesome.</font><font color="#00ff00">Stressed.</font>

71
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:44,245
<font color="#00ff00">I would very much doubt that many</font>
<font color="#00ff00">home bakers do patisserie.</font>

72
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:46,886
<font color="#00ff00">It's not something</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I have really done before this.</font>

73
00:03:46,887 --> 00:03:51,445
Patisserie is one of the hardest
challenges. It's neat. It's
exquisite.

74
00:03:51,446 --> 00:03:53,005
It's elegant.

75
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:56,166
<font color="#00ffff">Some people may not know what a</font>
<font color="#00ffff">savarin is, but think rum baba.</font>

76
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:57,325
<font color="#00ffff">That base is a savarin.</font>

77
00:03:57,326 --> 00:04:01,766
<font color="#00ffff">It's a yeasted, enriched dough,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">baked and cooked in a mould.</font>

78
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:05,005
<font color="#00ff00">Hermine says, "savarin," and I go</font>
<font color="#00ff00">"sav-rin."</font>

79
00:04:05,006 --> 00:04:08,245
We're here, doing the old
savarins this week, ain't we?

80
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:11,725
Shove them in the oven, the old
savarin.<font color="#00ffff">It's all about the proving.</font>

81
00:04:11,726 --> 00:04:15,366
<font color="#00ffff">The softness of the sponge</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and beautiful, delicate flavours.</font>

82
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:17,926
<font color="#00ffff">That's what patisserie is all about.</font>

83
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:20,845
Almost the worst challenge
is they're baking in a heatwave,

84
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:23,846
which means that proving times will
probably be shorter,

85
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,446
so they ought to watch that.

86
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:28,045
<font color="#00ffff">It's going to be interesting to see</font>
<font color="#00ffff">who really steps up to the</font>

87
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:30,726
<font color="#00ffff">plate and creates something that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">deserves its place</font>

88
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:32,646
<font color="#00ffff">in a patisserie</font>
<font color="#00ffff">anywhere in the world.</font>

89
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,725
But any of our four bakers could go
through to the final.

90
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:41,485
I think these four are as good
as we've ever had. I really do.

91
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:44,966
<font color="#00ffff">Strange dough to work with.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">It needs to be pipe-able.</font>

92
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:46,765
<font color="#00ffff">If it's done right,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it bakes beautifully.</font>

93
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:49,165
<font color="#00ff00">A normal dough, you can really knead</font>
<font color="#00ff00">it. You can't touch that.</font>

94
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,246
<font color="#00ff00">It's very, very wet.</font>

95
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:53,766
<font color="#00ffff">I'm just looking for a really</font>
<font color="#00ffff">silky smooth, stretchy dough.</font>

96
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:55,765
<font color="#00ffff">And I'm pretty much there.</font>

97
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:59,526
<font color="#00ffff">Hi, Hermine.</font><font color="#ffff00">Hello, Paul. Hello,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Prue.</font><font color="#00ffff">Tell us all about your</font>
<font color="#00ffff">savarin.</font>

98
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:04,285
<font color="#ffff00">So I'm doing a baba au rhum.</font>Oh,
lovely. I do like a rum baba.

99
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:08,166
<font color="#ffff00">And I am going to glaze it with</font>
<font color="#ffff00">an apricot jam</font>

100
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:10,406
<font color="#ffff00">to kind of give it a shine.</font>

101
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:15,686
Hermine, this should be your day.
This is such a classic French thing.

102
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:17,606
<font color="#ffff00">I hope I can deliver.</font>

103
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:20,326
Hermine was chosen to make
rum babas for her savarin

104
00:05:20,327 --> 00:05:21,565
and she's keeping

105
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:23,526
things traditional,
filling them with vanilla creme pate

106
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:25,885
and decorating
with piped Chantilly cream

107
00:05:25,886 --> 00:05:27,085
and tempered chocolate.

108
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:29,485
<font color="#00ffff">So you've won Star Baker twice.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Nobody else has done that.</font>

109
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:32,006
<font color="#00ffff">Are you feeling quite confident then</font>
<font color="#00ffff">going into the final?</font>

110
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:34,525
<font color="#ffff00">I don't want that to give me</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a big head, so...</font>

111
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:36,445
<font color="#ffff00">You've had a handshake as well,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">haven't you?</font>

112
00:05:36,446 --> 00:05:40,006
<font color="#ffff00">But if you can let things like that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">distract you...</font>Yeah, exactly.

113
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,245
You shouldn't think about that.

114
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:44,845
Just concentrate on today
and relax, do your best.

115
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:47,125
<font color="#ffff00">Can you say "apricot" for us</font>
<font color="#ffff00">one more time?</font>

116
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:48,205
<font color="#ffff00">Abricot.</font>

117
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:52,806
<font color="#ffff00">OK, that's the handshake.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you, Hermine.</font><font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

118
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:56,725
But Hermine has got competition
in the battle of the babas.

119
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:58,406
<font color="#00ff00">She keeps copying me, honestly.</font>

120
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:00,806
<font color="#00ff00">Someone's going to have to say</font>
<font color="#00ff00">something to her.</font>

121
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:06,246
<font color="#00ff00">Hermine, you learnt all you</font>
<font color="#00ff00">know from me, didn't you?</font><font color="#ffff00">I did!</font>

122
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:09,446
Laura is giving her rum babas
a tropical twist with a filling

123
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:11,846
of poached pineapple,
kiwi and passion fruit.

124
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:14,605
To finish, she's adding pipettes
of syrup to inject an extra

125
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:16,405
kick of rum into her bake.

126
00:06:16,406 --> 00:06:19,405
Tell us about your dough.
<font color="#00ff00">It's a fairly standard savarin</font>
<font color="#00ff00">dough.</font>

127
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:20,725
<font color="#00ff00">I've got fresh yeast in there</font>

128
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:23,046
<font color="#00ff00">cos I think it gives a nicer</font>
<font color="#00ff00">rise.</font><font color="#00ffff">Really?</font>

129
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:26,246
<font color="#00ffff">Why do you think fresh yeast is</font>
<font color="#00ffff">better?</font><font color="#00ff00">Uh...</font>

130
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:29,606
<font color="#00ffff">You think</font>
<font color="#00ffff">because it gives a better rise?</font>

131
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:31,885
Just say yes.<font color="#00ff00">Yes.</font><font color="#00ffff">Oh.</font>

132
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:33,685
<font color="#ffff00">That was horrible, wasn't it?</font>

133
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:36,646
<font color="#ffff00">It's like you're being interrogated.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I was sweating then, weren't you?</font>

134
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,406
<font color="#00ff00">"Why do you use that yeast?"</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I don't know!</font>

135
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:40,966
<font color="#ffff00">Don't let him get in your head.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, he's really good at it.</font>

136
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,365
<font color="#ffff00">He's got eyes like the nightwalker.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Make you doubt yourself.</font>

137
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:47,206
<font color="#ffff00">To create a savarin to savour...</font>

138
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,806
<font color="#00ffff">Put that in for the first prove.</font>

139
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:51,565
<font color="#ffff00">..the bakers will need to prove</font>
<font color="#ffff00">their dough long enough to achieve</font>

140
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:53,485
<font color="#ffff00">a light, open texture.</font>

141
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:56,006
<font color="#00ff00">The whole point of it is that you</font>
<font color="#00ff00">make it like a bread-type cake</font>

142
00:06:56,007 --> 00:07:00,685
<font color="#00ff00">and then you soak it in syrup.</font><font color="#ffff00">All</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the flavour comes from the syrup.</font>

143
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:05,126
<font color="#ffff00">The rum is spiced, but I'm adding</font>
<font color="#ffff00">some spices as well to the mix.</font>

144
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:09,926
<font color="#ffff00">While Hermine and Laura are aiming</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to perfect a French classic...</font><font color="#00ff00">Yum.</font>

145
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:13,165
<font color="#ffff00">..Dave is taking his savarin all the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">way to Mexico.</font>

146
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,566
<font color="#00ffff">Tequila!</font>

147
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,845
<font color="#ffff00">Dave's savarin will be soaked in</font>
<font color="#ffff00">honey tequila before being</font>

148
00:07:17,846 --> 00:07:20,845
<font color="#ffff00">set on a mango and passion fruit</font>
<font color="#ffff00">curd and crowned with a honey</font>

149
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:22,726
<font color="#ffff00">and cocoa Chantilly cream.</font>

150
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:27,445
Mango, passion fruit, chocolate and
tequila?<font color="#00ffff">And tequila, yes.</font>Hmm.

151
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:30,086
Quite a mix.<font color="#00ffff">Getting into the final.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Do you think you're going to do it?</font>

152
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:32,486
<font color="#00ffff">It's in sight, but there's</font>
<font color="#00ffff">tough competition here.</font>

153
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:33,926
<font color="#00ffff">I'm just going to try my best.</font>

154
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:35,526
I tell you what, Dave,
you are looking

155
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:38,246
so much more confident.<font color="#00ffff">Thank you.</font>

156
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:40,885
Quite different from when
we first met you.<font color="#00ffff">Good luck.</font>

157
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:42,445
<font color="#00ffff">Right, cheers. Thank you.</font><font color="#ffff00">Tequila.</font>

158
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:44,845
<font color="#00ffff">Tequila.</font><font color="#ffff00">Come on, now you're</font>
<font color="#ffff00">talking!</font>

159
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:46,285
<font color="#ffff00">Jiminy Christmas.</font>

160
00:07:46,286 --> 00:07:49,926
While Dave, Laura and Hermine are
all banking on booze...

161
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:53,365
<font color="#ffff00">Whenever I'm making a syrup,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I always add my alcohol last</font>

162
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:56,006
<font color="#ffff00">because I don't want the alcohol to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">evaporate too much.</font>

163
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:58,886
<font color="#ffff00">Only question - can it make Prue</font>
<font color="#ffff00">happy?</font>

164
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:01,525
To meet the demands
of patisserie week...

165
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:03,565
<font color="#00ffff">I'm purposely not</font>
<font color="#00ffff">over-complicating it today.</font>

166
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,406
<font color="#00ffff">I want to get something out that's</font>
<font color="#00ffff">really clean and looks professional.</font>

167
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:08,725
..Peter has chosen to keep
a clear head.

168
00:08:08,726 --> 00:08:10,165
<font color="#00ffff">I'm not soaking it in alcohol.</font>

169
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,725
<font color="#00ffff">In here I've got</font>
<font color="#00ffff">elderflower cordial,</font>

170
00:08:11,726 --> 00:08:14,005
<font color="#00ffff">lemon juice, water and sugar.</font>

171
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:15,206
<font color="#00ffff">I don't really</font>
<font color="#00ffff">drink very much myself,</font>

172
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:18,246
<font color="#00ffff">so I thought we'll go</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for a teetotal savarin.</font>

173
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,325
<font color="#00ffff">I'm the one who goes to the club</font>
<font color="#00ffff">sober, leaves after an hour.</font>

174
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:22,406
<font color="#00ffff">I'm really boring.</font>

175
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:24,326
He may think he's a bit of a square,

176
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:27,925
but Peter is hoping rectangular
savarins will help him pass this
exam.

177
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:30,445
He's soaking them in an elderflower
syrup before finishing

178
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:33,805
with elderflower
and strawberry creme diplomats.

179
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:36,685
<font color="#00ffff">I would like to see the old Peter</font>
<font color="#00ffff">today.</font>

180
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:38,246
<font color="#00ffff">We've got a bit of heat in the tent.</font>

181
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:40,166
<font color="#00ffff">I think you've just got to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">concentrate, ignore that</font>

182
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:42,726
<font color="#00ffff">and just don't make mistakes.</font><font color="#ffff00">Do you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">like that advice?</font>

183
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:43,885
<font color="#ffff00">"Don't make mistakes."</font>

184
00:08:43,886 --> 00:08:47,526
<font color="#00ffff">Don't make mistakes! It sounds...</font>
<font color="#ffff00">It's as easy as that!</font><font color="#00ffff">It's so</font>
<font color="#00ffff">simple.</font>

185
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,125
<font color="#ffff00">We can do it.</font><font color="#00ffff">Thank you, Peter.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Don't make mistakes, yeah?</font>

186
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:51,325
<font color="#00ffff">That's the plan.</font>

187
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:53,606
<font color="#00ffff">I'm going to bring back</font>
<font color="#00ffff">week one Star Baker</font>

188
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:55,885
<font color="#00ffff">and show them what I can do.</font>

189
00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:59,485
That's your yeasted enriched dough.
Is it proving at the moment?

190
00:08:59,486 --> 00:09:01,766
<font color="#00ff00">It is proving, yeah.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Do you want to see the best bit?</font>

191
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:05,126
<font color="#00ff00">You have to imagine it's Paul's</font>
<font color="#00ff00">face.</font>Oh! Really?

192
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,966
<font color="#00ff00">And then you go...</font>
Oh, poor Paul! Oh, my Lord!

193
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:10,886
<font color="#00ff00">Do you want to do it?</font>OK, here
we go.<font color="#00ff00">Go for it.</font>

194
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:13,405
Biff! Oh!

195
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:15,686
<font color="#00ff00">You can keep that. Thanks.</font>
Oh, wow!

196
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,965
I'm going to sell this on eBay.

197
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:20,486
With the first prove finished...

198
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:22,406
<font color="#00ffff">I'm going to get</font>
<font color="#00ffff">this into a piping bag</font>

199
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:25,405
<font color="#00ffff">and you'll see how we can pipe</font>
<font color="#00ffff">such a substance.</font>

200
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:28,166
..the savarins can begin to take
shape.

201
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,925
<font color="#ffff00">It's not easy to pipe</font>
<font color="#ffff00">because it's quite elastic,</font>

202
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:34,165
<font color="#ffff00">but I want it to be consistent.</font>

203
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,165
<font color="#00ffff">I'm just making each one even in</font>
<font color="#00ffff">weight.</font>

204
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,405
<font color="#00ffff">They should all rise identically.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">That's what I'm hoping for.</font>

205
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:43,846
<font color="#ffff00">All right, so that's me done.</font>

206
00:09:43,847 --> 00:09:46,165
<font color="#00ffff">I got to prove these</font>
<font color="#00ffff">until they double in size.</font>

207
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,685
<font color="#ffff00">But the savarin might be ready</font>
<font color="#ffff00">sooner than expected.</font>

208
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:51,085
<font color="#00ffff">Because it's getting</font>
<font color="#00ffff">really, really hot right now,</font>

209
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:53,965
<font color="#00ffff">it could be as little as 30 minutes,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">we'll just have to wait and see.</font>

210
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:56,365
<font color="#ffff00">The higher temperatures in the tent</font>
<font color="#ffff00">mean the bakers</font>

211
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:58,645
<font color="#ffff00">risk over-proving their dough...</font>

212
00:09:58,646 --> 00:10:00,685
<font color="#ffff00">They had 30 minutes during practice.</font>

213
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:03,686
<font color="#ffff00">I'll give it the same and then</font>
<font color="#ffff00">have a look.</font>

214
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,726
<font color="#ffff00">..resulting in flat,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">collapsed cakes.</font>

215
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:09,085
<font color="#00ff00">They're not going</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to buy rustic this time.</font>

216
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:09,805
<font color="#00ff00">It's got to be perfect.</font>

217
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:11,605
<font color="#ffff00">But stop proving too soon,</font>

218
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:15,925
<font color="#ffff00">and they'll rise too quickly</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in the oven, causing them to tear.</font>

219
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:17,365
<font color="#00ffff">It's so warm in here.</font>

220
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:21,286
Bakers, you have 4,950 seconds left.

221
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,645
<font color="#00ffff">Is that real?</font>

222
00:10:22,646 --> 00:10:27,046
<font color="#00ff00">Matt, how long do we actually have?</font>
Hm? Oh, you're halfway through.

223
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:29,766
<font color="#00ff00">Thank you.</font>With their dough
rapidly rising...

224
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:31,686
<font color="#00ffff">Did you try and work that out,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Peter?</font>

225
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:33,606
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>..the bakers will need every
second

226
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:35,366
to create their fillings and
toppings.

227
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:36,806
<font color="#00ffff">Mm!</font>

228
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:38,605
<font color="#00ff00">It's all about balance with</font>
<font color="#00ff00">flavours.</font>

229
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:41,126
<font color="#00ff00">You've got quite a lot</font>
<font color="#00ff00">going on with the rum, the fruit,</font>

230
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:42,566
<font color="#00ff00">the dough and everything.</font>

231
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:45,286
<font color="#00ff00">So the Chantilly cream is almost</font>
<font color="#00ff00">just breaks it up a bit.</font>

232
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:48,685
<font color="#00ffff">The savarin is going to be set</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on a mango and passion fruit curd,</font>

233
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:52,166
<font color="#00ffff">sort of a fruity custard.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I'm making a creme pate.</font>

234
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,925
<font color="#ffff00">I'm a bit worried that they</font>
<font color="#ffff00">might say it's simple,</font>

235
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:57,446
<font color="#ffff00">but I think it's a classic.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">A classic is simple.</font>

236
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:59,366
Have you ever seen
Babar The Elephant?

237
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,246
<font color="#ffff00">I watched that when I was young.</font>
I still watch it now. I love Pingu.

238
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:06,246
I watch Pingu. Do you ever watch
Pingu?<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>Love Pingu.

239
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:07,885
HE IMITATES PINGU

240
00:11:07,886 --> 00:11:11,776
Pingu!

241
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:15,085
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, yeah, they're definitely well</font>
<font color="#00ffff">proved.</font>

242
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:16,885
<font color="#00ffff">They've really risen.</font>

243
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:19,885
<font color="#00ffff">But they're all nice and even.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I think that's pretty much proved.</font>

244
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:23,245
<font color="#00ffff">So they're going in for 15</font>
<font color="#00ffff">minutes at 175.</font>

245
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:26,125
<font color="#00ffff">I think that is quite hot,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but it's for a quick bake.</font>

246
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:29,286
<font color="#ffff00">I'm baking them for 14 minutes.</font>

247
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:30,726
<font color="#00ffff">10 to 12-ish minutes,</font>

248
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:34,617
<font color="#00ffff">until they are nice</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and dark golden brown on top.</font>

249
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:37,766
<font color="#ffff00">Look at you go.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">You are so laid back.</font>

250
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:38,886
<font color="#ffff00">Am I?</font>

251
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:40,045
<font color="#ffff00">Do you think you're going to win</font>
<font color="#ffff00">this?</font>

252
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:41,965
<font color="#ffff00">Who knows? It's in the hands of the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">universe?</font>

253
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:43,885
<font color="#ffff00">I love that you trust the universe.</font>

254
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:46,285
<font color="#ffff00">What about old "good flavours"</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Laura?</font>

255
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:48,205
<font color="#ffff00">You're going to have to... Aren't</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you?</font>

256
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:50,086
<font color="#ffff00">You're going to have to...</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Bang!</font>

257
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:51,526
<font color="#ffff00">Oh.</font>

258
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:52,885
<font color="#ffff00">You do what you got to do in this</font>
<font color="#ffff00">business.</font>

259
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:55,285
<font color="#ffff00">No, that's not nice.</font>

260
00:11:55,286 --> 00:11:57,126
<font color="#ffff00">It's got to be a proud win.</font>

261
00:11:57,127 --> 00:12:01,017
<font color="#ffff00">A universe win.</font>

262
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,765
<font color="#00ff00">They look golden. I'll probably</font>
<font color="#00ff00">put them in for another few minutes.</font>

263
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:09,126
<font color="#ffff00">They're rising nicely.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe I'm talking too early.</font>

264
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:11,526
<font color="#00ffff">They are looking very golden</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and rather lovely.</font>

265
00:12:11,527 --> 00:12:13,165
<font color="#00ffff">I'm just going to make sure</font>
<font color="#00ffff">they are not under,</font>

266
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,405
<font color="#00ffff">rather than be slightly over</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and a bit drier.</font>

267
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:20,166
<font color="#00ffff">All right, I need to take these out.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, they're good.</font>

268
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,566
<font color="#00ffff">Looking good, yeah.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">They've puffed up nicely.</font>

269
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,166
<font color="#00ffff">Hopefully nice and light and airy.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I'm feeling good.</font>

270
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:27,046
<font color="#00ffff">Feeling really good.</font>Are they the
colour that you want them to be?

271
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,486
<font color="#00ffff">They are the colour</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I want them to be.</font>

272
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:30,445
<font color="#00ffff">Probably Paul will say</font>
<font color="#00ffff">they're too dark, but...</font>

273
00:12:30,446 --> 00:12:33,126
Say that you modelled them on his
tan. I dare you!

274
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,765
You might not get a Hollywood
handshake,

275
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:37,645
but you'll get one from me.

276
00:12:37,646 --> 00:12:40,045
<font color="#ffff00">From the look of them, I may have</font>
<font color="#ffff00">under proved them.</font>

277
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:44,486
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, dear, dear, dear.</font>

278
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:46,406
<font color="#ffff00">I'll do another batch.</font>

279
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:47,965
<font color="#ffff00">This is the semifinal,</font>

280
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:50,485
<font color="#ffff00">so I do want it to be perfect.</font>

281
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:53,965
<font color="#ffff00">Let's start again.</font>

282
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:56,845
<font color="#ffff00">OK, bakers.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">You've only got one hour left.</font>

283
00:12:56,846 --> 00:12:58,765
<font color="#00ffff">Time flies when you're having fun,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">doesn't it?</font>

284
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:01,286
<font color="#ffff00">Now, let's try again</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and see this time.</font>

285
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:03,366
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, the weather is not helping.</font>

286
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,725
<font color="#ffff00">Hopefully this one will be</font>
<font color="#ffff00">all right.</font>

287
00:13:05,726 --> 00:13:08,646
<font color="#ffff00">While Hermine's babas are starting</font>
<font color="#ffff00">back at the beginning...</font>

288
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:11,725
<font color="#ffff00">This time I'll just give it 15</font>
<font color="#ffff00">minutes.</font>

289
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:13,446
<font color="#ffff00">..the rest of the bakers will now</font>
<font color="#ffff00">find out</font>

290
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:15,805
<font color="#ffff00">if theirs pass the final test.</font>

291
00:13:15,806 --> 00:13:17,126
<font color="#00ffff">I'll just dip the whole thing in.</font>

292
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:21,606
<font color="#00ffff">The whole point is to saturate it.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">So you want no dry spots.</font>

293
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:25,446
<font color="#00ffff">It just holds on to as much</font>
<font color="#00ffff">syrup as it can.</font><font color="#00ff00">Come on. Get down.</font>

294
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:27,366
<font color="#00ffff">I'm just soaking them</font>
<font color="#00ffff">30 seconds each side.</font>

295
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:28,966
<font color="#00ffff">They should soak up enough syrup.</font>

296
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,886
<font color="#00ffff">I'm going to be soaking them</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for four minutes or something,</font>

297
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:33,446
<font color="#00ffff">which for such tiny things is</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a very long soak.</font>

298
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:36,646
<font color="#00ffff">But they are going to be absolutely</font>
<font color="#00ffff">bursting with all this lovely syrup.</font>

299
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:39,366
<font color="#00ffff">The only concern is</font>
<font color="#00ffff">if they hold their shape.</font>

300
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:44,006
IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE:<font color="#ffff00">Bakers, you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">have 30 minutes left!</font>

301
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:46,765
<font color="#ffff00">Was that OK?</font>

302
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:50,005
<font color="#ffff00">I'm going to get them in now.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">They don't take long to cook.</font>

303
00:13:50,006 --> 00:13:51,686
<font color="#ffff00">Hopefully, we are good this time.</font>

304
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:54,726
<font color="#00ffff">These need to go in the fridge just</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to firm up and set a bit more</font>

305
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:56,806
<font color="#00ffff">and then the savarin will</font>
<font color="#00ffff">sit on the curd.</font>

306
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:59,366
<font color="#00ff00">I really need to focus now,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">because this is the tough bit.</font>

307
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:02,125
<font color="#00ff00">The fancy bit.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Concentration station.</font>

308
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:04,045
<font color="#ffff00">I'm going</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to get my decoration ready,</font>

309
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:08,966
<font color="#ffff00">so as soon as I soak my savarin, I'm</font>
<font color="#ffff00">ready to go.</font>

310
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:11,526
<font color="#00ffff">The mayo curd is set nicely,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">so happy with that.</font>

311
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:14,125
<font color="#00ffff">I think</font>
<font color="#00ffff">they look pretty uniform, yeah.</font>

312
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:17,725
<font color="#00ff00">Deep breath.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">These are also puffing up.</font>

313
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:20,006
<font color="#ffff00">I'm just going to pick</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the best ones.</font>

314
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:22,645
OK, bakers,
you have five minutes left.

315
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:24,646
<font color="#00ff00">What?!</font>

316
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:26,965
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, God, my hands are shaking so</font>
<font color="#00ff00">much.</font>

317
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,485
<font color="#00ffff">I need to make 12 mango flowers.</font>

318
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:31,885
<font color="#00ffff">It's just really fiddly to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">roll these up.</font>

319
00:14:31,886 --> 00:14:35,046
<font color="#00ffff">I just want to make sure that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I get this absolutely bang on.</font>

320
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:36,966
<font color="#ffff00">This one is leaning.</font>

321
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:41,485
<font color="#00ff00">These are little pipettes that just</font>
<font color="#00ff00">get a bit of extra syrup.</font>

322
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:44,605
OK, bakers. Your time is up.

323
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:48,685
<font color="#ffff00">Please step away from your bakes.</font>

324
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:49,926
<font color="#00ff00">I just did patisserie!</font>

325
00:14:49,927 --> 00:14:53,005
<font color="#00ff00">I just</font>
<font color="#00ff00">can't believe I just done that!</font>

326
00:14:53,006 --> 00:14:58,937
<font color="#00ffff">Where are yours?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">In the freezer.</font><font color="#00ffff">Oh, are they?</font>

327
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:07,831
The bakers' soaked savarins
will now be judged by Prue and Paul.

328
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:13,802
<font color="#ffff00">Hello, Hermine.</font><font color="#00ff00">Hello, Prue.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, Hermine.</font><font color="#00ff00">Hello, Paul.</font>

329
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:22,350
<font color="#ffff00">They look really interesting</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and very elegant and quite modern.</font>

330
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:23,790
<font color="#00ffff">I love the pipework on them.</font>

331
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,310
<font color="#00ffff">There's a little bit of irregularity</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with the colour on these.</font>

332
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:27,511
<font color="#00ffff">Let's have a look.</font>

333
00:15:27,512 --> 00:15:33,482
<font color="#00ffff">I love the little</font>
<font color="#00ffff">tempered chocolate disc on the top.</font>

334
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:36,631
<font color="#00ffff">I actually quite like the flavour.</font>

335
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:38,430
<font color="#00ffff">The alcohol's just enough</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to give it a kick,</font>

336
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:40,830
<font color="#00ffff">and the Chantilly and the creme pat</font>
<font color="#00ffff">work beautifully</font>

337
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:43,230
<font color="#00ffff">and they're nice and creamy,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and the texture's all good.</font>

338
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:45,630
<font color="#00ffff">The savarin itself,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it's slightly under-proved.</font>

339
00:15:45,631 --> 00:15:47,511
<font color="#00ffff">The air holes inside</font>
<font color="#00ffff">are very, very tight,</font>

340
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:49,230
<font color="#00ffff">and they should be</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a little bit more open.</font>

341
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:53,751
<font color="#ffff00">I find it a little tough...</font><font color="#00ffff">Mm.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">..and too bread-like.</font>

342
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,311
<font color="#ffff00">The flavour is lovely.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you very much.</font><font color="#00ff00">Thank you.</font>

343
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:59,310
<font color="#00ff00">Thanks.</font>Well done.<font color="#00ff00">Thank you.</font>

344
00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:03,201
WHISPERS:<font color="#00ff00">Well done.</font>

345
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,271
<font color="#ffff00">At first glance,</font>

346
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:12,510
<font color="#ffff00">I think they're really pretty and</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I love the combination of colours.</font>

347
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:15,511
<font color="#ffff00">They're golden brown.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">They really do look scrumptious.</font>

348
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:17,550
<font color="#00ffff">They're a little bit messy</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on the icing.</font>

349
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:20,190
<font color="#00ffff">Likewise with the actual bake -</font>
<font color="#00ffff">they all look different sizes.</font>

350
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:23,191
<font color="#00ffff">That one looks bigger than this one.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Let's have a look.</font>

351
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:26,071
<font color="#ffff00">So, what's in the little pipettes?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">So, that's rum syrup.</font>

352
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:31,831
<font color="#ffff00">So, I give it a squeeze?</font><font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font>

353
00:16:31,832 --> 00:16:34,711
<font color="#ffff00">That's lovely, light sponge.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">It's beautiful.</font>

354
00:16:34,712 --> 00:16:36,390
<font color="#00ffff">Got some spice in there,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">haven't you?</font>

355
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:38,910
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, I put star anise...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">And cinnamon?</font><font color="#00ff00">..and cinnamon.</font><font color="#00ffff">Mm.</font>

356
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,431
<font color="#00ffff">You probably slightly overdid it</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with some of the spices.</font><font color="#00ff00">OK.</font>

357
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:44,151
<font color="#00ffff">It's little things with you, Laura.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">You're like a rough diamond.</font>

358
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:46,470
<font color="#00ffff">You just need polishing up</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a little bit, that's all.</font>

359
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:48,870
<font color="#ffff00">This is a very good rum baba.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Thank you.</font><font color="#ffff00">You know,</font>

360
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:50,910
<font color="#ffff00">nobody would send it back</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in a restaurant.</font>

361
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:53,550
<font color="#00ffff">I probably would send it back,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">just to meet the chef.</font>

362
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:56,311
<font color="#00ff00">Aw, nice!</font><font color="#ffff00">Oh, there you are.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Ah, a compliment from Paul.</font>See?

363
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:59,031
Lowered your hopes,
raised them at the end.

364
00:16:59,032 --> 00:17:02,922
Well done.<font color="#00ff00">Thank you.</font>

365
00:17:05,311 --> 00:17:07,950
<font color="#00ffff">They look unusual, different. Bold,</font>

366
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:10,231
<font color="#00ffff">strong colour. You've ripped it</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a little bit there</font>

367
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:11,550
<font color="#00ffff">getting it out of the mould.</font><font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font>

368
00:17:11,551 --> 00:17:16,830
<font color="#ffff00">I think they look</font>
<font color="#ffff00">really sensational and fun.</font>

369
00:17:16,831 --> 00:17:19,831
<font color="#ffff00">Well, the texture of the cake</font>
<font color="#ffff00">is so light,</font>

370
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:25,802
<font color="#ffff00">it's almost impossible</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to get it onto the fork!</font>

371
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:29,591
<font color="#00ffff">I think it's lovely.</font><font color="#ffff00">Mm, so do I.</font>

372
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:31,831
<font color="#00ffff">I don't get the curd</font>
<font color="#00ffff">sitting at the bottom.</font>

373
00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:33,271
<font color="#00ffff">I know it's a design thing...</font>

374
00:17:33,272 --> 00:17:35,671
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font><font color="#00ffff">..but I would have put that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">inside it</font>

375
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:37,271
<font color="#00ffff">and then topped it</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with the chocolate.</font>

376
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:39,630
<font color="#ffff00">But do you know,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the thing that surprises me</font>

377
00:17:39,631 --> 00:17:41,911
<font color="#ffff00">is I thought you had</font>
<font color="#ffff00">too many flavours in this.</font>

378
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:43,351
<font color="#ffff00">It's not. It really works.</font>

379
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:49,322
<font color="#00ff00">Really? Thank you. Cheers.</font>
There you go!

380
00:17:57,031 --> 00:17:59,070
<font color="#00ffff">I think they look very neat</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and very uniform.</font>

381
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:00,870
<font color="#00ffff">It looks like</font>
<font color="#00ffff">they're quite soaked, as well,</font>

382
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,071
<font color="#00ffff">which is always a good thing.</font>

383
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:08,042
<font color="#ffff00">Ooh, that looks very light.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Cuts through lovely.</font><font color="#ffff00">Look at that.</font>

384
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:13,350
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't think I was going to like</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a savarin without any booze in it.</font>

385
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:16,350
SHE LAUGHS
<font color="#ffff00">But it's delicious.</font><font color="#00ff00">Fantastic.</font>

386
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:18,030
<font color="#ffff00">Mm, mouthwatering.</font><font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

387
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:20,070
<font color="#00ffff">You've got such a nice texture</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to that.</font>

388
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:22,830
<font color="#00ffff">Very open inside,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">which is classic savarin.</font>

389
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:25,111
<font color="#00ffff">All I can say, Peter...</font>

390
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:26,430
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, wow!</font>

391
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,111
<font color="#00ffff">..welcome back to the tent.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Thank you so much.</font>

392
00:18:29,112 --> 00:18:31,831
<font color="#ffff00">And welcome back</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to the Peter standard.</font>

393
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:33,630
He told me I wasn't allowed to clap

394
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:39,562
when someone gets a handshake,
but...

395
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,190
Well done.

396
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:45,591
<font color="#00ff00">Ba-boom! Yeah, a handshake. He-he!</font>

397
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:48,631
<font color="#00ffff">Usual comments -</font>
<font color="#00ffff">tastes nice, looks a mess.</font>

398
00:18:48,632 --> 00:18:51,511
<font color="#00ffff">Getting a bit bored of that,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to be honest.</font>

399
00:18:51,512 --> 00:18:55,831
<font color="#ffff00">Disappointing, but,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">hey, you win some, you lose some.</font>

400
00:18:55,832 --> 00:18:57,630
<font color="#00ff00">I'm feeling overwhelmed now.</font>

401
00:18:57,631 --> 00:19:00,151
<font color="#00ff00">This is, like, incredible</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that I managed to do so well.</font>

402
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:03,390
<font color="#00ff00">So, going into the Technical,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I'm going in with confidence.</font>

403
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:06,630
<font color="#00ffff">It's going to definitely be</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a tough Technical, I think.</font>

404
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:10,521
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, bring it on.</font>

405
00:19:10,712 --> 00:19:12,030
NOEL:<font color="#ffff00">For the bakers,</font>

406
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:15,671
<font color="#ffff00">the pressure of patisserie week</font>
<font color="#ffff00">is about to rise...</font>

407
00:19:15,672 --> 00:19:21,271
<font color="#ffff00">..as they face</font>
<font color="#ffff00">their toughest Technical yet.</font>

408
00:19:21,272 --> 00:19:25,350
Bakers, it's time for
your semifinal Technical Challenge,

409
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:29,190
and this one has been set by Paul.
Paul, any words of advice?

410
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:31,511
<font color="#00ffff">It's quite methodical,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">this challenge.</font>

411
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:35,310
<font color="#00ffff">It's about precision.</font>

412
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:36,990
<font color="#ffff00">Has he finished?</font>I...

413
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:39,750
He went on for quite a long time.
<font color="#ffff00">For him.</font>Yeah.

414
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:41,670
<font color="#ffff00">OK, as ever,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">this Technical Challenge</font>

415
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:44,311
<font color="#ffff00">will be judged blind, so we're going</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to have to ask these two</font>

416
00:19:44,312 --> 00:19:47,831
<font color="#ffff00">to pop out of the tent. Off you go.</font>

417
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:49,350
Where are they going?
<font color="#ffff00">It's all right.</font>

418
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:50,670
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, calm down.</font>Ah!

419
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:52,951
Where are they going?!
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, they'll be back.</font>

420
00:19:52,952 --> 00:19:55,351
I don't want them to go!
<font color="#ffff00">Pull yourself together.</font>

421
00:19:55,352 --> 00:19:57,751
Ooh!<font color="#ffff00">Finished?</font>No.

422
00:19:57,752 --> 00:19:58,950
Oh!

423
00:19:58,951 --> 00:20:00,311
OK, finished.

424
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:04,951
<font color="#ffff00">The judges would like you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to make a Danish cornucopia -</font>

425
00:20:04,952 --> 00:20:07,991
<font color="#ffff00">a traditional</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Danish celebration cake</font>

426
00:20:07,992 --> 00:20:10,950
<font color="#ffff00">otherwise known</font>
<font color="#ffff00">as the Horn of Plenty.</font>

427
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:15,671
Now, the classic horn shape is
achieved by stacking rings of dough.

428
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,071
Your dough needs
to be firm on the outside

429
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:20,070
but chewy on the inside.

430
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:22,470
You have 2 hours and 15 minutes.

431
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:27,031
<font color="#ffff00">Bake.</font>On your marks.<font color="#ffff00">Get set.</font>

432
00:20:27,032 --> 00:20:28,590
HE CHUCKLES

433
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:30,990
<font color="#00ff00">Danish cornucopia?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">No, I've never heard of one.</font>

434
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:33,271
<font color="#00ff00">I can't really think</font>
<font color="#00ff00">of what it's going to be.</font>

435
00:20:33,272 --> 00:20:37,271
<font color="#ffff00">I've never even heard of it before,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">so I'll go with my guess, really.</font>

436
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:39,031
I need to read the instructions,

437
00:20:39,032 --> 00:20:41,431
get an idea of what it's going
to look like in the end,

438
00:20:41,432 --> 00:20:44,190
but, no, it's not a clear picture
in my head right now.

439
00:20:44,191 --> 00:20:48,510
<font color="#00ffff">Never heard of it,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">never eaten it, never seen it.</font>

440
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,191
<font color="#00ffff">It's going to be fun, isn't it?</font>

441
00:20:51,192 --> 00:20:54,551
<font color="#ffff00">Paul, Danish cornucopia -</font>
<font color="#ffff00">what's all this about?</font>

442
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:56,910
<font color="#00ffff">Well, it's a perfect challenge,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I think, for the bakers.</font>

443
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:58,110
<font color="#00ffff">Now, it's got no flour in it.</font>

444
00:20:58,111 --> 00:20:59,910
<font color="#00ffff">It's supposed to be</font>
<font color="#00ffff">ground almonds in there.</font>

445
00:20:59,911 --> 00:21:02,430
<font color="#00ffff">Once you've actually made the dough,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">they've got to divide it up</font>

446
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:03,870
<font color="#00ffff">and then they've got to shape it.</font>

447
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,911
<font color="#00ffff">Shape it into a round,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a bit like a cigar,</font>

448
00:21:05,912 --> 00:21:08,190
<font color="#00ffff">and just taper the ends</font>
<font color="#00ffff">so they bind together.</font>

449
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:09,591
<font color="#00ffff">When you do the cigar shape,</font>

450
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:11,910
<font color="#00ffff">you encourage a little bit</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of a slope,</font>

451
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:13,350
<font color="#00ffff">so as you piece them all together,</font>

452
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:16,350
<font color="#00ffff">the slope begins to curve,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and that's how you get that shape.</font>

453
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:19,110
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, I can see they're thicker</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in one side.</font><font color="#00ffff">Exactly, yeah.</font>

454
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,510
<font color="#00ffff">If they don't, they'll end up</font>
<font color="#00ffff">being very, very flat,</font>

455
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:23,831
<font color="#00ffff">and you won't get that depth</font>
<font color="#00ffff">which you see here</font>

456
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:25,431
<font color="#00ffff">in the Horn of Plenty</font>
<font color="#00ffff">all the way along.</font>

457
00:21:25,432 --> 00:21:28,951
<font color="#00ffff">So, Prue, do you want to try</font>
<font color="#00ffff">some of my horn?</font>

458
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:33,630
<font color="#00ffff">You can have that piece there.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you, darling.</font>

459
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:36,990
<font color="#ffff00">This is lovely and chewy</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and very almondy.</font>

460
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:40,951
<font color="#00ffff">You've got this gorgeous,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">soft, chewy almond filling</font>

461
00:21:40,952 --> 00:21:43,351
<font color="#00ffff">with this light, crispy exterior,</font>

462
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:46,110
<font color="#00ffff">and so you've got</font>
<font color="#00ffff">so many different textures in there.</font>

463
00:21:46,111 --> 00:21:48,030
<font color="#00ffff">I'm sure we're going</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to get some bakers in there</font>

464
00:21:48,031 --> 00:21:50,430
<font color="#00ffff">who are going to struggle slightly</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with the shape,</font>

465
00:21:50,431 --> 00:21:52,951
<font color="#00ffff">but I hope they don't struggle with</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the overall texture.</font>

466
00:21:52,952 --> 00:21:55,831
<font color="#ffff00">Paul, I think</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it's a really good challenge,</font>

467
00:21:55,832 --> 00:21:57,911
<font color="#ffff00">and especially for the semifinal.</font>

468
00:21:57,912 --> 00:22:02,910
<font color="#ffff00">Not easy, very delicate,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">absolutely delicious.</font>

469
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:04,710
<font color="#00ff00">Right, where am I? Oh!</font>

470
00:22:04,711 --> 00:22:06,551
<font color="#00ffff">Just says, "Make the dough."</font>

471
00:22:06,552 --> 00:22:09,751
"Icing sugar, egg whites,
almond extract and ground almonds."

472
00:22:09,752 --> 00:22:11,671
<font color="#00ffff">Never made a dough</font>
<font color="#00ffff">without flour before.</font>

473
00:22:11,672 --> 00:22:13,950
<font color="#ffff00">I've never seen a biscuit</font>
<font color="#ffff00">like this before,</font>

474
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:16,350
<font color="#ffff00">and I've certainly</font>
<font color="#ffff00">never baked one before.</font>

475
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:17,591
<font color="#00ff00">I can understand what he means</font>

476
00:22:17,592 --> 00:22:19,470
<font color="#00ff00">by crisp on the outside,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">chewy in the middle.</font>

477
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,271
<font color="#00ff00">It's kind of like</font>
<font color="#00ff00">an amaretti biscuit</font>

478
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:22,871
<font color="#00ff00">that's not quite baked.</font>

479
00:22:22,872 --> 00:22:24,791
<font color="#00ffff">I think we're going to have</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to work pretty fast</font>

480
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:27,511
<font color="#00ffff">cos there's a lot of shaping to do,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and we've only got 2 hours 15,</font>

481
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,951
<font color="#00ffff">which is not a long time.</font>

482
00:22:28,952 --> 00:22:31,470
<font color="#00ffff">Hello, Noel.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">How did you know it was me?</font>

483
00:22:31,471 --> 00:22:33,751
<font color="#ffff00">You're still elated</font>
<font color="#ffff00">from the handshake, aren't you?</font>

484
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,030
<font color="#ffff00">It was like this. Woo!</font>

485
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:38,711
<font color="#ffff00">And then you went, "Ahh!"</font>

486
00:22:38,712 --> 00:22:41,111
<font color="#ffff00">And then... Did you get</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on his shoulders?</font>

487
00:22:41,112 --> 00:22:43,470
<font color="#ffff00">Did you kiss him?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Did you get his number, at least?</font>

488
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:46,110
<font color="#ffff00">That was your moment.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">He softens for a minute.</font>

489
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:48,631
<font color="#ffff00">You've got, like, a window</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to get his email,</font>

490
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:52,710
<font color="#ffff00">get his number, try his clothes on.</font>

491
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:55,950
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, dear!</font>
HERMINE:<font color="#ffff00">I've made the dough now.</font>

492
00:22:55,951 --> 00:22:58,711
So, the next step is
to start shaping this.

493
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:00,631
We've got to use these templates.

494
00:23:00,632 --> 00:23:04,350
<font color="#00ff00">"Measure out 18g of dough</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and shape it into a cigar shape."</font>

495
00:23:04,351 --> 00:23:05,911
<font color="#00ffff">"Press the ends together."</font>

496
00:23:05,912 --> 00:23:08,471
"Overlapping by 0.5cm to form a ring

497
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:14,442
"that is approximately 0.5cm
the height..." No.

498
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,071
<font color="#00ff00">This is what I've got</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to get my head around.</font>

499
00:23:18,072 --> 00:23:21,990
<font color="#00ff00">"Press the ends together,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">overlapping by 1cm."</font>

500
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:23,991
<font color="#00ff00">Erm...</font>

501
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:27,671
<font color="#ffff00">This is like rocket science.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">It makes no sense.</font>

502
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,391
I just read that, and I have
no idea what I actually read,

503
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:32,951
so I'm going to reread that
probably about six times.

504
00:23:32,952 --> 00:23:34,871
<font color="#00ffff">This is, like,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">literally my worst nightmare.</font>

505
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:38,430
<font color="#00ffff">Like, I don't have a logical brain.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I can't do this.</font>

506
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:41,790
SHE EXHALES DEEPLY

507
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,351
<font color="#00ffff">I think I know what I'm doing.</font>

508
00:23:43,352 --> 00:23:45,431
<font color="#00ffff">Where I join the two bits</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of dough together,</font>

509
00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:49,751
<font color="#00ffff">it's going to be thin,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">so it's going to be like a circle -</font>

510
00:23:49,752 --> 00:23:52,151
<font color="#00ffff">thick at one end, thin at the other.</font>

511
00:23:52,152 --> 00:23:55,191
<font color="#00ffff">I'm guessing like that.</font>

512
00:23:55,192 --> 00:23:56,550
<font color="#00ff00">Right, I've got it.</font>

513
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:58,470
SHE SNIFFLES

514
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:00,951
How's it going?

515
00:24:00,952 --> 00:24:03,991
It's stressful, isn't it?
<font color="#00ffff">I just don't have a logical brain.</font>

516
00:24:03,992 --> 00:24:06,270
<font color="#00ffff">This is literally,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">like, my worst fear</font>

517
00:24:06,271 --> 00:24:09,111
<font color="#00ffff">of not being able to present</font>
<font color="#00ffff">anything on the Technical.</font>

518
00:24:09,112 --> 00:24:11,430
But you are going
to present something, aren't you?

519
00:24:11,431 --> 00:24:12,870
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>You can do it.

520
00:24:12,871 --> 00:24:15,511
There is something there in you
that will get you to the next step,

521
00:24:15,512 --> 00:24:17,790
because if there wasn't,
you wouldn't be here.

522
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,351
And you're going to smash it.
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you.</font>

523
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:20,791
I mean, don't literally smash it.

524
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,191
That would be a disaster.
<font color="#00ffff">I am quite clumsy.</font>

525
00:24:23,192 --> 00:24:25,911
Yeah, then if you literally
smash it...<font color="#00ffff">Bless you.</font>

526
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:29,111
<font color="#00ffff">You're the best.</font>See you later.
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you, Matt.</font>

527
00:24:29,112 --> 00:24:32,471
<font color="#00ffff">Oh! I love him.</font>

528
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:35,550
<font color="#ffff00">Just going to start shaping.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I'm going with that.</font>

529
00:24:35,551 --> 00:24:38,910
<font color="#00ff00">When you join it together, you do</font>
<font color="#00ff00">get a smaller and a thicker side.</font>

530
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,710
<font color="#ffff00">This will have to do.</font>

531
00:24:40,711 --> 00:24:42,510
<font color="#00ffff">Like that?</font>
SHE EXHALES

532
00:24:42,511 --> 00:24:44,791
<font color="#00ff00">I feel pretty good about that one.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I like that one.</font>

533
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:47,351
<font color="#00ffff">This is number two.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">11 in total, there should be.</font>

534
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:50,871
<font color="#00ff00">One, two, three, four, five, six,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.</font>

535
00:24:50,872 --> 00:24:55,710
<font color="#00ffff">If I achieve this, I'm going to have</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the biggest glass of gin...</font>

536
00:24:55,711 --> 00:24:57,751
<font color="#00ffff">..and Sambuca chasers.</font>

537
00:24:57,752 --> 00:25:03,681
<font color="#00ff00">Obviously, it all comes down</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to the bake, doesn't it?</font><font color="#00ffff">Going in.</font>

538
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:06,150
<font color="#00ffff">Going to check that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in about ten minutes.</font>

539
00:25:06,151 --> 00:25:07,590
<font color="#00ff00">I'm going to put them in</font>
<font color="#00ff00">for 15 minutes,</font>

540
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:09,990
<font color="#00ff00">but I'll probably check it</font>
<font color="#00ff00">after ten.</font>

541
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:13,950
<font color="#ffff00">I think I'm going</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to freestyle and see.</font>

542
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:17,111
<font color="#00ffff">Oh,</font>BLEEP!

543
00:25:17,112 --> 00:25:19,110
<font color="#00ffff">I forgot to put the oven on,</font>

544
00:25:19,111 --> 00:25:21,751
<font color="#00ffff">so I think we'll just</font>
<font color="#00ffff">whack it up a bit.</font>

545
00:25:21,752 --> 00:25:24,151
<font color="#00ffff">I'm just going to do</font>
<font color="#00ffff">my chocolate, I think.</font>

546
00:25:24,152 --> 00:25:25,830
<font color="#00ffff">Save some time, be a bit strategic.</font>

547
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:28,230
<font color="#ffff00">"Place a sheet of acetate</font>

00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:39,671
<font color="#ffff00">Are you OK?</font><font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font>

552
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:42,711
<font color="#ffff00">Shall I get on your shoulders?</font>

553
00:25:42,712 --> 00:25:43,991
<font color="#00ff00">Looks all right, actually.</font>

554
00:25:43,992 --> 00:25:48,030
<font color="#ffff00">You get on my shoulders.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Trench coat. Your head out the top.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Horn of Plenty comes out.</font>

557
00:25:51,032 --> 00:25:53,111
SHE LAUGHS
<font color="#ffff00">Yes or no?</font>

558
00:25:53,112 --> 00:25:57,150
<font color="#ffff00">Right, I'll get that stuff ready.</font>
SHE LAUGHS

559
00:25:57,151 --> 00:26:02,310
Boulangeres,
vous etes demi the way through.

560
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,310
<font color="#ffff00">Was that OK, Hermine?</font><font color="#00ff00">No-o-o!</font>

561
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:07,710
I'm just going
to leave them in there.

562
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:08,951
I think the more that they're baked,

563
00:26:08,952 --> 00:26:11,351
the stronger
they have the chance of being.

564
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:13,271
<font color="#00ff00">Just going in</font>
<font color="#00ff00">for another ten minutes.</font>

565
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:15,031
<font color="#00ffff">It's nearly there.</font>

566
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:18,030
<font color="#00ffff">I'm just going to have to go in.</font>

567
00:26:18,031 --> 00:26:21,271
<font color="#00ffff">I'm sure I had another timer.</font>

568
00:26:21,272 --> 00:26:23,671
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, well.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">We'll just... Until they're brown.</font>

<font color="#00ff00">I don't mind doing this stuff.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">It's quite nice.</font>

572
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:36,951
<font color="#ffff00">They're getting better</font>
<font color="#ffff00">as I go along, I think.</font>

573
00:26:36,952 --> 00:26:40,311
<font color="#00ffff">Well, they look brilliant.</font>

574
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:44,202
<font color="#00ff00">Ooh, that was a bit wonky.</font>

575
00:26:45,112 --> 00:26:48,870
<font color="#00ff00">Woo!</font><font color="#ffff00">I think it's about time</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to come out now.</font>

576
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:51,511
<font color="#00ff00">I think I'll cool them now.</font>

577
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:53,911
<font color="#00ff00">Quite sort of golden.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">They don't look burnt.</font>

578
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,791
<font color="#00ff00">No point not being happy at this</font>
<font color="#00ff00">point, I think, so let's stay happy.</font>

579
00:26:56,792 --> 00:27:00,311
<font color="#ffff00">They look a bit cracked.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Are they supposed to be cracked?</font>

580
00:27:00,312 --> 00:27:02,670
<font color="#00ff00">Nah, I think they need</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a little bit longer.</font>

581
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:06,391
<font color="#00ff00">Just do a couple of minutes</font>
<font color="#00ff00">at a time, cos that extra minute,</font>

582
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:10,470
<font color="#00ff00">you can go over too much.</font>

583
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:15,191
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, brilliant. They're all cracked.</font>

584
00:27:15,192 --> 00:27:18,071
SHE EXHALES

585
00:27:18,072 --> 00:27:20,670
<font color="#00ff00">I'd say it's the right colour.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Any more, and it would have burnt.</font>

586
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:22,551
So, next up is to make royal icing,

587
00:27:22,552 --> 00:27:24,990
whisking together icing sugar
and egg whites.

588
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:28,951
That's going to be decorating
the biscuits themselves.

589
00:27:28,952 --> 00:27:33,390
<font color="#00ff00">"Pipe zigzag patterns onto</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the cooled rings and leave to set."</font>

590
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:36,791
<font color="#00ffff">I'm good with icing. I can do icing.</font>

591
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:39,511
<font color="#00ffff">Good start.</font>

592
00:27:39,512 --> 00:27:41,911
<font color="#ffff00">Going to be messy, isn't it?</font>

593
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:46,950
Don't love that one.
<font color="#00ff00">Bit scruffier now.</font>

594
00:27:46,951 --> 00:27:49,271
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, dear!</font>

595
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:55,161
<font color="#ffff00">Ah, look at that. What a day!</font>

596
00:27:55,231 --> 00:27:57,271
<font color="#ffff00">Bakers, you've got a half-hour left!</font>

597
00:27:57,272 --> 00:28:00,151
<font color="#00ff00">It's not long.</font>
"Step 12 - make caramel."

598
00:28:00,152 --> 00:28:02,670
<font color="#00ff00">The caramel has</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to glue it all together.</font>

599
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:04,951
<font color="#ffff00">200g of sugar.</font>

600
00:28:04,952 --> 00:28:07,831
<font color="#00ffff">I'm just going to do my caramel.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I'm just going to do it by eye.</font>

601
00:28:07,832 --> 00:28:10,950
I need this to be liquid whilst
I'm sticking things together,

602
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:12,510
but have a slight tackiness to it

603
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:14,910
so that it's going
to bind and set on there,

604
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:16,830
and not just run out everywhere.

605
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:19,950
<font color="#ffff00">BLEEP</font><font color="#00ff00">caramel! It's crystallised.</font>

606
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:22,711
HE EXHALES
<font color="#00ff00">It just never goes right for me.</font>

607
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:25,350
<font color="#00ffff">I'm going to start making</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the old tower of doom.</font>

608
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:29,751
"Dip the bottom flat side
of ring number eight in the caramel

609
00:28:29,752 --> 00:28:31,230
"and place it on top of ring nine

610
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:34,470
"so that they are joined
base to base."

611
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:35,790
<font color="#ffff00">Do you want me to say it for you?</font>

612
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,470
That might be actually
really helpful.

613
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:39,870
IN SCOTTISH ACCENT:
<font color="#ffff00">"Repeat the ring-by-ring process</font>

614

<font color="#ffff00">the horn to each ring."</font>

615
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:47,831
<font color="#00ff00">Right, let's stick this</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and leave it to set.</font>

616
00:28:47,832 --> 00:28:49,950
<font color="#00ffff">Is that right? No idea.</font>

617
00:28:49,951 --> 00:28:52,230
<font color="#ffff00">This isn't the prettiest of jobs,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">is it?</font>

618
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:56,670
It's stuck. Sugar!

619
00:28:56,671 --> 00:28:59,191
I think it's all right. I think
that'll be on the bottom anyway,

620
00:28:59,192 --> 00:29:00,870
so they won't see it.

621
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:03,671
<font color="#ffff00">Bakers, you have five minutes left.</font>

622
00:29:03,672 --> 00:29:08,070
<font color="#00ffff">This is dangerous.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">This is a bit crazy.</font>

623
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:12,030
HERMINE:<font color="#ffff00">I'm not too convinced</font>
<font color="#ffff00">about what I'm doing here.</font>

624
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:14,430
<font color="#00ffff">It's a bit leany,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">isn't it? Oh, well.</font>

625
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:17,111
I wouldn't say it's the most
horn-like thing I've ever seen.

626
00:29:17,112 --> 00:29:21,271
<font color="#ffff00">And then I'm supposed to stick</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the horn to the stand?</font>

627
00:29:21,272 --> 00:29:23,070
That feels very precarious.

628
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:24,990
<font color="#ffff00">It's supposed to be like that?</font>

629
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:26,910
<font color="#ffff00">So, that's how you know</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it's a horn, right?</font>

HE EXHALES

631
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:36,270
SHE GROANS
Bakers, you have one minute left.

632
00:29:36,271 --> 00:29:39,390
<font color="#00ffff">Right.</font>I'm just sticking
the chocolate scrolls onto the horn.

633
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:42,150
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, gosh! It's not going to stand.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">It's too hot.</font>

634
00:29:42,151 --> 00:29:43,710
<font color="#00ffff">I can't even peel them off.</font>

635
00:29:43,711 --> 00:29:45,911
<font color="#00ff00">There! There!</font>

636
00:29:45,912 --> 00:29:47,671
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, my God.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">It's still not cool enough.</font>

637
00:29:47,672 --> 00:29:49,111
<font color="#ffff00">Lordy, Lordy, Lordy!</font>

638
00:29:49,112 --> 00:29:50,711
<font color="#ffff00">I'm just going to pipe over them.</font>

639
00:29:50,712 --> 00:29:53,111
<font color="#00ffff">I can try and swirl it on</font>
<font color="#00ffff">while it's on it.</font>

640
00:29:53,112 --> 00:29:54,391
I'm not sure
if that's what they wanted,

641
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:55,950
but it's what they're getting.

642
00:29:55,951 --> 00:29:57,990
<font color="#00ff00">My face says it all.</font>

643
00:29:57,991 --> 00:30:00,870
<font color="#ffff00">Bakers, your time is up.</font>

00:30:00,871 --> 00:30:05,271
<font color="#ffff00">Please bring your Horns of Plenty</font>
<font color="#ffff00">down to the front</font>

645
00:30:05,272 --> 00:30:08,070
<font color="#ffff00">and place them</font>
<font color="#ffff00">behind your photographs.</font>

646
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:10,071
<font color="#00ffff">Horrible challenge. Worst one yet.</font>

647
00:30:10,072 --> 00:30:12,390
<font color="#00ffff">I thought the matcha pancakes</font>
<font color="#00ffff">were bad.</font>

648
00:30:12,391 --> 00:30:15,031
<font color="#00ffff">That's an abomination, that is.</font>

649
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:19,031
<font color="#ffff00">Prue and Paul are looking for</font>
<font color="#ffff00">beautifully decorated cornucopia</font>

650
00:30:19,032 --> 00:30:20,791
<font color="#ffff00">in a classic horn shape...</font>

651
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:23,671
<font color="#00ff00">I should have looked around.</font>

652
00:30:23,672 --> 00:30:29,601
<font color="#ffff00">..crispy on the outside</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and soft and chewy inside.</font>

653
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:32,631
<font color="#00ffff">Let's start with this one,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">which is...</font>

654
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:35,031
HE LAUGHS

655
00:30:35,032 --> 00:30:37,950
THEY LAUGH

656
00:30:37,951 --> 00:30:39,831
<font color="#ffff00">Stop it, Paul!</font>

657
00:30:39,832 --> 00:30:41,670
<font color="#ffff00">It has no chocolate on it.</font>

658
00:30:41,671 --> 00:30:44,670
<font color="#00ffff">It should have been sitting</font>
<font color="#00ffff">more like that.</font><font color="#ffff00">That.</font>

659
00:30:44,671 --> 00:30:47,031
<font color="#ffff00">In which case,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it was the right shape.</font>

660
00:30:47,032 --> 00:30:51,031
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah. The graduation of the rings</font>
<font color="#00ffff">are there to the top.</font>

661
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:52,471
CRUNCH

662
00:30:52,472 --> 00:30:55,671
<font color="#ffff00">I think you might break your teeth</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on that.</font><font color="#00ffff">Hugely over-baked.</font>

663
00:30:55,672 --> 00:30:58,231
<font color="#00ffff">They're bone dry. Shame.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Lovely flavour, though. Goodness!</font>

664
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:00,870
<font color="#ffff00">I do love that flavour.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Mm. That almond's lovely.</font>

665
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:03,671
<font color="#00ffff">Right.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Well, I'm sure that chocolate was...</font>

666
00:31:03,672 --> 00:31:05,670
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, it was standing up</font>
<font color="#00ffff">at one point.</font><font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

667
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:07,230
<font color="#00ffff">The icing's much nicer.</font>

668
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:13,162
<font color="#00ffff">The graduation's OK,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but there's no horn shape to it.</font>

669
00:31:14,431 --> 00:31:16,791
<font color="#00ffff">The little ones are over-baked.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">The top ones aren't.</font>

670
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,231
<font color="#00ffff">When you bake these,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you can't bake them</font>

671
00:31:18,232 --> 00:31:20,550
<font color="#00ffff">all at the same time</font>
<font color="#00ffff">because they're different sizes.</font>

672
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:22,950
<font color="#ffff00">The fat ones are good, though.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Mm.</font><font color="#ffff00">Very chewy.</font>

673
00:31:22,951 --> 00:31:25,830
<font color="#00ffff">They're neat and they do have</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the chocolate on them.</font><font color="#ffff00">Mm.</font>

674
00:31:25,831 --> 00:31:28,151
<font color="#00ffff">Right, moving on. This is a bit of a</font>
<font color="#00ffff">mess, this one.</font>

675
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,751
<font color="#00ffff">The chocolate's gone all over the</font>
<font color="#00ffff">place,</font>

676
00:31:29,752 --> 00:31:32,550
<font color="#00ffff">but it's the icing...</font><font color="#ffff00">The icing's</font>
<font color="#ffff00">all over the place.</font><font color="#00ffff">It's terrible.</font>

677
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:35,191
<font color="#00ffff">And the colour of the actual rings</font>
<font color="#00ffff">are all over the place, as well.</font>

678
00:31:35,192 --> 00:31:36,990
<font color="#ffff00">That does look as if the baker</font>

679
00:31:36,991 --> 00:31:42,551
<font color="#ffff00">just didn't understand at all</font>
<font color="#ffff00">what they were trying to do.</font>

680
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:47,031
<font color="#ffff00">Mm!</font><font color="#00ffff">Almost raw.</font><font color="#ffff00">Like marzipan.</font><font color="#00ffff">Mm.</font>

681
00:31:47,032 --> 00:31:49,350
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, there's been issues</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with that one.</font>

682
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:51,191
<font color="#00ffff">Last one, we have a nice shape here.</font>

683
00:31:51,192 --> 00:31:53,670
<font color="#00ffff">They do look over-baked, though,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">if I'm honest, but there is</font>

684
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:56,550
<font color="#00ffff">chocolate on there, and it is fairly</font>
<font color="#00ffff">neat.</font><font color="#ffff00">The icing's not very good,</font>

685
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:58,231
<font color="#ffff00">though, because...</font><font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

686
00:31:58,232 --> 00:32:00,631
<font color="#ffff00">..the whole idea of the icing</font>
<font color="#ffff00">is to come down the side</font>

687
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:03,390
<font color="#ffff00">so that you can see it.</font>

688
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:06,510
<font color="#00ffff">The flavour of that one's OK.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">It's softer.</font>

689
00:32:06,511 --> 00:32:11,550
Paul and Prue will now rank the
Horns of Plenty from worst to best.

690
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:14,790
<font color="#ffff00">In fourth place,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">we have this one. Laura.</font>

691
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:16,791
<font color="#ffff00">Almost everything</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was wrong with this.</font>

692
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:18,391
<font color="#ffff00">It did look like a mess.</font>

693
00:32:18,392 --> 00:32:22,110
<font color="#ffff00">Funnily enough, it was the only one</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that was under-baked.</font>

694
00:32:22,111 --> 00:32:24,471
<font color="#ffff00">It was not your finest hour.</font>

695
00:32:24,472 --> 00:32:26,790
<font color="#00ffff">In third spot,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">we have this one.</font>

696
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:29,310
<font color="#00ffff">David. They were a little bit</font>
<font color="#00ffff">solid...</font><font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font>

697
00:32:29,311 --> 00:32:30,750
<font color="#00ffff">..all the way through.</font>

698
00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:34,110
<font color="#ffff00">In second place is this one.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Who's that?</font>

699
00:32:34,111 --> 00:32:36,990
<font color="#00ff00">Me.</font><font color="#ffff00">Hermine,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">this was so nearly there.</font>

700
00:32:36,991 --> 00:32:39,390
<font color="#ffff00">The decoration was really awful,</font>

701
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:42,270
<font color="#ffff00">but it was nicely baked</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and the right shape.</font><font color="#00ff00">Thank you.</font>

702
00:32:42,271 --> 00:32:45,630
<font color="#00ffff">So, in first spot is this one.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Peter.</font>

703
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:48,471
<font color="#00ffff">You forgot to put the horn shape,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but they were delicious,</font>

704
00:32:48,472 --> 00:32:50,790
<font color="#00ffff">and they look good with the icing.</font>

705
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:53,591
<font color="#00ffff">And you even managed to do</font>
<font color="#00ffff">some nice little swirls of chocolate</font>

706
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:57,482
<font color="#00ffff">on there, as well. Well done.</font>

707
00:32:57,752 --> 00:33:02,670
<font color="#00ff00">It's not been a bad day, yeah.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">But I don't want to be complacent.</font>

708
00:33:02,671 --> 00:33:06,071
<font color="#00ff00">There's only four of us,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and anything can happen.</font>

709
00:33:06,072 --> 00:33:09,271
<font color="#ffff00">I'm really, really happy.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">You know, I can't complain.</font>

710
00:33:09,272 --> 00:33:10,590
<font color="#ffff00">And Peter deserved it.</font>

711
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:13,830
<font color="#ffff00">He's really good with detail,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">which I'm not particularly,</font>

712
00:33:13,831 --> 00:33:15,750
<font color="#ffff00">so you can't take that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">away from him.</font>

713
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:17,431
<font color="#00ff00">Third isn't too great in Technical.</font>

714
00:33:17,432 --> 00:33:20,670
<font color="#00ff00">It's getting tougher as we go along,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">but I had a good Signature,</font>

715
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:23,790
<font color="#00ff00">so I'm comfortable going into</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the Showstopper tomorrow.</font>

716
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:24,990
<font color="#00ffff">Glad that's over.</font>

717
00:33:24,991 --> 00:33:27,390
<font color="#00ffff">It's not ideal, but there's</font>
<font color="#00ffff">always tomorrow, isn't there?</font>

718
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:30,750
<font color="#00ffff">Going to have to smash that,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">aren't I?</font>

719
00:33:30,751 --> 00:33:34,641
DUCK QUACKS

720
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:37,639
There's just the showstopper
challenge left before Prue and Paul

721
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,039
decide who is destined
for Star Baker,

722
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,879
and who will miss out on
a place in the final.

723
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,799
Hello, Bakers.
Welcome back to the tent.

724
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,279
It's time for your semifinal
Showstopper Challenge.

725
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,879
<font color="#ffff00">Now, today, Paul and Prue would</font>
<font color="#ffff00">like you each to make a cube cake.</font>

726
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,319
<font color="#ffff00">This should be comprised of at least</font>
<font color="#ffff00">25 mini cube-shaped cakes.</font>

727
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,040
This is all about precision,
so the cubes need to be sharp

728
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,440
and uniform and very neat.

729
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:06,200
We're looking for
an exquisite finish.

730
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:10,040
<font color="#ffff00">Your mini-cakes can be flavoured</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and decorated however you like,</font>

731
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:13,759
<font color="#ffff00">and you can use non-edible supports</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to help stack the layers.</font>

732
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,880
But you will get extra points
if the whole thing is edible.

733
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:21,080
<font color="#ffff00">I'm on a diet, so I'll probably</font>
<font color="#ffff00">just eat the supports!</font>

734
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:24,319
You have four and a half hours,
which seems like a lifetime.

735
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,880
<font color="#ffff00">On your marks...</font>
..get set...

736
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:29,119
<font color="#ffff00">..bake!</font>

737
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,080
<font color="#00ffff">One last challenge</font>
<font color="#00ffff">before the potential final.</font>

738
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:35,480
<font color="#00ff00">Do you know what?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I'm just going to have fun today.</font>

739
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:37,759
<font color="#00ff00">Bake from the heart,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and what will be will be.</font>

740
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,559
This is right up your street.

741
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,680
If you can't pull yourself
into the victory spot today,

742
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:43,879
there's something wrong.

743
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,919
<font color="#00ff00">Let's see what happens.</font>

744
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,280
<font color="#00ffff">We've set the bakers</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a four-and-a-half hour,</font>

745
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:49,759
<font color="#00ffff">gruelling, hot challenge</font>

746
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,720
<font color="#00ffff">and they have to make a cube cake,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">straight edges, flat sides.</font>

747
00:34:53,721 --> 00:34:56,120
<font color="#00ffff">Think Rubik's Cube,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and really, in Patisserie Week,</font>

748
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:57,919
<font color="#00ffff">we are we are looking for that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">precision,</font>

749
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,640
<font color="#00ffff">we are looking for that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">artistic flair,</font>

750
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:01,400
<font color="#00ffff">and obviously their baking skill.</font>

751
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:05,720
<font color="#ffff00">This is a sponge cake,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and sponge has to be, as always,</font>

752
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:08,479
<font color="#ffff00">beautifully flavoured</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and beautifully textured.</font>

753
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,320
<font color="#00ffff">Inside that sponge, we'd</font>
<font color="#00ffff">like to see something like a mousse,</font>

754
00:35:11,321 --> 00:35:13,240
<font color="#00ffff">or a melted chocolate or a ganache.</font>

755
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:15,800
<font color="#00ffff">The four bakers in the tent are</font>
<font color="#00ffff">amateurs. I want to see them</font>

756
00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:18,799
<font color="#00ffff">push themselves now into that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">world of professionalism.</font>

757
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,200
<font color="#ffff00">I think there's going to be a real</font>
<font color="#ffff00">fight to get into the final.</font>

758
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:24,920
<font color="#ffff00">And they need to fight for it.</font>

759
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:26,599
<font color="#ffff00">Hello, Peter.</font><font color="#00ff00">Hello.</font>

760
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,280
<font color="#ffff00">Tell us about your cube cake.</font>

761
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:31,039
<font color="#00ff00">I'm making a chocolate,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">raspberry and pistachio cube cake.</font>

762
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,040
Yes! Favourites! Magic!

763
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:35,839
<font color="#00ff00">So, we've got</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the three different flavours</font>

764
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,279
<font color="#00ff00">running through the entire cake.</font>

765
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,679
<font color="#00ff00">I've got three different sponges,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">three different mousses</font>

766
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,240
<font color="#00ff00">and three different glazes.</font>

767
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:42,840
<font color="#00ffff">Wow, clever!</font>

768
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:45,199
Peter's going big to avoid
going home,

769
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,879
with the tent's most
ambitious cube cake.

770
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,040
Made up of three types of cube,
each will contain a different

771
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,999
combination of chocolate,
raspberry and pistachio sponge,

772
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,439
mousse and mirror glaze.

773
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,839
<font color="#ffff00">Wow, it sounds wonderful.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">It does.</font>

774
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,520
<font color="#ffff00">But that's a lot to do, Peter.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">It's a lot to do.</font>

775
00:35:58,521 --> 00:36:00,920
<font color="#00ff00">So, cracking on.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, good luck.</font><font color="#00ff00">Thank you.</font>

776
00:36:00,921 --> 00:36:03,320
I promise I won't come
and disturb you, at all.

777
00:36:03,321 --> 00:36:04,639
Except you know I will!

778
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,079
PETER LAUGHS

779
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,799
<font color="#00ff00">The strategy for today is to go out</font>
<font color="#00ff00">hard and fast so that,</font>

780
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,319
<font color="#00ff00">by the end, I'll have time</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to get that patisserie precision</font>

781
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,000
<font color="#00ff00">that the judges are going</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to be looking for.</font>

782
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:16,440
<font color="#00ff00">It's gone really well in practice.</font>

783
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:19,160
While Peter's hoping
practice makes perfect,

784
00:36:19,161 --> 00:36:23,599
for one baker, today's showstopper
will be a step into the unknown.

785
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,880
<font color="#00ff00">Right, there's been</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a change of plan.</font>

786
00:36:25,881 --> 00:36:29,959
<font color="#00ff00">When I practised,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">it didn't go quite well.</font>

787
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,000
<font color="#00ff00">So, everything I'm doing today</font>
<font color="#00ff00">is literally...</font><font color="#ffff00">New.</font><font color="#00ff00">..new.</font>

788
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:38,479
<font color="#00ffff">When did you decide to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">change your recipe?</font>

789
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,280
<font color="#00ff00">I wrote it yesterday morning.</font>

790
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,959
<font color="#00ffff">Yesterday?!</font>

791
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,080
Hermine's gambling everything
on a cube cake made up of

792
00:36:45,081 --> 00:36:48,319
two different varieties, both
featuring her favourite flavours,

793
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,599
coffee and praline,
and cherry and chocolate.

794
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,800
<font color="#ffff00">They sound delicious.</font>

795
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:53,599
<font color="#00ff00">If it works, that'll be amazing.</font>

796
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,999
<font color="#ffff00">Very good luck.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Thanks!</font>

797
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,399
Sometimes you have to take risks.
<font color="#00ff00">True!</font>

798
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,440
Fortune favours the bold.

799
00:37:00,441 --> 00:37:03,199
Good luck.<font color="#00ff00">Thank you.</font>

800
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,559
Not only must the bakers'
sponges pack plenty of flavour...

801
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,919
<font color="#00ff00">I always add a bit of coffee</font>
<font color="#00ff00">in my chocolate sponge,</font>

802
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,280
<font color="#00ff00">so it kind of flavours it out.</font>

803
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:14,520
..texture must be spot-on, too.

804
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:17,119
<font color="#00ffff">I'm making my pistachio friand.</font>

805
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,120
<font color="#00ffff">It's going to be like frangipane,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">very soft, very moist.</font>

806
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:23,800
<font color="#00ff00">Always thinking about textures.</font>

807
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:27,000
<font color="#00ff00">They're really important, I think.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">It's not just about flavour.</font>

808
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:31,519
Deliciously delicate, yet able to
hold their shape when layered.

809
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,679
<font color="#00ff00">This is the joconde sponge.</font>

810
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,279
<font color="#00ff00">That's just gone in at 190,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">for 12 minutes.</font>

811
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,440
<font color="#00ff00">Today, I'm going to be making</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a chocolate cube cake.</font>

812
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:44,839
<font color="#00ff00">I love chocolate, so this is just</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to celebrate all things chocolate.</font>

813
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,320
As well as chocolate sponge
and mousse,

814
00:37:47,321 --> 00:37:49,880
Dave's cubes will also contain
either a white,

815
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:51,559
milk or dark chocolate

816
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,359
liquid caramel centre.

817
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,720
But with temperatures in the tent
rising, is Dave risking a meltdown?

818
00:37:57,721 --> 00:37:59,800
It's going to be hot, today.

819
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:01,400
<font color="#00ff00">I know it's going to be hot today,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">yeah.</font>

820
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:04,440
<font color="#00ffff">Try and get most of this done before</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the heat really starts rising, then.</font>

821
00:38:04,441 --> 00:38:06,840
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font><font color="#00ffff">All right, Dave.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Good luck.</font><font color="#00ff00">Cheers.</font>

822
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:08,600
<font color="#00ff00">That's for my praline mousse.</font>

823
00:38:08,601 --> 00:38:10,879
<font color="#00ff00">So, I don't have a clear</font>
<font color="#00ff00">vision at the moment,</font>

824
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,479
<font color="#00ff00">so it's just keep going</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and don't stop.</font>

825
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,280
With so many elements to juggle...

826
00:38:16,281 --> 00:38:18,559
<font color="#00ff00">So, this is for my chocolate</font>
<font color="#00ff00">hazelnut mousse.</font>

827
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,959
..the bakers can't
relax for a second.

828
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,640
<font color="#00ff00">I always listen to my cakes</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and hear them bubble.</font>

829
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:26,520
<font color="#00ff00">If they're bubbling too much,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">they're not done.</font><font color="#00ffff">Ooh!</font>

830
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:28,879
<font color="#00ff00">If they're not bubbling at all,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">they're over-baked.</font>

831
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,759
The smallest lapse
in concentration...

832
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,839
<font color="#00ff00">I've done that wrong.</font>

833
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,520
..could spell disaster.

834
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,799
<font color="#00ff00">I meant to split the cream,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">heat half the cream up,</font>

835
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,040
<font color="#00ff00">whisk half the cream.</font>

836
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:39,679
Haaallo!<font color="#00ff00">Hello, umpire.</font>

837
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,840
That's strong booze you've got
going on there, innit? Whoo!

838
00:38:42,841 --> 00:38:45,439
<font color="#00ff00">This is for Prue.</font>What is it?
<font color="#00ff00">Kirsch.</font>

839
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,719
You might require a little
shot of that on the side

840
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,759
if you really want to blackmail her.

841
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,120
A jug. A jug of kirsch.

842
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,479
<font color="#00ffff">Put a fair bit of kirsch on.</font>

843
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,120
<font color="#00ffff">If you're going to do it,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you've got to do it, haven't you?</font>

844
00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:58,639
<font color="#00ffff">I am doing a Black Forest</font>
<font color="#00ffff">gateau-inspired cube cake.</font>

845
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,159
<font color="#00ffff">I just feel like flavours,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">like the dark chocolate</font>

846
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,559
<font color="#00ffff">and the cherries, they work</font>
<font color="#00ffff">really nicely together.</font>

847
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,040
<font color="#00ffff">This is one of my dad's favourite</font>
<font color="#00ffff">things. This one's for him.</font>

848
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:09,080
Although Laura's cake is made
up of just one type of cube,

849
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:12,199
each contains five layers,
including a biscuit crumb,

850
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,199
chocolate sponge,
two mousses and whole cherries,

851
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,200
all decorated in a dark
chocolate mirror glaze.

852
00:39:18,201 --> 00:39:19,640
<font color="#00ffff">I'm looking forward to this one.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Good!</font>

853
00:39:19,641 --> 00:39:21,400
<font color="#00ffff">One of my favourite cakes.</font>

854
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,440
<font color="#ffff00">And it's sort of important that you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">do it really well, Laura.</font>

855
00:39:24,441 --> 00:39:28,440
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah. It's one of my favourite</font>
<font color="#00ff00">things that I have, like, made.</font>

856
00:39:28,441 --> 00:39:29,720
<font color="#00ff00">I'm really proud of it.</font>

857
00:39:29,721 --> 00:39:31,519
<font color="#ffff00">Good! That's the spirit!</font>

858
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,959
<font color="#00ffff">I can't wait.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">So, I hope you like it.</font>

859
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,279
I already like it!

860
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,600
I haven't even ett it, yet...
<font color="#00ff00">"Ett it"?!</font>

861
00:39:36,601 --> 00:39:39,640
..and I already like it.
<font color="#00ff00">Thank you.</font>

862
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:41,599
<font color="#00ff00">I'm confident with</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the flavours of this one,</font>

863
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,120
<font color="#00ff00">but it's all about the setting time.</font>

864
00:39:44,121 --> 00:39:46,879
<font color="#00ffff">First big concern with the mousse</font>
<font color="#00ffff">is that it doesn't set.</font>

865
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,199
<font color="#00ffff">I'm using gelatine. It's got 2.5</font>
<font color="#00ffff">leaves in each of the mousse... es.</font>

866
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,599
<font color="#00ffff">Moussi? Mice?!</font>

867
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,519
<font color="#00ff00">It's a fairly delicate balance</font>
<font color="#00ff00">with the gelatine,</font>

868
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,760
<font color="#00ff00">because you need it to set,</font>

869
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:57,919
<font color="#00ff00">but if you put too much in,</font>

870
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,279
<font color="#00ff00">then it'll just be rubbery,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and that's not very nice.</font>

871
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,679
<font color="#00ffff">Because I'm not</font>
<font color="#00ffff">really following a recipe,</font>

872
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,919
<font color="#00ffff">I don't even know</font>
<font color="#00ffff">if the quantities are all right.</font>

873
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,800
<font color="#00ffff">Hopefully,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">these whole concoctions will work.</font>

874
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:14,360
Easy on the gelatine. Easy!

875
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:16,399
You know exactly how many to use,
don't you?

876
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,160
I mean,
I eat sheets of it as a snack.

877
00:40:19,161 --> 00:40:21,560
But, just not everyone's like me.

878
00:40:21,561 --> 00:40:23,960
I used to wear boots in
the '70s made out of gelatine.

879
00:40:23,961 --> 00:40:27,480
And, in hot weather,
I'd get shorter.

880
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:29,240
<font color="#00ff00">That's looking good.</font>

881
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:32,479
<font color="#00ff00">Does look nice. Kind of want to eat</font>
<font color="#00ff00">it, just like it is!</font>

882
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,040
<font color="#00ffff">Right, how's this going?</font>

883
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:35,960
<font color="#00ffff">Caramel's a big</font>
<font color="#00ffff">part of the cube cake,</font>

884
00:40:35,961 --> 00:40:37,759
<font color="#00ffff">so it needs to go right today.</font>

885
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,280
<font color="#00ffff">I've still got my biscuit to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">make for the cube cake stand.</font>

886
00:40:40,281 --> 00:40:42,559
<font color="#00ffff">So I'm just going to start</font>
<font color="#00ffff">prepping that.</font>

887
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,159
<font color="#00ff00">This is going to</font>
<font color="#00ff00">be my cherries mousse.</font>

888
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,440
<font color="#00ff00">Hopefully, it sets nicely.</font>

889
00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:52,639
<font color="#00ff00">I feel I'm behind.</font>

890
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,199
<font color="#00ffff">It's crystallised. Just don't know</font>
<font color="#00ffff">what it is with this caramel.</font>

891
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,560
<font color="#00ffff">I've not stirred it or disturbed it,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and it just does that.</font>

892
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:03,919
<font color="#00ffff">Caramel's not my friend</font>
<font color="#00ffff">at the moment.</font>

893
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,200
HE HUFFS

894
00:41:06,201 --> 00:41:08,839
NOEL AND MATT: Bakers,
you are halfway through.

895
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,520
I'm sorry, you say it!

896
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:13,880
Bakers, you are halfway through!
Yeah!

897
00:41:13,881 --> 00:41:15,679
<font color="#00ff00">I've made every single component.</font>

898
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,560
<font color="#00ff00">It's now just assembly.</font>

899
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:22,279
<font color="#00ffff">I'm currently lining the moulds</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with the joconde sponge.</font>

900
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,960
<font color="#00ff00">So, I decided not to make</font>
<font color="#00ff00">cubes in a mould,</font>

901
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:26,040
<font color="#00ff00">because I tried it once at home,</font>

902
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:29,080
<font color="#00ff00">and I just found it an absolute</font>
<font color="#00ff00">nightmare to get them out.</font>

903
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:31,399
<font color="#00ff00">So, I decided to go</font>
<font color="#00ff00">with the cake frame,</font>

904
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,359
<font color="#00ff00">and then I can slice them</font>

905
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,119
<font color="#00ff00">and get them nice and neat</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and square at the sides.</font>

906
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,680
<font color="#00ff00">Let's put them on.</font>

907
00:41:38,681 --> 00:41:41,240
<font color="#00ffff">My chocolate bavarois</font>
<font color="#00ffff">is now going in.</font>

908
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:43,640
<font color="#00ffff">It's just the assembly.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">My stomach's in knots.</font>

909
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:47,640
<font color="#00ffff">Must remember to be neat.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Must remember to be neat!</font>

910
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:52,639
<font color="#00ff00">I'm just balling out a hole in the</font>
<font color="#00ff00">mousse for the caramel to sit in.</font>

911
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,200
<font color="#00ff00">I wanted, like, a gooey centre,</font>

912
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:56,600
<font color="#00ff00">almost have</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a little bit of a chew.</font>

913
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:57,880
<font color="#00ffff">Not cutting the cherries up.</font>

914
00:41:57,881 --> 00:42:00,440
<font color="#00ffff">Probably get marked down for that,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but that's how I like it.</font>

915
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:03,320
It's getting hot again,
isn't it, in the tent?<font color="#00ff00">Yes!</font>

916
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:05,240
Just in the last ten minutes,

917
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:07,519
it started to get a bit watery.

918
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,839
<font color="#00ffff">It's melting!</font>

919
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,359
<font color="#00ff00">Temperature's creeping up on me.</font>

920
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,599
Ooh, what's that?
<font color="#00ff00">Cherry mousse.</font>Ooh!

921
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,960
<font color="#00ff00">There you are.</font>

922
00:42:15,961 --> 00:42:18,799
Are you allowing yourself to
think about being in the final, yet?

923
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,479
<font color="#00ff00">Er, not quite.</font>

924
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,239
<font color="#00ff00">There might not be any final</font>
<font color="#00ff00">if this doesn't go to plan.</font>

925
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,079
Well, there, no,
there would still be a final.

926
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:31,000
<font color="#00ff00">Well not for me, I mean!</font>
Not for you.<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, that's right.</font>

927
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:33,880
Do you want us to cancel
the final if you're not in it?

928
00:42:33,881 --> 00:42:36,920
<font color="#00ff00">Rinky-dink.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Into the freezer we go.</font>

929
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:41,400
<font color="#00ffff">They just need to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">stay in as long as possible.</font>

930
00:42:41,401 --> 00:42:43,759
<font color="#00ff00">Going pretty good.</font>

931
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,040
<font color="#00ff00">Got the raspberry glaze</font>
<font color="#00ff00">chilling down,</font>

932
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:47,640
<font color="#00ff00">the chocolate glaze is on,</font>

933
00:42:47,641 --> 00:42:50,360
<font color="#00ff00">I'm weighing out</font>
<font color="#00ff00">ingredients for the pistachio glaze.</font>

934
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:52,159
<font color="#00ffff">More gelatine!</font>

935
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,400
<font color="#00ffff">This is for my mirror glaze,</font>

936
00:42:53,401 --> 00:42:56,120
<font color="#00ffff">so I think there's 24 sheets</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of gelatine going into that.</font>

937
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:58,680
<font color="#00ffff">Basically, you want to be</font>
<font color="#00ffff">able to see yourself in it.</font>

938
00:42:58,681 --> 00:43:00,440
<font color="#00ffff">Mirror glaze is a bit tricky.</font>

939
00:43:00,441 --> 00:43:04,280
<font color="#00ffff">I'm not looking forward to it.</font>

940
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:07,759
<font color="#00ff00">I'm preparing</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the shapes for my cube cake stand.</font>

941
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,119
<font color="#00ff00">I need to make three platforms,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and then I need to make some cubes.</font>

942
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,560
<font color="#00ff00">I'm a square guy!</font>

943
00:43:13,561 --> 00:43:16,280
<font color="#00ffff">I don't know if this is how</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it's supposed to look,</font>

944
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:20,171
<font color="#00ffff">my mirror glaze.</font>

945
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:22,879
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, it's such a messy business.</font>

946
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,880
<font color="#00ffff">Don't think it's supposed</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to look this gloopy.</font>

947
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:29,119
<font color="#00ff00">Right, that's the raspberry</font>
<font color="#00ff00">mirror glaze complete.</font>

948
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,439
<font color="#00ff00">That just has to cool down.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Let's crack on.</font>

949
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,199
Come on! Just this bake
and then it's the final!

950
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,520
<font color="#00ff00">I know. It's so close!</font>

951
00:43:38,521 --> 00:43:39,800
How's it going, though?

952
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:42,799
<font color="#00ff00">It's going all right so far.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">This bit always goes fine.</font>

953
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,400
<font color="#00ff00">It's just always just the judging!</font>
Just the judging!

954
00:43:45,401 --> 00:43:46,879
THEY LAUGH

955
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,440
<font color="#00ffff">Oh!</font>

956
00:43:48,441 --> 00:43:50,840
<font color="#00ffff">What a nightmare.</font>

957
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:52,639
I know, viewers. Where's Noel?

958
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,039
HIGH-PITCHED:<font color="#ffff00">I'm in 'ere!</font>

959
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,279
Heh!

960
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,839
<font color="#ffff00">Owww!</font>You were there!

961
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,480
<font color="#ffff00">Bakers, you have half an hour left.</font>

962
00:44:03,481 --> 00:44:05,839
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, that's all good.</font>

963
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,080
<font color="#00ff00">It seems set,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">but I don't have time,</font>

964
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:13,279
<font color="#00ff00">so I'm going to keep adding</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the layers.</font>

965
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,280
<font color="#00ffff">I am just going to try and get these</font>
<font color="#00ffff">out, get the mirror glaze on,</font>

966
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:17,720
<font color="#00ffff">job's a good 'un.</font>

967
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:20,120
<font color="#00ff00">I'm getting a bit worried now.</font>

968
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:26,040
<font color="#00ff00">I'm not going to have the cakes,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">because they're not going to set.</font>

969
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:28,639
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, this is going to take longer</font>
<font color="#00ffff">than I thought.</font>

970
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,999
<font color="#00ff00">They don't release very</font>
<font color="#00ff00">well from these, so...</font>

971
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,680
<font color="#00ff00">Unfortunately, I'm going to</font>
<font color="#00ff00">have to butcher them.</font>

972
00:44:34,681 --> 00:44:38,119
<font color="#00ffff">Agh!</font>

973
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,240
<font color="#00ff00">Happy. Looks good.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Looks really, really good.</font>

974
00:44:41,241 --> 00:44:44,479
<font color="#00ffff">Doesn't look quite set inside.</font>

975
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,370
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, it's not going too well, is it?</font>

976
00:44:50,841 --> 00:44:53,880
Until you've seen a man getting
cubes out of a silicon mat,

977
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:55,000
you've not lived.

978
00:44:55,001 --> 00:44:59,000
<font color="#00ff00">Do you know how much</font>
<font color="#00ff00">each silicon mat costs?</font>How much?

979
00:44:59,001 --> 00:45:01,279
<font color="#00ff00">Like, nearly £9.</font>£9?!

980
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,000
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font>Who pays for that, Prue?

981
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:05,400
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, Prue did, yeah.</font>
I've been sponsored by Prue...

982
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:06,919
Have you?<font color="#00ff00">..my whole life, yeah.</font>

983
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,479
I walk her dogs.

984
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,720
I shampoo her hair.

985
00:45:09,721 --> 00:45:12,440
I put her husband's
waistcoats in a neat pile.

986
00:45:12,441 --> 00:45:14,840
Get in the wardrobe
so they don't see me.

987
00:45:14,841 --> 00:45:16,639
Get sucked into Narnia,
which is a nightmare,

988
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,160
because it takes about
three hours to get out.

989
00:45:19,161 --> 00:45:21,560
You have to bargain with
some sort of lion king.

990
00:45:21,561 --> 00:45:23,480
It's a disaster, really.

991
00:45:23,481 --> 00:45:26,520
It's an interesting life,
though. I wouldn't change it.

992
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:30,200
<font color="#00ffff">Race to the finish. As usual.</font>

993
00:45:30,201 --> 00:45:32,479
<font color="#00ff00">Let's glaze these puppies!</font>

994
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,200
<font color="#00ffff">So, there's eight in the milk,</font>

995
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:37,039
<font color="#00ffff">eight in the dark</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and nine in the white.</font>

996
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,760
<font color="#00ffff">I've got to speed up a little bit</font>
<font color="#00ffff">now. There's not a lot of time left.</font>

997
00:45:40,761 --> 00:45:46,040
<font color="#00ff00">This... is just not going to happen.</font>

998
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:48,440
<font color="#00ffff">Please be good, please be good.</font>

999
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:51,199
<font color="#00ff00">Do you know what? They look</font>
<font color="#00ff00">better without it, don't they?</font>

1000
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,599
<font color="#00ff00">Not happy at all with that.</font>

1001
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:58,040
<font color="#00ffff">They look a bit jelly-like,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but I might be able to get them out.</font>

1002
00:45:58,041 --> 00:46:01,931
<font color="#00ff00">This is for the chocolate support.</font>

1003
00:46:03,321 --> 00:46:04,760
<font color="#00ffff">They're looking pretty good.</font>

1004
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,360
<font color="#00ff00">Just not staying on.</font>

1005
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:11,640
<font color="#00ff00">This is going to</font>
<font color="#00ff00">look like a complete mess.</font>

1006
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:15,531
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, my God.</font>

1007
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:23,640
<font color="#00ff00">I think I have a bit too much kirsch</font>
<font color="#00ff00">in. If I can glaze those ones...</font>

1008
00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:25,279
<font color="#00ffff">I honestly don't know</font>
<font color="#00ffff">what's happened.</font>

1009
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,280
<font color="#00ffff">This has not</font>
<font color="#00ffff">gone like this in practice.</font>

1010
00:46:28,281 --> 00:46:29,599
<font color="#00ff00">Oh!</font>

1011
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,879
<font color="#00ffff">What's wrong? Are you OK?</font>

1012
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,439
<font color="#00ff00">I don't even want to carry on.</font>

1013
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,759
<font color="#00ffff">Come on.</font>

1014
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,079
<font color="#00ffff">You can do it.</font>

1015
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,000
<font color="#00ffff">I believe in you.</font>

1016
00:46:39,001 --> 00:46:42,919
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

1017
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,200
SHE HUFFS

1018
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:50,719
MACHINE WHINES

1019
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,280
<font color="#00ff00">I think they're looking good.</font>

1020
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:57,560
<font color="#00ff00">Is it perfection? Probably not</font>
<font color="#00ff00">quite, but it's not far off.</font>

1021
00:46:57,561 --> 00:46:59,839
IN WHISPERS: Just keep going.
It looks good.

1022
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:05,771
It's going to be fine.<font color="#00ff00">OK.</font>

1023
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,160
<font color="#00ff00">Oh!</font>

1024
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:16,159
WHISPERED:<font color="#00ffff">Oh, dear.</font>

1025
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,520
<font color="#00ff00">Can't believe I'm done.</font>

1026
00:47:18,521 --> 00:47:24,370
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1027
00:47:24,601 --> 00:47:26,479
<font color="#00ffff">Sit, sit, sit!</font>

1028
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,479
<font color="#00ffff">Snug as a bug in a rug.</font>

1029
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:37,451
<font color="#00ff00">If the mirror glaze had worked,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I would be so proud of these.</font>

1030
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,199
Bakers, your time is up.

1031
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,079
<font color="#00ffff">So upset.</font>

1032
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:00,011
Please step away from your bakes.

1033
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,679
<font color="#00ffff">Good? Happy?</font>

1034
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,959
<font color="#00ffff">Good, well done.</font>
WHISPERED:<font color="#00ff00">You happy?</font>

1035
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,919
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

1036
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,359
<font color="#00ff00">Absolutely gutted.</font>

1037
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,440
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, that would have looked so good</font>
<font color="#00ff00">if that mirror glaze had worked.</font>

1038
00:48:12,441 --> 00:48:13,880
<font color="#00ffff">How'd it go?</font>

1039
00:48:13,881 --> 00:48:18,559
<font color="#00ff00">Nightmare, like.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">It all went such a disaster.</font>

1040
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:24,491
<font color="#00ffff">I've definitely earned my crown</font>
<font color="#00ffff">as the messiest, messiest baker.</font>

1041
00:48:29,177 --> 00:48:34,216
It's judgment time for the bakers'
show-stopping cube cakes.

1042
00:48:34,217 --> 00:48:40,148
Dave, would you like to bring
up your Showstopper?

1043
00:48:45,737 --> 00:48:47,176
<font color="#00ffff">I think they look great.</font>

1044
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:49,456
<font color="#00ffff">I really do. Neat, tidy, uniform.</font>

1045
00:48:49,457 --> 00:48:51,256
<font color="#00ff00">And the chocolate is holding,</font>

1046
00:48:51,257 --> 00:48:54,497
<font color="#00ff00">which is amazing considering</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the heat.</font><font color="#ffff00">That was a brave choice.</font>

1047
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:56,577
<font color="#00ffff">I like the fact that you've made</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the base as well.</font>

1048
00:48:56,578 --> 00:49:00,097
<font color="#00ffff">So it looks quite neat.</font>

1049
00:49:00,098 --> 00:49:05,947
<font color="#00ff00">Mm.</font><font color="#ffff00">Look at that caramel in the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">middle.</font>

1050
00:49:06,737 --> 00:49:10,216
<font color="#00ffff">Well, personally, I think</font>
<font color="#00ffff">they're a triumph. The caramel is</font>

1051
00:49:10,217 --> 00:49:13,217
<font color="#00ffff">deliciousness, and it's just the</font>
<font color="#00ffff">right melting point so it oozes</font>

1052
00:49:13,218 --> 00:49:16,456
<font color="#00ffff">but it still holds. The mousse</font>
<font color="#00ffff">is perfectly set.</font><font color="#ffff00">And the amount</font>

1053
00:49:16,457 --> 00:49:19,096
<font color="#ffff00">of mousse and filling is quite a</font>
<font color="#ffff00">lot.</font>

1054
00:49:19,097 --> 00:49:22,456
<font color="#ffff00">So when you get a mouthful, it's all</font>
<font color="#ffff00">fudgy.</font><font color="#00ffff">The whole thing together...</font>

1055
00:49:22,457 --> 00:49:23,937
<font color="#ffff00">Very good.</font><font color="#00ff00">Thank you.</font>

1056
00:49:23,938 --> 00:49:26,177
<font color="#00ffff">You've improved</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a lot, actually, David.</font>

1057
00:49:26,178 --> 00:49:27,376
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, I think I have as well.</font>

1058
00:49:27,377 --> 00:49:29,656
<font color="#00ff00">I feel that I've improved myself.</font>

1059
00:49:29,657 --> 00:49:31,457
<font color="#00ffff">Well done.</font><font color="#00ff00">Cheers. Thank you.</font>

1060
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:37,147
Well done.

1061
00:49:44,098 --> 00:49:46,576
<font color="#00ffff">The heat's taken its toll.</font>

1062
00:49:46,577 --> 00:49:49,456
<font color="#ffff00">It's really difficult</font>
<font color="#ffff00">because it's melting, it looks</font>

1063
00:49:49,457 --> 00:49:50,657
<font color="#ffff00">a little bit messy.</font>

1064
00:49:50,658 --> 00:49:53,537
<font color="#00ffff">This is Patisserie Week...</font><font color="#00ff00">I know.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">..so it's got to look good.</font>

1065
00:49:53,538 --> 00:49:57,428
<font color="#00ff00">I'm so disappointed in the look.</font>

1066
00:50:02,537 --> 00:50:04,257
<font color="#ffff00">Mm.</font>

1067
00:50:04,258 --> 00:50:05,896
<font color="#ffff00">Absolutely delicious.</font>

1068
00:50:05,897 --> 00:50:09,057
<font color="#00ffff">I love the flavours going</font>
<font color="#00ffff">through there.</font><font color="#ffff00">And the textures</font>

1069
00:50:09,058 --> 00:50:10,817
<font color="#ffff00">are terrific. The whole cherries,</font>

1070
00:50:10,818 --> 00:50:13,217
<font color="#ffff00">I think that was brave,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">but it's really delicious.</font>

1071
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,496
<font color="#00ffff">Not the best thing you've ever</font>
<font color="#00ffff">made, but the flavours</font>

1072
00:50:15,497 --> 00:50:17,896
<font color="#00ffff">are really good.</font><font color="#ffff00">Mm. Worth all the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">calories.</font>

1073
00:50:17,897 --> 00:50:21,787
<font color="#00ff00">Yay!</font><font color="#00ffff">Thank you.</font>

1074
00:50:21,858 --> 00:50:27,787
<font color="#00ffff">Well done, Laura.</font><font color="#00ff00">Thanks, you too.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Well done, Laura.</font><font color="#00ff00">Thank you.</font>

1075
00:50:34,338 --> 00:50:38,977
<font color="#ffff00">That is so clever, Peter, and so</font>
<font color="#ffff00">complicated.</font><font color="#00ffff">The overall look</font>

1076
00:50:38,978 --> 00:50:41,296
<font color="#00ffff">is quite effective because</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you've got a nice shine</font>

1077
00:50:41,297 --> 00:50:45,187
<font color="#00ffff">on all of them.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">It's set beautifully.</font>

1078
00:50:46,018 --> 00:50:50,017
<font color="#00ffff">The sponge and the mousse are</font>
<font color="#00ffff">gorgeous. Really nice.</font>

1079
00:50:50,018 --> 00:50:52,456
<font color="#00ffff">I just want to see</font>
<font color="#00ffff">what one of the other ones are like.</font>

1080
00:50:52,457 --> 00:50:54,017
<font color="#00ffff">Let's go for the chocolate one.</font>

1081
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:58,497
<font color="#00ff00">It has pistachio and a raspberry</font>
<font color="#00ff00">sponge.</font><font color="#00ffff">Works beautifully.</font>

1082
00:50:58,498 --> 00:51:01,576
<font color="#00ff00">Can I ask that you try the final</font>
<font color="#00ff00">one? It's my favourite.</font>

1083
00:51:01,577 --> 00:51:04,936
<font color="#ffff00">So that's pistachio cake, chocolate</font>
<font color="#ffff00">mousse, raspberry glaze.</font>

1084
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:08,827
<font color="#00ff00">Like a sort of friand cake.</font>

1085
00:51:10,338 --> 00:51:14,536
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, that one quite disappoints me.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, no!</font><font color="#00ffff">I'm only joking!</font>

1086
00:51:14,537 --> 00:51:15,976
<font color="#ffff00">I love them all.</font>

1087
00:51:15,977 --> 00:51:18,856
<font color="#00ff00">I think they're very clever.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Well executed. Thank you.</font>

1088
00:51:18,857 --> 00:51:20,776
Well done.

1089
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:26,708
<font color="#00ff00">Smashed it!</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Well done, Peter.</font>

1090
00:51:31,817 --> 00:51:34,177
<font color="#ffff00">Well, it doesn't look great,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">does it?</font>

1091
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:35,896
<font color="#00ff00">No, not my finest, I'm afraid.</font>

1092
00:51:35,897 --> 00:51:38,536
<font color="#ffff00">The mousse hasn't quite set here.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">And the bottom</font>

1093
00:51:38,537 --> 00:51:41,217
<font color="#00ffff">is collapsing with the weight</font>
<font color="#00ffff">as it's melting as well.</font>

1094
00:51:41,218 --> 00:51:47,107
<font color="#00ffff">But before it melts too much,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">let's have a quick look.</font>

1095
00:51:48,418 --> 00:51:51,856
<font color="#00ffff">That, for me, tastes more like</font>
<font color="#00ffff">raspberry than it does cherry.</font>

1096
00:51:51,857 --> 00:51:54,256
<font color="#00ffff">I think it's the outside with the</font>
<font color="#00ffff">raspberry on it...</font><font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font>

1097
00:51:54,257 --> 00:51:55,457
<font color="#00ffff">..cos I love the flavour.</font>

1098
00:51:55,458 --> 00:52:00,136
<font color="#00ffff">These do feel like panna cotta.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">It's really odd.</font>

1099
00:52:00,137 --> 00:52:02,896
<font color="#ffff00">It's actually quite stodgy</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and bouncy.</font>

1100
00:52:02,897 --> 00:52:05,296
<font color="#00ffff">It's got too much gelatine in,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it's like a rubber ball.</font><font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font>

1101
00:52:05,297 --> 00:52:07,336
<font color="#00ffff">It's a shame.</font>

1102
00:52:07,337 --> 00:52:10,096
<font color="#ffff00">To be honest, I'm really</font>
<font color="#ffff00">disappointed...</font><font color="#00ff00">I am too.</font>

1103
00:52:10,097 --> 00:52:12,737
<font color="#ffff00">..because you were so good</font>
<font color="#ffff00">at patisserie and this is,</font>

1104
00:52:12,738 --> 00:52:18,708
<font color="#ffff00">by your standards, it's a failure.</font>

1105
00:52:21,858 --> 00:52:25,096
<font color="#00ff00">I think it goes without saying,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I'm really disappointed in myself.</font>

1106
00:52:25,097 --> 00:52:28,697
<font color="#00ff00">I haven't had any disastrous bake.</font>

1107
00:52:28,698 --> 00:52:33,376
<font color="#00ff00">This is my first one, it's a shame</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that happened in week nine.</font>

1108
00:52:33,377 --> 00:52:35,737
<font color="#00ff00">If I do make it to the final,</font>

1109
00:52:35,738 --> 00:52:39,257
<font color="#00ff00">it'll mean a lot. But it's really</font>
<font color="#00ff00">50/50.</font>

1110
00:52:39,258 --> 00:52:41,657
<font color="#00ffff">I'm happy. Yeah.</font>

1111
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:42,976
<font color="#00ffff">It's been a really good week.</font>

1112
00:52:42,977 --> 00:52:45,817
<font color="#00ffff">Got my first handshake,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">first in the Technical.</font>

1113
00:52:45,818 --> 00:52:48,136
<font color="#00ffff">I think I've got a really good shot</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for Star Baker.</font>

1114
00:52:48,137 --> 00:52:49,696
<font color="#00ff00">That was phenomenal.</font>

1115
00:52:49,697 --> 00:52:52,537
<font color="#00ff00">I'm so proud that I even</font>
<font color="#00ff00">managed to pull that off.</font>

1116
00:52:52,538 --> 00:52:54,016
<font color="#00ff00">Paul said it was a triumph,</font>

1117
00:52:54,017 --> 00:52:56,537
<font color="#00ff00">and that's going to stick with me</font>
<font color="#00ff00">forever.</font>

1118
00:52:56,538 --> 00:52:59,296
<font color="#00ffff">That went a lot better than</font>
<font color="#00ffff">expected. Prue said it was worth</font>

1119
00:52:59,297 --> 00:53:02,176
<font color="#00ffff">the calories - that's like the</font>
<font color="#00ffff">golden comment you want from Prue.</font>

1120
00:53:02,177 --> 00:53:04,096
<font color="#00ffff">So it's going to be close.</font>

1121
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:07,456
<font color="#00ffff">I'm certain it's between me</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and Hermine going home.</font>

1122
00:53:07,457 --> 00:53:11,347
<font color="#00ffff">Hopefully, it'll be enough.</font>

1123
00:53:14,946 --> 00:53:16,625
Let's start with who has
had a good week.

1124
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,106
<font color="#00ffff">I think the lads have had</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a good week.</font>

1125
00:53:18,107 --> 00:53:20,986
<font color="#00ffff">David and Peter have both</font>
<font color="#00ffff">done very well.</font>

1126
00:53:20,987 --> 00:53:24,065
<font color="#00ffff">David's really come from nowhere.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">He struggled from the off.</font>

1127
00:53:24,066 --> 00:53:26,345
<font color="#00ffff">And then he's come up with that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in the semifinal.</font>

1128
00:53:26,346 --> 00:53:27,546
<font color="#ffff00">Absolutely delicious.</font>

1129
00:53:27,547 --> 00:53:29,946
<font color="#ffff00">And it's such a sophisticated</font>
<font color="#ffff00">thing to do.</font>

1130
00:53:29,947 --> 00:53:32,346
<font color="#ffff00">The other thing that was really</font>
<font color="#ffff00">good was Peter's.</font>

1131
00:53:32,347 --> 00:53:34,865
<font color="#00ffff">I did like the fact that he had all</font>
<font color="#00ffff">these different mousses</font>

1132
00:53:34,866 --> 00:53:37,146
<font color="#00ffff">going in each one,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the flavours were amazing.</font>

1133
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:39,706
<font color="#ffff00">I would like to give Star Baker</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to both those two boys.</font>

1134
00:53:39,707 --> 00:53:42,665
<font color="#ffff00">But what I found so disappointing</font>
<font color="#ffff00">is Hermine,</font>

1135
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:44,346
<font color="#ffff00">this is Patisserie Week,</font>

1136
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:46,625
<font color="#ffff00">it should have been her finest hour,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">really.</font>

1137
00:53:46,626 --> 00:53:48,425
<font color="#00ffff">This is basically a rubber ball.</font>

1138
00:53:48,426 --> 00:53:49,985
<font color="#00ff00">But in her defence,</font>

1139
00:53:49,986 --> 00:53:52,385
<font color="#00ff00">Hermine made two things...</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Laura did one cake.</font>

1140
00:53:52,386 --> 00:53:56,225
<font color="#00ffff">It doesn't look brilliant,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but when you bit into that,</font>

1141
00:53:56,226 --> 00:53:58,145
<font color="#00ffff">that was absolutely delicious.</font>

1142
00:53:58,146 --> 00:54:00,545
<font color="#ffff00">But how many times have</font>
<font color="#ffff00">we said Laura has got to save</font>

1143
00:54:00,546 --> 00:54:03,066
<font color="#ffff00">herself on a show stopper?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Five times.</font>

1144
00:54:03,067 --> 00:54:05,345
Hermine did have a better
technical...

1145
00:54:05,346 --> 00:54:06,586
<font color="#00ffff">This is a tricky one, this.</font>

1146
00:54:06,587 --> 00:54:09,185
<font color="#00ffff">It could go either way.</font>
Really?<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

1147
00:54:09,186 --> 00:54:12,026
<font color="#00ff00">And this is the worst time to go</font>
<font color="#00ff00">out, isn't it?</font><font color="#00ffff">It's heartbreaking.</font>

1148
00:54:12,027 --> 00:54:14,345
<font color="#00ffff">You are just there.</font><font color="#ffff00">It's brutal.</font>

1149
00:54:14,346 --> 00:54:18,236
<font color="#00ffff">But that's the position</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that we are in.</font>

1150
00:54:22,907 --> 00:54:27,665
Well, it's time for me to tell you
who has been Star Baker this week.

1151
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:33,596
There are a couple of candidates,
but this week's Star Baker is...

1152
00:54:35,227 --> 00:54:40,865
..Peter.<font color="#00ff00">Well done, Peter.</font>

1153
00:54:40,866 --> 00:54:44,105
<font color="#00ff00">That leaves me with the horrible</font>
<font color="#00ff00">job of announcing the baker</font>

1154
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:45,786
<font color="#00ff00">who will be leaving us.</font>

1155
00:54:45,787 --> 00:54:48,785
<font color="#00ff00">It's especially hard because</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the person who is leaving us</font>

1156
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,106
<font color="#00ff00">is not going to get to the final,</font>

1157
00:54:50,107 --> 00:54:53,146
<font color="#00ff00">and you've all been</font>
<font color="#00ff00">so fantastic to get this far.</font>

1158
00:54:53,147 --> 00:54:57,037
<font color="#00ff00">But, sadly, there can only be three.</font>

1159
00:54:58,146 --> 00:55:04,077
<font color="#00ff00">So the person who is leaving us...</font>

1160
00:55:11,466 --> 00:55:15,356
<font color="#00ff00">..is Hermine.</font>

1161
00:55:15,707 --> 00:55:18,106
<font color="#00ffff">It's been a pleasure.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">It has been a pleasure.</font>

1162
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:21,185
<font color="#00ffff">I'm a bit disappointed because</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I didn't want to leave.</font>

1163
00:55:21,186 --> 00:55:23,866
<font color="#00ff00">I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.</font>

1164
00:55:23,867 --> 00:55:29,626
<font color="#00ffff">I believe everything has a reason.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">And it was the right time for me.</font>

1165
00:55:29,627 --> 00:55:33,545
<font color="#ffff00">You were so good. And that was just</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a bad day, wasn't it?</font>

1166
00:55:33,546 --> 00:55:38,945
<font color="#00ffff">When I go home and I have time to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">reflect, there will be,</font>

1167
00:55:38,946 --> 00:55:43,505
<font color="#00ffff">you know, a lot of happy memories,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a lot of proud moments...</font>

1168
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,786
You've been an inspiration,
you know?<font color="#00ffff">Aw.</font>

1169
00:55:45,787 --> 00:55:47,386
You really have.<font color="#00ffff">Thank you.</font>

1170
00:55:47,387 --> 00:55:51,546
<font color="#00ffff">I take a lot of good things away</font>
<font color="#00ffff">from this.</font>

1171
00:55:51,547 --> 00:55:54,665
<font color="#00ff00">Well done.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Well done to get Star Baker.</font>

1172
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:56,986
<font color="#00ffff">I've, like, hit</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the Bake Off jackpot this week.</font>

1173
00:55:56,987 --> 00:55:58,385
<font color="#ffff00">You are such a clever lad.</font>

1174
00:55:58,386 --> 00:55:59,706
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you very much, Prue.</font>

1175
00:55:59,707 --> 00:56:02,106
<font color="#00ffff">I think it will take a wee while</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to sink in.</font>

1176
00:56:02,107 --> 00:56:04,145
<font color="#00ffff">It feels a bit surreal.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">This whole thing is surreal.</font>

1177
00:56:04,146 --> 00:56:07,625
<font color="#00ffff">I mean, we are in lockdown</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in a country estate with Prue Leith</font>

1178
00:56:07,626 --> 00:56:09,306
<font color="#00ffff">and Paul Hollywood eating your bakes</font>

1179
00:56:09,307 --> 00:56:13,626
<font color="#00ffff">and Matt Lucas coming round to make</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you laugh with Noel. It's bonkers.</font>

1180
00:56:13,627 --> 00:56:16,186
Congratulations.<font color="#00ff00">Thank you.</font>
You made the final.

1181
00:56:16,187 --> 00:56:21,946
<font color="#00ff00">I, like, genuinely, I can't process</font>
<font color="#00ff00">it all right now. It's mad!</font>

1182
00:56:21,947 --> 00:56:24,826
<font color="#00ff00">Like, I'm in the final of</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the Great British Bake Off.</font>

1183
00:56:24,827 --> 00:56:28,506
<font color="#00ff00">Like the actual final.</font>

1184
00:56:28,507 --> 00:56:31,226
<font color="#00ff00">Like, yeah, it's...</font>

1185
00:56:31,227 --> 00:56:34,906
SHE STUTTERS

1186
00:56:34,907 --> 00:56:37,505
<font color="#00ff00">OK, maybe it's sinking</font>
<font color="#00ff00">in a little bit now.</font>

1187
00:56:37,506 --> 00:56:38,906
<font color="#ffff00">You are flying.</font>

1188
00:56:38,907 --> 00:56:42,426
<font color="#ffff00">Think of that - the final.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I know, yeah.</font>

1189
00:56:42,427 --> 00:56:45,065
<font color="#00ff00">It hasn't sunk in yet.</font>

1190
00:56:45,066 --> 00:56:48,956
<font color="#00ff00">I can't express how happy I am.</font>

1191
00:56:49,986 --> 00:56:53,876
<font color="#00ff00">It's just unreal.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I just can't believe it.</font>

1192
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,506
Next time...

1193
00:56:56,507 --> 00:56:58,865
The judges have said it was
the closest final

1194
00:56:58,866 --> 00:57:01,865
