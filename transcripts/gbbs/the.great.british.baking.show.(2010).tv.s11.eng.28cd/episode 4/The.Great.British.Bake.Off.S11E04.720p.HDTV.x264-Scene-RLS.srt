1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,319
Ooh, I love chocolate.
Are you a chocolate man, Noel?

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,559
No, I'm an actual man.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,999
Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,599
Last time...

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,199
It was Bread Week.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,479
Oh, crumbs.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,800
While Marc proved a worthy
Star Baker...

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,799
..it was Rowan who unravelled...

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,799
It looks just like a bit
of a shambles.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,159
You've gone for all style
and no substance.

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,759
..and became the latest baker to
leave the tent.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,320
I'm glad. I didn't really want
to do Chocolate Week!

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,479
But for the remaining Bakers...
Don't drop, don't drop, don't drop!

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,079
..Chocolate Week has arrived...

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,959
Literally melting in my hands.

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,879
..with a back-to-basics
signature...

17
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,239
Brownies are one of the most
basic things to bake.

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,119
If you can't get that right...
You're getting hammered! Ruthless.

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,479
A return to bread in the
technical...

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,039
What have we got to prove?
Everything.

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,159
Maybe if you stroke it,
it'll get a bit bigger. Might do!

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,879
..and the Show Stopper...

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,199
At the moment,
they're saying it's 25 degrees.

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,599
Not ideal for white chocolate.

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,039
..that gets them
all hot under the collar.

26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,119
Don't forget -
you only have to be not the worst.

27
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,439
What a great mantra that is!

28
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,520
"Just don't be the worst."

29
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,159
Chocolate Week!

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,959
Yeah, it's fun.
Absolute fun, this one.

31
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,039
Massive chocoholic!

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,719
A day without chocolate
is a day wasted, in my opinion.

33
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,199
Chocolate releases endorphins,

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,039
but that tent does not always
release endorphins!

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,079
I think it is quite a stressful
place, so um...

36
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,479
Maybe if I have some chocolate
halfway through my bake,

37
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,200
I'll feel a bit better!

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,879
Hello, Bakers.
Welcome to the tent.

39
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,759
It is Chocolate Week and it's time
for your signature challenge. OK...

40
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,399
Their names are Paul
and Prue.

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,279
Yeah, I know. You say that, but you
always get them wrong. No, I don't!

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,600
All right. Paul and Prue. I know!

43
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,959
Praul and Pue would like you
each to make a batch of

44
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,719
18 chocolate brownies. You may use
any type of chocolate you like.

45
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,039
You can use as many additional
flavours as you like,

46
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,319
but we will be looking for that
nice fudgy texture.

47
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,639
And when I say we, I mean...

48
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,879
Plaul and Plue.
You have one hour and 30 minutes.

49
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,839
On your marks... Get set...

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,960
Bake!

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,879
Brownies may be famously
simple to make...

52
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,799
Put anything in a brownie that you
like. As long as you don't

53
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,199
overcook it and keep the middle of
nice and gooey.

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,039
But the Bakers have just 90 minutes
to produce the perfect batch.

55
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,039
It's the timing that I'm really
worried about.

56
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,959
We're all up against it.

57
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,079
To get them cooked, cooled and ready
in an hour and a half

58
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,399
is going to be tough.

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,999
The perfect chocolate brownie
has a gooey centre

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,399
and it has a crackly crisp top.
And that's it!

61
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,839
The bake on the brownie is
the most critical thing.

62
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,239
If you over-bake it, it will become
very, very dry and cake-like.

63
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,079
Although the Bakers can, of course,
decorate their brownies,

64
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,839
all icings are very sweet and extra
chocolate is more sweetness,

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,599
so I think they should try not to
over-decorate the top.

66
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,039
This, for me, is going
back to basics.

67
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,679
If you can't produce a decent
chocolate brownie...

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
..there's going to be problems.

69
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,079
Hello, Linda. Good morning!
Linda, tell us about your brownies.

70
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,519
These are my Christmas brownies,
they remind me of when I was a kid

71
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,239
and we used to have all the
nuts and Turkish delights

72
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,759
and dates that were a real treat.

73
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,719
Linda's treats of Christmas
past will be studded into a layer

74
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,599
of white chocolate on top
of her date-filled brownie.

75
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,359
What texture are we looking for when
we cut into it? Nice and gooey.

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,999
Gooey? Nice and gooey. Good luck,
thank you. Thank you very much.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,079
Good luck. Thank you. I might just
stay here... OK.

78
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,359
..and wait till they're ready and
then eat them. Keep stirring that...

79
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,239
If you are going to... Do you want
me to? ..be useful. Oh, OK.

80
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,039
So, I'm making a rich chocolate
brownie with roasted macadamia.

81
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,519
Surprisingly, I hadn't made brownies
until a few years ago.

82
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,519
I wouldn't say
they're my favourite cake.

83
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,999
Perfecting the recipe for his
praline buttercream brownies,

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,319
has given Marc sleepless nights.

85
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,519
I'm tired! Really tired this
morning. Are you? I'm quite tired.

86
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,679
I woke up in the middle of the
night, I was sleep-walking and
driving around...

87
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,119
As a vampire, though, that's what
you're meant to do, isn't it? Get up
at night... I call it sleepwalking.

88
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,479
You call it... other people call
it... Being a vampire!

89
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,999
Taking people into the bushes
and sucking all their blood out.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,999
I mean, people like to split hairs.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,439
The Bakers' quest for the
perfect gooey centre starts

92
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,079
with their brownie mix.

93
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,839
I think it's all about the
ratios in your recipe.

94
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,279
So, how much fat you've got,
how much flour you've got.

95
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,199
If you add too much flour, you're
going to start getting a cake.

96
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,559
So, getting their calculations
right...

97
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,999
Little bit too much sugar.
..is crucial.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,599
I like your purple calculator!
It's good, isn't it?

99
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,039
I haven't seen calculators for a
while because I have a calculator
app on my phone.

100
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,479
Yeah, unfortunately, we are not
allowed are phones in here.

101
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,839
Are you not? No. Why? Because
you'd be ringing going,

102
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,799
"Mum, can you come and get me?
I don't like it here.

103
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,479
"They make me bake all day
and then, I bake all day,

104
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,879
"a horrible man with a beard
comes along and says it isn't good."

105
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,319
But this bake should be
child's play for Dave,

106
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,519
as it is inspired by his favourite
childhood sweets,

107
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,439
which will sit on top of his rich
ganache-topped brownies.

108
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,159
They'd better take my last cos they
won't be able to eat any more after
they've had mine.

109
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,999
Hoping for a slightly
healthier brownie...

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,639
These are some good looking figs.
..is Peter.

111
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,439
Peter, that looks amazing.

112
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,839
So, I am making fig
and pistachio upside-down brownies.

113
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,599
So, I've got a layer of figs
underneath and that's going to

114
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,119
be flipped out and become the top
and I've got some cinnamon

115
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,199
going into the brownie batter.
It just tastes really good

116
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,999
alongside the chocolate.
It's very untraditional...

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,400
It's certainly unusual. It's risky.

118
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,239
Peter's hoping for a riot of
texture and flavour with his unusual
fig-topped brownies.

119
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,879
What did Paul say when you said
"figs"? Did he go...

120
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,479
.. "Oo-o-o-oh!"?

121
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,599
Or did he just stare through you
with his cold blue eyes?

122
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,959
When I said most things,
he just did that, yeah.

123
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,599
You must have made brownies, right?
Everyone's made brownies.

124
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,119
Everyone's made brownies, surely.
Have you made brownies?
I've made brownies...

125
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,519
I haven't made brownies.
No, I have... never baked.

126
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,919
You've never baked?
Like... ever? Never ever? Never.

127
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,239
Baking's for losers!

128
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,679
This is good inside knowledge.

129
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,519
I make brownies of the time at home.
My husband does really like
brownies.

130
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,599
But, you know, it's Paul Hollywood
and Prue Leith judging it

131
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,559
and not my husband.
He will eat anything!

132
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,519
Her husband might not be
fussy, but Sura is hoping

133
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,999
to win over the judges today with
her ruby and dark chocolate marble
brownies.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,799
It could be great...
Or it could be...

135
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,839
We'll see what kind of disaster
this turns out to be.

136
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,119
Right, so, I'm going in.

137
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,959
170 for 20 minutes.

138
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,559
Getting their brownies baked

139
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,599
and cooled as quickly as possible is
crucial, if the Bakers are to

140
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,360
leave themselves enough time to cut
and decorate...

141
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,839
That goes in at 180 for
about 25 minutes.

142
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,719
..but Lottie's going to have to
run the oven gauntlet twice.

143
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,679
They're going to go for 25
minutes to start with and then,

144
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,479
another 25 minutes once
they've got the toppings on.

145
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,839
Lottie's ambitious
double-baked brownies will have

146
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,679
a chocolate and pecan base and baked
raspberry cheesecake topping.

147
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,919
I have given myself a hellish pile
of work to do. I think I can

148
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,199
get it done. Obviously, what will
suffer is my decoration,

149
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,399
but that's always the case with me.
As long as it tastes all right,
I'm happy.

150
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,079
Hermine, good morning. Morning!

151
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,879
Hermine, tell us
about your brownies.

152
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,919
So, I'm making raspberry, white
chocolate and pistachio... Wow.

153
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,599
..brownie. How long are you going to
cook them for?

154
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,919
Ten minutes on one side, get it out,

155
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,479
and then ten
minutes on the other side.

156
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,839
How do you mean,
"ten minutes on the other side"?

157
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,239
Turn around. Of the tray?
Yeah, it's a tray.

158
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,679
The only problem is, when you do
that, you drop the temperature
of the oven.

159
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,320
Well, isn't that a good
thing for a brownie? Is it?

160
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,719
Hermine is also adding coffee
to elevate the chocolate flavour

161
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,119
of her brownie, which she's hoping
she can bake to perfection.

162
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,519
If the baker says, "You're not
supposed to turn it around",

163
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,079
maybe I'm not supposed to
turn it around.

164
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,079
So, we're not going to turn
it around!

165
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,839
Bakers, you are halfway through!

166
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,519
That was nice.

167
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,919
45 minutes...

168
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,879
Now I'm going to
make my Italian meringue.

169
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,599
The Bakers' choice of
toppings...

170
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,279
Going to blitz the hazelnuts...

171
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,759
..should enhance
the flavour of their brownies...

172
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,559
On the top of the brownies is going
to be tiny little cubed

173
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,919
Turkish delight and chopped nuts.

174
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,239
..without adding too much sweetness.

175
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,599
On top of my brownies is going to be
a milk chocolate ganache

176
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,879
with honeycomb.
Yeah, they are a bit sweet.

177
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,239
This is my cheesecake layer.

178
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,359
This goes back in the oven for
25 minutes or as long as I can
spare, really.

179
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,279
So, I am making the Italian
meringue buttercream...

180
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,759
There's a few Italian meringues
I know in the tent today.

181
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,560
It's like a sweet overload,
but so worth it.

182
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,679
It's like Donald Trump's hair,
isn't it?

183
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,479
That's how you know
your meringue is done.

184
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,120
You've got a Trump on your whisk!

185
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,759
Mark's Italian meringue-topped
brownies will sit on a cookie base

186
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,039
in his take on his
favourite camping treat.

187
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,599
A smore is usually something you
have with marshmallows

188
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,359
and biscuits, sort of,
over by a campfire,

189
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,239
so I thought I'd convert
that into a brownie.

190
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,999
Also hoping to score brownie
points with her smores-inspired bake

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,879
is Laura. Smores is quite an
American term,

192
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,799
but it basically means
melted marshmallow, I think.

193
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,479
But I'm doing a posh version with
Italian meringue.

194
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,479
Laura's Italian meringue will
be piped on top of her decadent

195
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,799
chocolate and hazelnut brownies,

196
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,159
before being drizzled with a
rich salted caramel sauce.

197
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,919
The brownies are so,
so sweet that I'm hoping the salt

198
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,279
and the caramel will just... cut
through that

199
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,199
and then, you get that really
nice balance.

200
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,199
So, these are going
back in for another 25 minutes.

201
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,079
With Lottie just halfway
through her bake time...

202
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,079
I'm praying to the brownie gods.
Er... the others...

203
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,519
Brownie, cook! Brownie, cook!

204
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,999
..now face a game of nerves...

205
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,719
It's never failed me
to leave them in for 33 minutes.

206
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,039
It still stays all nice and fudgy.

207
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,559
..as they must judge when their
brownies are perfectly underbaked.

208
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,840
Ooh, yeah,
they still need a bit longer.

209
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,199
Oh, come on!

210
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,119
Get them out too soon
and they could fall apart.

211
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,919
That's good, we've got a nice
crack... on top.

212
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,719
Leave them in too long...

213
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,599
Just going to give them a couple of
minutes, that's all. Just a couple.

214
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,599
..and they risk losing
the fudgy centre.

215
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,999
Oh, they're still a bit...
Oh, gosh...

216
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,680
Got to give it another five minutes,
that's not good!

217
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,200
They're completely raw.

218
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,559
Got to get these in the freezer,

219
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,280
I just need it to cool quickly.

220
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,359
I think I'm going to take mine
out now.

221
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,319
I'm going to get it out, I think.

222
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,319
Cos I really don't want
to overdo it.

223
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,600
I do really want a nice,
fudgy middle.

224
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,279
That looks good to me!

225
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,599
Let's just hope they cool in time.

226
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,880
Into the fridge -
we've not got long.

227
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,319
They're still a little bit
raw in the middle.

228
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,080
The thicker they are,
the longer they take to cook, so...

229
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,240
My fault, really.

230
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,999
Gr-r-r!

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,279
Yours in the oven?

232
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,959
Yeah, mate, I've got another 15
minutes before they can come out.

233
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,319
It's not going to be pretty,
the end of this.

234
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,680
Bakers, you have... insert number
of minutes here... minutes remaining.

235
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,680
You've actually got half
an hour left.

236
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,399
That's not enough time.

237
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,999
What are you doing?
I'm still baking. Still in the oven?

238
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,280
Yeah. What? Mm-hm...

239
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,999
If you need any more time,
I do do the time calls,

240
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,999
so I could cheat for us.

241
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,359
OK? You know you're my favourite.
Don't tell the others.

242
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,600
I'm just going to take them out.

243
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,479
Bakers,
you have 15 minutes remaining.

244
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,959
Yeah,
what you going to do about it?!

245
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,840
Probably carry on baking
and try your hardest.

246
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,880
That's very hot. I'm going
to defrost the freezer!

247
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,239
Don't drop, don't drop, don't drop!

248
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,719
Ideally, it'd be nice to leave them

249
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,439
a little bit longer before I cut
them, but time's of the essence now.

250
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,799
When I've not this is practice
and it hasn't gone right,

251
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,959
it's just went...

252
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,239
..splurge out the side.

253
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,799
Only now will the Bakers find
out if they've judged

254
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,639
their bake times correctly.

255
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,639
Oh, thank God for that.

256
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,239
That is perfect inside.

257
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,920
Very happy with that bake.

258
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,319
A bit raw.

259
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,359
Unfortunately, Paul's going to say,
probably, now that

260
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,919
they're not quite right.
Let's see how raw it is, shall we?

261
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,279
On a scale of one to raw...
Do you think it's still raw?

262
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,719
Oh, yeah,
I'm fairly confident it's raw, yeah.

263
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,599
Have you got time to put
it in the freezer?

264
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,199
I did put it in the freezer... Oh.

265
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,919
..and then the freezer melted on it
because it was so hot and then,

266
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,000
now, this is all just wet freezer
juice that... dripped onto it.

267
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,119
"Wet freezer juice"?!

268
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,919
Yeah. So, what have you...?

269
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,519
"What's your topping again, Lottie?
"It's wet freezer juice

270
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,039
"and then, also, I dipped it in bin
juice because I wasn't..."

271
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,399
Yeah, just for good measure.
"..wasn't pleased."

272
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,720
So, tuck in, Blue Eyes,
see how that grabs you!

273
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,319
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

274
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,600
You can do this, Bakers.

275
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,879
Oh, the stress.
Oh, the stress is too much.

276
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,720
Just piping on the Italian meringue.

277
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,400
I think these are looking darn,
rootin'-tootin' good!

278
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Mine are a mess.

279
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,359
Just going to pop
some of this over there...

280
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,320
They look a treat.
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

281
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,760
So, I'm just thinking if I can split
one tin into 18 brownies...

282
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,760
Oh, what a hot mess.

283
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,159
No, I'm not going
to try.

284
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,439
I'm happy with that!
God, to the wire...

285
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,479
Bakers, your time is up.

286
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,279
Please put your bakes
at the end of your bench.

287
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,119
Oh, that was horrific. Mine are raw.
They're not cooked. Look at them.

288
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,400
Well, at least they're gooey!

289
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,880
Looks like an actual car crash.

290
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:23,295
sponsor The Great British
Bake Off.

291
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,319
The nine batches
of chocolate brownies

292
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,639
now face the scrutiny
of Paul and Prue.

293
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,400
Hello, Peter. Hi, Peter.

294
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,319
They look quite attractive
on the top.

295
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,720
They really look lovely.

296
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,079
It's got the chewiness, but it's
coming from the dates, isn't it?

297
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,039
Mm. What spices
did you put in there?

298
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,279
There's cinnamon in there.

299
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,199
Mm. I think there's
too much cinnamon.

300
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,599
Because, actually, the cinnamon
is overtaking the chocolate.

301
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,080
It's different, it's risky.

302
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,399
It's OK.

303
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,879
That is brutal.

304
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,479
Thank you. OK, thank you.

305
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,599
It's OK. It's a bit disappointing.

306
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,959
Oh, dear God, here we go.

307
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,599
Good luck, honey.

308
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
You'll be great.

309
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,479
Mm. It looks as if they came
out of the oven too early.

310
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,639
Yeah, it does look a mess.

311
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,639
Let's have a look, shall we?

312
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,959
I really think
that's too much Italian meringue.

313
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,599
OK.

314
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,039
It's too sweet.

315
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,719
Really? Far too sweet. OK.

316
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,039
Cos you've got caramel,
you've got the meringue on the top,

317
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,079
you've got the chocolate,
you're going, "Mm, enough now."

318
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,040
It's under baked. Mm. So,
you've got a few problems here.

319
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,199
We need to get them out
of there, don't we? Yeah.

320
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,999
Initially I had
two trays of brownies,

321
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,279
and one of them actually
fell inside the oven.

322
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,560
So, I've just presented one.

323
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,919
Very tough. Mm.

324
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,719
I don't like the flavours either.

325
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,959
I do! What is it?

326
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,719
Dark chocolate and ruby chocolate.

327
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,279
Because I'm getting
a sort of citrusy kick,

328
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,599
but I think that must be
the ruby chocolate. Yeah.

329
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Mm. But...

330
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:14,639
..the bake's not right. Mm-hm.

331
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,959
And, obviously,
you haven't got enough. Yeah.

332
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,240
Not your best work. No.

333
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,239
We're getting hammered.

334
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,440
Ruthless.

335
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,319
OK, well, they look neat.

336
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,839
And they look pretty identical.

337
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,559
So, I've got a cookie base,
with a dark chocolate brownie,

338
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,320
with Italian meringue
and some sugared cranberries.

339
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,359
It tastes like a brownie.

340
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,879
I'm slightly avoiding the top

341
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,719
because I know
that'll be very sweet.

342
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,439
But, overall, I think
it's a really good job.

343
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,119
Thank you.

344
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,079
The biscuit base is too thick.

345
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,959
I like your flavour.

346
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,679
I just think your textures
were wrong.

347
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,080
OK, thank you.

348
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,560
They're a little bit messy.

349
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,079
I like the raspberry acidity.

350
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,999
But the white chocolate
is just too much.

351
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,319
There's a lot going on in that.

352
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,639
You've got coffee, you've got
chocolate, you've got raspberry,

353
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,759
you've got pistachio...

354
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,440
You've got a hell of a lot of sugar.

355
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,759
It's very spongelike
rather than brownie-like. See?

356
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,079
Looks like a chocolate sponge.

357
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,359
I like the flavour, though.

358
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,999
It's unusual, it's nice. It just
came down to the bake itself.

359
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,680
OK, thank you. Thank you.

360
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,960
They're all pretty even. Yeah.

361
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,159
It's over baked.
It's more like a sponge

362
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,519
than a brownie.

363
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,399
Tastes great!
I like the flavour. Yeah.

364
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,039
But it lacks the two things
that I think make a brownie,

365
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,199
that is the gooey middle
and the crackly top.

366
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,959
Yeah. You made a good tray bake.

367
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,280
Thank you.

368
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,079
They don't look good at all. No.

369
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,839
Yeah, I was running out
of time, basically,

370
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,159
so it was a rush at the end of it.
So, I apologise for that.

371
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,479
It's quite dry. OK.

372
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,839
If you go right to the middle,
it's nice and squidgy. OK.

373
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,399
Actually, I think the flavour's OK.

374
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,799
But it does look a mess.
It does, I know, I'm ashamed of it.

375
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,599
That's a problem for me
because... Yeah.

376
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,919
..brownies are one of the
most basic things to bake.

377
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,280
If you can't get that right...

378
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,359
What are they going to say to me,

379
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,679
if that's what
they're saying to Marc?

380
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,080
I'm going to get roasted.

381
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,519
Well, they don't look great,
do they? They look a right mess.

382
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,400
It looks like
they've been dropped. Yeah.

383
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,919
Have you got a straw?

384
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,360
Not on me. Would you like a spoon?

385
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,839
Mm.

386
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,519
I love the sharpness
of the raspberries.

387
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,159
But there's too much
cheesecake mixture.

388
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,639
Sort of overpowers it.

389
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,319
Flavour's OK.

390
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,679
Textures are all wrong. Yeah.
The look of it's terrible.

391
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,319
Yeah. But besides that, brilliant.
Nailed it. Yeah. Thanks, guys.

392
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,119
If any of us had just presented
like a standard chocolate brownie,

393
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,919
I think we'd be away,
but none of us have,

394
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,279
we've all tried to make it harder
than it needed to be.

395
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,439
Oh, God.

396
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,799
We've all done a botched job
of our brownies.

397
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,039
That was brutal.

398
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,999
I mean, brownies, what are people
watching this going to think of us?

399
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,599
Like, we're meant to be the best
amateur bakers in the country

400
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,760
and cannot make brownies
to please Paul and Prue?

401
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,919
The bakers could practise
their brownies,

402
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,360
but their next challenge, shrouded
in gingham, is a complete mystery.

403
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,759
Hello, bakers.

404
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,519
Welcome back to the tent. It's time
for your Technical Challenge.

405
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,519
Today, it's been set for you
by Paul.

406
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,519
Paul, any words of advice?

407
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,399
The brownie challenge
was easy, this isn't.

408
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,479
Concentrate on your textures.

409
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,119
OK, as ever,
this Technical Challenge

410
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,319
will be judged blind,

411
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,719
so we're going to have to ask
these two to leave the tent and...

412
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,479
..have their eyes temporarily
removed by Belgian robots.

413
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,080
Have they gone? Not yet.

414
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,319
Can you go, please?

415
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,679
Prue's lurking about
at the entrance.

416
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,839
OK, Judge Paul Hollywood
would like you each

417
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,719
to make a chocolate babka,

418
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,439
which is a traditional
Jewish loaf cake.

419
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,839
Your babka must consist
of an enriched dough

420
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,399
with layers of nuts and chocolate.

421
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,239
And it needs to be rolled, split and
then twisted to create the shape.

422
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,959
Once baked, it should be brushed
with syrup to finish.

423
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,879
You have two and half hours.

424
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,840
On your marks. Get set.

425
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,800
Bake.

426
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,479
Babka, here we come!

427
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,079
Never heard of one.

428
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,599
If brownies are meant to be simple,
then we've got no chance in this.

429
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,719
None of us have.

430
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,039
I don't know what it is.
I've never made one.

431
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,560
I wish I knew what it looked like.

432
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,719
So, Paul, why have you chosen
this babka?

433
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,199
Basically, it's an enriched dough
with a chocolate filling.

434
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,679
You roll it out into a rectangle,

435
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,399
roll it up as if you were making
a Chelsea bun.

436
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,159
Mm-hm. Cut that in half, and
it's a case of a spiral twist.

437
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,839
It's a plait, basically.
But you can't make it too long.

438
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,199
If you make it too long,
it'll never fit in the tin.

439
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,959
Not easy, rather typical
of Paul Hollywood.

440
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,320
Shall we have a look inside?

441
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,039
And there it is. You've got
that crisp on the outside

442
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,319
and then that beautiful soft inside,

443
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,960
with this gorgeous chocolate mixture
with the hazelnuts in it.

444
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,159
It's lovely. It's much lighter
than I thought it would be.

445
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,359
Mm. I've had it in New York,
and it's not nearly as nice as this.

446
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
I had it in Birkenhead.

447
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,999
I'm reading and reading
these instructions today

448
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,639
to make sure I'm not
messing anything up.

449
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,999
Make the dough.

450
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,119
Nothing else.

451
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,479
No further instruction.
Thanks, Paul.

452
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,839
I haven't made enriched that often.
So just have to wing it, won't I?

453
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,679
Enriched dough,
it's got butter and milk in it,

454
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,639
and you mix it up with the eggs.
Whereas a general dough,

455
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,280
I mean, it's just flour,
yeast and water.

456
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,439
That's the sound of enriched dough
slopping about.

457
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,119
You should be able to stretch it
without the dough splitting.

458
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,639
Then you'll know that it's ready.

459
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,959
I am happy with the dough.
It's really nice and stretchy.

460
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,319
Mate, this dough, now, is too wet.

461
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,600
There's no windowpane
coming out of that.

462
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,959
The dough's really nice,
actually. It's quite sticky.

463
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,640
Roll out the dough into a rectangle,
measuring 40cm x 30cm.

464
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,719
30 would be, like, out there.

465
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,559
Here we are again, trying to make
rectangles out of circles.

466
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,919
OK, spread the cool
chocolate mixture over the dough,

467
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,399
leaving a 1cm border
around the edges.

468
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,279
I'm just trying to go for
a nice, even layer... ish.

469
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,479
You're just doing that in such
a liberal, sort of, free way.

470
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,399
Do you think?
You're quite free, aren't you?

471
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,159
How free are you?

472
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,399
How free are any of us?

473
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,799
No, well, exactly. What's the
freest thing you've ever done?

474
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,159
Um... Have you ever got naked
in a public space?

475
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,759
I haven't, no!

476
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,639
Do you want to do it now?
Me and you could do it now.

477
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,039
In the Bake Off tent. Could make
Bake Off history. We could!

478
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,319
We could streak in the tent.

479
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,599
Scatter the hazelnuts over the top.

480
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,359
Roll the dough into a tight roll.

481
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,159
Pbbt! Lol...

482
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,759
It's all about the shaping
of the babka.

483
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,079
I'm trying to remember
what exactly it looks like,

484
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,319
in terms of the twists in it.

485
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,839
Crucial moment.

486
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,319
"Cut through the
middle of the dough,

487
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,159
"cutting it into two long pieces.

488
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,279
"Then lift the right half
over the left half.

489
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,799
"Fold by the left half
over the right half,

490
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,239
"repeating the process
to make a two-stranded plait."

491
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,559
That guy over that guy. Yup.

492
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,279
And then that one over
there. And then seal.

493
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,959
That can't be right.

494
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,760
Ha! That looks ridiculous.

495
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,520
What now?

496
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,839
"Carefully lift into the tin."

497
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,120
Absolute jokers.

498
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,760
Mine is a bit too long.

499
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,199
This is not 40 cm.

500
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,160
Going to go like this.

501
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,559
This is all extra, it's too long.

502
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,999
I'm loving your work.

503
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,279
Oh, yeah!

504
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,520
Come on, high five. There you go.

505
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,279
From there...

506
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,959
Let me see, prove until
doubled in size. OK.

507
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,519
What have you got to prove?

508
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,560
Everything, everything
to Paul Hollywood.

509
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,759
Well, that can't be right.

510
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,320
Why doesn't mine fit?

511
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,520
Maybe it will, like, lift in the
middle or something and take shape.

512
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,319
Don't really know how long
I need to prove it for.

513
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,119
Half an hour, let's check it.

514
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,479
I'm going to just set a timer
for ten minutes.

515
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,760
All right, let's just
get it in, I think.

516
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,480
I don't know what you're supposed
to do, but you be good to me.

517
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,279
Yeah, OK, I let them know.

518
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,559
Bakers, you're halfway through.

519
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,199
Through. Yeah, they know now.

520
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,839
There's a lot of waiting
around on proving things.

521
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,599
Slightly unnerving.

522
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,400
To rise or not to rise.
That is the question. Yes.

523
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,919
# Carefully lift
the loaf into the tin. #

524
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,279
Mine wasn't carefully lifted.

525
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,479
# Prove until it
becomes double in size. #

526
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,799
Good luck with that.
# Bake!

527
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,240
# Make the syrup,
brush the babka with the syrup! #

528
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,679
That seems fairly straightforward.

529
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,079
Well, it's got a little bit bigger.
It's got a bit bigger, hasn't it?

530
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,919
Yes. Not as big as I would like it.

531
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,480
Maybe if you stroke it, it'll
get a bit bigger. It might do.

532
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,079
Generally works.

533
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,879
I think mine is ready
to go in the oven.

534
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,879
I still wouldn't say it's doubled.
I think it's like one and one half.

535
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,239
With the time that's left, it's
going to be possible, shall we say.

536
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,119
I'm hoping.

537
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,599
Right, so it's not doubled in size.

538
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,800
That's the shape that mine's going
to be, and that's the end of it.

539
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,840
Off we go.

540
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,519
Just trying to work out how long
it's going to take to bake it.

541
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,880
So, I'm just going to do
25 minutes for now.

542
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,039
Oh, I don't know about that.
Maybe I should tuck the ends under.

543
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,280
It's all in the bake.

544
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,959
It's the waiting that's the worst.

545
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,000
Just waiting, waiting and hoping.

546
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,519
How's it going?

547
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,879
It's really brown on the ends,
because the ends are the bits that

548
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,399
I left out, when clearly,
I was supposed to tuck those in.

549
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,679
Can you cut the ends off?

550
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,119
Well, I was tempted,
I was tempted, but then he'll see.

551
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,479
Do you know what I mean?
He'll see that I then carved it.

552
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,839
You should say to him,
if he goes on, you know. Yeah.

553
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,679
"It's a bit burnt at
the end, like." Yeah.

554
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,879
"It's a bit burnt at the end, like,
you know, it's a bit over baked."

555
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,199
Yeah. If he does that, should go,

556
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,599
"Well I've never
even seen one before.

557
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,359
"I didn't even know
what one was." Yeah.

558
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,479
Just like that.

559
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,199
"Yeah, I didn't even
know what one was." Yeah.

560
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,879
"Don't put it on me,
it's on you!" Yeah.

561
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,799
I think that's what you should do.
Yeah. Winner-winner.

562
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,919
Follow my advice.

563
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,200
I shall.

564
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,919
Bakers, you have five minutes left!

565
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,120
Coming out.

566
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,519
Ready, steady...

567
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,839
..babka!

568
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,279
We've got ourselves a babka.

569
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,759
I'm happy with that. It's got a
nice little zigzag design in it.

570
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,239
Well, I quite like it, actually.
Yes, it doesn't look too bad at all.

571
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,640
There's no rise on that.

572
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,519
Really not convinced
that that's cooked.

573
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,760
And I put all that messy
chocolate stuff all down the side.

574
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,679
Oh, well.

575
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,959
Going to spread some syrup.

576
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,840
A bit of syrup to glaze it.

577
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,799
Seamless.

578
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,279
Bakers, your time is up.

579
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,679
Please bring your chocolate babkas
to the front of the tent

580
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,359
and place them
behind your photographs.

581
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,600
Mine looks like a Viking longboat.

582
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,079
Oh, my God, embarrassment.

583
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,519
Paul and Prue are looking
for a beautifully risen babka

584
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,959
with a gorgeous chocolate spiral
all the way through,

585
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,000
crispy on the outside
and soft on the inside.

586
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,359
Right.

587
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,439
Now, looking at this,
it looks good, it's small,

588
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,399
but you can see the lines
all the way through it.

589
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,960
Let's have a look inside.

590
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,400
That swirl is good.

591
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,279
Mm.

592
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,639
Even though it hasn't risen
as much, it's very tender. Mm.

593
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,919
It's got a nice bake on it,

594
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,639
and the combination of the
chocolate to the dough is good.

595
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,199
Moving onto number two,
a few issues.

596
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,879
Sunk in the middle.

597
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,160
Yeah, not the best-looking babka
I've seen.

598
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,279
It's not over baked, though.
No. The flavour's OK.

599
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,439
It's the way it's twisted,

600
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,079
and the way the chocolate's
been put into it,

601
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,439
that's created that drop
in the middle.

602
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,039
Moving on to this one.
This is a nice one, this.

603
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,759
This looks like a model babka.

604
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,999
Colour's good.

605
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,359
Stripes are good, it's a
nice bake all the way around.

606
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,919
It's a good height as well.

607
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,039
Shine's good.

608
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,880
So all it has to do now
is taste good.

609
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,279
Mm! Good flavour.

610
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,639
Excellent. Now, this one...

611
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,079
..big issues with the plaiting side
of things. It's very, very small.

612
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,520
Looks a bit heavy, too. Yeah.

613
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,399
Yeah. Feels much, much
tighter, doesn't it?

614
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,119
A bit heavy, generally. Mm.

615
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,159
OK, moving on.

616
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,999
It does look like a babka,
doesn't it?

617
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It does.

618
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,759
It is amazing, isn't it,

619
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,119
how much chocolate you
can get into the dough?

620
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,959
Mm. It's got a very cakey
feel to it. It's lovely.

621
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,279
Moving on. Big gaps in this.

622
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,959
It doesn't look so attractive,
does it?

623
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,679
No, it doesn't.

624
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,559
It needed more proving.
It's very dense, this.

625
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
Mm.

626
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,319
Yeah, it's odd.

627
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,239
Moving on. Now,
the size of this isn't bad.

628
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,560
A few holes in there, but, actually,
it's quite a nice sized loaf.

629
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,319
A bit dry.

630
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,879
Mm. Now, moving on.

631
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,319
Neat, but again, the plait's
not the entire way through.

632
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,119
There's one on the other side. Yeah.

633
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,560
Wow, it's heavy.
It's really under proved.

634
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,399
Tastes good, though.

635
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,919
Funnily enough,
this has got very few plaits,

636
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,279
and yet, the height is there. Mm.

637
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,159
And you can see there,
it's fairly open.

638
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,080
It could do with being
a little bit more.

639
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,159
Tastes delicious.

640
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,559
Prue and Paul will now rank
the babkas from worst to best.

641
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,679
OK, in ninth spot,
we have this one.

642
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,239
A lot of you struggled a little bit
with the shaping into the tin.

643
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,159
It seemed to be really high.

644
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,239
And then in eighth place,
we have this one.

645
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,679
Dave, didn't get much rise on it.

646
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,119
So it was a little bit heavy.

647
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,879
Sarah is seventh.

648
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,599
Mark is sixth.

649
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,959
Hermine, fifth.

650
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,799
Peter is fourth.

651
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,119
In third, we have this one.

652
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,399
Very neat, just could've done
with being a little bit higher.

653
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,640
Right. Now, number two...

654
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,199
..is this one.

655
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,639
Laura, the only thing wrong with it

656
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,359
was that it sank a little bit
in the middle,

657
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,319
but it is a really nice babka.

658
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,759
Thank you. So, in first...

659
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,599
..we have this one.

660
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,199
Well done.

661
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,519
Have you made one before? No.

662
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,879
Very, very good. I think
you did a good job on that.

663
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,879
The swirl was good, the height,
I couldn't fault it.

664
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
Well done.

665
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,119
I know.

666
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,480
I know, I am so...

667
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,399
..I'm so shocked myself!

668
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,439
I just followed my instincts,
and there you go.

669
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,759
That's the first time I've had
good, obviously, praise

670
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,319
and come second and

671
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,639
it's a confidence boost
that I really needed.

672
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,319
That was horrific.

673
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,719
And that was two challenges
pretty much failed.

674
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,719
So tomorrow, I have
to pull it out the bag

675
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,199
and hope that
the weather is on our side.

676
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,000
It's going to be hard.

677
00:32:15,995 --> 00:32:16,385
..9, 10.
Coming, ready or not!

678
00:32:16,405 --> 00:32:19,639
sponsors The Great

679
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,039
Just one challenge remains
before the Star Baker is crowned

680
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,999
and one baker will be asked...
Oh, God.

681
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,280
..to leave the tent.

682
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,319
Hello, bakers. Welcome back to
the tent.

683
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,679
It's time for your
Showstopper Challenge.

684
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,039
Today, the judges would love you to
make a spectacular

685
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,719
white chocolate celebration cake.

686
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,119
Now, your cake should be made with a
particular celebration in mind.

687
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,199
For instance, it could be the first
time you went to the toilet

688
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,399
all by yourself.

689
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,719
For Paul, that was last Thursday.
Well done, Paul.

690
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,319
We're all very proud.

691
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,519
Well done, Paul.

692
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,359
There's your gold star.

693
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,560
No more nappy.

694
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,039
You get three of those, you get
a book token, little man.

695
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,639
Mm. Your cake should have a
minimum of two layers,

696
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,999
and the decoration needs to display
an expert use of white chocolate.

697
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,239
You have four hours.

698
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,680
On your marks.
Get set.

699
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,839
White chocolate's a bit of a crowd
pleaser,

700
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,239
so hopefully it's going to be a
good, yummy bake

701
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,759
that the judges like.

702
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,079
I love white chocolate, which is why
it's so dangerous

703
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,519
having massive jars of these around.

704
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,959
I'm blitzing it because it does
incorporate a bit better.

705
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,319
Also, though, let's be honest,

706
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,999
I don't know what I'm doing
with this one.

707
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,239
It's a gamble.

708
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,719
The Showstopper Challenge is to make
a white chocolate tiered cake.

709
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,079
One of the big challenges for the
bakers, actually,

710
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,759
is introducing the white chocolate
into the sponge.

711
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,119
White chocolate has a higher fat
content,

712
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,759
which means, if they've got butter
in the sponge as well,

713
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,399
they need to reduce that so they're
not really upping that fat content

714
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,839
in the sponge, which will disrupt
the texture of the cake itself.

715
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,319
I think it's a really tricky
challenge.

716
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,999
Because white chocolate is frankly
a nightmare to work with.

717
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,839
It splits at the drop of a hat,

718
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,159
it seizes if you get it too hot,

719
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,639
and I think the bakers will have
their work cut out.

720
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,519
With the weather being so warm
today,

721
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,879
the bakers are going to have to be
extremely careful

722
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,359
how they introduce the white
tempered chocolate

723
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,039
or ganaches on the outside.

724
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,359
They're going to have to compensate
for the fact that

725
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,319
they may start to melt.

726
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,399
Hopefully the ambient temperature
in here doesn't go above 20,

727
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,319
otherwise we're all in for a bit of
a worry.

728
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,039
I'm not a massive fan of white
chocolate,

729
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,479
because, although I have got a sweet
tooth, it's very sweet.

730
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,839
And it's very one-note,
white chocolate.

731
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,199
But I think, in a cake, you can
kind of celebrate it

732
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,719
with other things, which is
hopefully

733
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,039
what I'm going to do today.

734
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,439
Laura's white chocolate sponges
will be sandwiched

735
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,039
with Italian meringue buttercream
and a sharp blackcurrant jam.

736
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,359
And, for a touch of romance,
she'll be decorating

737
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,039
with a chocolate bouquet

738
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,519
to celebrate her two-year wedding
anniversary.

739
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,839
It was your wedding anniversary
yesterday? Yeah.

740
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,999
How exciting. Yeah.

741
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,039
What did you do to celebrate?

742
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,399
I was here, making brownies.
You were here in a tent.

743
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,399
And getting absolutely rinsed by
Paul Hollywood.

744
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,719
Getting told off by a grumpy man
with a beard.

745
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,039
Yeah, basically. Yeah.

746
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,479
That's a great way to spend your
anniversary. Do you think?

747
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,839
Romance is also in the air
for Lottie.

748
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,439
It is a celebration cake for my
grandparents,

749
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,159
because they are celebrating their
Sapphire wedding anniversary

750
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,599
in January.
What is Sapphire?

751
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,799
65 years.

752
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,639
That's incredible. Yeah.

753
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,999
Lottie's ambitious design will
feature

754
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,639
a sapphire geode effect

755
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,239
and an array of tempered white
chocolate decorations.

756
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,679
Have you practice this?

757
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:39,039
I have practised this cake between
15 and 18 times.

758
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,799
Oh, Lottie!

759
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,759
Yeah, this is a really tricky one
for me.

760
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,359
Don't forget, you only have to be
not the worst.

761
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,839
What a great mantra that is.

762
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,839
"Just don't be the worst."
"Don't be the worst."

763
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,199
Well, good luck, then.
Thank you very much.

764
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,559
Oh, well, that spurs you on,
doesn't it?

765
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,399
Making a tiered cake requires
perfect light sponges.

766
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,959
If you're trying to stack it,
you need it to be light,

767
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,319
otherwise it will collapse on
itself.

768
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,399
So it's crucial the bakers gets
the ratio of white chocolate

769
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,919
to butter spot on.

770
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,959
Because white chocolate has such
a high cocoa butter content,

771
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,719
I've used a little bit less butter
than I would normally.

772
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,599
Too much white chocolate will
just...

773
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,359
So, essentially, I'm using a small
amount that I will incorporate

774
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,639
very gently in.

775
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,319
It's very temperamental.

776
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,679
It's like the worst chocolate to
work with.

777
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,159
Sura, good morning. Good morning.

778
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,439
Hello, Sura.

779
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,439
How are you feeling today? Yesterday
wasn't your best day.

780
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,039
No, it wasn't. It was horrific.

781
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,759
But today I'm optimistic and hoping
for the best.

782
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,119
From horrific to optimistic.

783
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,639
Celebrating her parents' 36th
wedding anniversary,

784
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,519
Sura's elaborately decorated cake
will feature

785
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,239
tempered chocolate truffles and
piped buttercream flowers

786
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,199
that will encase layers of
strawberry and lemon jam

787
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,879
and white chocolate sponges.

788
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,239
How are you getting the chocolate
into your cake?

789
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,039
I've watered it down. So it's going
to make it a looser texture,

790
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,039
but, also, it's still going to have
the flavour,

791
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,479
without the heaviness of
white chocolate.

792
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,399
Good luck, Sura.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

793
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,999
Good luck. Thank you.

794
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,599
While Sura is banking on diluted
white chocolate,

795
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,439
Peter is going for an altogether
different texture.

796
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,239
I'm just adding chunks of white
chocolate.

797
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,559
I really like it when you come
across that hunk

798
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,799
of white chocolate in a bit of cake,

799
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,719
so that's what I'm going to be doing
in this one.

800
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,719
Peter's chocolate-studded sponges
will be sandwiched

801
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,039
with a mango curd and whipped cream,

802
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,759
and surrounded with a chocolate
collar

803
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,799
painted with complex equations.

804
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,279
It's the celebration of his brother
Andrew's recent graduation

805
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,239
from a degree in mathematics.

806
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,999
He graduated this year, but he
hasn't had a full ceremony

807
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,799
because of Covid.
Yeah.

808
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,239
So I'm celebrating that through
this cake.

809
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,039
Celebrate it in the tent where
he can't eat it, and we can.

810
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,519
I've practised one at home, and
he's been able to enjoy it.

811
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,759
All right, OK.

812
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,879
Hermine is building her cake
from Genoese sponges,

813
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,679
where whisked eggs and flour are
traditionally combined

814
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,199
with melted butter.

815
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,639
I'm replacing the butter with
the white chocolate, here.

816
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,039
That reminds me of the wedding cakes
at my parents' wedding.

817
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,839
Not that I was there, because I was
still really young.

818
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,439
But I've seen pictures of it.

819
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,999
Her throwback wedding cake will be
decorated

820
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,279
with a white chocolate collar
and piped ganache roses.

821
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,999
Inside, she will layer her delicate
sponges with lemon curd

822
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,999
and Italian meringue buttercream.

823
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,359
Well, I love Genoese.

824
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,319
I think it's beautiful.

825
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,879
It's a nice combination of flavours
as well with the lemon.

826
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,199
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

827
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Thank you.

828
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,039
So, if Paul Hollywood is not
complementary,

829
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,599
are you going to take one of the
cakes

830
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,639
and smush it into his face?

831
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,519
Say, "Well, now see how you like
it?"

832
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,999
Could you do that?
I'll do it.

833
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,479
You'll get away with it. I wouldn't.

834
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,759
You would get away with it.

835
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,119
You'd be a national treasure for
doing that.

836
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,039
But Mark is hoping to keep all three
tiers of his cake intact.

837
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,999
Dedicated to his daughters,
Rosie and Jasmine,

838
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,479
it will be decorated with their
namesake flowers

839
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,119
and sandwiched with raspberry Swiss
meringue buttercream.

840
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,239
I'm nervous because the comments
weren't particularly good

841
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,960
yesterday and I know cakes aren't
particularly my strong point.

842
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,159
So, yeah...

843
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,199
In my perspective, I'm feeling
I'm close to the bottom.

844
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,039
There's also a lot riding on this
bake for Linda.

845
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,559
This really means a lot to me,
this cake, you know?

846
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,479
It's a tribute to my daughter,
actually.

847
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,999
Melissa had special needs.

848
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,439
She's no longer with us.

849
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,799
You know, she passed away when she
was 18.

850
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,719
But this is just a celebration of
her life, really.

851
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,639
And she was just a sweet little
English rose.

852
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,279
Linda will craft a chocolate
rose to sit atop

853
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,159
an all-white three-tiered sponge

854
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,239
filled with Amaretto, raspberry jam
and mascarpone cream.

855
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,599
You had a little triumph yesterday.
I did, didn't I?

856
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,279
I really enjoyed it. Looked like you
were really enjoying yourself.

857
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,719
In actual fact, the directions
were really brilliant.

858
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,079
Yeah, thank you very much.
Don't give him any credit!

859
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,439
No, they was really good.
Have you got one of my books, then?

860
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,760
I have. I think you're going
to do really well.

861
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,639
OK, here we go.

862
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,919
Attempt number one.

863
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,559
Please. Please bake.

864
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,599
With their sponges in the ovens...

865
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,639
I'm going to check it after about
26 minutes, to be precise.

866
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,999
..the bakers now turn their
attention to the fillings...

867
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,319
God, I love multitasking!

868
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,359
..which means even more
white chocolate.

869
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,759
This is going to be white chocolate
overload, but, you know,

870
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,919
that's what they asked for.

871
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,199
What they do in this show is,

872
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,079
they make tell you to make really
sweet cakes,

873
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,559
and then they tell you off.

874
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,840
Yeah, Prue will just go,
"It's too sweet."

875
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,559
"Actually, it's just a little sweet.

876
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,879
And you go, "Yeah, because you told
us to make a cake

877
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,199
"full of white chocolate!"

878
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,959
"I've always thought, maybe, to
balance out the sweetness,

879
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,800
"you could have put some mud
in there."

880
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,999
Luckily, Mark's wife, Laura, is a
big fan of this cake,

881
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,039
as it's in honour of her birthday.

882
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,639
Covered in tempered chocolate shards
and geometric shapes,

883
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,319
the interior is full of her
favourite flavours -

884
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,919
white chocolate, pistachio, lemon,

885
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,879
and a South African marula fruit
cream liqueur.

886
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,319
This is Laura's favourite drink.

887
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,239
And elephants get drunk on this.

888
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,919
Elephants eat fermented marula fruit
and get drunk.

889
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,999
Yeah.

890
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,199
So I quite like it, yeah.

891
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,720
I thought I'd fire it in here, yeah.

892
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,999
I'm not happy with the cakes.

893
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,319
It just looks really bumpy
and uneven.

894
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,480
It's either start again or hold out.

895
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,519
I think I might need to do them
again.

896
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,039
Just three hours of the bake remain.

897
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,839
That goes so quickly. That's one
hour gone.

898
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,999
Yeah, they're not right.

899
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,639
No, they're really not right.

900
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,159
I'm going to stick to what I know.

901
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,520
Equal quantities of everything.

902
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,919
Who would you most be upset
if someone went?

903
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,159
Got a few? I'm not going to say
that.

904
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,999
You always say that.
No, I'm not going to say.

905
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,679
Cos we're all really good people
in here.

906
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,440
This will come out much later,
and by then you won't care.

907
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,639
Paul? Would you like to get rid of
Paul? Yeah, let's get rid of Paul.

908
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,999
This batch really does need to
behave,

909
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,319
because otherwise I am definitely
screwed.

910
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,279
As Laura plays catch up,

911
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,600
it's a critical point in the bake
for the others.

912
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,399
I know by the colour,
that's not ready.

913
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,759
So I'm going to actually leave it
a little bit longer.

914
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,079
The high sugar content in white
chocolate means the sponges

915
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,439
will brown very quickly...

916
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,839
Five minutes.

917
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,159
..which could deceive the bakers
into thinking

918
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,279
they're baked through.

919
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,759
They're a lovely colour.

920
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,079
They need just maybe a minute or
two.

921
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,000
Oh, I don't know.

922
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,799
I'm actually going to put them
in for another two minutes.

923
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,399
I listen to my cakes to hear how
bubbly they are.

924
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,719
If they're very, very bubbly

925
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,000
then there's a lot of liquid
left in them.

926
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,719
You don't want a wet cake.

927
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,360
It is definitely ready.

928
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,040
Yep, I think they're coming out.

929
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,239
Really happy with them.
They look great.

930
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,639
Yeah, nice and golden.

931
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,319
I'm just trying to play catch up,
really.

932
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,079
But I've got my cakes in the oven,
so fingers crossed.

933
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,439
Hi, David.

934
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,799
Good morning. Hello, David.

935
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,479
Tell us about your cake.

936
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,359
So, today, my cake's going to be
called

937
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,359
a Strawberry Splash White Chocolate
Frasier Cake.

938
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,599
Oh, Frasier cake. Nice.

939
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,519
You put the strawberries all round
the outside?

940
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,799
Round the outsides, yeah.

941
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,159
I've got white chocolate creme
mousseline in the middle.

942
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,279
It's going to be decorated with
tempered white chocolate splashes.

943
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,679
Dave's splashes will sit on top
of his Amaretto-soaked sponges.

944
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,959
This is a cake he loves to bake for
his girlfriend Stacy's birthday,

945
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,879
and no birthday is complete
without balloons.

946
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,599
What's happening here with these
little guys?

947
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,279
So, look, there's one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

948
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,799
I can count.
Yeah, there's one for each baker.

949
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,119
And what are they going to be?

950
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,759
They're going to be chocolate
splashes.

951
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,999
Splashes? Mm.

952
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,039
You're doing one for everyone? Yeah.

953
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,439
Aw, that's so sweet.
And...

954
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,759
And then you're going to burst them
one by one

955
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,240
as you rise through the ranks.

956
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,360
Bakers, you are through-way half.

957
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,799
Is that right?
Yeah.

958
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,439
I think everyone's pretty focused
today. There's no chat.

959
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,879
Not as much fun as I thought it was
going to be, I'll be honest.

960
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,319
No chat from Mark. Everyone's
taking it really seriously,

961
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,359
like it's some sort of competition,
or whatever.

962
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,639
You join us in the middle of a very
important bake.

963
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,039
It's all happening.

964
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,879
Laura is checking the temperature of
her sponges.

965
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,159
Laura, what do we think?

966
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,879
Right, these two are done.

967
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,039
Yeah. Talk into the microphone,
please.

968
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,879
Oh, sorry. These two are done.
Excellent.

969
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,159
I think the others just need...

970
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,399
Actually, no, they're not done.

971
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,919
These two are NOT done.
False alarm.

972
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,239
False alarm, everybody.
Newsflash.

973
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,759
Breaking news - they are not done.

974
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,719
One more minute.
We will come back to you later.

975
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,599
In the meantime, we'll go to
the weather.

976
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,919
The thermometer's saying it's
25 degrees.

977
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,239
Not ideal for white chocolate.

978
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,319
And not ideal conditions for
stacking layers of sponge

979
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,079
with delicate, creamy fillings.

980
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,439
This is all feeling a little bit
warm at the moment,

981
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,999
so I'm going to have to try and work
as quick as I can.

982
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,799
I have to go like the clappers.

983
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,599
The assembly shouldn't
take too long.

984
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,159
It's the chilling part that I need
the most amount of time on,

985
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,999
to really firm up the mousseline.

986
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,559
As the layers build...

987
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,799
So hot.

988
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,719
..the bakers will need to make full
use of the fridges

989
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,639
to stop them melting and sinking in
the ever-warming intent.

990
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,039
Really glad I remade them.

991
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,679
They're looking really good.
Much better, yeah.

992
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,239
Panic averted.

993
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,759
Hot.

994
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,760
Bakers, you have one hour left.

995
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,599
That's not long.

996
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,039
If dealing with white chocolate in
their sponges wasn't hard enough,

997
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,959
the bakers also need to temper it to
make their decorative elements.

998
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,559
I'm just hoping they don't pop.

999
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,239
Now I'm making my white
chocolate collar.

1000
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,039
I'm going to just spread it out on
the acetate

1001
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,439
and then put it around the cake.

1002
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,039
This is the messy bit.

1003
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,079
This is just a lacy sort of
collar thing

1004
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,879
that I'm putting around the outside
of it.

1005
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,559
It kind of partially sets on the
acetate,

1006
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,040
and then it's easier to pick up and
lift onto and around the cake.

1007
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,600
It's a mess, isn't it?

1008
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,159
Too hot.

1009
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,679
Literally melting in my hands.

1010
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,879
Too, too hot.

1011
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,879
I'm just going to do some chocolate
drips down the side.

1012
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,319
That's all I can do now.

1013
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,839
Bakers,
you've got ten minutes left.

1014
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,960
Don't mess it up.

1015
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,560
It's pretty satisfying.

1016
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,719
Ah, it's not coming off.

1017
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,359
I may not get the rows done,
but I'm hoping to.

1018
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,719
I'm going to just smooth this off.

1019
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,439
Guys,
you have about nine minutes left.

1020
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,879
You need to start making your cakes
round about now.

1021
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,400
Do speed up, Lottie.

1022
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,999
I wanted much longer to be
able to do this.

1023
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,879
Looks good, doesn't it?

1024
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,199
It's just not working.

1025
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,919
I'm painting on some maths symbols
and equations,

1026
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,399
and all that kind of jazz.

1027
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,920
I'm making roses.

1028
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,759
This is my rose. Going to do her
proud.

1029
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,799
That is not going to stay.

1030
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,319
Just got to finish the ruffles.

1031
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,759
I would actually really love to make
something Paul likes today.

1032
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,199
Rough and ready, isn't it?

1033
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,519
But the rose looks amazing.

1034
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,320
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1035
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,800
Ooh, that's scary canary.

1036
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,399
Yeah, really happy. Yeah.

1037
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,319
It couldn't have gone better for me,
I don't think.

1038
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,440
They're breaking!

1039
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,519
Going for the less is more.
Less is not more.

1040
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,800
Have you seen mine?

1041
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,999
Whatever, I'm done.
OK.

1042
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,199
I'm done.

1043
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,999
Bakers, your time is up.

1044
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,760
Please step away from your bakes.

1045
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,919
Looks awesome, Lottie.

1046
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,479
It looks OK. It looks fine.

1047
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,320
But I'm not happy with OK and fine.

1048
00:47:49,945 --> 00:47:56,119
Nine white chocolate
celebration cakes

1049
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,600
now face the judgement
of Paul and Prue.

1050
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,519
I love the way it looks.
Oh, thank you.

1051
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,199
I think it looks original, it looks
modern. I'd buy that. Thank you.

1052
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,559
Thank you. It's a
great looking cake.

1053
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,919
The naked element of it looks nice.
It's neat.

1054
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,279
I love the drips are all
equal as well.

1055
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,479
And so I've got white chocolate cake
with a pistachio

1056
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,479
and lemon Genoise and then
a white chocolate sponge with

1057
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,119
a marula fruit liquor

1058
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,040
and white chocolate
Italian meringue buttercream.

1059
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,999
All the flavours are there,
but they're quite... delicate.

1060
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,839
OK. It needs more of a hero flavour.

1061
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,159
I don't think pistachio's going
to be strong enough.

1062
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,479
It's a beautifully made cake.

1063
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,479
The flavour just needs
a bit more oomph.

1064
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,760
A bit more oomph. OK.

1065
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,359
I love that. It's very cool.

1066
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,399
I like what you've done
with the sapphire as well.

1067
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,159
I think it's imaginative, I think
it's exciting. Oh, thank you.

1068
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,999
Beautiful. Thank you. Well done,
Lottie.

1069
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,319
It is three white chocolate sponges

1070
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,359
with a passion fruit curd
and a lime kind of syrup.

1071
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,239
The flavour's good.

1072
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,119
The textures aren't, though.
It's overbaked.

1073
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,039
Mm-hm. Cos it is bone dry inside.

1074
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,120
Yeah.

1075
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,279
I think, actually, the work
and the chocolate looks fine.

1076
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,479
My issue is... It's leaning.
..the shape of the cakes. Yeah.

1077
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,240
I mean, they're all over the place,
aren't they? They are.

1078
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,079
Mm.

1079
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,359
You have raw dough.
It looks like marzipan.

1080
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,799
Your recipe was at fault or you've
weighed something up wrong.

1081
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,479
It could have been the
white chocolate with the water.

1082
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,039
Mm. Yeah, maybe.

1083
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,520
Such a pity it's not edible.

1084
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,159
It looks wonderful. Thank you.

1085
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,039
The colour of the sponge worries me
a lot. OK. It's very dark.

1086
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,360
Let's have a look inside.

1087
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,479
Well, I don't think it's overbaked.
It does taste really good.

1088
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,439
Strawberries work well with it.
Thank you.

1089
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,479
It's just the colour of
that sponge I don't like.

1090
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,119
But overall, I think it's
a decent cake.

1091
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,400
Thank you. I love it.
Cool, thank you.

1092
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,999
I really like it. Buttery, white
chocolate, a bit of zest in there.

1093
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,439
My issue is the decoration.

1094
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,279
The piping work is not good.

1095
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,079
At any level. I think Paul is right.

1096
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,959
It's a really delicious cake.

1097
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,079
A little dense. Piping not perfect.

1098
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,320
No. But thank you.

1099
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,919
It's really neat. I think it's
a great looking cake.

1100
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,279
Thank you. Very pastel. Yeah.

1101
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,640
Let's have a look, shall we?

1102
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,399
Sponge is a little dense. OK. It is.
It's weighed heavy on that. Yeah.

1103
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,879
But I like the flavour of it and I
love the raspberry

1104
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,279
through it as well. I think you've
done a really good job.

1105
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,119
Thank you. And it's taste of white
chocolate. Good. Yeah, well done.

1106
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,680
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1107
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,519
The colour is beautiful and smooth

1108
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,079
and all the way around,

1109
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,719
it just looks really neat.

1110
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,600
It's a coconut cake with mango curd
cream in the centre.

1111
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,399
Oh, that'll be a chocolate chunk.

1112
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,040
It's like toffee.
It's gluing my teeth together.

1113
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,519
I think it's well baked.

1114
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,439
Coconut flavour really comes
through. Mango lightens it up.

1115
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,959
You've come up with something that
is very, very neat too. Clever.

1116
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,520
Thanks. Yeah, well done. Thank you.

1117
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,439
It's a little bit messy down at the
bottom. Yes.

1118
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,879
The top bit's quite cute.

1119
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,359
Quite like that.
Just don't seem to go together.

1120
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,120
No, they don't. It's like two
different cakes, isn't it?

1121
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,439
Mm! Delicious.

1122
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,479
Delicious.

1123
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,919
So, we call it a Prue-gasm.

1124
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,080
"Mm!"

1125
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,679
The lemon works beautifully
with the sponge.

1126
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,239
It's got that citrus kick that
you want. Well done, Hermine.

1127
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,520
It's just delicious.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1128
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,159
Sometimes less is more.

1129
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,280
That sort of let it down a little
bit. OK.

1130
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,919
Blackcurrant is beautiful.

1131
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,279
I can't really get the white
chocolate, but then,

1132
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,919
since there's such a mass of white
chocolate everywhere else,

1133
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,479
perhaps that doesn't matter. Yeah.

1134
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,479
I think your sponges are dried
out slightly

1135
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,319
and you probably
slightly overbaked it. OK.

1136
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,719
But I love the blackcurrant.

1137
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,719
Thank you. It works beautifully,
actually, with the white chocolate.

1138
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,999
You put a lot of thought into it.

1139
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,760
Well, well done, Laura. Thank you.

1140
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,559
I'm a tiny bit disappointed,
I think,

1141
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,880
cos I just really wanted to,
like, nail it this week.

1142
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,039
But the comment
that I really loved was

1143
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,839
when Paul said that
a lot of thought had gone into it.

1144
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,439
Like, that meant a lot to me.

1145
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,920
Yet! I had a Prue roar!

1146
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,999
It's a thing, apparently, now.

1147
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,760
She goes, "Mm!"

1148
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,199
Went horrific.

1149
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,199
I can't believe the cake was, like,

1150
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,480
pretty much raw inside.

1151
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,920
I honestly don't know to say.

1152
00:53:32,115 --> 00:53:32,335
Whoa...

1153
00:53:32,336 --> 00:53:38,519
sponsors The Great British Bake Off.

1154
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,199
So, kids, that was a tough week.

1155
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,079
But we should talk first
about who could be Star Baker.

1156
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,039
I think Peter. Again, Mr Consistent.

1157
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,719
Very clever, very neat.

1158
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,319
The colour was very good.
I liked the mango as well.

1159
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,159
Can I talk about Mark L?

1160
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,319
Because I think his cake
was just beautiful.

1161
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,679
He's been up there constantly,
Mark L.

1162
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,279
Well, he was third in Technical,
did pretty well in Signature,

1163
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,959
and I think he's done
pretty good today.

1164
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,199
So I think I would put one of those
two in line for Star Baker.

1165
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,559
Who's in trouble?

1166
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,119
Sura, I think.

1167
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,639
I think based on her
Showstopper being raw.

1168
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,679
She made a big mistake with that.

1169
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,759
And probably Lottie.
She was bottom in the Technical.

1170
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,439
Didn't do fantastically
in the Signature.

1171
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,519
She did well in the Showstopper,
but has she done enough to stay in

1172
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,879
the competition and has Sura really
failed that much that she has to go?

1173
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,759
I really like Lottie and Sura,

1174
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,079
so I will go instead of them
if you want.

1175
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,559
I'm happy. Oh, yes. We'll have that.

1176
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,519
See you, mate. Prue!

1177
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,079
I thought I was your favourite!

1178
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,279
See how easily they forget once
the new kid's in town?

1179
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,559
The novelty of me will wear off.

1180
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,040
I wouldn't get rid of him.

1181
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,039
Hello, Bakers.

1182
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,639
I've got the great job
of announcing Star Baker.

1183
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,320
So, the Star Baker is...

1184
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,599
..Mark L.

1185
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,920
Oh, thank you. Well done, Mark.

1186
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,559
Thank you. Smashed it. Well done!

1187
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:21,919
So, it's up to me
to announce who' is going home,

1188
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,439
and it is someone who we are
really fond of,

1189
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,439
but who had a bad week.

1190
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,760
And so the baker who
will be leaving us this week is...

1191
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,799
..Sura.

1192
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,880
I was expecting that.

1193
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,319
You are honestly amazing.

1194
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,079
You're so good.

1195
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,480
Never mind. You're a good baker.

1196
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,879
I'm gutted, but what's done is done.

1197
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,760
I'm not going to be bitter about it.

1198
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,040
I've had a great time.

1199
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,360
Sorry. That's OK.

1200
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,199
You just had a bad week.

1201
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,919
I hate white chocolate.

1202
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,039
I hate chocolate. End of.

1203
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,360
I don't think I'll ever eat
chocolate ever again.

1204
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,919
I'm really sad to see Sura go.

1205
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,519
Now, that's the classic case
of you cannot have a weakness

1206
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,239
in your baking if you're going to
win The Great British Bake Off.

1207
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,719
And unfortunately
we found Sura's this week,

1208
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,040
and it was that that
actually saved Lottie.

1209
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,600
Just pick it up for the next one,
yeah? I will try my best.

1210
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,599
The sadness that I feel at losing
Sura is at least part way made

1211
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:39,399
up by Mark getting Star Baker.
That... I'll take that.

1212
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,719
That'll cheer me up.
Yeah, well done, mate. Thank you.

1213
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,039
I'm quite emotional. Are you? Yeah.

1214
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,399
You're hiding it really well. Am I?
No.

1215
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,399
How did that happen?

1216
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,119
I can't believe it.

1217
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,639
Yeah, I just didn't expect it.

1218
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,999
I think consistency
pays off, doesn't it?

1219
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,759
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1220
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,079
Yeah, well done. What a surprise.
Really good.

1221
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,799
I'm delighted that we're going...

1222
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,279
..we're down to the final seven
bakers, you know?

1223
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,839
Like... Seven? Eight.

1224
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,639
Eight. Is it eight?

1225
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,400
Eight bakers.

1226
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,119
Next time... It's pastry week!

1227
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:14,159
..the bakers feel the heat at
the halfway point.

1228
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,999
Halfway to paradise.

1229
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,680
With a strenuous signature...

1230
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,839
..a perplexing Technical.

1231
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,279
Hashtag winging it.

1232
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,279
And an astonishing Showstopper...

1233
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,679
It's bonkers.

1234
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,999
..that will leave one baker
feeling fragile.

1235
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I don't know what to do.

1236
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:30,760
It's just breaking as I'm trying
to get it.

1237
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,960
