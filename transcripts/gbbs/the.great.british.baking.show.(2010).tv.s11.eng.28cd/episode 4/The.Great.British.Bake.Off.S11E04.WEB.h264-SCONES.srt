1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,280
- Hello, it's Chocolate Week!

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,440
Ooh, I love chocolate.
Are you a chocolate man, Noel?

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,840
- No, I'm an actual man.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,320
- BOTH: - Welcome to
The Great British Bake Off.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,920
- Last time...

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,520
It was Bread Week.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,760
- Oh, crumbs.

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,120
- While Marc proved a worthy
Star Baker...

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,800
APPLAUSE

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,920
..it was Rowan who unravelled...

11
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,080
- It looks just like a bit
of a shambles.

12
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,360
- You've gone for all style
and no substance.

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,040
- ..and became the latest baker to
leave the tent.

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,640
- I'm glad. I didn't really want
to do Chocolate Week!

15
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,760
- HE CHUCKLES

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,800
- But for the remaining Bakers...
- Don't drop, don't drop, don't drop!

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,400
- ..Chocolate Week has arrived...

18
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,240
- Literally melting in my hands.

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,160
- ..with a back-to-basics
signature...

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,520
- Brownies are one of the most
basic things to bake.

21
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,400
If you can't get that right...
- You're getting hammered! - Ruthless.

22
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,480
- A return to bread in the
technical...

23
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,320
- What have we got to prove?
Everything.

24
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,480
- Maybe if you stroke it,
it'll get a bit bigger. - Might do!

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,160
- ..and the Show Stopper...

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,240
- At the moment,
they're saying it's 25 degrees.

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,880
Not ideal for white chocolate.

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,320
- ..that gets them
all hot under the collar.

29
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,400
- Don't forget -
you only have to be not the worst.

30
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,520
- LAUGHTER
What a great mantra that is!

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,880
"Just don't be the worst."

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,440
- Chocolate Week!
- SHE LAUGHS

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,920
- Yeah, it's fun.
Absolute fun, this one.

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
- Massive chocoholic!

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,680
A day without chocolate
is a day wasted, in my opinion.

36
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,120
- Chocolate releases endorphins,

37
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,960
but that tent does not always
release endorphins!

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I think it is quite a stressful
place, so um...

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,440
Maybe if I have some chocolate
halfway through my bake,

40
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,200
I'll feel a bit better!

41
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,800
- Hello, Bakers.
Welcome to the tent.

42
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,680
It is Chocolate Week and it's time
for your signature challenge. OK...

43
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,320
- HE WHISPERS: - Their names are Paul
and Prue.

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,256
- Yeah, I know. - You say that, but you
always get them wrong. - No, I don't!

45
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,600
- All right. Paul and Prue. - I know!

46
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Praul and Pue would like you
each to make a batch of

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,640
18 chocolate brownies. You may use
any type of chocolate you like.

48
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,960
- You can use as many additional
flavours as you like,

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,280
but we will be looking for that
nice fudgy texture.

50
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,560
And when I say we, I mean...

51
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,840
- Plaul and Plue.
You have one hour and 30 minutes.

52
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,800
- On your marks... - Get set...

53
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,960
- Bake!

54
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,800
Brownies may be famously
simple to make...

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,720
- Put anything in a brownie that you
like. As long as you don't

56
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,120
overcook it and keep the middle of
nice and gooey.

57
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,960
- But the Bakers have just 90 minutes
to produce the perfect batch.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
- It's the timing that I'm really
worried about.

59
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,880
We're all up against it.

60
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,040
- To get them cooked, cooled and ready
in an hour and a half

61
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,120
is going to be tough.

62
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,920
- The perfect chocolate brownie
has a gooey centre

63
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,040
and it has a crackly crisp top.
And that's it!

64
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,760
- The bake on the brownie is
the most critical thing.

65
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,040
If you over-bake it, it will become
very, very dry and cake-like.

66
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,000
- Although the Bakers can, of course,
decorate their brownies,

67
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,760
all icings are very sweet and extra
chocolate is more sweetness,

68
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,520
so I think they should try not to
over-decorate the top.

69
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,960
- This, for me, is going
back to basics.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,640
If you can't produce a decent
chocolate brownie...

71
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
..there's going to be problems.

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,000
Hello, Linda. - Good morning!
- Linda, tell us about your brownies.

73
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,440
- These are my Christmas brownies,
they remind me of when I was a kid

74
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,200
and we used to have all the
nuts and Turkish delights

75
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,680
and dates that were a real treat.

76
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,640
- NOEL: - Linda's treats of Christmas
past will be studded into a layer

77
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,520
of white chocolate on top
of her date-filled brownie.

78
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,296
- What texture are we looking for when
we cut into it? - Nice and gooey.

79
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,936
- Gooey? - Nice and gooey. - Good luck,
thank you. - Thank you very much.

80
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,000
- Good luck. - Thank you. - I might just
stay here... - OK.

81
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,240
- ..and wait till they're ready and
then eat them. - Keep stirring that...

82
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,160
If you are going to... - Do you want
me to? - ..be useful. - Oh, OK.
-LINDA LAUGHS

83
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,960
- So, I'm making a rich chocolate
brownie with roasted macadamia.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,440
Surprisingly, I hadn't made brownies
until a few years ago.

85
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,440
I wouldn't say
they're my favourite cake.

86
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,960
- MATT: - Perfecting the recipe for his
praline buttercream brownies,

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,240
has given Marc sleepless nights.

88
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,400
- I'm tired! Really tired this
morning. - Are you? I'm quite tired.

89
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,560
I woke up in the middle of the
night, I was sleep-walking and
driving around...

90
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,776
- As a vampire, though, that's what
you're meant to do, isn't it? Get up
at night... - I call it sl
- eepwalking.

91
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,176
- You call it... - ..other people call
it... - Being a vampire!

92
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,960
- Taking people into the bushes
and sucking all their blood out.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,920
I mean, people like to split hairs.

94
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,400
- MATT: - The Bakers' quest for the
perfect gooey centre starts

95
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,000
with their brownie mix.

96
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,760
- I think it's all about the
ratios in your recipe.

97
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,200
So, how much fat you've got,
how much flour you've got.

98
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,120
- If you add too much flour, you're
going to start getting a cake.

99
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,480
- NOEL: - So, getting their calculations
right...

100
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,920
- Little bit too much sugar.
- ..is crucial.

101
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,480
- I like your purple calculator!
- It's good, isn't it?

102
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,960
- I haven't seen calculators for a
while because I have a calculator
app on my phone.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,400
- Yeah, unfortunately, we are not
allowed are phones in here.

104
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,656
- Are you not? - No. - Why? Because
you'd be ringing going,

105
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,720
"Mum, can you come and get me?
I don't like it here.

106
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,400
"They make me bake all day
and then, I bake all day,

107
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,800
"a horrible man with a beard
comes along and says it isn't good."

108
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,240
- NOEL: - But this bake should be
child's play for Dave,

109
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,440
as it is inspired by his favourite
childhood sweets,

110
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,320
which will sit on top of his rich
ganache-topped brownies.

111
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,080
- They'd better take my last cos they
won't be able to eat any more after
they've had min
- e.

112
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,920
NOEL: - Hoping for a slightly
healthier brownie...

113
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,600
- These are some good looking figs.
- ..is Peter.

114
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,360
- Peter, that looks amazing.

115
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,600
- So, I am making fig
and pistachio upside-down brownies.

116
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,520
So, I've got a layer of figs
underneath and that's going to

117
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,040
be flipped out and become the top
and I've got some cinnamon

118
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,120
going into the brownie batter.
It just tastes really good

119
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,960
alongside the chocolate.
- It's very untraditional...

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,400
- It's certainly unusual. - It's risky.

121
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,160
MATT: - Peter's hoping for a riot of
texture and flavour with his unusual
fig-topped brown
- ies.

122
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,840
- What did Paul say when you said
"figs"? Did he go...

123
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,400
- SQUEAKILY: - .. "Oo-o-o-oh!"?

124
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,520
Or did he just stare through you
with his cold blue eyes?

125
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,840
- When I said most things,
he just did that, yeah.

126
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,480
- You must have made brownies, right?
Everyone's made brownies.

127
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,040
- Everyone's made brownies, surely.
Have you made brownies?
-I've made brownies...

128
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,440
I haven't made brownies.
No, I have... never baked.

129
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,600
- You've never baked?
Like... ever? Never ever? - Never.

130
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,000
Baking's for losers!
- THEY LAUGH

131
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,560
- This is good inside knowledge.

132
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,440
- I make brownies of the time at home.
My husband does really like
brownies.

133
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,520
But, you know, it's Paul Hollywood
and Prue Leith judging it

134
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,480
and not my husband.
He will eat anything!

135
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,400
- MATT: - Her husband might not be
fussy, but Sura is hoping

136
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,920
to win over the judges today with
her ruby and dark chocolate marble
brownies.

137
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,720
- It could be great...
Or it could be...

138
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,800
We'll see what kind of disaster
this turns out to be.

139
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,040
- Right, so, I'm going in.

140
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,920
170 for 20 minutes.

141
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,480
- NOEL: - Getting their brownies baked

142
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,520
and cooled as quickly as possible is
crucial, if the Bakers are to

143
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,360
leave themselves enough time to cut
and decorate...

144
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,760
- That goes in at 180 for
about 25 minutes.

145
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,640
- ..but Lottie's going to have to
run the oven gauntlet twice.

146
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,600
- They're going to go for 25
minutes to start with and then,

147
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,400
another 25 minutes once
they've got the toppings on.

148
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,760
- MATT: - Lottie's ambitious
double-baked brownies will have

149
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,600
a chocolate and pecan base and baked
raspberry cheesecake topping.

150
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,840
- I have given myself a hellish pile
of work to do. I think I can

151
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,080
get it done. Obviously, what will
suffer is my decoration,

152
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,360
but that's always the case with me.
As long as it tastes all right,
I'm happy.

153
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,000
- Hermine, good morning. - Morning!

154
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,800
- Hermine, tell us
about your brownies.

155
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,840
- So, I'm making raspberry, white
chocolate and pistachio... - Wow.

156
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,560
- ..brownie. - How long are you going to
cook them for?

157
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,680
- Ten minutes on one side, get it out,

158
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,400
and then ten
minutes on the other side.

159
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,560
- How do you mean,
"ten minutes on the other side"?

160
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,880
- Turn around. - Of the tray?
- Yeah, it's a tray.

161
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,240
- The only problem is, when you do
that, you drop the temperature
of the oven.

162
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,320
- Well, isn't that a good
thing for a brownie? - Is it?

163
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,640
NOEL: - Hermine is also adding coffee
to elevate the chocolate flavour

164
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,840
of her brownie, which she's hoping
she can bake to perfection.

165
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,160
- If the baker says, "You're not
supposed to turn it around",

166
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,000
maybe I'm not supposed to
turn it around.

167
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
So, we're not going to turn
it around!

168
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,800
- Bakers, you are halfway through!

169
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,480
- That was nice.

170
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,840
- 45 minutes...

171
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,800
- Now I'm going to
make my Italian meringue.

172
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,560
- MATT: - The Bakers' choice of
toppings...

173
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,200
- Going to blitz the hazelnuts...

174
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,680
- ..should enhance
the flavour of their brownies...

175
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,520
- On the top of the brownies is going
to be tiny little cubed

176
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,880
Turkish delight and chopped nuts.

177
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,960
- ..without adding too much sweetness.

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,520
- On top of my brownies is going to be
a milk chocolate ganache

179
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,840
with honeycomb.
Yeah, they are a bit sweet.

180
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,960
- This is my cheesecake layer.

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,280
This goes back in the oven for
25 minutes or as long as I can
spare, really.

182
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,200
- So, I am making the Italian
meringue buttercream...

183
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,680
- There's a few Italian meringues
I know in the tent today.

184
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,560
- It's like a sweet overload,
but so worth it.

185
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,600
- It's like Donald Trump's hair,
isn't it?

186
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,440
That's how you know
your meringue is done.

187
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,120
You've got a Trump on your whisk!

188
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,680
- Mark's Italian meringue-topped
brownies will sit on a cookie base

189
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,960
in his take on his
favourite camping treat.

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,520
- A smore is usually something you
have with marshmallows

191
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,280
and biscuits, sort of,
over by a campfire,

192
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,160
so I thought I'd convert
that into a brownie.

193
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,920
- MATT: - Also hoping to score brownie
points with her smores-inspired bake

194
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,800
is Laura. - Smores is quite an
American term,

195
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,720
but it basically means
melted marshmallow, I think.

196
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,400
But I'm doing a posh version with
Italian meringue.

197
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,440
- NOEL: - Laura's Italian meringue will
be piped on top of her decadent

198
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,560
chocolate and hazelnut brownies,

199
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,080
before being drizzled with a
rich salted caramel sauce.

200
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,840
- The brownies are so,
so sweet that I'm hoping the salt

201
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,960
and the caramel will just... cut
through that

202
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,120
and then, you get that really
nice balance.

203
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,120
- So, these are going
back in for another 25 minutes.

204
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,000
- MATT: - With Lottie just halfway
through her bake time...

205
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,040
- I'm praying to the brownie gods.
- Er... - ..the others...

206
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,480
- Brownie, cook! Brownie, cook!

207
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,920
- ..now face a game of nerves...

208
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,680
- It's never failed me
to leave them in for 33 minutes.

209
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,760
It still stays all nice and fudgy.

210
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,480
- ..as they must judge when their
brownies are perfectly underbaked.

211
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,640
- Ooh, yeah,
they still need a bit longer.

212
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,120
Oh, come on!

213
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,040
- NOEL: Get them out too soon
and they could fall apart.

214
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,880
- That's good, we've got a nice
crack... on top.

215
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,640
- Leave them in too long...

216
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,536
- Just going to give them a couple of
minutes, that's all. Just a couple.

217
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,520
- ..and they risk losing
the fudgy centre.

218
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,920
- Oh, they're still a bit...
Oh, gosh...

219
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,680
Got to give it another five minutes,
that's not good!

220
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,200
- They're completely raw.

221
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,520
- Got to get these in the freezer,
ASAP.

222
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,280
I just need it to cool quickly.

223
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,320
- I think I'm going to take mine
out now.

224
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,240
- I'm going to get it out, I think.

225
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,240
Cos I really don't want
to overdo it.

226
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,520
I do really want a nice,
fudgy middle.

227
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,240
- That looks good to me!

228
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,480
Let's just hope they cool in time.

229
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,680
- Into the fridge -
we've not got long.

230
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,240
- They're still a little bit
raw in the middle.

231
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,080
The thicker they are,
the longer they take to cook, so...

232
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,240
My fault, really.

233
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,960
- Gr-r-r!

234
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,200
- Yours in the oven?

235
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,880
- Yeah, mate, I've got another 15
minutes before they can come out.

236
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,240
It's not going to be pretty,
the end of this.

237
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,360
- Bakers, you have... insert number
of minutes here... minutes remaining.

238
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,720
- SHE GIGGLES

239
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,680
You've actually got half
an hour left.

240
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,320
- That's not enough time.

241
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,960
- What are you doing?
- I'm still baking. - Still in the oven?

242
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,280
- Yeah. - What? - Mm-hm...

243
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,920
- If you need any more time,
I do do the time calls,

244
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,920
so I could cheat for us.
SURA GIGGLES

245
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,320
OK? You know you're my favourite.
Don't tell the others.

246
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,400
- I'm just going to take them out.

247
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,400
- Bakers,
you have 15 minutes remaining.

248
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,880
- Yeah,
what you going to do about it?!

249
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,840
Probably carry on baking
and try your hardest.

250
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,880
- That's very hot. I'm going
to defrost the freezer!

251
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,200
- Don't drop, don't drop, don't drop!

252
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,656
- Ideally, it'd be nice to leave them

253
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,376
a little bit longer before I cut
them, but time's of the essence now.

254
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,616
- When I've not this is practice
and it hasn't gone right,

255
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,920
it's just went... - HE WHISTLES

256
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,160
- ..splurge out the side.

257
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,760
- MATT: Only now will the Bakers find
out if they've judged

258
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,560
their bake times correctly.

259
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
- Oh, thank God for that.
- HE GIGGLES GLEEFULLY

260
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,200
- That is perfect inside.

261
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,920
Very happy with that bake.

262
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,240
- A bit raw.

263
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Unfortunately, Paul's going to say,
probably, now that

264
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,840
they're not quite right.
- Let's see how raw it is, shall we?

265
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,200
On a scale of one to raw...
- Do you think it's still raw?

266
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,640
- Oh, yeah,
I'm fairly confident it's raw, yeah.

267
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,560
- Have you got time to put
it in the freezer?

268
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,120
- I did put it in the freezer... - Oh.

269
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,856
- ..and then the freezer melted on it
because it was so hot and then,

270
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,000
now, this is all just wet freezer
juice that... dripped onto it.

271
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,080
- "Wet freezer juice"?!

272
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,840
- Yeah. - So, what have you...?

273
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,440
"What's your topping again, Lottie?
"It's wet freezer juice

274
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,960
"and then, also, I dipped it in bin
juice because I wasn't..."

275
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,080
- Yeah, just for good measure.
- "..wasn't pleased."

276
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,640
So, tuck in, Blue Eyes,
see how that grabs you!

277
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,160
- NOEL CHUCKLES

278
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,560
THUD

279
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,800
SHE SIGHS

280
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,240
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

281
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,520
HE CHUFFS
- You can do this, Bakers.

282
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,840
- Oh, the stress.
Oh, the stress is too much.

283
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,720
- Just piping on the Italian meringue.

284
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,400
- I think these are looking darn,
rootin'-tootin' good!

285
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
- Mine are a mess.

286
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,280
- Just going to pop
some of this over there...

287
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,320
They look a treat.
- Yummy, yummy, yummy.

288
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,760
- So, I'm just thinking if I can split
one tin into 18 brownies...

289
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,760
- Oh, what a hot mess.

290
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,080
- UNDER HER BREATH: - No, I'm not going
to try.

291
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,400
- I'm happy with that!
God, to the wire...

292
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,400
- Bakers, your time is up.

293
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,200
Please put your bakes
at the end of your bench.

294
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,056
- Oh, that was horrific. Mine are raw.
They're not cooked. Look at them.

295
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,120
- HE SIGHS
- Well, at least they're gooey!

296
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,880
- Looks like an actual car crash.

297
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,240
- MATT: - The nine batches
of chocolate brownies

298
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,600
now face the scrutiny
of Paul and Prue.

299
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,400
- Hello, Peter. - Hi, Peter.

300
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,280
They look quite attractive
on the top.

301
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,720
- They really look lovely.

302
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,000
It's got the chewiness, but it's
coming from the dates, isn't it?

303
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,000
- Mm. - What spices
did you put in there?

304
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,200
- There's cinnamon in there.

305
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,120
- Mm. - I think there's
too much cinnamon.

306
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,560
Because, actually, the cinnamon
is overtaking the chocolate.

307
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,080
It's different, it's risky.

308
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,320
It's OK.

309
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,840
- NOEL: - That is brutal.

310
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,440
- Thank you. - OK, thank you.

311
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,560
- It's OK. - It's a bit disappointing.

312
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,920
- LAURA: - Oh, dear God, here we go.

313
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,560
- Good luck, honey.

314
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
You'll be great.

315
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,440
- Mm. It looks as if they came
out of the oven too early.

316
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,600
- Yeah, it does look a mess.

317
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,560
Let's have a look, shall we?

318
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,800
- I really think
that's too much Italian meringue.

319
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,560
- OK.

320
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,000
- It's too sweet.

321
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,640
- Really? - Far too sweet. - OK.

322
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,960
- Cos you've got caramel,
you've got the meringue on the top,

323
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
you've got the chocolate,
you're going, "Mm, enough now."

324
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,040
- It's under baked. - Mm. - So,
you've got a few problems here.

325
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,120
We need to get them out
of there, don't we? - Yeah.

326
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,920
Initially I had
two trays of brownies,

327
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,240
and one of them actually
fell inside the oven.

328
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,560
So, I've just presented one.

329
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,840
- Very tough. - Mm.

330
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,680
- I don't like the flavours either.

331
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,920
- I do! What is it?

332
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,640
- Dark chocolate and ruby chocolate.

333
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,200
- Because I'm getting
a sort of citrusy kick,

334
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,280
but I think that must be
the ruby chocolate. - Yeah.

335
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,560
- Mm. - But...

336
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,560
..the bake's not right. - Mm-hm.

337
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,720
- And, obviously,
you haven't got enough. - Yeah.

338
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,240
- Not your best work. - No.

339
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,200
- We're getting hammered.

340
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,440
- Ruthless.

341
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,280
- OK, well, they look neat.

342
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,760
- And they look pretty identical.

343
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,480
- So, I've got a cookie base,
with a dark chocolate brownie,

344
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,320
with Italian meringue
and some sugared cranberries.

345
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,320
- It tastes like a brownie.

346
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,800
I'm slightly avoiding the top

347
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,640
because I know
that'll be very sweet.

348
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,400
But, overall, I think
it's a really good job.

349
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,080
- Thank you.

350
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,040
- The biscuit base is too thick.

351
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,880
I like your flavour.

352
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,640
I just think your textures
were wrong.

353
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,080
- OK, thank you.

354
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,560
- They're a little bit messy.

355
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,000
- I like the raspberry acidity.

356
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,960
But the white chocolate
is just too much.

357
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,256
- There's a lot going on in that.

358
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,496
You've got coffee, you've got
chocolate, you've got raspberry,

359
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,720
you've got pistachio...

360
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,440
- You've got a hell of a lot of sugar.

361
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,720
- It's very spongelike
rather than brownie-like. See?

362
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,040
Looks like a chocolate sponge.

363
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,280
I like the flavour, though.

364
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,960
It's unusual, it's nice. It just
came down to the bake itself.

365
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,680
- OK, thank you. - Thank you.

366
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,960
They're all pretty even. - Yeah.

367
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,120
- It's over baked.
It's more like a sponge

368
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,440
than a brownie.

369
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,320
Tastes great!
I like the flavour. - Yeah.

370
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,960
- But it lacks the two things
that I think make a brownie,

371
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,160
that is the gooey middle
and the crackly top.

372
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,920
- Yeah. - You made a good tray bake.

373
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,280
- Thank you.

374
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,016
- They don't look good at all. - No.

375
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,760
Yeah, I was running out
of time, basically,

376
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,120
so it was a rush at the end of it.
So, I apologise for that.

377
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,280
- It's quite dry. - OK.

378
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,800
- If you go right to the middle,
it's nice and squidgy. - OK.

379
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,320
- Actually, I think the flavour's OK.

380
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,736
But it does look a mess.
- It does, I know, I'm ashamed of it.

381
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,520
- That's a problem for me
because... - Yeah.

382
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,760
- ..brownies are one of the
most basic things to bake.

383
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,280
If you can't get that right...

384
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,280
- What are they going to say to me,

385
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,560
if that's what
they're saying to Marc?

386
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,080
- MUFFLED: - I'm going to get roasted.

387
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,440
- Well, they don't look great,
do they? - They look a right mess.

388
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,360
It looks like
they've been dropped. - Yeah.

389
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,680
- NOEL CHUCKLES

390
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,880
- Have you got a straw?

391
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,360
- Not on me. Would you like a spoon?

392
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,760
- Mm.

393
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,440
I love the sharpness
of the raspberries.

394
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,120
But there's too much
cheesecake mixture.

395
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,600
Sort of overpowers it.

396
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,240
- Flavour's OK.

397
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,576
Textures are all wrong. - Yeah.
- The look of it's terrible.

398
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,240
- Yeah. - But besides that, brilliant.
- Nailed it. Yeah. Thanks, guys.

399
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,040
If any of us had just presented
like a standard chocolate brownie,

400
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,840
I think we'd be away,
but none of us have,

401
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,120
we've all tried to make it harder
than it needed to be.

402
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,360
- SHE SIGHS - Oh, God.

403
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,480
- We've all done a botched job
of our brownies.

404
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,960
- That was brutal.

405
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,920
I mean, brownies, what are people
watching this going to think of us?

406
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,520
Like, we're meant to be the best
amateur bakers in the country

407
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,760
and cannot make brownies
to please Paul and Prue?

408
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,840
MATT: - The bakers could practise
their brownies,

409
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,360
but their next challenge, shrouded
in gingham, is a complete mystery.

410
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,680
- Hello, bakers.

411
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,440
Welcome back to the tent. It's time
for your Technical Challenge.

412
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Today, it's been set for you
by Paul.

413
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,440
Paul, any words of advice?

414
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,360
- The brownie challenge
was easy, this isn't.

415
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Concentrate on your textures.

416
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,080
- OK, as ever,
this Technical Challenge

417
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,240
will be judged blind,

418
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,440
so we're going to have to ask
these two to leave the tent and...

419
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,440
..have their eyes temporarily
removed by Belgian robots.

420
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,080
Have they gone? - Not yet.

421
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,240
Can you go, please?

422
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,520
- Prue's lurking about
at the entrance.

423
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,800
- OK, Judge Paul Hollywood
would like you each

424
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,640
to make a chocolate babka,

425
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,360
which is a traditional
Jewish loaf cake.

426
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,800
- Your babka must consist
of an enriched dough

427
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,320
with layers of nuts and chocolate.

428
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,160
And it needs to be rolled, split and
then twisted to create the shape.

429
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,920
- Once baked, it should be brushed
with syrup to finish.

430
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,840
- You have two and half hours.

431
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,840
- On your marks. - Get set.

432
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,800
- Bake.

433
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,440
- Babka, here we come!

434
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,000
- Never heard of one.

435
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,576
If brownies are meant to be simple,
then we've got no chance in this.

436
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,640
None of us have.

437
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,720
- I don't know what it is.
I've never made one.

438
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,560
I wish I knew what it looked like.

439
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,640
- So, Paul, why have you chosen
this babka?

440
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,160
- Basically, it's an enriched dough
with a chocolate filling.

441
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,600
You roll it out into a rectangle,

442
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,320
roll it up as if you were making
a Chelsea bun.

443
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,080
- Mm-hm. - Cut that in half, and
it's a case of a spiral twist.

444
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,760
It's a plait, basically.
But you can't make it too long.

445
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,840
If you make it too long,
it'll never fit in the tin.

446
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,920
- Not easy, rather typical
of Paul Hollywood.

447
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,320
- Shall we have a look inside?

448
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,800
And there it is. You've got
that crisp on the outside

449
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,256
and then that beautiful soft inside,

450
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,960
with this gorgeous chocolate mixture
with the hazelnuts in it.

451
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,080
- It's lovely. It's much lighter
than I thought it would be.

452
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,320
- Mm. - I've had it in New York,
and it's not nearly as nice as this.

453
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
- I had it in Birkenhead.

454
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,680
- I'm reading and reading
these instructions today

455
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,600
to make sure I'm not
messing anything up.

456
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,960
- Make the dough.

457
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,040
Nothing else.

458
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,200
- No further instruction.
- Thanks, Paul.

459
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,760
- I haven't made enriched that often.
So just have to wing it, won't I?

460
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,600
- Enriched dough,
it's got butter and milk in it,

461
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,560
and you mix it up with the eggs.
Whereas a general dough,

462
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,280
I mean, it's just flour,
yeast and water.

463
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,360
- That's the sound of enriched dough
slopping about.

464
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,080
- You should be able to stretch it
without the dough splitting.

465
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,560
Then you'll know that it's ready.

466
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,896
- I am happy with the dough.
It's really nice and stretchy.

467
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,240
- Mate, this dough, now, is too wet.

468
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,320
There's no windowpane
coming out of that.

469
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,760
- The dough's really nice,
actually. It's quite sticky.

470
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,640
- Roll out the dough into a rectangle,
measuring 40cm x 30cm.

471
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,640
- 30 would be, like, out there.

472
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,480
- Here we are again, trying to make
rectangles out of circles.

473
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,720
OK, spread the cool
chocolate mixture over the dough,

474
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,320
leaving a 1cm border
around the edges.

475
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,200
- I'm just trying to go for
a nice, even layer... ish.

476
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,400
- You're just doing that in such
a liberal, sort of, free way.

477
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,360
- Do you think?
- You're quite free, aren't you?

478
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,120
How free are you?

479
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,320
How free are any of us?

480
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,720
- No, well, exactly. - What's the
freest thing you've ever done?

481
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,080
- Um... - Have you ever got naked
in a public space?

482
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,680
HE LAUGHS - I haven't, no!

483
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,576
- Do you want to do it now?
Me and you could do it now.

484
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,016
- In the Bake Off tent. - Could make
Bake Off history. - We could!

485
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,280
- We could streak in the tent.

486
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,360
- Scatter the hazelnuts over the top.

487
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,320
Roll the dough into a tight roll.

488
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,080
- Pbbt! Lol...

489
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,696
- It's all about the shaping
of the babka.

490
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,920
I'm trying to remember
what exactly it looks like,

491
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,280
in terms of the twists in it.

492
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,760
- Crucial moment.

493
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,296
- "Cut through the
middle of the dough,

494
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,080
"cutting it into two long pieces.

495
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,200
"Then lift the right half
over the left half.

496
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,720
"Fold by the left half
over the right half,

497
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,200
"repeating the process
to make a two-stranded plait."

498
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,320
- That guy over that guy. - Yup.

499
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,240
And then that one over
there. - And then seal.

500
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,920
- That can't be right.

501
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,760
Ha! That looks ridiculous.

502
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,520
What now?

503
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,640
"Carefully lift into the tin."

504
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,120
Absolute jokers.

505
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,760
- Mine is a bit too long.

506
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,160
- This is not 40 cm.

507
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,160
Going to go like this.

508
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,520
This is all extra, it's too long.

509
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,960
- I'm loving your work.

510
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,040
Oh, yeah!

511
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,520
Come on, high five. - There you go.

512
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,200
- From there...

513
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,920
Let me see, prove until
doubled in size. OK.

514
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,440
- What have you got to prove?

515
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,520
Everything, everything
to Paul Hollywood.

516
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,440
- SHE GASPS

517
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,720
Well, that can't be right.

518
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,320
Why doesn't mine fit?

519
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,440
Maybe it will, like, lift in the
middle or something and take shape.

520
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,280
- Don't really know how long
I need to prove it for.

521
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,040
- Half an hour, let's check it.

522
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,360
- I'm going to just set a timer
for ten minutes.

523
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,680
- All right, let's just
get it in, I think.

524
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,480
- I don't know what you're supposed
to do, but you be good to me.

525
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,160
- Yeah, OK, I let them know.

526
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,440
Bakers, you're halfway through.

527
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,120
- Through. - Yeah, they know now.

528
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,800
- There's a lot of waiting
around on proving things.

529
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,520
Slightly unnerving.

530
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,400
- To rise or not to rise.
- That is the question. - Yes.

531
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,880
- # Carefully lift
the loaf into the tin. #

532
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,200
- Mine wasn't carefully lifted.

533
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,400
- # Prove until it
becomes double in size. #

534
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,720
- Good luck with that.
- # Bake!

535
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,240
# Make the syrup,
brush the babka with the syrup! #

536
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,600
That seems fairly straightforward.

537
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,056
- Well, it's got a little bit bigger.
- It's got a bit bigger, hasn't it?

538
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,840
- Yes. Not as big as I would like it.

539
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,480
- Maybe if you stroke it, it'll
get a bit bigger. - It might do.

540
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,880
Generally works.
- HE CLEARS THROAT

541
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,800
I think mine is ready
to go in the oven.

542
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,800
- I still wouldn't say it's doubled.
I think it's like one and one half.

543
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,080
With the time that's left, it's
going to be possible, shall we say.

544
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,080
I'm hoping.

545
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,520
- Right, so it's not doubled in size.

546
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,800
That's the shape that mine's going
to be, and that's the end of it.

547
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,840
- Off we go.

548
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,440
- Just trying to work out how long
it's going to take to bake it.

549
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,880
- So, I'm just going to do
25 minutes for now.

550
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,000
- Oh, I don't know about that.
Maybe I should tuck the ends under.

551
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,280
- It's all in the bake.

552
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,920
- It's the waiting that's the worst.

553
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,000
Just waiting, waiting and hoping.

554
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,440
- How's it going?

555
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,816
- It's really brown on the ends,
because the ends are the bits that

556
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,360
I left out, when clearly,
I was supposed to tuck those in.

557
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,600
- Can you cut the ends off?

558
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,040
- Well, I was tempted,
I was tempted, but then he'll see.

559
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,216
Do you know what I mean?
He'll see that I then carved it.

560
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,600
- You should say to him,
if he goes on, you know. - Yeah.

561
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,600
- "It's a bit burnt at
the end, like." - Yeah.

562
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,840
- "It's a bit burnt at the end, like,
you know, it's a bit over baked."

563
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,136
- Yeah. - If he does that, should go,

564
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,536
"Well I've never
even seen one before.

565
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,320
"I didn't even know
what one was." - Yeah.

566
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,400
Just like that.

567
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,136
- "Yeah, I didn't even
know what one was." - Yeah.

568
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,800
- "Don't put it on me,
it's on you!" - Yeah.

569
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,760
- I think that's what you should do.
- Yeah. Winner-winner.

570
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,840
- Follow my advice.

571
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,920
- SHE CHUCKLES - I shall.

572
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,880
- Bakers, you have five minutes left!

573
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,120
- Coming out.

574
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,480
- Ready, steady...

575
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,800
..babka!

576
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,200
- We've got ourselves a babka.

577
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,680
- I'm happy with that. It's got a
nice little zigzag design in it.

578
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,200
- Well, I quite like it, actually.
Yes, it doesn't look too bad at all.

579
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,640
- There's no rise on that.

580
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,440
Really not convinced
that that's cooked.

581
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,760
And I put all that messy
chocolate stuff all down the side.

582
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,640
Oh, well.

583
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,840
- Going to spread some syrup.

584
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,840
- A bit of syrup to glaze it.

585
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,760
- Seamless.

586
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,200
- Bakers, your time is up.

587
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,600
- Please bring your chocolate babkas
to the front of the tent

588
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,320
and place them
behind your photographs.

589
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,520
- Mine looks like a Viking longboat.

590
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,000
Oh, my God, embarrassment.

591
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,440
- Paul and Prue are looking
for a beautifully risen babka

592
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,880
with a gorgeous chocolate spiral
all the way through,

593
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,000
crispy on the outside
and soft on the inside.

594
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,280
- Right.

595
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,360
Now, looking at this,
it looks good, it's small,

596
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,360
but you can see the lines
all the way through it.

597
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,960
Let's have a look inside.

598
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,400
- That swirl is good.

599
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,200
Mm.

600
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,600
Even though it hasn't risen
as much, it's very tender. - Mm.

601
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,840
It's got a nice bake on it,

602
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,560
and the combination of the
chocolate to the dough is good.

603
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,160
Moving onto number two,
a few issues.

604
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,800
- Sunk in the middle.

605
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,120
- Yeah, not the best-looking babka
I've seen.

606
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,240
- It's not over baked, though.
- No. The flavour's OK.

607
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,360
It's the way it's twisted,

608
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,016
and the way the chocolate's
been put into it,

609
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,080
that's created that drop
in the middle.

610
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,000
Moving on to this one.
This is a nice one, this.

611
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,720
- This looks like a model babka.

612
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,920
- Colour's good.

613
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,320
Stripes are good, it's a
nice bake all the way around.

614
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,880
It's a good height as well.

615
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,960
- Shine's good.

616
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,880
So all it has to do now
is taste good.

617
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,240
Mm! - Good flavour.

618
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,560
- Excellent. - Now, this one...

619
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,040
..big issues with the plaiting side
of things. It's very, very small.

620
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,520
- Looks a bit heavy, too. - Yeah.

621
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,360
- Yeah. - Feels much, much
tighter, doesn't it?

622
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,080
- A bit heavy, generally. - Mm.

623
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,080
OK, moving on.

624
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,960
- It does look like a babka,
doesn't it?

625
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
- It does.

626
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,680
- It is amazing, isn't it,

627
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,040
how much chocolate you
can get into the dough?

628
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,920
- Mm. It's got a very cakey
feel to it. - It's lovely.

629
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,120
- Moving on. Big gaps in this.

630
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,920
- It doesn't look so attractive,
does it?

631
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,600
- No, it doesn't.

632
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,520
It needed more proving.
It's very dense, this.

633
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
- Mm.

634
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,240
Yeah, it's odd.

635
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,160
- Moving on. Now,
the size of this isn't bad.

636
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,280
A few holes in there, but, actually,
it's quite a nice sized loaf.

637
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,280
- A bit dry.

638
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,800
- Mm. Now, moving on.

639
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,280
Neat, but again, the plait's
not the entire way through.

640
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,040
There's one on the other side. - Yeah.

641
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,560
- Wow, it's heavy.
It's really under proved.

642
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,320
Tastes good, though.

643
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,880
- Funnily enough,
this has got very few plaits,

644
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,200
and yet, the height is there. - Mm.

645
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,080
And you can see there,
it's fairly open.

646
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,080
It could do with being
a little bit more.

647
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,960
- Tastes delicious.

648
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,440
MATT: - Prue and Paul will now rank
the babkas from worst to best.

649
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,600
- OK, in ninth spot,
we have this one.

650
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,216
A lot of you struggled a little bit
with the shaping into the tin.

651
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,080
It seemed to be really high.

652
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,200
- And then in eighth place,
we have this one.

653
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,640
Dave, didn't get much rise on it.

654
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,080
So it was a little bit heavy.

655
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,840
- Sarah is seventh.

656
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,560
Mark is sixth.

657
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,920
Hermine, fifth.

658
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,760
Peter is fourth.

659
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,040
- In third, we have this one.

660
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,360
Very neat, just could've done
with being a little bit higher.

661
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,600
- Right. Now, number two...

662
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,160
..is this one.

663
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,560
Laura, the only thing wrong with it

664
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,320
was that it sank a little bit
in the middle,

665
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,280
but it is a really nice babka.

666
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,720
- Thank you. - So, in first...

667
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,560
..we have this one.

668
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,160
- Well done.

669
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,360
- Have you made one before? - No.

670
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,800
- Very, very good. I think
you did a good job on that.

671
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,840
The swirl was good, the height,
I couldn't fault it.

672
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
Well done.

673
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,080
- I know.

674
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,440
I know, I am so...

675
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,760
- SHE LAUGHS DELIGHTEDLY

676
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,320
- ..I'm so shocked myself!

677
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,360
I just followed my instincts,
and there you go.

678
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,680
- That's the first time I've had
good, obviously, praise

679
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,240
and come second and

680
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,480
it's a confidence boost
that I really needed.

681
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,240
- That was horrific.

682
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,520
And that was two challenges
pretty much failed.

683
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,640
So tomorrow, I have
to pull it out the bag

684
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,160
and hope that
the weather is on our side.

685
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,000
It's going to be hard.

686
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,800
MATT: - Just one challenge remains
before the Star Baker is crowned

687
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,960
and one baker will be asked...
- Oh, God.

688
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,280
- ..to leave the tent.

689
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,240
- Hello, bakers. Welcome back to
the tent.

690
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,320
It's time for your
Showstopper Challenge.

691
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,720
Today, the judges would love you to
make a spectacular

692
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,640
white chocolate celebration cake.

693
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,840
- Now, your cake should be made with a
particular celebration in mind.

694
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,160
For instance, it could be the first
time you went to the toilet

695
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,320
all by yourself.

696
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,600
- For Paul, that was last Thursday.
Well done, Paul.

697
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,280
We're all very proud.

698
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,480
- Well done, Paul.

699
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,320
There's your gold star.

700
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,560
No more nappy.

701
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,960
- You get three of those, you get
a book token, little man.

702
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,560
- Mm. Your cake should have a
minimum of two layers,

703
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,840
and the decoration needs to display
an expert use of white chocolate.

704
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,160
- You have four hours.

705
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,640
- On your marks.
- Get set.

706
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,840
- B. - A. - K. - E.

707
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,760
- White chocolate's a bit of a crowd
pleaser,

708
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,200
so hopefully it's going to be a
good, yummy bake

709
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,680
that the judges like.

710
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,896
- I love white chocolate, which is why
it's so dangerous

711
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,440
having massive jars of these around.

712
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,920
- I'm blitzing it because it does
incorporate a bit better.

713
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,240
Also, though, let's be honest,

714
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,960
I don't know what I'm doing
with this one.

715
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,160
It's a gamble.

716
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,640
- The Showstopper Challenge is to make
a white chocolate tiered cake.

717
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,840
One of the big challenges for the
bakers, actually,

718
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,680
is introducing the white chocolate
into the sponge.

719
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,960
White chocolate has a higher fat
content,

720
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,680
which means, if they've got butter
in the sponge as well,

721
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,320
they need to reduce that so they're
not really upping that fat content

722
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,760
in the sponge, which will disrupt
the texture of the cake itself.

723
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,240
- I think it's a really tricky
challenge.

724
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,960
Because white chocolate is frankly
a nightmare to work with.

725
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,800
It splits at the drop of a hat,

726
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,960
it seizes if you get it too hot,

727
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,560
and I think the bakers will have
their work cut out.

728
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,440
- With the weather being so warm
today,

729
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,800
the bakers are going to have to be
extremely careful

730
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,320
how they introduce the white
tempered chocolate

731
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,960
or ganaches on the outside.

732
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,240
They're going to have to compensate
for the fact that

733
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,240
they may start to melt.

734
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,320
- Hopefully the ambient temperature
in here doesn't go above 20,

735
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,240
otherwise we're all in for a bit of
a worry.

736
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,960
- I'm not a massive fan of white
chocolate,

737
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,400
because, although I have got a sweet
tooth, it's very sweet.

738
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,480
And it's very one-note,
white chocolate.

739
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,040
But I think, in a cake, you can
kind of celebrate it

740
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,680
with other things, which is
hopefully

741
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,960
what I'm going to do today.

742
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,360
- Laura's white chocolate sponges
will be sandwiched

743
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,960
with Italian meringue buttercream
and a sharp blackcurrant jam.

744
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,280
And, for a touch of romance,
she'll be decorating

745
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,960
with a chocolate bouquet

746
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,440
to celebrate her two-year wedding
anniversary.

747
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,520
- It was your wedding anniversary
yesterday? - Yeah.

748
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,960
- How exciting. - Yeah.

749
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,960
- What did you do to celebrate?

750
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,240
- I was here, making brownies.
- You were here in a tent.

751
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,320
- And getting absolutely rinsed by
Paul Hollywood.

752
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,640
- Getting told off by a grumpy man
with a beard.

753
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,960
- Yeah, basically. Yeah.

754
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,416
- That's a great way to spend your
anniversary. - Do you think?

755
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,720
- Romance is also in the air
for Lottie.

756
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,360
- It is a celebration cake for my
grandparents,

757
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,080
because they are celebrating their
Sapphire wedding anniversary

758
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,560
in January. - What is Sapphire?

759
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,760
- 65 years.

760
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,560
- That's incredible. - Yeah.

761
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,960
- Lottie's ambitious design will
feature

762
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,560
a sapphire geode effect

763
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,200
and an array of tempered white
chocolate decorations.

764
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,600
- Have you practice this?

765
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,960
- I have practised this cake between
15 and 18 times.

766
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,720
- Oh, Lottie!

767
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,680
- Yeah, this is a really tricky one
for me.

768
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,320
- Don't forget, you only have to be
not the worst.

769
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,760
- What a great mantra that is.

770
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,760
"Just don't be the worst."
- "Don't be the worst."

771
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,960
- Well, good luck, then.
- Thank you very much.

772
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,400
Oh, well, that spurs you on,
doesn't it?

773
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,320
- Making a tiered cake requires
perfect light sponges.

774
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,880
- If you're trying to stack it,
you need it to be light,

775
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,960
otherwise it will collapse on
itself.

776
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,360
- So it's crucial the bakers gets
the ratio of white chocolate

777
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,840
to butter spot on.

778
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,880
- Because white chocolate has such
a high cocoa butter content,

779
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,640
I've used a little bit less butter
than I would normally.

780
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,520
- Too much white chocolate will
just...

781
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,320
So, essentially, I'm using a small
amount that I will incorporate

782
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,440
very gently in.

783
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,240
- It's very temperamental.

784
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,640
It's like the worst chocolate to
work with.

785
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,136
- Sura, good morning. - Good morning.

786
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,360
- Hello, Sura.

787
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,400
- How are you feeling today? Yesterday
wasn't your best day.

788
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,960
- No, it wasn't. It was horrific.

789
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,720
But today I'm optimistic and hoping
for the best.

790
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,040
- From horrific to optimistic.

791
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,560
- Celebrating her parents' 36th
wedding anniversary,

792
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,440
Sura's elaborately decorated cake
will feature

793
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,160
tempered chocolate truffles and
piped buttercream flowers

794
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,160
that will encase layers of
strawberry and lemon jam

795
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,800
and white chocolate sponges.

796
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,160
- How are you getting the chocolate
into your cake?

797
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,960
- I've watered it down. So it's going
to make it a looser texture,

798
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,960
but, also, it's still going to have
the flavour,

799
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,400
without the heaviness of
white chocolate.

800
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,376
- Good luck, Sura.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

801
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,920
- Good luck. - Thank you.

802
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,520
While Sura is banking on diluted
white chocolate,

803
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,360
Peter is going for an altogether
different texture.

804
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,160
- I'm just adding chunks of white
chocolate.

805
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,280
I really like it when you come
across that hunk

806
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,736
of white chocolate in a bit of cake,

807
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,656
so that's what I'm going to be doing
in this one.

808
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,680
- Peter's chocolate-studded sponges
will be sandwiched

809
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,760
with a mango curd and whipped cream,

810
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,720
and surrounded with a chocolate
collar

811
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,720
painted with complex equations.

812
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,240
It's the celebration of his brother
Andrew's recent graduation

813
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,160
from a degree in mathematics.

814
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,920
- He graduated this year, but he
hasn't had a full ceremony

815
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,720
because of Covid. - Yeah.

816
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,160
- So I'm celebrating that through
this cake.

817
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,960
- Celebrate it in the tent where
he can't eat it, and we can.

818
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,480
- I've practised one at home, and
he's been able to enjoy it.

819
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,680
- All right, OK.

820
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,800
NOEL: Hermine is building her cake
from Genoese sponges,

821
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,640
where whisked eggs and flour are
traditionally combined

822
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,120
with melted butter.

823
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,560
- I'm replacing the butter with
the white chocolate, here.

824
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,840
That reminds me of the wedding cakes
at my parents' wedding.

825
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,800
Not that I was there, because I was
still really young.

826
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,360
But I've seen pictures of it.

827
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,920
- Her throwback wedding cake will be
decorated

828
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,200
with a white chocolate collar
and piped ganache roses.

829
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,960
Inside, she will layer her delicate
sponges with lemon curd

830
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,960
and Italian meringue buttercream.

831
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,320
- Well, I love Genoese.

832
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,240
I think it's beautiful.

833
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,800
- It's a nice combination of flavours
as well with the lemon.

834
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,176
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

835
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
- Thank you.

836
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:35,960
- So, if Paul Hollywood is not
complementary,

837
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,560
are you going to take one of the
cakes

838
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,560
and smush it into his face?

839
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,440
Say, "Well, now see how you like
it?"

840
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,960
- Could you do that?
- I'll do it.

841
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,456
- You'll get away with it. I wouldn't.

842
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,680
- You would get away with it.

843
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,040
You'd be a national treasure for
doing that.

844
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,960
- But Mark is hoping to keep all three
tiers of his cake intact.

845
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,920
Dedicated to his daughters,
Rosie and Jasmine,

846
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,400
it will be decorated with their
namesake flowers

847
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,040
and sandwiched with raspberry Swiss
meringue buttercream.

848
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,160
- I'm nervous because the comments
weren't particularly good

849
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,960
yesterday and I know cakes aren't
particularly my strong point.

850
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,080
So, yeah...

851
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:16,120
In my perspective, I'm feeling
I'm close to the bottom.

852
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,960
- There's also a lot riding on this
bake for Linda.

853
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,480
- This really means a lot to me,
this cake, you know?

854
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,440
It's a tribute to my daughter,
actually.

855
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,960
Melissa had special needs.

856
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,360
She's no longer with us.

857
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,640
You know, she passed away when she
was 18.

858
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,640
But this is just a celebration of
her life, really.

859
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,560
And she was just a sweet little
English rose.

860
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,240
- MATT: - Linda will craft a chocolate
rose to sit atop

861
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,080
an all-white three-tiered sponge

862
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,160
filled with Amaretto, raspberry jam
and mascarpone cream.

863
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,400
- You had a little triumph yesterday.
- I did, didn't I?

864
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,200
I really enjoyed it. - Looked like you
were really enjoying yourself.

865
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,640
- In actual fact, the directions
were really brilliant.

866
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,816
- Yeah, thank you very much.
- Don't give him any credit!

867
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,336
- No, they was really good.
- Have you got one of my books, then?

868
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,520
- I have. - I think you're going
to do really well.

869
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,040
- THEY LAUGH

870
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,600
- OK, here we go.

871
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,840
Attempt number one.

872
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,520
Please. Please bake.

873
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,520
- With their sponges in the ovens...

874
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,560
- I'm going to check it after about
26 minutes, to be precise.

875
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,960
- ..the bakers now turn their
attention to the fillings...

876
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,120
- God, I love multitasking!

877
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,280
- ..which means even more
white chocolate.

878
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,736
- This is going to be white chocolate
overload, but, you know,

879
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,880
that's what they asked for.

880
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,136
- What they do in this show is,

881
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,040
they make tell you to make really
sweet cakes,

882
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,480
and then they tell you off.

883
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,600
Yeah, Prue will just go,
"It's too sweet."

884
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,480
"Actually, it's just a little sweet.

885
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,720
And you go, "Yeah, because you told
us to make a cake

886
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,960
"full of white chocolate!"

887
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,880
"I've always thought, maybe, to
balance out the sweetness,

888
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,800
"you could have put some mud
in there."

889
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,960
- Luckily, Mark's wife, Laura, is a
big fan of this cake,

890
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,960
as it's in honour of her birthday.

891
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,560
Covered in tempered chocolate shards
and geometric shapes,

892
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,280
the interior is full of her
favourite flavours -

893
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,840
white chocolate, pistachio, lemon,

894
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,840
and a South African marula fruit
cream liqueur.

895
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,280
- This is Laura's favourite drink.

896
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,160
And elephants get drunk on this.

897
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,880
Elephants eat fermented marula fruit
and get drunk.

898
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,960
Yeah.

899
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,160
So I quite like it, yeah.

900
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,720
I thought I'd fire it in here, yeah.

901
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,920
- I'm not happy with the cakes.

902
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,080
It just looks really bumpy
and uneven.

903
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,480
It's either start again or hold out.

904
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,360
I think I might need to do them
again.

905
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,960
- Just three hours of the bake remain.

906
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,800
- That goes so quickly. That's one
hour gone.

907
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,960
- Yeah, they're not right.

908
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,600
No, they're really not right.

909
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,120
I'm going to stick to what I know.

910
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,520
Equal quantities of everything.

911
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,640
- Who would you most be upset
if someone went?

912
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,096
Got a few? - I'm not going to say
that.

913
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,936
- You always say that.
- No, I'm not going to say.

914
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,600
Cos we're all really good people
in here.

915
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,440
- This will come out much later,
and by then you won't care.

916
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,576
Paul? Would you like to get rid of
Paul? - Yeah, let's get rid of Paul.

917
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,920
- This batch really does need to
behave,

918
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,240
because otherwise I am definitely
screwed.

919
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,200
- As Laura plays catch up,

920
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,600
it's a critical point in the bake
for the others.

921
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,336
- I know by the colour,
that's not ready.

922
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,480
So I'm going to actually leave it
a little bit longer.

923
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,960
- The high sugar content in white
chocolate means the sponges

924
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,400
will brown very quickly...

925
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,760
- Five minutes.

926
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,840
- ..which could deceive the bakers
into thinking

927
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,240
they're baked through.

928
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,680
- They're a lovely colour.

929
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,760
They need just maybe a minute or
two.

930
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,000
- Oh, I don't know.

931
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,736
- I'm actually going to put them
in for another two minutes.

932
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,360
I listen to my cakes to hear how
bubbly they are.

933
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,640
If they're very, very bubbly

934
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,720
then there's a lot of liquid
left in them.

935
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,680
You don't want a wet cake.

936
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,360
- It is definitely ready.

937
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,040
- Yep, I think they're coming out.

938
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,200
- Really happy with them.
They look great.

939
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,560
Yeah, nice and golden.

940
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,256
- I'm just trying to play catch up,
really.

941
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,040
But I've got my cakes in the oven,
so fingers crossed.

942
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,400
- Hi, David.

943
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,760
- Good morning. - Hello, David.

944
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,400
Tell us about your cake.

945
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,280
- So, today, my cake's going to be
called

946
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,320
a Strawberry Splash White Chocolate
Frasier Cake.

947
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,520
- Oh, Frasier cake. Nice.

948
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,480
You put the strawberries all round
the outside?

949
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,720
- Round the outsides, yeah.

950
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,080
I've got white chocolate creme
mousseline in the middle.

951
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,200
It's going to be decorated with
tempered white chocolate splashes.

952
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,320
- Dave's splashes will sit on top
of his Amaretto-soaked sponges.

953
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,880
This is a cake he loves to bake for
his girlfriend Stacy's birthday,

954
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,800
and no birthday is complete
without balloons.

955
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,520
- What's happening here with these
little guys?

956
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,200
- So, look, there's one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

957
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,760
- I can count.
- Yeah, there's one for each baker.

958
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,056
- And what are they going to be?

959
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,720
- They're going to be chocolate
splashes.

960
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,960
- Splashes? - Mm.

961
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,960
- You're doing one for everyone? - Yeah.

962
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,360
- Aw, that's so sweet.
- And...

963
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,640
- And then you're going to burst them
one by one

964
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,240
as you rise through the ranks.

965
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,360
- Bakers, you are through-way half.

966
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,720
Is that right? - Yeah.

967
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,360
- I think everyone's pretty focused
today. There's no chat.

968
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,816
Not as much fun as I thought it was
going to be, I'll be honest.

969
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,240
No chat from Mark. Everyone's
taking it really seriously,

970
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,280
like it's some sort of competition,
or whatever.

971
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,600
- You join us in the middle of a very
important bake.

972
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,960
It's all happening.

973
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,840
Laura is checking the temperature of
her sponges.

974
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,960
Laura, what do we think?

975
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,800
- Right, these two are done.

976
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,960
- Yeah. Talk into the microphone,
please.

977
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,840
- Oh, sorry. These two are done.
- Excellent.

978
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,960
- I think the others just need...

979
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,320
Actually, no, they're not done.

980
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,856
- These two are NOT done.
- False alarm.

981
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,960
False alarm, everybody.
- Newsflash.

982
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,680
Breaking news - they are not done.

983
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,640
- One more minute.
- We will come back to you later.

984
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,520
In the meantime, we'll go to
the weather.

985
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,600
- The thermometer's saying it's
25 degrees.

986
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,160
Not ideal for white chocolate.

987
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,280
- And not ideal conditions for
stacking layers of sponge

988
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,000
with delicate, creamy fillings.

989
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,160
- This is all feeling a little bit
warm at the moment,

990
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,960
so I'm going to have to try and work
as quick as I can.

991
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,720
- I have to go like the clappers.

992
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,520
- The assembly shouldn't
take too long.

993
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,120
It's the chilling part that I need
the most amount of time on,

994
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,960
to really firm up the mousseline.

995
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,520
- As the layers build...

996
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,720
- So hot.

997
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,640
- ..the bakers will need to make full
use of the fridges

998
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,600
to stop them melting and sinking in
the ever-warming intent.

999
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,960
- Really glad I remade them.

1000
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,640
They're looking really good.
Much better, yeah.

1001
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,200
Panic averted.

1002
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,720
Hot.

1003
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,720
- Bakers, you have one hour left.

1004
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,360
- NOEL WHISTLES

1005
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,520
- That's not long.

1006
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,960
- If dealing with white chocolate in
their sponges wasn't hard enough,

1007
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,920
the bakers also need to temper it to
make their decorative elements.

1008
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,480
- I'm just hoping they don't pop.

1009
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,160
- Now I'm making my white
chocolate collar.

1010
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm going to just spread it out on
the acetate

1011
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,400
and then put it around the cake.

1012
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,960
- This is the messy bit.

1013
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
- This is just a lacy sort of
collar thing

1014
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,800
that I'm putting around the outside
of it.

1015
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,496
- It kind of partially sets on the
acetate,

1016
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,040
and then it's easier to pick up and
lift onto and around the cake.

1017
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,600
- LAURA SIGHS
- It's a mess, isn't it?

1018
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,120
- Too hot.

1019
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,640
Literally melting in my hands.

1020
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,800
Too, too hot.

1021
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,840
I'm just going to do some chocolate
drips down the side.

1022
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,240
That's all I can do now.

1023
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,800
- IN AN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT: Bakers,
you've got ten minutes left.

1024
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,960
Don't mess it up.

1025
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,560
- It's pretty satisfying.

1026
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,640
- Ah, it's not coming off.

1027
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,320
I may not get the rows done,
but I'm hoping to.

1028
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,640
I'm going to just smooth this off.

1029
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,360
- IN AN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT: - Guys,
you have about nine minutes left.

1030
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,840
You need to start making your cakes
round about now.

1031
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,400
- Do speed up, Lottie.

1032
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,960
- I wanted much longer to be
able to do this.

1033
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,840
- Looks good, doesn't it?

1034
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,960
- It's just not working.

1035
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,880
- I'm painting on some maths symbols
and equations,

1036
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,360
and all that kind of jazz.

1037
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,920
- I'm making roses.

1038
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,720
- This is my rose. Going to do her
proud.

1039
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,760
- That is not going to stay.

1040
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,240
- Just got to finish the ruffles.

1041
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,720
I would actually really love to make
something Paul likes today.

1042
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,160
- Rough and ready, isn't it?

1043
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,480
- But the rose looks amazing.

1044
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,320
- Bakers, you have one minute left.

1045
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
SURA SIGHS

1046
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,800
- Ooh, that's scary canary.

1047
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,120
- Yeah, really happy. Yeah.

1048
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,280
It couldn't have gone better for me,
I don't think.

1049
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,440
- They're breaking!

1050
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,480
- Going for the less is more.
- Less is not more.

1051
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,800
Have you seen mine?

1052
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,960
- Whatever, I'm done.
- OK.

1053
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,160
- I'm done.

1054
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,960
- MATT: - Bakers, your time is up.

1055
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,760
Please step away from your bakes.

1056
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,880
- Looks awesome, Lottie.

1057
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,440
- It looks OK. It looks fine.

1058
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,320
- But I'm not happy with OK and fine.

1059
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,920
- Nine white chocolate
celebration cakes

1060
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,480
now face the judgement
of Paul and Prue.

1061
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,240
- I love the way it looks.
- Oh, thank you.

1062
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,016
- I think it looks original, it looks
modern. I'd buy that. - Thank you.

1063
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,200
Thank you. - It's a
great looking cake.

1064
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,640
The naked element of it looks nice.
It's neat.

1065
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,040
I love the drips are all
equal as well.

1066
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,280
- And so I've got white chocolate cake
with a pistachio

1067
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,320
and lemon Genoise and then
a white chocolate sponge with

1068
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,920
a marula fruit liquor

1069
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,920
and white chocolate
Italian meringue buttercream.

1070
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,840
- All the flavours are there,
but they're quite... delicate.

1071
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,640
- OK. - It needs more of a hero flavour.

1072
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,960
I don't think pistachio's going
to be strong enough.

1073
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,200
- It's a beautifully made cake.

1074
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,320
The flavour just needs
a bit more oomph.

1075
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,640
- A bit more oomph. OK.

1076
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,040
- I love that. It's very cool.

1077
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,200
I like what you've done
with the sapphire as well.

1078
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,960
- I think it's imaginative, I think
it's exciting. - Oh, thank you.

1079
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,840
- Beautiful. - Thank you. - Well done,
Lottie.

1080
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,120
- It is three white chocolate sponges

1081
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,200
with a passion fruit curd
and a lime kind of syrup.

1082
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,040
- The flavour's good.

1083
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,960
The textures aren't, though.
It's overbaked.

1084
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,880
- Mm-hm. - Cos it is bone dry inside.

1085
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,000
- Yeah.

1086
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,080
- I think, actually, the work
and the chocolate looks fine.

1087
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,280
My issue is... - It's leaning.
- ..the shape of the cakes. - Yeah.

1088
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,120
- I mean, they're all over the place,
aren't they? - They are.

1089
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,880
- Mm.

1090
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,160
- You have raw dough.
- It looks like marzipan.

1091
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,600
- Your recipe was at fault or you've
weighed something up wrong.

1092
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,320
It could have been the
white chocolate with the water.

1093
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,880
- Mm. - Yeah, maybe.

1094
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,360
- Such a pity it's not edible.

1095
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,120
- SHE SIGHS

1096
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,960
- It looks wonderful. - Thank you.

1097
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,880
- The colour of the sponge worries me
a lot. - OK. - It's very dark.

1098
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,240
Let's have a look inside.

1099
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,280
- Well, I don't think it's overbaked.
- It does taste really good.

1100
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,240
Strawberries work well with it.
- Thank you.

1101
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,280
- It's just the colour of
that sponge I don't like.

1102
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,920
But overall, I think it's
a decent cake.

1103
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,080
- Thank you. - I love it.
- Cool, thank you.

1104
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,840
- I really like it. Buttery, white
chocolate, a bit of zest in there.

1105
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,280
My issue is the decoration.

1106
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,120
The piping work is not good.

1107
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,920
At any level. - I think Paul is right.

1108
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,800
It's a really delicious cake.

1109
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,920
A little dense. Piping not perfect.

1110
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,160
- No. - But thank you.

1111
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,496
It's really neat. - I think it's
a great looking cake.

1112
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,120
- Thank you. - Very pastel. - Yeah.

1113
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,520
- Let's have a look, shall we?

1114
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,200
- Sponge is a little dense. - OK. - It is.
It's weighed heavy on that. - Yeah.

1115
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,680
- But I like the flavour of it and I
love the raspberry

1116
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,080
through it as well. - I think you've
done a really good job.

1117
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,976
- Thank you. - And it's taste of white
chocolate. - Good. - Yeah, well done.

1118
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,560
Thank you. - Thank you very much.

1119
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,360
- The colour is beautiful and smooth

1120
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,920
and all the way around,

1121
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,520
it just looks really neat.

1122
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,480
- It's a coconut cake with mango curd
cream in the centre.

1123
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,200
Oh, that'll be a chocolate chunk.

1124
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,920
- It's like toffee.
It's gluing my teeth together.

1125
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,320
- I think it's well baked.

1126
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,240
Coconut flavour really comes
through. Mango lightens it up.

1127
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,800
You've come up with something that
is very, very neat too. Clever.

1128
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,400
- Thanks. - Yeah, well done. Thank you.

1129
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,280
It's a little bit messy down at the
bottom. - Yes.

1130
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,680
- The top bit's quite cute.

1131
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,160
Quite like that.
Just don't seem to go together.

1132
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,000
- No, they don't. - It's like two
different cakes, isn't it?

1133
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,280
- Mm! Delicious.
- THEY LAUGH

1134
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,320
- Delicious.

1135
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:05,760
- So, we call it a Prue-gasm.

1136
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,960
"Mm!"

1137
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,320
- The lemon works beautifully
with the sponge.

1138
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,040
It's got that citrus kick that
you want. - Well done, Hermine.

1139
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,280
It's just delicious.
- Thank you. - Thank you very much.

1140
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,960
- Sometimes less is more.

1141
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,160
That sort of let it down a little
bit. - OK.

1142
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,720
- Blackcurrant is beautiful.

1143
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,040
I can't really get the white
chocolate, but then,

1144
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,760
since there's such a mass of white
chocolate everywhere else,

1145
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,280
perhaps that doesn't matter. - Yeah.

1146
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,280
- I think your sponges are dried
out slightly

1147
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,160
and you probably
slightly overbaked it. - OK.

1148
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,520
- But I love the blackcurrant.

1149
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,560
- Thank you. - It works beautifully,
actually, with the white chocolate.

1150
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,760
You put a lot of thought into it.

1151
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,640
- Well, well done, Laura. - Thank you.

1152
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,360
I'm a tiny bit disappointed,
I think,

1153
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,640
cos I just really wanted to,
like, nail it this week.

1154
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,040
- SHE SIGHS

1155
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,840
- But the comment
that I really loved was

1156
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,680
when Paul said that
a lot of thought had gone into it.

1157
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,280
Like, that meant a lot to me.

1158
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,800
- Yet! I had a Prue roar!

1159
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,640
It's a thing, apparently, now.

1160
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,600
She goes, "Mm!"

1161
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,640
- SHE LAUGHS

1162
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,040
- Went horrific.

1163
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,040
I can't believe the cake was, like,

1164
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,360
pretty much raw inside.

1165
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,800
I honestly don't know to say.

1166
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,000
- So, kids, that was a tough week.

1167
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,920
But we should talk first
about who could be Star Baker.

1168
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,880
- I think Peter. Again, Mr Consistent.

1169
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,520
Very clever, very neat.

1170
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,160
The colour was very good.
I liked the mango as well.

1171
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,960
- Can I talk about Mark L?

1172
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,120
Because I think his cake
was just beautiful.

1173
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,480
- He's been up there constantly,
Mark L.

1174
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,080
- Well, he was third in Technical,
did pretty well in Signature,

1175
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,760
and I think he's done
pretty good today.

1176
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,040
So I think I would put one of those
two in line for Star Baker.

1177
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,400
- Who's in trouble?

1178
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,920
- Sura, I think.

1179
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,480
- I think based on her
Showstopper being raw.

1180
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,480
She made a big mistake with that.

1181
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,560
- And probably Lottie.
- She was bottom in the Technical.

1182
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,240
Didn't do fantastically
in the Signature.

1183
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,320
She did well in the Showstopper,
but has she done enough to stay in

1184
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:28,480
the competition and has Sura really
failed that much that she has to go?

1185
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,560
- I really like Lottie and Sura,

1186
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,840
so I will go instead of them
if you want.

1187
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,400
I'm happy. - Oh, yes. We'll have that.

1188
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,360
- See you, mate. - Prue!

1189
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,880
I thought I was your favourite!

1190
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,120
See how easily they forget once
the new kid's in town?

1191
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,400
- The novelty of me will wear off.

1192
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,880
I wouldn't get rid of him.

1193
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,480
THEY LAUGH

1194
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,840
- Hello, Bakers.

1195
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,480
I've got the great job
of announcing Star Baker.

1196
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,200
So, the Star Baker is...

1197
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,400
..Mark L.

1198
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,800
- THEY APPLAUD
- Oh, thank you. - Well done, Mark.

1199
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,360
- Thank you. - Smashed it. - Well done!

1200
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,720
- So, it's up to me
to announce who' is going home,

1201
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,280
and it is someone who we are
really fond of,

1202
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,240
but who had a bad week.

1203
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,560
And so the baker who
will be leaving us this week is...

1204
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,640
..Sura.

1205
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,760
- I was expecting that.

1206
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,160
- You are honestly amazing.

1207
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,920
You're so good.

1208
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,360
- Never mind. You're a good baker.

1209
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,720
- I'm gutted, but what's done is done.

1210
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,640
I'm not going to be bitter about it.

1211
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,920
I've had a great time.

1212
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,120
- Sorry. - That's OK.

1213
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,040
- You just had a bad week.

1214
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,760
- I hate white chocolate.

1215
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,840
I hate chocolate. End of.

1216
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,960
I don't think I'll ever eat
chocolate ever again.

1217
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,360
- SHE LAUGHS

1218
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,720
- I'm really sad to see Sura go.

1219
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,320
Now, that's the classic case
of you cannot have a weakness

1220
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,040
in your baking if you're going to
win The Great British Bake Off.

1221
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,520
And unfortunately
we found Sura's this week,

1222
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,880
and it was that that
actually saved Lottie.

1223
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,080
- THEY GIGGLE

1224
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,480
- Just pick it up for the next one,
yeah? - I will try my best.

1225
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,560
- SHE SIGHS

1226
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,400
- The sadness that I feel at losing
Sura is at least part way made

1227
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:39,200
up by Mark getting Star Baker.
That... I'll take that.

1228
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,440
That'll cheer me up.
Yeah, well done, mate. - Thank you.

1229
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,720
I'm quite emotional. - Are you? - Yeah.

1230
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,040
- You're hiding it really well. - Am I?
- No.

1231
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,240
- HE LAUGHS
- How did that happen?

1232
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,960
I can't believe it.

1233
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,440
Yeah, I just didn't expect it.

1234
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,840
I think consistency
pays off, doesn't it?

1235
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,560
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1236
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,640
- Yeah, well done. - What a surprise.
- Really good.

1237
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,600
- I'm delighted that we're going...

1238
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,120
..we're down to the final seven
bakers, you know?

1239
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,680
Like... Seven? Eight.

1240
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,480
Eight. Is it eight?

1241
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,240
Eight bakers.

1242
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,640
- HE LAUGHS

1243
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,880
Next time... - It's pastry week!

1244
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,000
- ..the bakers feel the heat at
the halfway point.

1245
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,840
- Halfway to paradise.

1246
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,560
- With a strenuous signature...

1247
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,680
..a perplexing Technical.

1248
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,120
- Hashtag winging it.

1249
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,120
- And an astonishing Showstopper...

1250
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,480
- It's bonkers.

1251
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,600
- ..that will leave one baker
feeling fragile.

1252
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,800
- I don't know what to do.

1253
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,600
It's just breaking as I'm trying
to get it.

1254
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,800
- HE SIGHS

1255
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,840
